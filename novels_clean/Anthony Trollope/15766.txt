probability between might be able to buy next presentation to clavering when time must come in sir hugh must determine on selling that sir hugh must give family living to cousin be never thought probable by of family at rectory might perhaps part with under such circumstance on favourable term for reason father be very anxious that son must follow out course for have be intended that being unenergetic having hitherto done little for son must dictate to young man who have be energetic who have done much for be out of question harry therefore be to be arbiter of own fate when harry received back cheque from julia brabazon then again returned to resolution respecting messrs beilby burton took first opportunity of telling father that such be case after breakfast followed father

in life unless be always preaching teaching look at saul mr saul be curate of clavering be always preaching teaching be doing best can what life of have have literally thrown off worldly care consequently everybody laugh at nobody love believe better man breathes must like life at point there be pause lasted till cigar have come to end then a threw stump into fire mr clavering spoke again truth be that have have life bad example before father yes son let speak on to end then can say what please in have have bad example on one side now in poor saul have bad example on other side can

beauty of woman be exceptional specimen of man need more fear than must venture to hope that must become such a be at point be interrupted by entrance of fanny clavering who came to say that mr saul be in drawing room what doe want fanny question mr clavering asked half in whisper with something of comic humour in face a though partly afraid that mr saul must hear partly intending to convey wish that might escape mr saul if be possible be about iron church papa say be come part of have come want to go out to cumberly green about site thought be settled say not what doe matter where be can put anywhere like on green however have better go to so mr clavering went cumberly green be hamlet in parish of clavering three mile distant from church people of have got into wicked habit of going to dissenting chapel near to by mr saul energy chiefly out of mr clavering purse iron chapel have be purchased for hundred fifty pound mr saul proposed to add to own duty pleasing occupation of walking to cumberly green sunday morning before breakfast wednesday evening after dinner to perform service bring back to true flock a many of erring sheep of cumberly green a might be able to catch towards

harry said fanny stopping with brother hanging over chair be pretty gay spirited girl with bright eye dark brown hair fell in two curl behind ear have said nothing to unsettle know make very unhappy fanny not very unhappy must rather that must go into church be about think be quite right mary think be quite wrong mary think so of course so must too perhaps if be engaged to clergyman be old story of fox who have lost tail tail be gone yet tail be gone yet mary think that life be like clergyman life harry though mamma have said so be sure think be right wo say so a long a may seem to interfere with anything papa may choose to say be sure be glad in heart be glad in heart fanny a be person most concerned suppose be most material thing then followed father into drawing room must drive mr clavering over in pony chair settle between said mr clavering to curate mr saul looked disappointed in first place hated driving pony be rapid footed little beast have will of own in next place thought rector ought to visit spot on occasion mr clavering will drive said rector remembering mr saul objection to pony still mr saul looked unhappy mr saul be very tall very thin with tall thin head weak eye sharp well cut nose so to say lip very white teeth with beard well cut chin face be so thin that cheekbone obtruded unpleasantly wore long rusty black coat high rusty black waistcoat trouser be brown with dirty road general ill usage nevertheless never occurred to one mr saul did not look like gentleman not even to to whom idea on subject ever presented that be gentleman think knew well enough be able to carry before sir hugh wife with quite a much ease a must do in rectory once twice have dined at great house lady clavering have declared to be bore sir hugh have called that most offensive of animal clerical prig have therefore be decided that be not to be asked to great house more may be a well to state here a elsewhere that mr clavering very rarely went to nephew table on certain occasion did do so so that there might be recognized quarrel between sir hugh such visit be few far between after few more word from mr saul glance from wife eye mr clavering consented to go to cumberly green though there be nothing liked so little a morning spent with curate when have started harry told mother also of final decision will go to stratton to morrow settle what doe papa say asked mother just what have said before be not so much that wish to be clergyman a that doe not wish to have lost time up to be more than think harry said elder sister tall girl le pretty than sister apparently le careful of prettiness very quiet a said demure known to be good a gold by who knew well doubt said harry stoutly however may be man must choose for thought have chosen said mary if be settled said mother suppose will do good by opposing must wish to oppose mamma said harry dear think must judge for see must have scope in church for sort of ambition must satisfy look at such men a locke stephenson brassey be men who seem to to do most in world be self educated surely man ca have worse chance because have learned something look at old beilby with seat in parliament property worth two three hundred thousand pound when be age have nothing weekly wage know whether mr beilby be very happy man very good man said mary know said harry do know that have thrown single arch over wider span of water than ever be done before ought to make happy after saying in tone of high authority befitting dignity a fellow of college harry clavering went out leaving mother sister to discus subject to two of be important a to mary have hope of own vested in clerical concern of neighbouring parish chapter iii lord ongar on next morning harry clavering rode over to stratton thinking much of misery a went be very well for in presence of own family to talk of profession a one subject be to of importance knew very well that be only beguiling in doing so question of profession be after dead leaf to to who have canker at heart perpetual thorn in bosom misery within profession must mitigate dear one at home guessed nothing of must take care that must guess nothing why must have pain of knowing that have be made wretched for ever by blighted hope mother indeed have suspected something in sweet day of roaming with julia through park have once twice said word to warn of very truth of deep love so told have be happily ignorant let be ignorant why must make mother unhappy a thought passed through mind think that revelled in wretchedness made much to of misery sucked in sorrow greedily be somewhat proud to have have occasion to break heart not le because be thus early blighted must struggle for success in world must show that a wife might have have worthier position than lord ongar must give too might probably rise quicker in world a now must have impediment of wife family then a rode along composed sonnet fitting to case strength rhythm of seemed to a sat on horseback to be almost perfect unfortunately when be back at clavering sat in room with pen in hand turn of word have escaped found mr burton at home be not long in concluding business messrs beilby burton be not only civil engineer be land surveyor also land valuer on great scale be employed much by government upon public building if not architect be supposed to know architect must do must not do in purchase of great property mr burton opinion be supposed to be to have be a good a in kingdom therefore there be very much to be learned in office at stratton mr burton be not rich man like partner mr beilby ambitious man have never soared parliamentwards have never speculated have never invented never be great have be father of very large family of whom be doing a well in world of perhaps better than father indeed there be many who said that mr burton must have be richer man if have not joined in partnership with mr beilby mr beilby have reputation of swallowing more than share wherever went when business part of arrangement be finished mr burton talked to future pupil about lodging went out with into town to look for room old man found that harry clavering be rather nice in respect in own mind formed idea that new beginner might have be more auspicious pupil have not already become fellow of college indeed harry talked to quite a though two be on equality together before have parted mr burton be not sure that harry did not patronize asked young man however to join at early dinner then introduced to mr burton to youngest daughter only child who be still living with other girl be married mr clavering of married to men connected with own profession colour came slightly to florence burton cheek a heard father word harry asked whether old man expected that must go

loved woman such suffering be seldom perpetual with have be a easy of cure a with most others little more than year have passed now be already engaged to woman a thought of did not by mean accuse of

want in wife a walked up down hill of stratton street with kiss of dear modest affectionate girl still warm upon lip told that marriage with one a julia brabazon must have be altogether fatal to chance of happiness thing have occurred rumour have reached assisted much in adopting view of subject be known to claverings even to others who cared about such thing that lord lady ongar be not happy together have be already said that lady ongar have misconducted there be certain count whose name have come to be mingled with hers in way be to say least of very unfortunate sir hugh clavering have declared in mr clavering hearing though little disposed in general to make many revelation to of family at rectory that did not intend to take sister in law part have made own bed must lie upon have known what lord ongar be before have married fault be own so much sir hugh have said in saying have done in lay to damn sister in law fair fame harry clavering little a have lived in world during last twelve month still knew that people told different story earl too wife have not be in england since marriage so that rumour have be filtered to at home through foreign medium during most of time have be in italy now a harry knew be at florence have heard that lord ongar have declared intention of suing for divorce that supposed to be erroneous a two be still living under same roof then heard that lord ongar be ill whisper be spread abroad darkly doubtingly a though great misfortune be apprehended harry must not fail to tell have julia become wife a have once promised whisper darkness must hardly have come to pas not on account did now regret that early vow have not be kept living at stratton have taught to think much of quiet domesticity of life to believe florence burton be fitter to be wife than julia brabazon told that have done well to find out that have be wise to act upon wisdom have in truth consisted in capacity to feel florence be nice girl clever well minded high principled full of spirit in falling in love with a consequence regard for quiet domesticity have come from love have have share in producing florence be bright eyed eye be ever brighter in tear in laughter when came to look at well found that have be idiot to think plain there be thing grow to beauty a look at to exquisite beauty be one of have said to there be men have answered who grow to flattery a listen to to impudent flattery be one of thought plain first day saw be not flattery yes sir be mean for flattery after harry come only to want to tell that have learned to love repeated to a walked up down stratton declared to that be very lovely have be given to to ascertain be rather proud of be little diffident about father thought that perhaps father might see florence a have first seen might not have discernment enough to ascertain mistake a have done florence be not going to clavering at once must be able to give beforehand own account of have not be home since engagement have be thing settled position with regard to florence have be declared by letter mother have written to young lady asking to come to clavering when harry got home family received with congratulation be so glad to think that must marry early mother said to in whisper be not married yet answered do show lock of hair said fanny laughing be twice prettier hair than yours though doe think half so much about

fry wo care much about said harry seems be going to do regular thing said father like good apprentice marry master daughter then become lord mayor of london be not view in have pleased harry to regard engagement other young men have gone to mr burton have married mr burton daughter at least enough have done so to justify stratton assertion that have fallen into same trap burton with five girl be supposed in stratton to have managed affair very well something of hint have reached harry ear must have preferred that thing must not have be made so common be not fool enough to make really unhappy on head know much about becoming lord mayor replied that promotion doe lie exactly in line marrying master daughter doe seems said rector harry thought that a coming from father be almost ill natured therefore dropped conversation be sure will like said fanny think that will like harry choice said mr clavering do hope edward will like said mary mary said sister do wish be once married when be will begin to have self of own again now be better than unconscious echo wait for own turn dear said mother harry have reached home on saturday following monday be christmas day lady clavering be told be at home at park sir hugh have be there lately one from house except servant be seen at church on sunday on christmas day show nothing said rector speaking in anger very rarely doe come when doe must be better that must be away think that like to insult by misconducting say that be not well can easily believe that about sister make unhappy if be must go up call mother be there other day did not see think will find that be away hunting somewhere saw groom going off with three horse on sunday afternoon always sends by church gate just a be coming out so harry went up to house found lady clavering at home be looking old careworn be glad to see harry be only one of rectory family who have be liked at great house since sir hugh marriage have cared to do so must have be made welcome there a have once said to sir hugh sister in law if shot clavering game must be expected to do so in guise of head gamekeeper did not choose to play that part must not suit to drink sir hugh claret be bidden to ring bell to be asked to step into stable for that be fellow of college quite a big man thought a sir hugh must not be hanger on at park to tell truth disliked cousin quite a much a father did there have even be sort of friendship nay occasionally almost confidence between lady clavering believed that by be really liked lady clavering have heard of engagement of course congratulated who told asked be mother have not seen mother know when think be maid told though somehow see much of at rectory servant be doubt more gracious with rectory servant be sure must be nice harry must not have chosen hope have got money yes think be nice be coming here at easter ah will be away then know about money will have little very little hundred year oh harry be not that rash of younger brother must always get money be same a younger brother know idea be to earn own bread be not very aristocratic after there be great many more in same boat with of course will earn bread having wife with money must not hinder that girl be not worse because can bring help however be sure hope will be happy what meant be that think best when money come from husband be sure ought to agree with because never have then there be pause suppose have heard about lord ongar said have heard that be very ill very ill believe there be hope when heard last julia never writes now be sorry that be so bad a said harry not well knowing what else to say a regard julia know whether may not be for best seems to be cruel thing to say of course can not think most of have heard perhaps that have not be happy yes have heard that of course what be use of pretending anything with know what people have said of have never believed always loved harry oh dear remember how unhappy that made once be so afraid that hugh must suspect must never have done for must harry did great deal better for herself said harry if mean that ironically must say now if dy will be well off of course people will in time forget have be said be if will live quietly worst of be that fear nothing speak a though thought have be be think be probably imprudent believe nothing worse than who can say what be absolutely wrong what only imprudent think be too proud to go really astray then with man a so difficult so ill tempered sir hugh think at moment door be opened sir hugh came in what doe sir hugh think said be speaking of lord ongar said harry sitting up shaking hand with cousin then harry be speaking on subject must rather not have discussed in house do understand that hermione will have talking about lord ongar wife know very little what hear be simply uncomfortable will dine here to day harry thank have only just come home be just going away be go to morrow can not stand place think dullest neighbourhood in england most gloomy house ever saw hermione like to last assertion lady clavering expressed assent did venture to contradict chapter v lady ongar return sir hugh did not get away from clavering park on next morning a have intended there came to that same afternoon message by telegraph to say that lord ongar be dead have died at florence on afternoon of christmas day lady ongar have expressed intention of coming at once to england why devil doe stay where be said sir hugh to wife people must forget there in twelve month time row must be over perhaps doe not want to be forgotten said lady clavering then must want care whether have be guilty not when woman get name into mess a must keep in background think be unjust to hugh of course do suppose that expect anything else if mean to tell that there must have be row if have be decently prudent tell that be mistaken only think what man be knew that when took must have borne with while lasted woman be to have seven thousand year for nothing forget that not syllable have be proved against be attempted to be proved have never left now have be with in last moment think ought to be first to turn against if must remain abroad must do best must for chooses to return home a think be wrong wo have here be suppose that go about world accusing think might do something to fight battle for will hing unless take advice remains abroad must write to now will tell what say be infernal bore dying at moment suppose people wo expect be to shut up for one day only did baronet shut up on following went whither have before intended lady clavering thought proper to write line to rectory informing family there that lord ongar be more did in note to mr clavering when be received there came over face of that lugubrious look be a matter of course assumed by decorous people when tidings come of death of one who have be known to even in most distant way with exception of harry rectory claverings have be introduced to lord ongar be now bound to express something approaching to sorrow will one dare to call hypocrisy if be so called who in world be not hypocrite where be man woman who have not special face for sorrow before company man woman who have such face must at once be accused of heartless impropriety be very sad said mr clavering only think be little more than year since married twelve such month a have be for said rector shaking head face be very lugubrious for though a parson be essentially kindly easy man to whom humbug be odious who dealt little in austerity of clerical denunciation still have face of pulpit sorrow for sin of people what may perhaps call clerical knack of gentle condemnation must therefore assume solemn look little saddened motion of head with more ease than people who be not often called upon for such action poor woman said fanny thinking of woman married sorrow early widowhood poor man said mary shuddering a thought of husband fate hope said harry almost sententiously that one in house will condemn upon such mere rumour a have be heard why must one in house condemn said rector even if there be more than rumour dear judge not lest ye be judged a regard be bound by close tie not to speak ill of even to think ill unless can not avoid a far a know have not even reason for thinking ill then went out changed tone of countenance among rectory stable lit cigar three day after second note be brought down from great house to rectory be from lady clavering to harry dear harry ran note must find time to come up to morning sir hugh have gone to north priory ever yours h c harry of course went a went wondered how sir hugh must have have heart to go to north priory at moment north priory be hunting seat thirty mile from clavering belonging to great nobleman with whom sir hugh much consorted harry be grieved that cousin have not resisted temptation of going at time be quick enough to perceive lady clavering alluded to absence of lord a reason why harry might pay visit to house with satisfaction be so much obliged to for coming said lady clavering want to know if can do something for a spoke have paper in hand immediately perceived to be letter from italy will do anything can of course lady clavering must tell hardly know whether ought to ask be doing what must make hugh very angry be so unreasonable so cruel about julia condemns simply because a say there be smoke without fire be cruel thing to say about woman be not harry thought that be cruel thing a did not wish to speak evil of sir hugh before lady clavering held tongue when got first news by telegraph julia said that intended to come home at once hugh think that must remain abroad for time indeed be not sure must be best at rate made write to advise to stay declared that if came at once must hing for truth be doe not want to have here for if be again in house must have to take part if ill natured thing be said that be cowardly said harry stoutly say that harry till have heard if belief thing be right not to wish to meddle be very hard always belief evil be not coward if be here living with a sister must take part whatever might think why must think ill of own sister in law have never thought ill of loved never did though think liked too in way be what told to do did wrote to advising to remain at florence till warm weather come saying that a must not specially wish to be in london for season thought must be more comfortable there than here then added that hugh also advised to stay of course did not say that must not have here be threat be not likely to press where be not wanted will not forget rank money for must now be hers julia can be quite a hard a stubborn a can did write a say think that if have got letter before have written must perhaps have stayed here be letter from declaring that will come at once will be starting almost a soon a letter get there be sure will not alter purpose now see why must not come if like only that might be more comfortable there read what say need not read first part not that there be secret be about last moment must only pain harry longed to read whole did a be bid began letter at spot lady clavering marked for with finger have to start on third a will stay nowhere except to sleep at turin paris will be home by eighth think on evening of eighth will bring only own maid one of men who desire to come back with wish to have apartment taken for in london suppose hugh will do a much a for be quite sure hugh wo said lady clavering who be watching eye a read harry said nothing went on reading will only want two sitting room two bedroom one for one for clara must like to have somewhere near piccadilly in clarges street about there can write line send message to hotel bristol at paris if anything fails so that must not hear will go to palace hotel in case must telegraph for room from paris be that be to read harry asked can go on see what say a to reason for coming so harry went on reading have suffered much of course know must suffer more be determined will face worst of at once have be hinted to that attempt will be made to interfere with settlement who can have hinted said harry lady clavering suspected who might have done so made answer can hardly think possible if be done will not be out of way have done duty a best must have done under circumstance may truly say be terrible will go on doing one will say that be ashamed to show face claim own will be surprised when see have aged so much need not go on said lady clavering rest be about nothing that signifies then harry refolded letter gave back to companion sir hugh be gone therefore must not show that in time to do anything if be to do so must simply hing let go to hotel in london now must be unkind must not very unkind think must seem so cold to on return very cold will not go meet lady clavering blushed a answered though sir hugh be tyrant to wife known to be such though knew that be known have never said that be so to of claverings now be driven to

difficult sum asked seemed to be enormous seven guinea week at time of year lady dimdaff have always paid seven guinea be in season suggested harry to woman replied that be season now harry felt that

vehicle man be there of course in time harry made angry because must not get carriage so placed that lady ongar might be sure of stepping into without leaving platform punctually to moment coming train announced by whistle harry clavering felt to be in flutter train came up along platform harry stood there expecting to see julia brabazon head projected from first window caught eye be of julia

shook hand with through carriage window be saw of word have be repeated be be spoken of face have not caught glimpse a went home to lodging be conscious that interview have not be satisfactory must not say what more wanted felt that there be something amiss consoled however by reminding that florence burton be girl whom have really loved not julia brabazon lady ongar have given invitation to come see therefore determined that must return home on following day without going near bolton street have pictured to beforehand sort of description must give to lady clavering of sister seeing how thing have turned out made up mind that must say nothing of meeting indeed must not go up to great house at have done lady clavering commission at little trouble expense to there must be end of lady ongar must not mention that have seen doubted indeed whether must remember whom have seen for good that have done for sentiment that there have be cousin hugh butler might a well have gone to train in mood returned home consoling with fitness of thing have given florence burton instead of julia brabazon for wife chapter vi rev samuel saul during harry absence in circumstance have occurred at rectory have surprised of annoyed others good deal mr saul curate have made offer to fanny rector fanny declared to be surprised annoyed that rector be in truth troubled by thing be very evident mr clavering said that have almost suspected that be at rate not surprised a to offer of course be sorry that must have be made a must not suit fanny to accept mary be surprised a have thought mr saul to be wholly intent on other thing must not see reason why offer must be regarded a being on part unreasonable how can say so mamma such have be fanny indignant exclamation when mr clavering have hinted that mr saul proceeding have be expected by simply because saw that liked dear men under such circumstance have different way of showing liking fanny who have seen of mary love affair from beginning to end who have watched reverend edward fielding in very conspicuous manoeuvre must not agree to edward fielding from first moment of intimate acquaintance with mary have left doubt of intention on mind of one have talked to mary walked with mary whenever be allowed found possible to do so when driven to talk to fanny have always talked about mary have be lover of good old plainspoken stamp about whom there have be no mistake from first moment of coming much about clavering rectory only question have be about income think mr saul ever said word to except about poor people church service said fanny be merely way said mr clavering then must be goose said fanny be very sorry if have made unhappy have business to come to in way suppose will have to look for curate said rector be said in private to wife see that at said mr clavering with many men must be so think will find that will take answer that there will be end of fanny perhaps have right to be indignant for certainly mr saul have given fair warning of intention mary have for month be intent rather on mr fielding church matter than on going on in own parish therefore there have be nothing singular in fact that mr saul have said more on such matter to fanny than to sister fanny be eager active a mr saul be very eager very active be natural that must have have interest in common there have be no private walking talking must properly be called private there be certain book fanny kept containing name of poor people in parish to mr saul have access equally with content be of most prosaic nature when have sat over in rectory drawing room with mr saul by side striving to extract more than twelve penny out of charity shilling have never thought that must lead to declaration of love have never called fanny in life not up to moment when declined honour of becoming mr saul offer be made in wise have be at house of old widow tubb way between cumberly green little village of clavering striving to make rheumatic old woman believe that have not be cheated by general conspiracy of parish in matter of distribution of coal when just a be about to leave cottage mr saul came up be then past four evening be becoming dark there be moreover slight drizzle of rain be not tempting evening for walk of mile half through very dirty lane fanny clavering did not care much for such thing be just stepping out into mud moisture with dress well looped up when mr saul accosted be afraid will be very wet miss clavering will be better than going without cup of tea mr saul must have to do if stayed longer with mr tubb have got umbrella be so dark dirty said be used to a ought to know yes do know said walking on with do know that nothing ever turn away from good work there be something in tone of voice fanny did not like have never complimented before have be very intimate have often scolded other fanny must accuse of exacting too much from people must retort upon that coddled fanny must often decline to obey must make angry hint a to clerical authority in way have worked together pleasantly without of awkwardness on other term must have arisen between young man young woman now that began to praise with peculiar intention of meaning in tone be confounded have made immediate answer to walked on rapidly through mud slush be very constant said have not be two year at clavering without finding that out be becoming worse worse be not so much word provoked a tone in be uttered yet have not slightest idea of what be coming if thoroughly admiring devotion mistaken a to character be to ask to become protestant nun suggest to that must leave home go a nurse into hospital then there must have occurred sort of folly of believed to be capable of folly now committed have not believed to be capable have come on to rain hard held umbrella low over head also be walking with open umbrella in hand so that be not very close to other fanny a stepped on impetuously put foot into depth of pool splashed thoroughly oh dear oh dear said be very disagreeable miss clavering said have be looking for opportunity to speak to know when may find so suitable a still believed that proposition be to be made to must be disagreeable perhaps impertinent never occurred to that mr saul be in want of wife doe rain too hard for talking said a have begun must go on with now replied raising voice little a though be necessary that must do so to make hear through rain darkness moved little further away from with unthinking irritation still went on with purpose miss clavering know that be ill suited to play part of lover very ill suited then gave start again splashed sadly have never read how be done in book have not allowed imagination to dwell much on such thing mr saul go on pray now did understand what be coming yes miss clavering must go on now not on account must press to give answer to day have learned to love if can love in return will take by hand will be wife have found that in have be unable not to love not to covet may bind to a own for ever will think of give answer when have considered fully illustration mr saul proposes have not spoken altogether amiss fanny though be very angry with be conscious of time have chosen might not be considered suitable for declaration of love place having chosen have perhaps made best of there have be hesitation in voice word have be perfectly audible oh mr saul of course can assure at once said fanny there need not be consideration really have never thought fanny who knew own mind on matter thoroughly be hardly able to express plainly without incivility a soon a phrase of course have passed lip felt that must not have be spoken there be need that must insult by telling that proposition from must have one answer miss clavering know have never thought of therefore must be well that must take time have not be able to make manifest to by little sign a men do who be le awkward love have felt for indeed must have done so must still have hesitated till have thoroughly resolved that might be better with wife than without one have resolved also a far a might be possible for that also must be better with husband mr saul really must be for to think of for also can man offer to marry woman to bind woman for life to certain duty to so close obligation without thinking whether such bond must be good for a well a for of course must think for so have thought for must think for must think also for fanny be quite aware that a regarded matter be one required more thinking mr saul be not man with whom must bring to be in love have own idea a to what be loveable in men eager curate splashing through rain by side by mean came up to standard of excellence be unconsciously aware that have altogether mistaken character given credit for more abnegation of world than pretended to posse be desirous of possessing fanny clavering be in hurry to get married know that have even made up mind that marriage must be good thing for have untroubled conviction that if did marry husband must have house income have reliance on own power of living on potato with one new dress year comfortable home with nice comfortable thing around ease in money matter elegance in life be charm with have not quarrelled though did not wish to be hard upon mr saul on account of mistake did feel that in making proposition have blundered because chose to do duty a parish clergyman daughter thought entitled to regard a devotee who must be willing to resign everything to become wife of clergyman who be active indeed who have not one shilling of income beyond curacy mr saul said can assure need take time for further thinking can not be a must have perhaps have be abrupt indeed feel that be so though did not know how to avoid must have made difference indeed indeed mr saul nothing of kind must have made difference will grant may speak to again on same subject after six month can not do good will do good for so much time will have have idea before fanny thought that must have mr saul before that must be enough mr saul with rusty clothes thick dirty shoe weak blinking eye mind always set upon one wish of life must not be made to present to in guise of lover be one of men of whom woman become very fond with fondness of friendship from whom young woman seem to be a far removed in way of love a though belonged to other specie will not press further said a gather by tone that distress be so sorry if distress really mr saul must give never must give other answer then walked on silently through rain silently without single word for more than mile till reached rectory gate here be necessary that must at rate speak to other for last three hundred yard fanny have be trying to find word must be suitable be first to break silence good night miss clavering said stopping putting out hand good night mr saul hope that there may be difference in bearing to other because of what have to day said to not on part be if will forget miss clavering will not forget if have be thing to be forgotten must not have spoken certainly will not forget know what mean mr saul will not forget even in way that mean still think need not fear because know that love think can promise that need not withdraw from because of what have passed will tell father mother of course will be guided by now good night then went be astonished at finding that have have much best of in manner of speaking conducting have refused very curtly have borne well have not be abashed have become sulky have tried to melt by mention of own misery in truth have done very well only that must have known better than to make such attempt at mr saul have be right in one thing of course told mother of course mother told father before dinner that evening whole affair be being debated in family conclave agreed that fanny have have no alternative to reject proposition at once indeed be so thoroughly taken for granted that point be not discussed there came to be difference between rector fanny on one side mr clavering mary on other upon word said rector think be very impertinent fanny must not have liked to use that word loved father for using see that said mr clavering must not know what fanny view in life might be curate very often marry out of house of clergyman with whom be placed see why mr saul must be debarred from privilege of trying if have got to like fanny what else be to do said mary oh mary talk such nonsense said fanny got to like people must get to like people unless there be reason for what on earth did intend to live on demanded rector edward have nothing to live on when first allowed to come here said mary edward have prospect saul a far a know have none have given one slightest notice if man in moon have come to fanny suppose must have be more surprised not so much papa then be that mr clavering have declared that be not surprised that have suspected have almost made fanny angry by saying so when harry came back two day afterwards family news be imparted to immediately ranged on father side upon word think that ought to be forbidden house said harry have forgotten in making such proposition be nonsense harry said mother if can be comfortable coming here there can be reason why must be uncomfortable must be injustice to to ask to go great trouble to father to find curate must suit so well there must be doubt whatever a to latter proposition therefore be quietly argued that mr saul fault if there have be fault must be condoned on next day came to rectory be astonished at ease with bore be not that affected special freedom of manner that altogether avoided change in mode of speaking to slight blush came upon sallow face a first spoke to mr clavering hardly did more than say single word to fanny carried a though conscious of what have done in degree ashamed of doing rector manner to be stiff formal seeing mr clavering spoke to gently with smile saw be little hard on therefore tried to make up for said afterwards be quite right said husband always be wish have not made fool of will never be same thing with again harry hardly spoke to mr saul first time met of mr saul understood perfectly clavering said to harry day two after hope there be to be difference between difference know what mean by difference be good friend hope that be to remain so no doubt know what have taken place between sister oh yes have be told of course what mean be that hope be not going to quarrel with on account what did be not what must have done in position only must have done successfully think fellow must have income know can say that must have waited for income before spoke of marriage think might have be better that must have gone to father may be that be rule in such thing if so know must have liked that better well ca say be engaged did go to young lady family first ca say did think have given ground to expect fancy knew what be about be over now know that need say anything more about certainly not nothing can be said must be of use think have done anything that must resent resent be strong word resent at rate wo there may be end of after harry be more gracious with mr saul having idea that curate have made sort of apology for what have done that fancy be by mean mr saul view of case have offered to marry daughter of archbishop of canterbury instead of daughter of rector of clavering must not have imagined that doing so needed apology day after return from london lady clavering sent for harry up to house so saw sister in london said yes said harry blushing a be in town thought might a well meet a said lady ongar be able to do without much assistance of kind only just saw julia took so kindly of seems surprised that did not come to following day thought must have called oh dear fancied that must be too tired too busy to wish to see mere acquaintance ah harry see that have angered said lady clavering otherwise must not talk about mere acquaintance not in least angered how must anger what meant be that at time must probably wish to see one people on business unless be one near to like hugh hugh will not go to will do so will not before long will seem to understand harry perhaps must be odd if did that ca run up to town back a please ought not to tell dare say one feel a though one wanted to talk to one about one affair at present moment have not money to go even if there be other reason last word said almost in whisper then looked up into young man face to see what thought of communication have made oh money said must soon get money hope wo be long before go on next morning one letter came by post for from lady ongar when saw handwriting knew heart be at once in mouth hesitated to open letter at breakfast table did open read in truth hardly understood digested till have taken away with up to own room letter be very short be a follows dear friend felt kindness in coming to at station so much more perhaps because others who owed more kindness have paid le suppose allude to poor hermione for in truth have intention to complain of thought perhaps must have come to see before left london suppose be hurried hear from clavering that be to be up about new profession in day two pray come see before have be many day in london will have so much to say to room have taken be everything that wanted be so grateful yours ever j o

about affair on matter practice be very various among different people there be family who think almost indelicate to talk about marriage a thing actually in prospect for of own community ordinary acquaintance must be considered to be impertinent in even hinting at thing although thing be established fact engaged young lady only whisper news through very depth of pink note paper be supposed to blush a communicate tidings by pen even in retirement of own room there be other family in there be vestige of such mystery in engaged couple be spoken of together a openly a though be already bound in sort of public partnership in family young lady talk openly of lover generally prefer that subject of conversation to other such family so little mysterious so open in arrangement be that of burton at reserve in reserved family be usually atoned for by magnificence of bridal arrangement when marriage be at last solemnized whereas among other set people who have reserve marriage when come be customarily affair of much le outward ceremony be married without blast of trumpet with very little profit to confectioner do honeymoon if do at with prosaic simplicity florence have made up mind that

of after if not to morrow then on next day so on till day must come on must consent to become wife went on also to say that must continue to torment on subject about once week till have induced to give way then quoted latin line to show that constant dropping of water will hollow stone be somewhat at variance with declaration have made to mr burton in onslow crescent to effect that must never speak to florence again upon subject then men do occasionally change mind harry clavering be man who often changed florence a made declaration above described thought that played part of lover very well drew little closer to a thanked for warmth dear harry be so good so kind do love so truly in way journey be made very pleasantly when florence be driven up to rectory door be quite contented with coachman harry clavering who be hero of story will not fear have hitherto presented to reader a having much of heroic nature in character will perhaps be complained of that be fickle vain easily led almost a easily led to evil a to good must be remembered that hitherto have be rather hardly dealt with in page that fault weakness have be exposed almost unfairly that have such fault be subject to such weakness may be believed of there may be question whether a much evil must not be known of most men let be hero not be hero if character be so to say turned inside out before eye harry clavering fellow of college six foot high with handsome face person with plenty to say for on subject be esteemed highly regarded much by who knew in spite of little foible marred character must beg reader to take world opinion about not to estimate too meanly thus early in history of adventure if tale must ever be read by lady who in course of career have entered house under circumstance similar to have brought florence burton to clavering rectory will understand how anxious must have be that young lady when encountered whole clavering family in hall have be blown about by wind cloak shawl be heavy on hat be little out of shape from fault on part of harry a believe felt to be dowdy a appeared among must think of what must think of harry in have chosen one to be wife mr clavering have kissed before have seen that lady face mary fanny have kissed before knew be then stout clerical gentleman kissed who doubt be mr clavering senior after clerical gentleman very much younger very much slighter shook hand with might have kissed too have be so minded for florence be too confused to be capable of making exact reckoning in matter might have done so that be a far a florence be concerned may be question whether mary clavering must not have objected for clerical gentleman be rev edward fielding who be to become husband in three day time now florence said fanny come upstairs into mamma room have tea will look at harry need come have have to yourself for long time can have again in evening florence in way be taken upstairs found seated by fire while three pair of hand be taking from

at time said mary think so much of having harry future wife at wedding wish be going to be married same day be not going to be married for ever so long two year hence have be shortest time named be sure of florence said fanny have of received special commission from harry to talk out of heresy have not mamma think have better not tease florence about immediately on arrival be hardly fair then when have drunk tea florence be taken away to own room before be allowed to go downstairs be intimate with girl have so far overcome awe of harry mother a to be able to answer without confusion well sir what do think of said harry to father a soon a be alone have not have time to think much of yet seems to be very pretty be so tall a thought must be be not tall said harry in voice of disappointment have doubt will like very much what money be to have hundred year while father life be not much much little made difference with must never have thought of marrying girl for money be kind of thing hate almost wish be to have nothing must refuse if be of course sha refuse what mean be that never thought about when asked to have must have be bit more likely to ask if have ten time a much fortune with one wife be bad thing for poor man harry poor man must be poor in more sens than one when look about to get fortune in way suppose wo marry just yet said father including everything must not have five hundred year must be very close work in london be not quite decided yet sir a far a be concerned think that people be great deal too prudent about money believe must live a married man on hundred year if have more a for london see why london must be more expensive than other place can get exactly what want in london make halfpenny go farther there than anywhere else sovereign go quicker said rector be wanted said harry be will to live on income little firmness in carrying out plan rector of clavering a heard wisdom fall from son lip looked at harry expensive clothes at ring on finger at gold chain on waistcoat at stud in shirt smiled gently be by mean so clever man a son knew something more of world though not much given to general reading have read son character great deal of firmness of fortitude also be wanted for kind of life said there be men who can go through without suffering must not advise young man to commence in hurry if be must wait year two come let have walk be if can tear away from lady love for hour if there be not saul coming up avenue take hat harry will get out other way only want to see girl about school if catch will keep for hour then harry asked after mr saul love affair have not heard one single word about since went away said rector seems to have passed off like dream fanny go on same a ever suppose know that made fool of in matter rector of clavering be mistaken mr saul did not by mean think that have made fool of have never spoken word to since said fanny to brother that evening be not word a to what occurred then of course be very embarrassing at first though think minded much came after day two just same a ever almost made think that have forgotten be confused not at all never be only difference be that think scold more than used to do scold oh dear yes always scolded if thought there be anything wrong especially about giving child holiday doe now more than ever how do bear in half half sort of way laugh at then do a be bid make everybody do what bid at clavering except papa sometimes scold too heard other day in library did father take from did in sort of way think papa like then know know that be so good never spare in anything have nothing curacy what give away be wonderful hope wo take to scolding said harry proudly a concern about parish must say that be safe suppose think mamma doe everything right for never scold there be talk of going away none at think must be sorry because doe so much good florence reigned supreme in estimation of rectory family evening of arrival till after breakfast next morning then bride elect be restored to natural pre eminence however lasted only for two day after bride be taken away wedding be very nice pretty comfortable people of clavering be much better satisfied with than have be with other marriage have be mentioned a having be celebrated in clavering church rectory family be generally popular everybody wished well to daughter who be being given away when be gone there be breakfast at rectory speech be made with much volubility on occasion rector be great man harry also shone in conspicuous rivalry with father mr saul spirit be not so well tuned to occasion a of rector son when got upon leg mournfully expressed hope that friend mr fielding might be enabled to bear trial of life with fortitude be felt by that speaking have better be brought to end must laugh at harry fanny said to brother afterwards almost seriously one man can do one thing one can make speech better than can think must preach so good sermon declare think be getting fond of after said harry upon hearing fanny turned away with look of great offence one brother said must say such thing a to because like to hear poor man ridiculed without cause that evening when be alone fanny told florence whole story about mr saul tell know because be like one of now have never be mentioned to one out of family florence declared that story must be sacred with be sure of dear therefore like to know of course such thing be quite out of question poor fellow have mean at literally none then independently of think must ever bring to think of a first thing said florence must if really be attached to man think must tell so agree to wait either with hope without just so fanny there be nothing of kind indeed be sort of man that girl must think of being in love with be see will hardly take trouble to dress decently have only seen at wedding know for be quite bright will see plenty of if will go to school with indeed come here great deal quite a much a did before happened be so good florence poor man ca in least make out from manner whether have given up thinking about suppose have indeed of course have because must know that must be of sort of use be one of men of whom can never say whether be happy not never can be quite sure what may be in mind be not bound to place at not like father oh said fanny thinking perhaps that mr saul might find to be bound to place though not exactly with bond similar to kept father there if found to be unhappy must go said florence oh yes must go if be unhappy said fanny be must go if pleased lady clavering have come to wedding one else have be present from great house sir hugh indeed be not at home a rector truly observed might have be at home if have so pleased be man said father to son who always doe rude thing if be in power for care nothing for a know think that mary must have liked to have seen a head of family therefore doe not come have greater skill in making odious than man ever knew a for say be leading terrible life be becoming so stingy about money too hear that archie be very heavy on believe that must allow man to be heavy on a call archie have mean of own suppose have not run through yet if hugh have advanced money may be sure that have security a for archie will come to end very soon if what hear be true tell be always at newmarket that always loses though sir hugh be thus uncourteous to rector to rector daughter be so far prepared to be civil to cousin harry that allowed wife to ask rectory family to dine up at house in honour of harry sweetheart florence burton be specially invited with lady clavering sweetest smile florence of course referred matter to hostess be decided that must accept invitation be given personally after breakfast be not always easy to decline invitation so given may think be doubted whether man woman have right to give invitation in way whether invitation so given must not be null void from fact of unfair advantage have be taken man who fire at sitting bird be known to be sportsman now dinner giver who catch guest in unguarded moment bag when have have chance to rise upon wing doe fire at sitting bird in instance however lady clavering little speech be made only to mr clavering to florence said nothing personally to rector therefore might have escaped wife talked over think must go for harry sake said mr clavering see what good will do harry will show that approve of match approve disapprove of be own master do approve know a countenance there can not possibly be sweeter girl than florence burton like be sure seem to take to thoroughly take to yes take to very well be ladylike though be beauty look pretty be spirited daresay be clever so good if be good that be better than only see what be to live on a be here will go with to great house mr clavering never asked husband anything in vain rector agreed to go apologized for afterwards to son by explaining that did a duty will serve for six month said if did not go there about once in six month there must be supposed to be family quarrel must be bad for parish harry be to remain only week at clavering dinner be to take place evening before went away on morning walked round park with florence a have before often walked with julia took occasion of giving full history of clavering family none of like cousin hugh have said be at least harmless mean to be good natured be very unlike sister lady ongar so must suppose from what have told altogether inferior being have only one child only one boy now two year old say be anything strong sir hugh have one brother archie clavering think archie be worse fellow even than hugh make more attempt to be agreeable there be something in eye always distrust then be man who doe good in world to anybody be not married no be not married suppose ever will marry be on card florence that future baronet may be then frowned on walked on quickly changed conversation chapter xi sir hugh brother archie there be numerous gathering of claverings in drawing room of great house when family from rectory arrived comprising three generation for nurse be in room holding heir in arm mr clavering fanny of course inspected child at once a be bound to do while lady clavering welcomed florence burton archie spoke word two to uncle sir hugh vouchsafed to give one finger to cousin harry by way of shaking hand with then there came feeble squeak from infant there be cloud at once upon sir hugh brow hermione said wish must have child in here be not place for be always cross have said dozen time must have down here just before dinner then sign be made to nurse walked off with burden be poor rickety unalluring bairn be that lady clavering have must fain have be allowed to show to relative a other mother be allowed to do hugh said wife will introduce to miss burton then sir hugh came forward shook hand with new guest with sort of apology for remissness while harry stood by glowering at with offence in eye father be right have said to when cousin failed to notice florence on first entrance into room be impertinent a well a disagreeable care for quarrel in parish so will let know upon word be doosed good looking little thing said archie coming up to after having also shaken hand with doosed good looking call be glad think so said harry drily let see where be picked up did hear forget picked up a call at stratton where father life oh yes know be fellow coached in new business be by by harry think have made mess of in changing line 'd have stuck to governor shop if 'd be 'd got through d d fag of there be living have always belonged to clavering must brother have said if have asked to give to must have given of course nobody doe give anything to anybody now day living be sort of thing that people buy 'd have got under favourable circumstance fact be archie be not very fond of church a profession must have thought easy work look at father keep curate doe take trouble upon word if 'd known a much then a do now 'd have have shy for hugh must have refused to ca give while uncle hold must have be against to be sure governor life be pretty nearly a good a mine must have liked waiting so suppose be a well a be there may perhaps have be other reason why archie clavering regret that did not take holy order be needle have never succeeded in learning anything that master have ever attempted to teach although have shown considerable aptitude in picking up acquirement for regular master be appointed knew father mother sire dam ought perhaps to say grandfather grandmother so back for generation of horse of note living in day knew also circumstance of race what horse must run at at what age be stake period of running special interest of affair not on account must be thought

away will be next person to be taken away suppose must be next person at home because be last be left sister be married how many be there there be five married good heaven five be married to men in same profession a harry quite family affair said sir hugh harry who be sitting on other side of florence heard must have preferred that florence must have said nothing about sister why harry said

brother never offered to make bet with hugh have once put stop to altogether archie have said pray understand that there be money to be made out of at rate not by if lost money to must think necessary to pay certainly will lose none to habit of proposing to bet have become with archie so much matter of course that did not generally intend real speculation by offer with brother have dropped even habit seldom began conversation with hugh unless have point to gain advance of money to ask favour to beg in way of shooting loan of horse on such occasion must commence negotiation with usual diplomacy not knowing other mode of expressing wish be aware that brother must always detect manoeuvre expose before have got through first preface therefore a have said be afraid of hugh know what be come to uncle of late said hugh after while think will have to drop at rectory altogether never have much to say for have mode of expressing without speaking choose to put up with at table fact be be going to mischief at rectory eldest girl have just married curate fielding have got living be something very small then suppose fanny will marry prig have here uncle never doe of own work now harry be going to make fool of used to think must fall on leg be clever fellow then why be fool a to marry girl a without money good look breeding be well for be such fool else must have chance see at said archie julia always have sneaking fondness for harry if have waited must have taken now be very near making fool of with once before lord ongar turned up to archie said nothing changed colour may almost be said of that blushed why be affected in so singular manner by brother word will be best explained by statement of what took place in back drawing room little later in evening when harry reached drawing room went up to lady clavering said nothing to then of especial notice be talking to mr clavering while rector be reading pretending to read review two girl be chattering together in part of room then have coffee after awhile two other men came in from wine lady clavering did not move at once took first opportunity of doing so when sir hugh came up to mr clavering spoke word to few minute after harry found closeted with lady clavering in little room detached from others though door between two be open do know said lady clavering sir hugh have asked julia to come here harry paused moment then acknowledged that did know hope did not advise to refuse advise oh dear did not ask anything about have refused think have be very wrong be hard to say said harry know thought very cruel that hugh did not receive immediately on return if have be must have gone to paris to meet be good talking of now harry hugh be hard know that who feel most do think julia a have come round what can gain by standing off will not be best thing for to come here know that have much to gain by harry do know that have plan who be harry asked went on without noticing question tell because believe can help more than one if will only for engagement with miss burton must not mention to for that plan must daresay be of use what be plan said harry very gravely vague idea of what plan might be have come across harry mind during lady clavering last speech must not be good thing if julia archie be to be married asked question in quick hesitating voice looking at first eagerly up into face then turning away eye a though be afraid of answer might read there of course know that be fond of can be nothing now said harry can be nothing now then why must archie have must make so much more comfortable together told archie must speak to because know that have more weight with than of hugh doe know that mean doe sir hugh know of plan be who proposed archie will be very badly off when have settled with hugh about money dealing of course julia money must be left in own hand there must be intention to interfere with position must be so good for must know put on leg yes said harry must put on leg daresay why must be so ca live alone by always of course never must have really loved lord ongar never must think said harry archie be good natured good tempered good looking think so think must just do for 'd have own way for be not bit like hugh know be not so clever a hugh be much more good natured think must be good arrangement harry then again looked up into face anxiously nothing in whole matter surprised more than eagerness in advocating proposal why must desire that sister must be sacrificed in way in so thinking of forgot own position need that there be to for friend to be near to for comfort assistance have spoken truly in saying that plan have originated with husband since have be suggested to have not ceased to think of to wish for well harry what do say asked see have anything to say know can help when be with last time declared that be only one of ever wished to see again meant to include then especially of course be not thinking of archie know can help if will be to ask to marry not exactly that think must do good might persuade to come here think must come if advised then after bit might say good word for archie upon word must not why not harry because know must not make happy what good must such marriage do think of position one will visit unless be first received here at rate unless come to in town then must be up hill work do know lord ongar have absolutely determined at one time to to get divorce do believe that be guilty say that why must believe anything against own sister when nothing be proved that make difference if world belief say now that if have lived three month longer never must have got money then say lie who be say so parcel of old woman who delight in having one to run down backbite be false lady clavering what doe signify harry there be know how people be talking of course must be best for to marry again if must take archie sir hugh brother brother in law nothing further must be said might go anywhere then a sister feel sure that be best thing must do harry brow became clouded there be look of anger on face a answered lady clavering said sister will never marry cousin archie look upon thing a impossible perhaps be harry that must not wish why must wish be own cousin cousin indeed why must wish why must not wish be of anything to ought not to be anything to be nothing may marry archie if plea for will not set against lady clavering might a well tell to get one of star think can know sister when suppose match to be possible hermione shouted sir hugh shout be uttered in voice always caused lady clavering to tremble be coming said rising from chair set against harry then without waiting to hear further obeyed husband summons what mischief keep in there said seemed that thing have not be going well in larger room rector have stuck to review taking notice of sir hugh when entered seem to be very fond of book of sudden sir hugh have said after standing silent on rug for few minute yes be said rector just at present be quite new with then said sir hugh else be very much belied hugh said mr clavering rising slowly from chair often come into father house when do wish to be treated with respect be only person in parish that ever omits to do so bosh said sir hugh two girl sat cowering in seat poor florence must have begun to entertain uncomfortable idea of future connexion archie made frantic attempt to raise conversation with mr clavering about weather mr clavering paying attention to archie looked at husband with beseeching eye henry said allow to be angry pray what be use none on earth said returning to book use on earth worse than none in showing then be that sir hugh have made diversion by calling to wife wish 'd stay with not go off alone with one person in particular in way lady clavering looked round immediately saw that thing be unpleasant archie said will ring for tea archie did ring tea be brought cup be taken round almost in silence harry in meantime remained by thinking of what have heard from lady clavering archie clavering marry lady ongar marry julia be impossible must not bring even to think of such arrangement with equanimity be almost frantic with anger a thought of proposition to restore lady ongar to position in world repute have right to claim by marriage a must indeed be disgraced then said harry to knew that be impossible must see what must be nature of julia countenance if archie must ever get near enough to to make proposal archie indeed there be one for whom at moment entertained so thorough contempt a did for cousin archie clavering let hope that be dog in manger that feeling now entertained for poor archie must not have be roused against other possible suitor who might have be named a fitting husband for lady ongar lady ongar must be nothing to fear that be dog in manger that marriage contemplated for lady ongar by by others for must have be distasteful to unnaturally distasteful knew that lady ongar must be nothing to yet a came out of small room into larger room there be something sore about heart soreness be occasioned by thought that second marriage must be thought possible for lady ongar florence smiled on a went up to doubt whether must have smiled have known heart soon after mr clavering rose to return home having swallowed peace offering in shape of cup of tea though tea have quieted storm then on water there be true peace in rector breast shook hand cordially with lady clavering without animosity with archie then held out three finger to baronet baronet held out one finger nodded at other so parted harry who knew nothing of what have happened who be still thinking of lady ongar busied with florence be soon out of house walking down broad road from front door will never enter house again when know that hugh clavering be in said rector make rash assertion henry said wife hope be not rash make assertion said will never again enter house a nephew guest have borne

count be in league together league of must greatly disapprove anger have given place to new interest when learned direct from herself that have not seen count that be simply anxious that a friend must have interview with man have then become very eager in matter offering to subject to amount of inconvenience so that might effect that lady ongar asked of be not however called upon to endure special

concurrent circumstance have be have reached lady ongar in english reader must not however suppose that letter contained word be intended to support lover suit be very far indeed from spoke of count simply a friend eloquence went to show that nothing have passed must be construed by lady ongar a offering bar to fair friendship what world said bah did not know sophie did not friend know friend julie that world be great liar be not even now telling wicked venomous lie about friend julie why mind what world said seeing that world must not be brought to speak one word of truth world indeed bah lady ongar though be not a yet more than half a old a madame gordeloup knew what be about almost a well a lady knew what sophie gordeloup be doing lady ongar have known count sister in france italy having seen much of in one of sudden intimacy to english people be subject when abroad have be glad to see madame gordeloup in london much more glad than must have be have be received there on return by crowd of loving native friend not on account be prepared to shape conduct in accordance with friend sophie advice especially not so when advice have reference to sophie brother have therefore said very little in return to lady eloquence answering letter on matter very vaguely having purpose of own have begged that count pateroff might be asked to call upon harry clavering count pateroff did not feel to care very much about harry clavering wishing to do a be bidden did leave card in bloomsbury square why be lady ongar anxious that young man who be friend must see man who have be husband friend whose name have be mixed with own in so grievous manner have called harry friend might be that desired to give friend possible mean of testing truth of story have told reader perhaps will hardly have believed in lady ongar friendship will perhaps have believed friendship story if so reader will have done wrong will not have read character aright woman be not heartless because have once in one great epoch of life betrayed own heart be altogether false because have once lied altogether vile because have once taught that for one a rich be necessity might be that punishment of sin must meet with remission in world not on account must be presumed that there be place for repentance left to a walked alone through shrubbery at ongar park thought much of other path at clavering of walk in have not be alone thought of interview in garden when have explained to harry a have then thought so successfully that two being poor be not fit to love marry other have brooded over too during long hour of sad journey home to england be thinking of still when have met have be so cold to on platform of railway station when have sent away angry because have seemed to slight have thought of a have sat in london room telling terrible tale of married life while eye be fixed on head be resting on hand even then at moment be asking whether believed story whether within breast be saying that be vile false knew that have be false to that must have despised when with easy philosophy have made best of own mercenary perfidy have called jilt to face have be able to receive accusation with smile must now call something worse with louder voice within own bosom if must convince to accusation be not fairly subject might old thing come back again must walk with again look into eye a though only wanted command to show ready to be slave be widow have seen many thing even now have not reached six twentieth year apple at rich country seat have quickly become ash between teeth something of juice of fruit might yet reach palate if must come sit with at table a complained to herself of coldness of world thought that must not care how cold might be world if there might be one whom must love who must love have loved to in old day in day now seemed to to be very old have made confession of love old a be day must not be must still remember have loved only to none other have ever pretended love from none other have love be offered to between that wretched being to whom have sold who have be half dead before have seen there have be pretence of love harry clavering have loved harry clavering be man with quality valued also with foible saved from being too perfect for so slight creature a herself harry have be offended to quick have called jilt yet might be possible that must return to must not be supposed that since return to england have have one settled definite object before eye with regard to renewal of love there have be time in have thought that must go on with life have prepared for herself that must make contented if not happy with price have be paid to there be other time in spirit sank low within told that contentment be longer possible to looked at in glass found to be old haggard harry said be last man in world to sell for wealth when there be love remaining harry must never do a have done with not for wealth that woman ever inherited so told must link to one who have made vile tainted among woman in think did more than justice though may be that in other matter rated character too highly of florence burton have a yet heard nothing though have heard of may well be that must not on account have desisted such being thought hope have written to harry begging to see man who have followed knew not why from italy have told sister simply that must not do a be asked because be away from london alone in country house quite alone be sitting one morning counting up misery feeling that apple be in truth ash when servant came to telling that there be gentleman in hall desirous of seeing man have visitor card in hand before must read name blood have mounted into face a told that be harry clavering there be joy for moment at heart must not show not a yet have be four month widow must not have come to in country must see in way make understand must be very gentle with then eye fell upon card saw with grievous disappointment that bore name of count pateroff be not going to be caught in way let result be what might must not let sophie gordeloup sophie brother get better of by such ruse a tell gentleman with compliment said a handed back card regret greatly can see one now then servant went away sat wondering whether count must be able to make way into presence felt rather than knew that have reason to fear have be told of of have be false accusation brought against have contained one spark of truth there have be thing between lord ongar man must not care to have told openly in england though in conduct to have be customarily courteous on one occasion have be generous still feared must much rather that must have remained in italy though when alone in bolton street have in desolation welcomed sister sophie must have preferred that sophie must not have come to claiming to renew friendship with count must hold communion now even though must find way into room few minute passed before servant returned then brought note with a door opened lady ongar rose ready to leave room by passage took note read be a follows can not understand why must refuse to see feel aggrieved present purpose be to say few word to on private matter connected with paper belonged to lord ongar still hope that will admit p having read word while standing made effort to think what might be best course for to follow a for lord ongar paper did not believe in plea lord ongar must have have paper interesting to in such manner a to make desirous of seeing man of hearing of in private lord ongar though have nursed to hour of death earning price have be bitterest enemy though there have be something about count that have respected have known to be man of intrigue afraid of falsehood in intrigue dangerous man who might perhaps now again do generous thing one who must expect payment for generosity besides have not be named openly a lover wrote to therefore a follows lady ongar present compliment to count pateroff find to be out of power to see at present answer visitor took walked away from front door without showing disgust to servant by demeanour in countenance on evening received from long letter written at neighbouring inn expostulating with a to conduct towards saying in last line that be impossible now that must be stranger to other impossible that must be stranger said almost out loud why impossible know such

stranger room pateroff knew very well having often dined at beaufort said something a to private little dinner for two thereby apologizing for proposing to count to dine without other guest pateroff accepted invitation harry never having done thing before ordered dinner with much nervousness count be punctual two men introduced harry have expected to see handsome foreigner with black hair polished whisker probably hook nose forty year of age thereabouts so got up a to look not much more than thirty guest be by mean man of stamp excepting that count age be altogether uncertain correctness of guess on matter being possible by mean of appearance harry preconceived notion be wrong in point be fair man with broad fair face very light blue eye forehead be low broad wore whisker bore on lip heavy moustache be not grey perfectly white white be with year of course gave sign of age to face be well made active somewhat broad in shoulder though rather below middle height for certain ease of manner possessed accompanied by something of restlessness in eye one must have taken for englishman speech hardly betrayed that be not english harry knowing that be foreigner noticed now again little acquired distinctness of speech be hardly natural to native otherwise there be nothing in tongue to betray be sorry that must have have so much trouble said shaking hand with harry clavering declared that have incurred no trouble declared also that must be only too happy to have taken trouble in obeying behest from friend lady ongar have be pole a be count must not have forgotten to add that must have be equally willing to exert with view of making count acquaintance being simply young englishman be much too awkward for such courtesy a that count observed omission smiled bowed then spoke of weather said that london be magnificent city oh yes knew london well have known twenty year have be for fifteen year member of traveller liked everything english except hunting english hunting have found to be dull work liked shooting for hour two must not rival said intense energy of englishman who must work day with gun harder than plowman with plough englishman sported said a though more than bread a though honour wife soul depended on be very fine often wished that be englishman then shrugged shoulder harry be very anxious to commence conversation about lady ongar did not know how at first to introduce name count pateroff have come to at lady ongar request therefore a thought count must have be first to mention count seemed to be enjoying dinner without thought either of lady ongar of late husband at time have be down to ongar park on mission have be a know futile said word of to harry seemed to enjoy dinner thoroughly made very agreeable when wine be discussed told harry that certain vintage of moselle be very famous at beaufort harry ordered wine of course be delighted to give guest best of everything be little annoyed at finding that stranger knew club better than knew slowly count ate dinner enjoying morsel that took with thoughtful conscious pleasure young men never attain in eating drinking men a grow older so often forget to acquire count never forgot of own capacity for pleasure in thing made most of own resource to be rich be not to have one ten thousand year to be able to get out of one ten thousand pound shilling penny will give after fashion count be rich man sit after dinner here suppose said count when have completed elaborate washing of mouth moustache like club because who be stranger have so charming room for smoking be best club in london for men who belong to occurred to harry in smoking room there must be privacy three four men have already spoken to count showing that be well known giving notice a be that pateroff must become public man when once be placed in public circle to have given dinner to count to have spoken word to about lady ongar must be by mean satisfactory to harry feeling though a appeared might be sufficiently satisfactory to guest harry therefore suggested one bottle of claret count agreed expressing opinion that lafitte be unexceptional lafitte be ordered harry a filled glass considered way in subject must be introduced knew lord ongar think abroad lord ongar abroad oh yes very well for many year here in london at vienna very early in life at st petersburg knew lord ongar first in russia when be attached to embassy a frederic courton father lord courton be then alive a be also grandfather be nice good looking lad then a regard being nice

be ill at florence said count must have have terrible time with said harry count put up hand again shrugged shoulder then shook head knew be no longer adonis when married adonis did not expect adonis thought must have something of honour feeling of man found uncomfortable doubt did too much of know said count raising glass to lip did do with lafitte be be fault world knew for last ten year one knew better than hugh clavering said harry then stopped hardly knew what be that wished to learn from man though certainly did wish to learn something have thought that count must have talked about lady ongar florentine day did not seem disposed to do will have cigar now said count pateroff one moment if mind certainly certainly there be hurry will take more wine more wine take wine at dinner a saw want to ask one special question about lady ongar will say anything in favour that please be always ready to say anything in favour of lady if need be to swear anything against lady nobody ever heard say harry be sharp enough to perceive that assertion made under such stipulation be worse than nothing be a when man in denying truth of statement doe so with assurance on subject must consider justified in telling number of lie did not write book have right to ask question must say have not even if have pateroff be speaking of lady ongar in way harry hated for doing so want to say good of said evil certainly will say evil of think know that have be most cruelly treated well there be about seven thousand pound year think seven thousand year not franc pound poor foreigner lose ourselves in amazement when hear about english fortune seven thousand pound year for lady alone beau tiful house house so beautiful tell have to do with said harry whereupon count again shrugged shoulder what have to do with because man be rich be not justified in ill treating wife did not bring false accusation against in order that might rob after death of of think so much did not bear false witness

way into smoking room when there man of world separated from young friend of whose enthusiasm have perhaps have enough be soon engaged in conversation with sundry other men of own standing harry soon perceived that guest have further need of countenance went home to bloomsbury square by mean satisfied with new acquaintance on next day dined in onslow crescent with burton when there said nothing about lady ongar count pateroff be not aware that have special reason for being silent on subject made up mind that burton be people so far removed in sphere of life from lady ongar that subject must not be suitable in onslow crescent be lot in life to be concerned with people of two class did not at mean to say even to that liked ongar class better still a such be lot must take a came entertain subject of interest without commingling of one with of lady ongar early love have spoken to florence at length did not find necessary in letter to tell anything of count pateroff dinner at beaufort

up into thin wisp of paper lighting end of watched till shred of be burnt to ash if want said can come take a other men do be fearful attempt that have thought of making how must have looked in face again have answer to be refusal hour went by before took to bed during cruelly used maiden be waiting for half asleep in chamber above during time tried to bring to steady resolve must remain in london for coming month so that might come to if pleased must remain there even though be subject to daily attack of sophie gordeloup hardly knew why in part be afraid of sophie have done nothing of sophie knew secret have cause to tremble because sophie might be offended woman have seen in of saddest moment must indeed tell of indignity must have killed woman have borne have not disgraced in bearing of still be afraid of sophie felt that must not bring absolutely to dismiss friend from house nevertheless must remain because harry clavering be in london must come to there to house at ongar park must never go again unless went a wife place have become odious to bad a be solitude in london with sophie gordeloup to break perhaps with sophie brother to attack be not so bad a silent desolation of ongar park never again must go there unless went there in triumph a harry wife having so far resolved took at last to room dismissed drowsy phoebe to rest now reader must be asked to travel down at once into country that may see how florence burton passed same evening at clavering rectory be florence last night there on following morning be to return to father house at stratton florence have not a yet received unsatisfactory letter from harry be to arrive on following morning at present be a regarded letter under influence of one have be satisfactory in so especial degree not that coming letter one now on route be of nature to disturb comfort permanently to make in degree unhappy dear fellow must be careful be overworking even unsatisfactory letter must produce nothing worse than from now at moment of be writing be in paradise of happy thought visit to clavering have be in respect successful have be liked by one one in return have be liked by mr clavering have treated a though be daughter rector have made pretty present have kissed called child with fanny have formed friendship be to endure for ever let destiny separate how might dear fanny have have wonderful interview respecting fanny on very day be at moment disquieting mind because must not tell friend what have happened without breach of confidence have learned great deal at clavering though in most matter of learning be better instructed woman than be whom have met in general knowledge in intellect be fanny superior though fanny clavering be fool florence when came thither have lacked something living in such house have given to must rather say something have be given to of must greatly feel want if must be again taken from mother be a excellent woman a have ever sent forth family of daughter into world know that one ever objected to a being ignorant specially vulgar house in stratton be not like clavering rectory in little way of living florence burton have be clever enough to understand knew that sojourn under roof with woman a mr clavering must make fitter to be harry wife therefore when pressed to come again in autumn said that thought must must understand too harry be different in many thing from men who have married sister rejoiced that be so poor florence have be more like might have be safer for must return for moment to wonderful interview have be mentioned florence during sojourn at clavering have become intimate with mr saul a well a with fanny have given for time heartily to school matter have so far progressed with mr saul have on one occasion scolded soundly be great sign that think well of fanny have said be only sign ever gave before spoke to in sad strain on afternoon of last day at clavering have gone over to cumberly green with fanny to say farewell to child walked back by a fanny have not finished work when be still about mile from rectory met mr saul who be on way out to green knew must meet said so that might say good by yes indeed mr saul for be going in truth to morrow wish be staying wish be going to remain with having here be very pleasant do more good here perhaps than will elsewhere will not allow that forget have father mother yes will have husband soon not soon day perhaps if go well mean to be back here often before mean to be here in october just for little visit if mamma can spare miss burton said speaking in very serious tone tone be serious now adopted be more solemn than usual wish to consult on certain matter if can give five minute of time to consult mr saul yes miss burton be hard pressed at present know one else of whom can ask certain question if can not ask of think that will answer truly if answer at think must flatter tell untruth flatter how must flatter by telling must ask question first fanny clavering be dear friend now tell other everything know said florence doubting a to what might best say guessing something of be coming will have told perhaps that asked to be wife did ever tell that florence looked into face for few moment without answering not knowing how to answer question know that have told said can see that be so have told said florence why must not how must be with so many hour not tell that of must hardly fail to have remembrance often present with if be gone from here if be not before eye daily might be otherwise seeing a doe from day to day of course have spoken of to friend yes mr saul have told of now will tell whether may hope mr saul want to betray secret ask for advice can hope that will ever return love how be to answer with truth only with truth must say that think that have forgotten forgotten miss burton can not think that do believe that men woman can forget such thing a can ever forget brother do think people ever forget when have loved have not forgotten have not forgotten that walk have down lane together there be thing men never forget then paused for answer florence be by nature steady collected at once felt that be bound to be wary before gave answer have half fancied once twice that fanny thought more of mr saul than allowed even to know fanny when have spoken of impossibility of such marriage have always based impossibility on fact that people must not marry without mean of living reason to florence with prudence be not sufficient fanny might wait a also intended to wait latterly too fanny have declared more than once to florence conviction that mr saul passion have be momentary insanity have altogether passed away in declaration florence have half fancied that discovered tinge of regret if be so what be now to say to mr saul think then miss burton continued have chance of success ask question because if felt certain that be so quite certain must be wrong to remain here have be first only parish must not leave without bitter sorrow if be to remain here hopelessly must become unfit for work be becoming so will be better away why ask mr saul because think that can tell why not ask who can tell so truly a can do must not advise to do if be sure that must reject be what must advise will take advice miss burton now good by may god bless say will be here in autumn before autumn will probably have left clavering if so farewell will be for very long will always remember pleasant intercourse here then went on towards cumberly green florence a walked into vicarage ground be thinking that girl have ever be loved by more single hearted pure minded gentleman than mr saul a sat alone in bed room five six hour after interview felt regret that must leave clavering without word to fanny on subject mr saul have exacted promise of secrecy from be not man to exact such promise felt not le that must be betraying confidence to speak might even be that speaking on matter must do more harm than good sympathy be doubtless with mr saul must not therefore say that thought fanny ought to accept love must be best to say nothing of matter to allow mr saul to fight own battle then turned to own matter there found that everything be pleasant how good world have be to to give such lover a harry clavering owned with heart excellence of being in love when girl might be allowed to call man own must not make comparison between mr saul though knew that be making on point be hardly worthy of thought mr saul be plain uncouth with little be bright about except brightness of piety harry be like morning star looked walked spoke a though be something more godlike than common men very voice created joy ring of laughter be to florence a music of heaven what woman must not have loved harry clavering even julia brabazon creature so base that have sold to such thing a lord ongar for money title so grand in gait way so florence have be told that seemed to despise earth on trod even have loved then a florence thought of what julia brabazon might have have of what have lost wondered that there must be woman born so sadly vicious woman vice have given success joy great triumph be surely not for to deal hardly with fault of julia brabazon for who be enjoying blessing of fault have robbed other julia brabazon have be very good friend why have perfect lover come to to one so small so trifling so little in world account a given to treasure of love oh harry dear harry what must do for must be return good enough for such great goodness then took out last letter satisfactory letter letter have be declared to be perfect read read again did not want fanny one else to tell that be true honesty truth be written on line of face be to be heard in tone of voice must be seen in sentence came from hand dear harry dearest harry knew well that be true then also sat down wrote to on that last night beneath father roof wrote to when have nearly prepared herself for bed honestly out of full heart thanked for love there be need that must be coy with now for be own dear harry when think of that have done for in loving choosing for wife know can never pay owe such be two rival claimant

have asked to go up see madame have declined to do so pleading that be hurried be however driven to resolve that must go direct to sophie a otherwise must find mean of doing a have promised probably might put on scent of brother there have be reason why harry have not gone to bolton street though have not acknowledged to did not dare to trust with lady ongar feared that must be led on to betray to betray florence to throw at julia foot sacrifice honesty in spite of resolution to contrary felt when there a accustomed repentant dram drinker might feel when having resolved to abstain be called

be aware that in doing so be hardly obeying friend to letter a sort of operation must come rather under head of handling filly with light touch thought that must in way at rate do harm if must only remember instruction have received when in presence of trained mare be nearly three when found in bolton street having calculated that lady ongar might be more probably found at home then than at later hour when came to door instead of knocking passed by began to remember that have not yet made up mind by what mean must bring about that must certainly know that be there so took little turn up street away from piccadilly through narrow passage that there be in part by stable down into piccadilly again to bolton street during little tour have made up mind that must hardly become duty to teach that great lesson on occasion must undoubtedly be taught to know that be there not so taught on first visit that lesson must quickly precede offer although have almost hoped in interval between two of beaker of gin water on preceding evening that might ride race win altogether during very morning visit be about to make in cooler moment have begun to reflect that must hardly be practicable

separate can not feel for do said harry be cousin perhaps have be friend not especially have never pulled well together still pity deeply be not cousin know better than do harry will not feel much sorrow will be for heir not for son be man whose happiness doe not depend on life death of one like people a once liked think that ever loved human being will get over will simply wish that hermy may die that may marry wife harry know so well archie will marry now said harry yes if can get one to have there be very few men who ca get wife can fancy archie clavering to be one of have not humility enough to ask sort of girl who must be glad to take now with improved prospect will want royal princess something not much short of money rank blood might have done before will expect youth beauty wit now a well a other thing may marry after for be just man to walk out of church day with cookmaid under arm a wife perhaps may find something between princess cookmaid hope for sake may not neither princess cookmaid anything between have leave to marry to morrow lady ongar if have wish hugh must have house full of child of course be proper thing to say harry wo stand that from lady ongar what say mean one know that better than wo harry from whom then if not from come will do justice believe to be simple enough to wish anything of kind sort of castle in air build be not one to be have by inheritance to be taken by storm must fight for work for win in way off own bat lord ever sat prouder in castle than sit in that build from day to day in imagination sally forth do manner of magnificent deed help distressed damsel poor for instance attack enormous dragon will say that sophie gordeloup be latest dragon wish well to enemy such a hugh archie cut down enormous forest mean coming miracle a engineer then fall gloriously in love when be that last to be harry suppose according to precedent must be done with distressed damsel said fool that be harry no will take young fresh generous heart to better market than not that distressed damsel will ever remember what might once have be knew that be playing on edge of precipice that be fluttering a moth round candle knew that behoved now at once to tell tale a to stratton florence burton that if must tell now pang must be over danger gone did not tell instead of telling thought of lady ongar beauty of own early love of what might have be have not gone to stratton think thought if not of wealth yet of power place must have be be now open to to ask for hand when have declared that did not want cousin inheritance have spoken simple truth be not covetous of money be archie to marry a many wife a henry have a many child a priam must be offence to desire did not lie in line in other case woman before who must so willingly have endowed with that possessed have be loved by before have ever seen florence burton in love for florence so now told so told falsely have ever remembered that julia brabazon have be first love love whom have loved with heart thing have gone with most unfortunately with misfortune have never be paralleled be thus be thinking instead of remembering now be time in tale must be told lady ongar however soon carried away from actual brink of precipice how about dragon said rather about dragon brother at whom be bound to go tilt on behalf have tilted be recreant knight have tilted said dragon professes that will not regard a killed in other word declares that will see that will see said lady ongar a spoke there came angry spot on cheek doe send message a threat doe not send a threat think partly mean so will find harry will not see must force into presence will know how to punish outrage if sent message let know to tell truth be most unwilling to speak to at though be anxious to be civil to when have inquired for time in vain came to with man asked to dinner so went a there be four of of course must not speak to then still have other man foreigner colonel schmoff perhaps yes colonel schmoff kept colonel schmoff by so a to guard from being questioned be so like everything doe doe with design with little plan well harry might have ignored colonel schmoff for what must have cared got count to come out into room at last then be very angry with know talked of what must do to men who interfered with will not quarrel with harry promise that there will be nonsense of sort fighting oh be friend again very soon bade tell that there be something important for to say for to hear be concern of mine required interview believe harry said that have once be very courteous to yes once insolent once courteous have forgiven one for other then went on to say that made poor return for civility by shutting door in face that did not doubt must think better of when have heard message therefore said must call again that lady ongar be whole of will tell what intention be harry again face became red a asked question colour now came to cheek be rather that of shame than of anger what be intention to make believe that be in power to make think that have be lover to lower in eye so that might believe others have believed hugh clavering have pretended to believe have be object harry perhaps will tell what success have have lady ongar know old story that drop be ever dropping will wear stone after why must faith in be a hard even a stone do believe that what said have such effect be very hard to look into person heart dearer nearer that heart be to own greater think be difficulty know that man heart what call heart know yours for moment two clavering made answer then when did speak went back from to count if what surmise of be true must be very devil can not be man man devil what matter be be worst harry what be difference faust of day want mephistopheles to teach guile to harden heart believe that there be such men there may be one one harry be lord ongar what be cousin hugh what be count pateroff be not of same nature hard a stone desirous simply of indulging own appetite utterly without one generous feeling incapable even of idea of caring for one be not so in truth count be best of three have named with woman must stand better chance than with of others nevertheless if be motive be devil will be devil if say so will be anything please so long a have not made think evil of have not done that then care what have done what may do must not have see must asked with sudden energy throwing forward from seat with elbow on table resting face on hand a have already done more than once when have be there so that attitude became well be now customary in eye will hardly be guided by opinion in such matter by whose then will be guided nay harry since put to promise will make promise will be guided by opinion if bid see will do though own must be distressing to why must see if wish know reason in truth there be reason what say about lord ongar be simply part of scheme see what scheme be harry what be scheme simply must be frightened into becoming wife darling bosom friend sophie who a take have not quite managed to come to satisfactory term with brother have doubt price for assistance have be high have informed more than once that brother desire to do so much honour count perhaps think that can manage such bagatelle without aid from sister dearest sophie seems to feel that can do better with in widowed state than if be to take husband be so kind so affectionate be not at moment tea be brought in clavering sat for time silent with cup in hand meanwhile have resumed old position with face upon hand have abandoned when servant entered room be now sitting looking at a sipped tea with eye averted from can not understand at last said why must persist in intimacy with woman have not thought about harry must understand be think very easily understood know to be treacherous false vulgar covetous unprincipled can not like say be dragon dragon to said can not pretend that be lady yet put up with society exactly now tell what must have do must have part from how be so easy to say part be to bar door against when have given offence be to forget that did great service when sorely needed such service can tell to face that be thing that say of therefore will for future dispense with company do believe that people in world associate only with love esteem must not have one for intimate friend whom did not love esteem harry suppose that one loved esteemed that have home down at clavering with father admires mother worship sister think to be almost perfect comrade with whom can work with mutual regard emulation self confidence high hope of own power of choosing companion whom can esteem love suppose with be sophie gordeloup none how must be with then heart must have be made of stone if have not melted got up coming round to stood over julia said be not so with be so with julia said be truth how be better than why must not associate with better than a woman be pole asunder a dragon said smiling come together do mean that have one to love harry be just what do mean have none to love in playing card have won stake in money rank have lost amount ten time told in affection friendship that general unpronounced esteem creates fellowship of men woman in world have carriage horse be driven about with grand servant people a see whisper say be lady ongar whom nobody know can see in eye till fancy can hear word be false what be false be not false have deserved have done have made fitting companion for one a sophie gordeloup though have not done that perhaps people think paused again before spoke still standing near on rug lady ongar said nay harry not lady ongar when be together thus let feel have one friend who can dare to call by name from whose mouth will be pleased to hear name need not fear that will think that mean too much will not take a meaning what used to mean did not know how to go on with speech in truth what to say to florence burton be still present to mind from minute to minute told that must not become villain now have come to with that must have given that have in world that have never gone to stratton sat down by in silence looking away from at fire swearing to that must not become villain yet wishing almost wishing that have courage to throw honour overboard at last half turning round towards took hand rather took first by wrist till must posse of hand a did so touched hair cheek let hand drop till rested in julia said what can do to comfort did not answer looked away from a sat across table into vacancy julia said again be there anything

anything further at present moment knew that thing be not altogether right thing be by mean right have written neither to lady ongar to florence longer put off task more burdensome did become be now telling that must write to till got back to london on day before went there came to letter from stratton fanny be with when received observed that put into pocket without opening in pocket carried unopened day till be ashamed of own weakness at last almost in despair with broke seal forced to read there be nothing in need have alarmed contained hardly word be intended for rebuke wonder why must

according to cecilia be perfect must not write to then very often now when be away letter be only three line suppose be teaching not to be exacting if so will kiss rod like good child feel more because lesson have not come soon enough then went on in usual strain telling of what have done what have read what have thought there be suspicion in letter fear hint at jealousy must have further cause for jealousy one of two must be sacrificed be most fitting that julia must be sacrifice julia must be sacrificed julia still must not write to florence till have written to julia must not bring to send soft pretty loving word to one woman while other be still regarding a affianced lover be letter from florence morning fanny asked yes be have received mine know of course have if sent by post

suppose be to say that hated being cross be sure do be going away to morrow too have hardly said nice word to since have be home harry threw back into chair almost in despair be not enough hypocrite to say nice word when heart within be not at ease must not bring to pretend that thing be pleasant if be in trouble harry will not go on teasing be in trouble said can not help can not help one can help ask question oh harry be about money no have nothing to do with money have not really quarrelled with florence have not quarrelled with at will not answer more question fanny speak of to father mother will be over before long then if possible will tell harry be not going to fight with hugh fight with hugh not must mind be not fool enough for if wanted fighting done must do by deputy there be nothing of kind asked no more question on next morning returned to london on table found note at once knew to be from lady ongar have come only that afternoon come to at once at once be that note contained chapter xxiii cumberly lane without mud fanny clavering while be inquiring of brother about trouble have not be without trouble of own for day past have be aware almost aware that mr saul love be not among thing be past be not prepared to say that conviction on part be altogether unalloyed trouble that there might have be faint touch of sadness of silent melancholy about have be otherwise mr saul be undoubtedly trouble to mr saul with love in activity must be more troublesome than mr saul with love in abeyance must be madness in in fanny have said to herself very often have not shilling in world thought more in day of awkwardness of gait of rusty clothes abstracted manner for doings a clergyman admiration have become very great mother saw something of cautioned fanny demure manner deceived mr clavering oh mamma of course know that anything of kind must be impossible be sure doe not think of longer when have said mr clavering have believed that be all right reader must not suppose that fanny have be hypocrite there have be no hypocrisy in word to mother at moment conviction that mr saul love be not among past event have not reached a regarded herself be quite sincere when said that anything of kind must be impossible will be remembered that florence burton have advised mr saul to try again that mr saul have resolved that must do so resolving also must try in vain must leave clavering seek home be solemn earnest thoughtful man to whom matter a be phase of life very serious causing infinite present trouble nay causing tribulation to same extent capable of causing infinite joy from day to day went about work seeing amidst ministration almost daily never during day did say word to of love never since day in have plainly pleaded cause in muddy lane to one florence burton have since spoken of florence have certainly be true to trust notwithstanding fanny conviction be very strong florence have counselled mr saul to try again mr saul be prepared to make attempt be man who allowed to hing in hurry thought much of matter before must prepare to recur to subject doubting sometimes whether must be right to do so without first speaking to fanny father doubting afterwards whether might not best serve cause by asking assistance of fanny mother resolved at last that must depend on alone a to rector if suit to fanny be fault against mr clavering a fanny father that fault have be already committed mr saul must not admit to that be fault fancy that considered to have a gentleman right to address to lady with whom be thrown into close contact fancy that ignored want of worldly preparation never for moment attempting to place on footing with men who be richer than a world go brighter still feeling to be in way lower than if woman so lived a to show that thought line better than line be open to to ask such woman to join lot to if failed misfortune be misfortune a well knew be one be hard to bear a to mother though have learned to love mr clavering dearly appreciating kindness to around conduct to husband solicitude in parish genuine goodness still be averse to trust to for part of success though mr saul be knight though have nothing knightly about though be poor curate in very rusty clothes with manner strangely unfitted for much communion with outer world still have feeling that spoil desired to win must be won by own spear that triumph must lose glory if be not achieved by own prowess be coward either in such matter a in other when circumstance demanded that must speak must speak mind freely with manly vigour sometimes not without certain manly grace how did fanny know that be coming did know though have said nothing to beyond usual parish communication be often with in two school often returned with in sweet spring evening along lane led back to rectory from cumberly green often inspected with little amount of parish charity entry of penny collected from such parent a must pay have never reverted to other subject yet fanny knew that be coming when have questioned harry about trouble have be thinking also of own be now middle of may spring be giving way to early summer almost before spring have arrived be so think in latter year sharpness of march prolongs almost through april then while be still hoping for spring there fall upon suddenly bright dangerous delicious gleam of summer lane from cumberly green be no longer muddy fanny must go backwards forward between parsonage distant school without wading for feminine apparel be so unsuited one evening just a have finished work mr saul head appeared at school door asked whether be about to return home a soon a saw eye heard voice feared that day be come be prepared with new answer must only give answer that have given before have always told that be impossible a to other question about own heart such like have put such question away from a being unnecessary perhaps unseemly thing be impossible must therefore be put away out of thought a matter completed at end now time be come almost wished that have be more definite in own resolution yes mr saul have just done will walk with if will let then fanny spoke word of experienced wisdom to two three girl in order that might show to to to herself that be quite collected lingered in room for few minute be very wise very experienced be quite ready now mr saul so saying came forth upon green lane followed walked on in silence for little way then asked question about florence burton fanny told that have heard from stratton two day since that florence be well liked very much said mr saul so did be coming here again in autumn so will not be very long before see again how may be can not tell if see will be of more consequence will see of course be here in lane be with last wished good by did not tell of having parted with then not especially that remember ah must have remembered if have told be quite right not to tell fanny be now little confused so that must not exactly calculate what meant mr saul walked on by side for moment nothing be said after while recurred again to parting from florence asked advice on occasion gave clearly with clear purpose assured voice like person who will do that be sure then that be getting truth out of friend even if be simple negative refusal to give reply to question asked florence burton be always clear in what say have asked if thought that might venture to hope for more favourable answer if urged suit to again can not have said yes to mr saul can not have done so did not do so simply bade ask be right on matter there be one to whom can with propriety address to therefore now ask question may venture to have hope voice be so solemn there be so much of eager seriousness in face that fanny must not bring to answer with quickness answer be in mind be in truth how can ask to try to love man who have seventy pound year in world while have nothing there be something in demeanour something be almost grand in gravity made quite impossible that must speak to in tone having asked question waited for answer be well aware that longer delayed weaker became ground on be standing be quite impossible said at last if really be so if will say again that be so after hearing out to end will desist in case will desist leave leave clavering oh mr saul do that for papa sake because of parish must do much for father a to parish love well think can make understand how well love seems to that can never again have same feeling for place have for there be not house field green lane be not dear to be like first love with people first love will come so strongly that make renewal of passion impossible did not say that must be so with seemed to that intended that must so understand see why must leave clavering said if knew nature of regard for must see why must be so say that there ought to be such necessity if be strong there must be such need be weak weak in must not hold under such control a be wanted for work have to do when have spoken of love for place for parish there have be something of passion in language now in word spoke of of feeling for be calm reasonable tranquil talked of going away from a might have talked have change of air be declared necessary for health felt that be so be almost angry with of course must know what will be best for said yes know now what must do if such be to be answer have made up mind a to can not remain at clavering if be told that may never hope that will become wife mr saul well be listening before speak remember how important word will be to can not be all important a regard present happiness rest in world will be so of course know that nothing can say do will hurt beyond might help even to further greater bliss might help too in a also might help mr saul began again then feeling that must go on forced to utter word at time felt to be commonplace people can not marry without income mr fielding did not think of thing till have living assured to independently of might hope ventured for instant to glance at face saw that eye be glistening with wonderful brightness how can answer further be not that reason enough why thing must not be even discussed miss clavering be not reason enough if be to tell that must never love personally that must never regard with affection must be reason why must desist why must abandon hope here go away from clavering for ever nothing else can be reason enough being poor ought not to make throw aside if loved if be so that loved think must owe to say so let be ever so poor like le because be poor do like at can bring to love must make effort if have income a thought necessary if have such rich must teach to regard a whom be to love better than world beside call upon to answer that question truly if tell that must be so will not despair will not go away a said came to turn in road brought parsonage gate within view fanny knew that must leave there go in alone knew also that must say something further to before must thus escape did not wish to give assurance of positive indifference to still le did wish to tell that might hope must not be possible that engagement must be approved by father must bring to think that must be quite contented with lover such a mr saul when have first proposed to have almost ridiculed proposition in heart even now there be something in be almost ridiculous yet there be something in also that touched a being man be honest good true perhaps best truest man that have ever known must not bring to say to word must banish for ever from place loved so well if knew own heart well enough to answer must do so went on to say if say so will be content to wait own time must be better mr saul that must not think of more miss clavering must not be better not for for must prove to be utterly heartless be not heartless love dearly will not say that can not live without be one great hope a regard world must have at future day a own may be that be too prone to hope surely if be altogether beyond hope must have found word to tell so by time have now come to gateway paused a put trembling hand upon latch can not say more to now said then let be so miss clavering will not leave place till have said more than will speak truth to even though may offend have more of hope now than have ever have before more hope that may possibly learn to love in few day will ask again whether may be allowed to speak upon subject to father now will say farewell may god bless remember only earthly wish ambition be in hand then went on way towards own lodging entered parsonage garden by must now do how must carry must have gone to mother at once be not that must not resolve what word must speak to mother when mother must ask how regarded man in what way must answer question must not tell that loved mr saul yet if surely did not love if such love be impossible why have not said a much to however may declare that inclination to ridicule passion to think of a man who have right to love be gone for ever conceded to clearly that right knew that have exercised well knew that be good true honest recognized in also manly courage spirited resolution must not tell that be impossible that must love went up at last to room doubting unhappy ill at ease to have secret long kept from mother must make life unendurable to felt that in speaking to mother only one aspect of affair must be possible even though loved how must marry curate whose only income be seventy pound year chapter xxiv russian spy when baby died at clavering park somebody hinted that sir hugh must certainly quarrel with brother a soon a archie must become father of presumptive heir to title property that such must be case who best knew sir hugh must not doubt that archie must have of have be robbed must of be enough to make hate archie nevertheless at present time continued to instigate brother in matter of proposed marriage with lady ongar hugh a well a others felt that archie prospect be now improved that must demand hand of wealthy lady with more of seeming propriety than must have belonged to such proposition while poor child be living one must understand better than lady ongar who knew so well circumstance of family day after funeral two brother returned to london together spoke mind in railway carriage will be no good for to hang on about bolton street off on a though be girl of seventeen said be quite up to said archie must let know be there of course understand then why do thought meant to go to at once when be talking about before in london so did go to got on with very well too considering have be there long when woman came in did tell what have come about not exactly see doe do to pop at once to widow like ongar know have be dead six month one have to be little delicate in thing believe archie have better give up notion of being delicate tell what want at once plainly fairly may be sure that will not think of former husband if oh think about at who be woman say be there little frenchwoman sister of man sophie call sophie gordeloup be name be bosom friend sister of count yes sister woman for talking said ever so much about keeping down in country devil did what business be that of hers be julia doing well think so julia did say word about in fact know how came up never heard woman to talk ugly old hideous little creature two be always together if take care will find julia be married to count while be thinking about then archie began to consider whether might not a well tell brother of present scheme with reference to julia having discussed matter at great length with confidential friend captain boodle have come to conclusion that safest course must be to bribe madame gordeloup creep into julia favour by lady aid now on return to london be about at once to play game have already provided with fund for purpose parting with ready money be grievous thing to archie though in case misery must be somewhat palliated by feeling that be bona fide sporting transaction must be lessening odds against by judicious hedging of bet must stand to lose something always by horse mean to win doodle have said to archie have recognized propriety of remark have therefore with difficulty provided with fund be prepared to set about hedging operation a soon a must find madame gordeloup on return to london have already ascertained address through doodle have ascertained by unparalleled acuteness of friend that lady be russian spy must have be beautiful to have seen archie face when information be whispered into ear in private at club be a though have then be made acquainted with great turf secret unknown to sporting world in general ah said drawing long breath by george be same story have be told everywhere in london of little woman for last half dozen year whether truly untruly be not prepared to say have not hitherto reached archie clavering now on hearing felt that be becoming participator in deepest diplomatic secret of europe by george said be really respect for little woman rose thousand per cent be what be said doodle be doosed fine thing for know of course can make safe will be everything archie resolved at once that must use great advantage chance ingenuity of friend have thrown in way necessity of putting money in purse be sore grievance to occurred to that must be grand thing if must induce brother to help in special matter if must only make hugh see immense advantage of alliance with russian spy hugh must hardly avoid contributing to expense of course on understanding that such money be to be repaid when russian spy work have be brought to successful result russian spy there be in very sound of word something so charming that almost made archie in love with outlay female russian spy too sophie gordeloup certainly retained very few of charm of womanhood have presence a lady affected archie with special pleasure yet felt infinitely more pleased with affair than must have be have be man spy intrigue be deeper sense of delight in mysterious wickedness of thing be enhanced by additional spice be not given to man to employ service of political russian lady spy in love affair a thought of in bearing felt that be almost talleyrand at rate palmerston must tell brother if must represent matter in such light to brother a to induce hugh to produce fund for purchasing spy service whole thing must be complete with completeness have rarely be equalled doubted hugh be hard man hard unimaginative man might possibly altogether refuse to believe in russian spy hugh believed in little what saw usually kept very firm grasp upon money that madame gordeloup be always with julia archie said trying way a be before told plan of course will help brother view be not so sure of of foreign woman ai like other woman at go deeper doosed sight deeper into men pocket mean play deep game altogether what do suppose be now question archie asked in whisper bending head forward towards brother though there be one else in carriage with what be thief of kind probably have doubt be up to roguery be russian spy oh have heard of for last dozen year ugly old frenchwoman in london be russian spy according to what people say russian know how to use money better than if employ spy employ people who can spy something archie felt to be cruel very cruel said nothing further about brother be stupid pigheaded obstinate quite unfitted by nature for affair of intrigue be ala certain that brother must provide money for purpose a that now projected thinking of found consolation in reflection that hugh must not be participator with in great secret when must have bought russian spy doodle must rejoice together in privacy without third confederate triumvir might be very well archie also have heard of triumvir two be company three be none thus consoled when pigheaded brother expressed disbelief in russian spy there be nothing more said between in railway carriage a parted at door in

worth while will do work for must be careful do remember that archie shook head almost in anger then went home for night rest on next morning dressed in best presented at door in mount street exactly a clock struck twelve have idea that people be very punctilious a to time who must say that french ambassador might have appointment with madame gordeloup at past one perhaps emissary from pope have resolved that must not take left glove off hand have thrust note in under palm of glove thinking must get at easier from there must be wanted in moment than must do from waistcoat pocket knocked at door knowing that trembled a did so felt considerable relief when found to be alone in room to be shown knew that men conversant with intrigue always go to work with eye open therefore at once began to look about must not put money into convenient hiding place now at once there in one corner be spot in must seat upon sofa saw plainly enough a with eye of talleyrand mark thereon of constant sitting so seized moment to place chair suitable for cleared few inch on table near to for smoothing of bank note feeling while so employed that be doing great thing have almost made up mind to slip one note between page of book not with well defined plan a to utility of measure because seemed to be such diplomatic thing to do while grand idea be still flashing backwards forward across brain door opened found in presence of russian spy at once saw that russian spy be very dirty that wore nightcap liked better on account female russian spy must felt differ much in attire from other woman if possible must be arrayed in diamond pearl ear drop with a little else upon a might be failing that costume might be regarded a appropriate evening spy costume tumbled nightcap dirty white wrapper old cloth slipper objectionable stocking be just what must be ah said lady be captain clavering yes remember be captain clavering have honour of meeting at lady ongar now wish to consult on affair of great importance very well may consult will sit down there madame gordeloup indicated to chair just opposite to herself far removed from convenient spot archie have prepared for smoothing of bank note near to place now assigned to there be table whatever felt that must in position be so completely raked by fire of keen eye that must not be able to carry on battle upon good term in spite therefore of lady very plain instruction made attempt to take possession of chair have placed be ineffectual attempt for spy be very peremptory with there captain clavering there there will be best there then did a be bid seated a be quite out at sea with nothing ocean of carpet around with possibility of manipulating note except under raking fire of terribly sharp eye now said madame gordeloup can commence to consult be business ah what be business be now difficulty in discussing proper way of tendering bank note fear two captain have forgotten nicest point of whole negotiation how be to tell what be that wanted to do what that be to be required to do for behoved above thing not to be awkward that remembered how not to be awkward well said there be something almost of crossness in tone time doubt be valuable french ambassador might even now be coming well think madame gordeloup know brother sister in law lady ongar what julie of course know julie julie be dear friend so supposed be reason why have come to well well well lady ongar be person whom have known for long time for whom have great may say very deep regard ah yes what jointure have what park thousand thousand of pound so

live husband rich lord be dying in little room just inside know be very melancholy captain clavering when be looking at moon with hair dishevelled sophie put hand up to own dirty nightcap be just like magdalen yes just same just same exact strength of picture nature of comparison drawn be perhaps lost upon archie indeed sophie probably trusted more to tone of word than to idea contained tone be perfect felt that if anything must make talk must talk now dear say so have always admired very much madame gordeloup well french ambassador be probably in next street already if archie be to tell tale at must do now will keep secret if tell asked be ask that did ever hear of tell gentleman secret think not if have secret will trust will be good if will not trust will be good also of course

from position be debarred from attempting smoothing process began to work with right forefinger under glove on left hand what have got there said madame gordeloup looking at with eye captain clavering instantly discontinued work with finger became terribly confused voice on asking question have become very sharp seemed to that if brought out money in awkward barefaced way now seemed to be necessary

upon word will be most happy nothing on earth must give more pleasure fifty pound must give more pleasure just twice a much pleasure archie have begun to rejoice greatly at safe disposition of money to think how excellently well spy did business now there came upon suddenly idea spy perhaps might do business too well twenty pound in country go very little way be so rich said spy by george ai ai rich indeed mean to be with julie money oh ah yes ought to know madame gordeloup be now heir to family estate title yes poor little baby be dead in spite of pill powder daisy buttercup poor little

drop of perspiration standing on brow now desirous of getting out again into street promised that must come again on following day with required sum just for beginning now good morning captain clavering will do possible with julie julie be very fond of think have be right in coming here twenty pound be too little even for beginning mercenary wretch hungry greedy ill conditioned woman altogether of harpy breed a archie clavering looked into grey eye saw there greed hunger flesh crept upon bone must not succeed with julia how much must excellent lady cost a soon a be gone excellent lady made intolerable grimace shaking shrugging shoulder walking up down room with dirty wrapper held close round bah said bah a thought of heavy stupidity of late visitor shrugged shook again violently clutched up robe still more closely bah be intolerable to that man must be such fool even though be to make money by then that man must conceive to be possible that must become husband of woman with seven thousand pound year bah archie a walked away from mount street found difficult to create triumphant feeling within own bosom have be awkward slow embarrassed spy have be too much for be quite aware of be aware also that even sagacious doodle have be wrong there have at rate be necessity for making difficulty about money russian spy have known business too well to raise troublesome scruple on point that be very good at trade be prepared to acknowledge fear came upon that must find article too costly for own purpose remembered determined tone in have demanded fifty pound merely a further beginning then must not reflect how much have be said at interview about money about money for how very little have be said a to assistance to be given a to return to be made for money plan have be laid down time fixed facility for making love suggested to have simply paid over twenty pound be desired to bring fifty other fifty be to take to mount street on morrow what if be to require fifty pound day declare that must not stir in matter for le doodle doubt have told that first class russian spy did well work for be paid doubt if paid according to own tariff madame gordeloup must work well for tariff a be altogether beyond mean must be imperatively necessary that must come to distinct settlement with a to price twenty pound of course be gone must not be better that must come to final understanding with before gave further fifty then a thought of be aware that be too clever to allow to do a desired if went into room with fifty pound in pocket in glove indeed anywhere about person must have from let own resolution to make previous bargain be what might respect for woman rose almost to veneration with veneration be mixed strong feeling of fear in spite of did venture to triumph little when met doodle at club have employed russian spy have paid twenty pound be enrolled in corp of diplomatic mysterious personage who do work by mysterious agency did not tell doodle anything about glove way in money be taken from did say that be to see spy again to morrow that intended to take with present of fifty pound by george clavvy be going said doodle in voice be delightfully envious to ear of captain archie when heard that envious tone felt that be entitled to be triumphant chapter xxv what must men say of illustration harry tell truth tell truth harry clavering be thus greeted when in obedience to summons from lady ongar went to almost immediately on return to london will be remembered that have remained at clavering day after departure of hugh archie lacking courage to face misfortune boldly though delay have be cowardly have not be easy to to be coward despised for not having written with warm full expressed affection to florence with honest clear truth to julia misery rose from feeling of self abasement from consciousness that be weak piteously weak exactly in in have often boasted to that be strong such inward boasting be not altogether bad preserve men from succumbing make at rate attempt to realize man who tell that be brave will struggle much before fly man who never doe so tell will find flying easy unless heart be of nature very high now have come moment either for flying not flying harry swearing that must stand ground resolutely took hat glove made way to bolton street with sore heart a went must not keep from arguing matter within own breast knew what be duty be duty to stick to florence not only with word hand with heart be duty to tell lady ongar that not only word be at stratton heart also to ask pardon for wrong that have done by caress for ten minute a walked through street resolve be strong to do manifest duty gradually a thought of caress a thought of difficulty of coming interview a thought of julia high toned beauty perhaps something also of wealth birth more strongly still a thought of love for false treacherous selfish argument offered to mind argument knew to be false selfish of did love must be right for to give hand without heart must really be good for florence poor injured florence that must be taken by man who have ceased to regard more than other woman be to marry now must not that deceit be worse than other deceit rather must not that be deceitful whereas other course must simply be unfortunate unfortunate through circumstance for be blameless damnable argument false cowardly logic by male jilt seek to excuse own treachery to to others thus during second ten minute of walk line of conduct became le plain to a entered piccadilly be racked with doubt instead of settling in mind unconsciously allowed to dwell upon word with must seek to excuse treachery to florence thought how must tell not to face with spoken word for must not do with written skill that be unworthy of goodness that love for have fallen off through own unworthiness have returned to one who be in respect le perfect than who in old day a well knew have be first love yes must say julia let anger be what might must know that have said a planned there came to little comfort for thought there be something grand in resolution yes must do even though must lose julia also miserable clap trap knew in heart that logic be false argument baseless cease to love florence burton have not ceased to love be heart of man made so like weather cock that need must turn hither thither a wind directs be altogether beyond man control for harry with fault in spite of present falseness be man man cease to love without cause man need cease to love without cause man may maintain love nourish keep warm by honest manly effort a may probity courage honour be not that have ceased to love florence that glare of candle have be too bright for have scorched wing after a to embrace of have thought so much memory of be so sweet to so bitter have simply be accident thus writing in mind letter to florence knew if be honest man must never allow to write reached lady ongar door without having arranged for special line of conduct must return for moment to fact that hugh archie have returned to town before harry clavering how archie have be engaged on great doings reader hope will remember may a well be informed here that fifty pound be duly taken to mount street be extracted from by spy without much difficulty know archie in return obtained immediate aid valuable information from sophie gordeloup sophie did obtain information from found able to use for own purpose a position with reference to love marriage be being discussed position also of divine julia sophie hinted fear of clavering lover what did archie think of cousin harry why be engaged to girl said archie opening wide eye mouth becoming very free with information be matter to sophie found worth while to attend soon learned from archie archie knew about florence burton be must be known secret have be made in family of harry engagement archie told fair assistant miss burton have be received at clavering park openly a harry future wife by jove know ca be coming with julia after that know sophie made little grimace did not say much remembering that have caught lady ongar in harry arm thought that by jove might be coming with julia even after miss burton reception at clavering park then too remembered few word have passed between dear julia after harry departure on evening of embrace perceived that julia be in ignorance of very existence of florence burton even though florence have be received at park be information worth having information to be used respect for harry rose immeasurably have not given credit for so much audacity so much gallantry so much skill have thought to be pigheaded clavering like rest of be not pigheaded be promising young man must have liked perhaps aided only that have shown so strong determination to have nothing to do with therefore information must be used be used reader will now understand what be truth lady ongar demanded from harry clavering harry tell truth tell truth have come forward to meet in middle of room when spoke word stood looking in face not having given hand what truth said harry have ever told lie knew well what be truth required of lie can be acted a well a told harry tell at once who be florence burton who what knew then thing have settled for without necessity of action on part be odd enough that must not have learned before at rate knew now be well that must have be told only how be to excuse for embrace at rate speak to said standing quite erect looking a juno might have looked will acknowledge at least have right to ask question who be florence burton be daughter of mr burton of stratton be that that can tell come harry be braver than be not such coward once with be engaged to marry yes lady ongar be then have have revenge on now be quits so saying stepped back from middle of room sat down on accustomed seat be left there standing seemed a though intended to take further notice of might go if pleased there must be end of difficulty must be over might at once write to florence in what language liked must simply be little episode in life escape must not have be arduous must not go from in way must not bring to leave room without further word have spoken of revenge be not incumbent on to explain to that there have be no revenge that have loved suffered forgiven without one thought of anger that then have unfortunately loved again must not find word in to tell that have be light simply poor moth have burned wing lady ongar said there have be revenge will call justice if please at rate mean to complain if ever injured began did injure said sharply if ever injured forgave freely did injure a spoke rose again from seat showing how impossible to be that tranquillity have attempted to maintain did injure injury came to early in life sat lightly on within few month have learned to love young lady at place went to first young lady saw have not done much harm harry that have done can not be undone julia said coming up to not julia when be here before asked to call so hoping longing believing doing more so much more than must have done that thought love might now be of service to think that have heard of then oh be odd must not have known a now hear that be at sister house others have not be a silent a have be be quits harry be have to say be quits now have intended to be true to to to be true when acted a did other night must not explain to how greatly have be tempted be true when held in arm a woman came in have not made think that might glory in loving that might show scorned when thought to promise secrecy secrecy a though be ashamed of what have seen be not ashamed not then have world known must not have be ashamed have loved long ' must have said 'and only be to be husband now at last need not be ashamed ' so much spoke standing up looking at with firm face uttering syllable with quick clear voice at last word there came quiver in tone strength of countenance quailed there be tear made dim eye knew that must no longer stand before endeavoured to seat with composure attempt failed a fell back upon sofa just heard sob have cost so great vain effort to restrain in instant be kneeling at foot grasping at hand with be hiding face julia said look at let at rate understand other at last harry there must be no more such knowledge more such understanding must go from come here more have not be for other night must still have endeavoured to regard a friend have right to such friendship have sinned gone astray be thing vile polluted sold a beast be sold men have treated a treated have treated so yes harry how did treat when took in arm kissed knowing knowing be not to be wife o god have sinned have sinned be punished said rising from knee be not a say then how be sir be thus that treat other woman friend to whom declare friendship what did mean to think that loved yes with love must complete disgrace must finish degradation have not heard of florence burton harry night be so happy in bed in next week when be down there for sad ceremony be happy here happy proud yes harry be so proud when thought that still loved loved in spite of past sin that almost forgot be polluted have made remember will not forget again must have be better for have gone away at once now be sitting in chair sobbing violently pressing away tear from cheek with hand how must make understand that have intended no insult when embraced be not incumbent on to tell that wrong then did be done to florence burton not to agony be too much for at present must find word in to speak to said to myself that must come when funeral be over wept for poor hermy a thought that lot be so much happier than hers people have what deserve hermy who have done such wrong a have done be not crushed a be crushed be just harry that punishment must come from have come very heavily julia be not meant to be so well will let that pas can not unsay harry have said did not say must have thought known when be here last can not bid believe that love not more tenderly truly than love nay harry love to can be true tender will permit to be offered to think must rob that girl of what be hers mine for may be tender true ala truth have come to when can avail no longer julia if will say that love will avail in saying that be continuing to ill treat listen to now hardly know when began for at first did not expect that must forgive let be dear to a used to be a sat here looking up into face in old way came on gradually feeling that might be so told that if must take might be of service to thought that might forgive at last for possessing money if must throw into lap so that might thrive with in world said to myself that might be well to wait awhile till must see whether really loved then came that burst of passion though knew that be wrong be proud to feel be still so dear to be over understand other at last may go there be nothing to be forgiven between have now resolved that florence must go by board if julia must still take must be wife must face florence burton own family world in matter of treachery what must care what world might say treachery to florence be thing completed now at moment felt to be so devoted to julia a to make regard engagement to florence a one must at hazard be renounced thought of mother sorrow of father scorn of dismay with fanny must hear concerning tale must believe to be so impossible thought of theodore burton deep unquenchable anger of that brother be capable of cecilia outraged kindness thought of infamy must be attached to resolved that must bear even if own heart did not move so to act how must hinder from giving comfort happiness to woman who be before injury wrong broken hearted wretchedness must not prevent therefore part be a open to a other men must say that have done for lady ongar money indignation with be able to regard false accusation for mind declared such accusation to be damnably false gave comfort people might say of what pleased be about to do best within power bad ala be best be of avail now to think of julia said between at least there will be nothing to be forgiven there be nothing said there will be broken love be true to now a ever what then of truth to miss florence burton will not be for to rebuke with have of played game badly not for reason need be ruined broken hearted in folly thought that wealth be better than love in folly thought that one love blighted might be mended by when asked miss burton to be wife be wife of man now that be free again can not marry miss burton must marry harry there will be must in case know can not understand how good how perfect be be too good to take hand without heart what must men say of must bear what men say suppose

face averted from tell that will be wife must not say word be le selfish than be thinking be trying to think what might be best for above what might be best for speak to said acknowledge that wronged when thought that expression of love be insult to be easy to say speak what will say say that will be wife will not say rose again from chair took hand away from will not say go now think over that have done also will think of god help what evil come when evil have be done harry understand now at least will blame more go see florence burton if when see find that can love take to heart be true to will never hear reproach from go now go there be nothing more to be said paused moment a though be going to speak left room without word a went along passage turned on stair saw standing at door of room looking at seemed that eye be imploring to be true to in spite of word that have spoken will be true to said to be first that ever loved will be true to went out for hour two wandered about town hardly knowing whither step be taking there have be tragic seriousness in what have occurred to evening seemed to cover with care make feel that youth be gone from at former period of life ear must have tingled with pride to hear woman a lady ongar speak of love for in such term a have used there be room now for pride in bosom now at least thought nothing of wealth rank thought of a woman between whom there existed so strong passion a to make impossible that must marry even though duty plainly required grace graciousness of life be over love still remained to of that must make most others whom regarded must revile now must live for woman alone have said that have injured yes indeed have injured have robbed of high character of unclouded brow of self pride have so often told that be living life without reproach among men have brought to state in misery must be bedfellow disgrace companion still loved to love must be true a to florence burton how be to settle matter with letter for have be preparing word a went to bolton street before necessity for have become irrevocable did not now appear to to be very easy at rate did not attempt on night chapter xxvi man who dusted boot with handkerchief when florence burton have written three letter to harry without receiving word in reply to of began to be seriously unhappy last of letter received by after scene described in last chapter have be afraid to read still remained unopened in pocket florence though be unhappy be not even yet jealous fear did not lie in direction have naturally tendency to such uneasiness be ill thought if not ill in health then ill at ease trouble afflicted of must not bring to tell fact a thought of remembered own stubbornness on subject of marriage blamed in be not now with to comfort if such comfort must avail anything now must be stubborn longer when third letter brought reply wrote to sister in law mr burton confessing uneasiness begging for comfort surely cecilia must not see occasionally at rate have power of seeing theodore might do so a of course must be at office if anything ailed must cecilia tell truth cecilia when began to fear that something did ail did not find very easy to tell florence truth there be jealousy at stratton though florence be not jealous old mr burton have become alarmed be ready to tear eye out of harry clavering head if harry must be false to daughter be misfortune of with brood mr burton have a yet known nothing daughter of hers have be misused by man son of hers have ever misused one daughter child have gone out into world steadily prudently making brilliant marriage never falling into mistake heard of such misfortune around that young lady here have loved in vain that young lady there have be left to wear willow such sorrow have never visited roof be disposed to think perhaps to say that fault lay chiefly in imprudence of mother what if at last when work in line have be so nearly brought to successful close misery disappointment must come also upon lamb in such case mr burton may say be ewe who must not see lamb suffer without many bleatings considerable exercise of maternal energy tidings have come to mr burton have not a yet be allowed to reach florence ear in office at adelphi be one mr walliker who have younger brother now occupying that desk in mr burton office have belonged to harry clavering through bob walliker mr burton learned that harry did not come to office even when be known that have returned to london from clavering also learned at last that young men in office be connecting harry clavering name with of rich noble widow lady ongar then mr burton wrote to son theodore a florence have written to theodore wife mr burton though have loved harry dearly have perhaps in many respect liked better than of son in law have nevertheless felt misgiving from first florence be brighter better educated cleverer than elder sister therefore when have come to pas that be asked in marriage by man somewhat higher in rank softer in manner than who have married sister there have seemed to be reason for change mr burton have felt that be ground for apprehension high rank soft manner may not always belong to true heart at first be unwilling to hint caution even to herself at last a suspicion grew spoke word very frequently not only to herself also to husband why oh why have let into house man differing in mode of life from whom have known to be honest good how must gray hair be made to go in sorrow to grave if after old prudence old success last pet lamb must be returned to mother side ill used maimed blighted theodore burton when received mother letter have not seen harry since return from clavering have be inclined to be very angry with for long unannounced absence from office will do good have said to wife doe not know what real work mean anger turned to disgust a regarded harry almost to despair a regarded sister when harry have be week in town yet have not shown at adelphi at time theodore burton have heard word of lady ongar though clerk in office have that name daily in mouth can not go to theodore said wife be very easy to say go to replied if made business must of course go to doubt find if be determined to do so what more must do can lead horse to water can not make drink must speak to of florence be woman idea said husband when proper incentive to duty ambition have failed be to be brought into right way by mention of girl name may see cecilia urged yes if can catch advise to try after came two letter for husband wife of be shown to other then for first time did of receive idea lady ongar with fortune might be cause of misery to sister believe word of said cecilia whose cheek be burning half with shame half with anger harry have be pet with have already be taken so closely to heart a brother must not have suspected of kind of baseness said theodore very slowly be not base said cecilia may be idle foolish be not base must at rate go after now said theodore believe wo believe believe if must be true oh theodore think be true be not kind of weakness have seen in be weak vain must have said that be true be sure be true think so can not say more than think so will write to mother yes may ask florence to come up be not always better that people must be near to other when be engaged can ask if like doubt whether will come will come if think that anything be amiss with cecilia wrote immediately to florence pressing invitation in strongest term that must use tell whole truth said have not seen of course have troubled very greatly feel quite sure must come to if be here think must bring if other consideration doe so theodore imago that have become simply idle that be ashamed to show here because of that may be that have trouble with reference to own home of know nothing if have such trouble ought to be made aware of feel sure that must tell if be here much more said arguing in same way pressing florence to come to london mr burton did not at once send reply to mother wrote following note to harry adelphi may dear clavering have be sorry to notice continued absence from office cecilia have be very sorry that have discontinued coming to must not have written to on matter not wishing to interfere in own concern have not desired to see specially with reference to sister a have that to say to concerning can hardly write will make appointment with here at house if can not do will say when will find at home if will come dine with will like best leave to name early day to morrow next day day after very truly yours theodore burton when cecilia letter reached stratton post came without letter from harry poor florence heart sank low in bosom well dear said mr burton who watched daughter anxiously while be reading letter mr burton have not told florence of own letter to son now having received answer looked to obtain reply from daughter in law have sent cecilia want to go to london said florence be there anything matter that must go just now not exactly matter mamma can see letter mr burton read slowly felt sure that much be matter knew that cecilia must have written in strain only under influence of great alarm at first be disposed to think that must go to london be eager to know truth eager to utter loud maternal bleatings if wrong be threatened to lamb florence might go with longed to be on field of action felt that must almost annihilate man by word look who must dare to ill treat girl of hers well mamma what do think know yet dear will speak to papa before dinner a mr burton have be usually autocratic in management of own daughter florence be aware that mother simply required little time before made up mind be not want to go to london for pleasure of mamma know that dear yet merely to see though of course do long to see of course do why must cecilia be so very prudent think that will be better must not have pressed unless theodore have thought so too thought theodore must have written to writes so seldom expected letter from now a have written to about harry do mean well yes did not mention a be aware might make uneasy saw that be unhappy at not hearing

must always be regret sorrow remorse then there came upon letter from theodore burton knew that be necessary that must see writer nothing must be more disagreeable than interview must not allow to be guilty of cowardice of declining of personal quarrel with burton be not afraid felt indeed that might almost find relief in capability of being angry with one must positively make up mind before such interview must devote to florence to julia did not know how to abandon one other have allowed to be so governed by impulse that have pledged to lady ongar have sworn to that must be entirely hers be true have not taken altogether at word not le did know did think that knew that looked for performance of promise have be first that have sworn to love in dilemma did at last go to bolton street there

till have put hat upon head to go to adelphi time for taking hat soon came started on short journey even a walked must not think of be purposeless a ship without rudder telling that must only go a wind might direct how did hate for one weakness yet hardly made effort to overcome on one point only did seem to have resolve if burton attempted to use with anything like threat must instantly resent punctually at twelve walked into outer office be told that mr burton be in room halloa clavering said walliker who be standing with back to fire thought have lost for good here be come back again harry have always disliked man now hated worse than ever yes be here said for few minute believe need not trouble right old fellow said walliker then harry passed through into inner room be very glad to see harry said burton rising giving hand cordially to clavering be sorry to hear that have be in trouble be anything in can help hope mr burton be well said harry hesitating pretty well child quite well say be very bad fellow not to go see believe be bad fellow said harry sit down harry will be best to come at point at once will not be there anything wrong between florence what do mean by wrong must call very wrong hideously wrong if after have passed between there must now be doubt a to affection for other if such doubt be now to arise with must almost disown sister will never have to blush for think not thank god that hitherto there have be such blush among hope harry that heart may never have to bleed for come harry let tell at once like honest man hate subterfuge secret report have reached old people at home not florence mind that be untrue to florence be passing time with lady who be sister of cousin wife what right have to ask how pas time be unjust harry if simply tell that

girl that ever gave heart into man keeping will be there to worship to swear when back be turned that one who say word against will be brother sister friend of hers be man who have dusted boot with pocket handkerchief whom harry have regarded a being on account hardly fit to be friend knew that man be noble good generous true knew also that in that burton said simply did duty a brother not on account be easier for to reply say that will come to evening said burton even if have engagement put off have none said harry then say that will come to will be well harry understood of course that compliance with invitation must be taken a implying that be right must be so easy to accept invitation other answer be so difficult yet must not bring to tell lie burton said be in trouble what be

if will let come to evening will tell everything to to cecilia too will let come certainly will dine with after dinner when child be in bed then went leaving on mind of theodore burton impression that though something be much amiss mother have be wrong in fear respecting lady ongar chapter xxvii freshwater gate count pateroff sophie brother be man who when have taken thing in hand generally liked to carry through may perhaps be said that most men be of turn of mind count be think especially eager in respect a be not one who have many iron in fire who made many little effort great effort after thing altogether beyond reach be justified in expecting success a to archie courtship one who really knew man woman who knew anything of nature of woman in general must have predicted failure for even with doodle aid must not have chance in race when count pateroff entered for same prize who knew must not speak of failure a thing certain prize be too great not to be attempted by so very prudent gentleman be le impulsive in nature than sister did not open eye talk with watering mouth of seven thousand of pound year in quiet way have weighed calculated advantage to be gained have even ascertained at what rate must insure lady life have made certain that nothing in deed of lord ongar marriage settlement entailed pecuniary penalty on widow second marriage then have gone down a know to ongar park a have walked from lodge to house back again have looked around complacently told that place must do very well for english character in spite of pigheadedness of many englishman have a must have said much admiration thought that life of country gentleman with nice place of own with very nice place of own a be ongar park so very nice income must suit well in declining year have certain advantage certain aid towards object have come to from circumstance a indeed have also certain disadvantage knew lady be in much knew much of lady history have cognisance of saddest circumstance of life in creates intimacy be not necessary now to go back to scene have disfigured last month of lord ongar life reader will understand that what have then occurred gave count possible footing a suitor reader will also understand disadvantage have at time already shown in lady refusal to see count may be thought that sophie standing with lady ongar must be great advantage to brother doubt whether brother trusted honesty discretion of sister must have be willing to purchase such assistance a might give not in archie pleasant way with bank note hidden under glove by acknowledgment for service to be turned into solid remuneration when marriage must have taken place have not feared that sophie might communicate fact of such acknowledgment to other lady making own bargain in doing so have calculated have come to conclusion that have better make direct proposal to sophie when sophie made direct proposal to pointing out to in glowing language fine thing marriage must give have hardly vouchsafed to word of answer very well said sophie to herself very well then know what be about sophie must have kept lady ongar from marrying one have be able not even brother gratitude must be so serviceable to a generous kindness of devoted friend that might be able to sell service to lover also to keep julie from marrying be lucky combination of circumstance did not occur to till archie came to with money in glove complicated game be now playing be aware that harry clavering be great stumbling block in way woman even le clever than sophie must have perceived that lady ongar be violently attached to harry sophie when did see thought that there be nothing left for to make hay while sun be yet shining then heard story of florence burton again thought that fortune be on side told story of florence burton with what result know be quite sharp enough to perceive afterwards that tale have have intended effect even though julie have resolutely declined to speak of harry clavering of florence burton count pateroff have again called in bolton street have again be refused admittance be plain to to see by servant manner that be intended that must understand that be not to be admitted under such circumstance be necessary that must either abandon pursuit that must operate upon lady ongar through other feeling than personal regard for might perhaps have trusted much to own eloquence if must have seen how be man to be eloquent in wooing if can not see lady whom covets there be indeed penny post in day of legal restraint there be other method of approaching unwilling beauty forcible abduction be put end to a regard great britain ireland so count have resort to post letter be very long will not therefore be given to reader began by telling lady ongar that owed to for good service have done to read what might say to answer then gave various reason why must see pleading among other thing in language must understand though word be purposely a ambiguous a must be made that have possessed did posse power of doing grievous injury that have abstained hoped that might be able to abstain for future knew that word contained threat that taken literally be reverse of threat amounted to promise understood also that have intended to imply long a own letter be said nothing in a to suit confining to request that must see with letter sent enclosure longer than letter in wish be clearly explained enclosure purported to be expression of lord ongar wish on many subject a have be communicated to count pateroff in latter day of lord life a manuscript be altogether in count writing did not even pretend to have be subjected to lord ongar eye simply amounted to count own story of alleged conversation there might have be such conversation tenour might have be very different from count represented statement opinion if expressed at by lord ongar might have be expressed at time when statement opinion coming from must be of value a to conversation if must have be verified a having come from lord ongar mouth when be in full possession of such faculty a possessed must have amounted to nothing with lady ongar to lord ongar alive have owed obedience have be obedient to lord ongar dead owed obedience must not be obedient such must have be feeling a to document must have reached purporting to contain lord ongar wish document be of nature made specially antagonistic to exercise of such marital authority from grave be very long went into small detail detail be very small upshot of be tendering of great thanks to count pateroff expression of strong wish that count must marry widow o said that must be only thing for j name o said that must be safest course for own honour o said a took hand that in promising to take step gave great comfort o commissioned to speak to j in name to effect o be of course lord ongar j be of course julia be in french went on in same strain for many page lady ongar answered letter a follows lady ongar present compliment to count pateroff begs to return enclosed manuscript be to perfectly valueless lady ongar must still decline now more strongly than before to receive count pateroff bolton street may be quite firm a did have doubt at on matter did not feel that wanted to ask for advice did feel that count might still work additional woe that cup of sorrow might not even yet be full that be sadly sadly in want of love protection for aught knew count might publish whole statement people might believe that word came from husband that husband have understood what must be best for fame for honour whole thing be threat not to save from misery must have succumbed to menace still be possible that threat might be carried out be sorely in want of love protection at time when count letter reached harry have be with know what have passed between have bid go to florence love florence marry florence leave in desolation have be last command to know what such command mean have not be false in giving order have intended at moment glow of self sacrifice have be warm in bosom have resolved to do without wanted in order that might have when thought of afterwards in loneliness told that florence burton must not want harry love a wanted there must not be such need to girl who possessed father mother brother youth a there be to who have other arm on must lean besides of one man for whom have acknowledged love who have also declared passion for made scheme to deprive florence of lover in long hour of own solitude never revoked even within own bosom last word have said to harry clavering not le did hope that might come to again that might learn from that have freed from unfortunate engagement into falseness to have driven be after have answered count pateroff letter that resolved to go out of town for three four day for short time have be minded to go away altogether not to return till after autumn scheme gradually diminished fell away till determined that must come back after three four day then came to sophie devoted sophie sophie whom despised hated sophie of whom be so anxious to rid that in plan there be little under plot to effect sophie whom knew to be dishonest to in way might make dishonesty profitable before sophie have left sophie have engaged to go with dear friend to isle of wight a matter of course sophie be to be franked on expedition on such expedition sophies be always franked a matter of course sophie must travel with imaginable luxury matter to sophie be by mean indifferent though own private life be conducted with economy be not luxurious although good thing came in sophie way contrived to make appear that be devoting in manner be almost sacrificial to friend of bosom at same time lady ongar sent few word a message to count by sister lady ongar having told to madame gordeloup story of document have reached having described own answer be much commended by friend be quite right dear quite of course be fond of brother edouard have always be best of friend doe not make think ought to give to bah why must woman give away everything edouard be fine fellow what be fine fellow like to have money will tell from said lady

pleasant sound on long strand lay stretched in line from spot beneath out to point of island evening be warm almost transparent in clearness very quiet there be sound even of breeze when seated close upon margin of cliff heard small wave moving stone washed sound be a sound of little child voice very distant looking down must see through wonderful transparency of water pebble below be bright a diamond sand be burnished like gold tiny silent wavelet a moved up towards shore lost at last in own effort stretched whole length of strand such brightness on sea shore have never seen before have

strong affection with regarded kept promise said not word in answer to for more than hour walked side by side during greater part of time not syllable escaped from from moment to moment kept eye warily on fearing that might take by arm attempt violence with be too wise for too fully conscious that such proceeding on part must be of service to continued however to speak to word must not avoid hearing hoping rather than thinking that might at last frighten by description of evil be within power to do in acting thus showed that knew nothing of character be not woman whom prospect of evil must possibly frighten into distasteful marriage within few hundred yard of hotel there be fort at point path taken by lady ongar led into private ground of inn at be staying here count left raising hat a did so saying that hoped to see again before left island if do so said will be in presence of who can protect so parted chapter xxviii what cecilia burton did for sister in law illustration a soon a harry clavering have made promise to mr burton have declared that must be in onslow crescent same evening went away from office at adelphi feeling to be quite impossible that must recommence work there at moment even must ever be within power to do so did burton expect that must stay understood from what have passed much of harry trouble if not whole of though did not despair on behalf of sister be aware that lover have fallen into difficulty from must not extricate without great suffering much struggling burton be man who in spite of something cynical on surface of character believed well of mankind generally well also of men a individual even though harry have done amiss might be saved though harry conduct to florence might have be bad nay might have be false still a burton believed be too good to be cast aside spurned out of way without further attempt to save when clavering have left burton went back to work after while succeeded in riveting mind on paper before be hard struggle with did did not leave business till usual hour be past five when took down hat umbrella a fear dusted boot before passed out of office on to passage a went gave sundry direction to porter clerk a be wont then walked off intent upon usual exercise before must reach home have to determine on much with reference to florence harry before saw wife how be meeting of evening to take place in what way must be commenced if there be indispensable cause for anger in what way must show if necessity for vengeance how must sister be avenged there be nothing more difficult for man than redressing of injury done to woman who be very near to very dear to whole theory of christian meekness forgiveness becomes broken to piece fall to ground almost a absurd theory even at idea of such wrong what man ever forgave insult to wife injury to sister because have taught that to forgive trespass be religious duty without argument without moment thought man declares to that such trespass a be not included in general order what be to do thirty year since course be easy unless sinner be clergyman must in sort satisfy craving for revenge by taking pistol in hand having shot at offender that method be doubtless barbarous unreasonable be satisfactory sufficed what can do now thoughtful prudent painstaking man such a be theodore burton feel that be not given to to attack with fist to fly at enemy throat carry out purpose after manner of dog such one have probably something round heart tell that if so attacked must defend know that have aptitude for making such onslaught be conscious that such deed of arm must be unbecoming to in many perhaps in most of such case may if please have recourse to law aid that law can give be altogether distasteful to name of be so dear to must be kept quiet a grave under such misfortune not blazoned through ten thousand column for amusement of crowd there be nothing left for to spurn man not with foot with thought bitter consciousness to such spurning sinner will be indifferent old way be barbarous certainly unreasonable there be satisfaction in have be often wanting since use of pistol went out of fashion among passed through burton mind a walked home one must not have supposed to be man eager for bloodshed with wife whom deemed to be perfect with child who in eye be gracious a young god with daily work loved a good worker always do yet a thought of florence a thought of possibility of treachery on harry part regarded almost with dismay conclusion to be forced to come that there must be punishment might proclaim offender to world a false world must laugh at proclaimer shake hand with offender to sit together with such man on barrel of powder fight over handkerchief seemed to to be reasonable nay salutary under grievance there be sin felt god must punish with instant thunderbolt such sin a be of such nature florence pure good loving true totally void of suspicion faultless in heart a well a mind flower of burton flock have prospered so well that must be sacrificed through treachery of man who at best have scarcely be worthy of thought of be almost too much for gnashed teeth a went on way yet have not given up man though must not restrain from foreshadowing misery must result from such baseness yet told that must not condemn before condemnation be necessary harry clavering might not be good enough for florence what man be good enough for florence still if married harry thought must not make bad husband many man who be prone enough to escape from bond have undertaken to endure to escape from before be riveted be mild enough under endurance when be once fastened upon harry clavering be not of such nature that burton must tell that must be well that sister must escape even though way of escape must lie through fire water of outraged love harry clavering be gentleman that be clever that be by nature affectionate soft in manner tender of heart anxious to please good tempered of high ambition burton knew well partly recognized fact that harry have probably fallen into present fault more by accident than by design clavering be not skilled practiced deceiver at last a drew near to own door resolved on line of conduct must pursue must tell wife everything must receive harry alone be weary when reached home be little cross with fatigue good man a be be apt to be fretful on first moment of return to own house hot with walking tired with day labour in want of dinner wife understood well always bore with at such moment coming down to in dressing room behind back parlour ministering to want fear took advantage of goodness knowing at such moment must grumble scold without danger of contradiction institution be established cecilia never rebelled against traditional law on present day have much to say to even that must not say without few symptom of petulant weariness be afraid have have terrible long day said know what call terribly long find day terribly short have have harry with a told must well well say in one word dear that be all right if be so be not all right wonder what on earth men do to boot can never get pair hurt in walking at moment be standing over with slipper will have glass of sherry before dinner dear be so tired sherry what about harry mean to say if will listen will tell do mean to say then described to a well a must what have really taken place between harry clavering at office can not mean to be false if be coming here said wife doe not mean to be false be one of men who can be false without meaning who allow to drift away from anchor to be carried out into sea of misery trouble because be not careful in looking to tackle think that may still be held to right course therefore have begged to come here be sure that be right theodore be so good so affectionate made so much one of yes too easily by half be just danger look here cissy will tell mean to do will not see at rate not at first probably have better not see at will talk to by why not have always be great friend be man who can speak more openly to woman than to man what will say a to absence just truth tell that be remaining in dining room because think task will be easier with in absence have got into mess with woman with lady ongar yes not that name be mentioned between suppose be so horrible woman wicked wretched creature know nothing about a suppose do dear must have heard if have know have need not have believed be told that married old man who be now dead suppose want young husband dear if be cissy must say a little a might be about be old friend of harry jilted when be quite boy know that long before have seen florence be connected with through cousin let be ever so bad must drop that ca suppose theodore want even to mention name be told that nobody ever visit need be bit worse on account whenever hear that there be woman whom nobody visit always feel inclined to go pay respect to theodore how can say so that suppose be just what harry have done if world wife have visited lady ongar there must not have be trouble now mr burton of course undertook task husband assigned to though did so with much nervous trepidation many fear lest desired object must be lost through own maladroit management with there be at least doubt a to thing to be done hesitation a to desirability of securing harry clavering for burton faction everything in mind be to be forgiven to harry be to be received by with open arm loving caress if must only abandon lady ongar altogether to secure lover for florence be mr burton single simple object raised question now within own breast a to whether harry must make good husband such question a must have be asked answered before have be accepted at thing to be done now be to bring harry florence together since such terrible danger be intervening to make man wife with a little further delay a might be possible name of lady ongar be odious to when men went astray in matter of love be within power of cecilia burton heart to forgive must not pardon woman so sinned countess have once jilted harry be enough to secure condemnation since what terrible thing have be said of dear uncharitable cecilia burton be apt to think when evil be spoken of woman of woman whom did not know that there must not be smoke without fire now woman be widow with large fortune wanted husband what business have widow to want husband be so easy for wife to speak think after fashion when be satisfied with own venture be arranged that when harry came to door mr burton must go up alone to drawing room receive there remaining with husband in dining room till must come twice while sitting downstairs after cloth be gone ran upstairs with avowed purpose of going into nursery in truth that might see that room be comfortable that looked pretty that chair be so arranged a to be convenient two eldest child be with in parlour when started on second errand cissy reminded that baby must be asleep theodore who understood little manoeuvre smiled said nothing wife who in such matter be resolute went made further little change in furniture at last there came knock at door expected knock knock told something of hesitating unhappy mind of who have rapped mr burton started on business tell just simply why be there alone said husband be harry clavering cissy asked may go be harry clavering father said may not go indeed be time went somewhere else be harry clavering have not spent pleasant day since have left mr beilby office in morning now that have come to onslow crescent did not expect to spend pleasant evening when declare that a yet have not come to firm resolution fear that will be held a being too weak for role of hero even in such page a perhaps term have be so injurious to profession of novelist a two word hero heroine in spite of latitude be allowed to writer in putting own interpretation upon word something heroic be still expected whereas if attempt to paint from nature how little be heroic must describe how many young men subjected to temptation have befallen harry clavering how many young men whom delicate reader number among friend must have come out from unscathed man say delicate reader true man can love one woman one at time so say be so convinced conviction be ever more false when true man have loved with heart soul doe cease to love doe cleanse heart of passion when circumstance run against be forced to turn elsewhere for life companion be untrue a lover in doe not waste life in desolation because have be disappointed doe old love perish die away because have crept into heart first love if be true be ever there must meet after many year though head be gray cheek wrinkled there will still be touch of old passion a hand meet for moment methinks that love never dy unless be murdered by downright ill usage may be so murdered even ill usage will more often fail than succeed in enterprise how then must harry fail to love woman whom have loved first when returned to still young still beautiful told with charm flattery how heart stood towards be not to be thought that excuse altogether man though may love many must be devoted only to one man feeling to woman whom be to marry must be not from love only from chivalry from manhood from duty will be prepared always at hazard to defend from misadventure to struggle ever that may be happy to see that wind blow upon with needle severity that ravening wolf of misery will come near that path be swept clean for a clean a may be that roof tree be made firm upon rock there be much of be quite independent of love much of may be done without love be devotion be man owes to woman who have once promised to be wife have not forfeited right doubtless harry clavering must have remembered at first moment of weakness in lady ongar drawing room doubtless must have known at once that duty to florence made necessary that must declare engagement even though in doing so might have seemed to caution lady ongar on point on woman can endure caution fault be hers caution be needed no doubt must not have returned to bolton street must not have cozened by trusting to assurance of friendship must have kept warm love for woman to whom hand be owed not suffering to make comparison to injury must have be chivalric manly full of high duty must have be full also of love then must have be hero men a see be not often heroic a entered room saw mr burton at once then looked round quickly for husband harry said be so glad to see once again gave hand smiled on with sweet look used to make feel that be pleasant to be near took hand muttered word of greeting then looked round again for mr burton theodore be not here said thought better that must have little talk together said must like best so

after fashion must leave isle of wight on following morning early informing sophie why did so must offer money to little franco pole presuming that might not be agreeable to franco pole to be hurried

to pick up restore to pocket be improbable thought that madame gordeloup must leave to mercy of waiter chance be that note must go into pocket for be intended such be result sophie when be left alone got up from seat stood for moment on rug making calculation that lady ongar must be very angry about count pateroff presence sophie have expected have not expected that friend anger must be carried to such extremity that must pronounce sentence of banishment for life perhaps after might be well for sophie that such sentence must be carried out fool of woman with income park rank be going to give so said sophie to herself to young handsome proud pig of fellow so sophie called who have already shown to be sophie enemy who must certainly find place for sophie gordeloup within house might not be well that quarrel must be consummated now such compensation being obtained a might possibly be extracted sophie certainly knew good deal might be for convenience of future husband to keep dark convenient for future wife that future husband must not know term might be yet have although lady ongar have refused to pay anything beyond trumpery twenty pound term might be have indeed might be that lady ongar when anger be over might sue for reconciliation sophie idea occurred a sophie became little despondent after long calculation sophie might acknowledge to be wrong begging pardon weeping on friend neck perhaps might be worth while to make further calculation in bed then sophie softly drawing note towards a cat might have done hiding somewhere about person also went to room in morning lady ongar prepared for starting at eight o'clock a part of preparation have breakfast brought to upstairs when time be up descended to sitting room on way to carriage there found sophie also prepared for journey be going too will let go said sophie certainly said lady ongar proposed to to do so yesterday must not be so hard upon poor friend said sophie be said in hearing of lady ongar

adroit little woman contrived to get down upon knee on floor of carriage there say that be forgiven say that sophie be pardoned little woman have calculated that even must julie pardon julie must hardly condescend to ask for two ten pound note lady ongar have stoutly determined that there must be further intimacy have reflected that better occasion for quarrel must hardly be vouchsafed to than afforded by sophie treachery in bringing brother down to freshwater be too strong too much mistress of will to be cheated now out of advantage madame gordeloup attitude be absurd beg will get up never never till have pardoned sophie crouched still lower till be among dressing case little bag at bottom of carriage will not get up till say word dear forgive ' then fear will have uncomfortable drive luckily will be very short be only hour to yarmouth will kneel again on board packet on what call platform in railway carriage in street will kneel to julie everywhere till say beophie dear forgive '

preliminary dear fellow said speaking fear with scorn in voice where be that be what want to know where be just nowhere be true archie have received from madame gordeloup in return for last payment be intimation that immediate day must be at present named for renewal of personal attack upon countess that day might be named when must next come to mount street provision of course being made that must

assured friend that must certainly see madame gordeloup before week have passed over head on occasion of first visit to mount street sophie gordeloup be enjoying retreat in isle of wight when called second time be in bed fatigue of journey on previous day day on have actually risen at seven o'clock in morning having oppressed much have returned in cab alone have occupied much on same evening now that be to be parted from julie be needful that must be occupied wrote long letter to brother much more confidential than letter to have lately be telling how much have suffered on behalf describing

harry clavering engagement in letter described wretched wile by that horrid woman lady ongar be struggling to keep harry miss burton apart be very bad be true said diligent little woman have be seen in embrace know after that dressed went out into society society of have boasted a being open to to house of hanger on of embassy listened whispered laughed when old sinner joked with talked poetry to

that when captain boodle called next morning at twelve o'clock be still in bed have be in dear paris in dearer vienna must have not hindered from receiving visit in pigheaded london must not be done therefore when have duly scrutinized captain boodle card have learned from servant captain boodle desired to see on very particular business made appointment with for following day on following day at same hour doodle came be shown up into room have scrupulously avoided smartness of apparel calculating that newmarket costume must be of dress most efficacious in filling with idea of smartness whereas archie have probably injured much by polished leather boot general newness of clothing doodle therefore wore cut away coat coloured shirt with fogle round neck old brown trowsers fitted very tightly round leg be careful to take glove with be man with small bullet head who wore hair cut very short have other beard than slight appendage on lower chin certainly did posse considerable look of smartness when must knit brow nod head men be apt to think that be not easy to get on soft side of sophie on occasion be not arrayed with becoming negligence have graced appearance when captain clavering have called knew that visitor be coming questionably white wrapper have be exchanged for ordinary dress be regretted rather than otherwise by captain boodle who have received from archie description of lady appearance who have be anxious to see spy in proper peculiar habiliment must be remembered that sophie knew nothing of present visitor be altogether unaware that be in way

title somewhat equivalent to foreign count unfortunate in respect that be easily adopted by many whose claim to be very slight archie clavering with polished leather boot have looked like captain have come up to idea of captain man more regarded stronger in mind became idea of housebreaker business ma'be be of very delicate nature of nature very delicate indeed think that who understand world may soon come to understand other oh understand world very well sir go on now ma'be money be money know goose be goose what of yes goose be goose people be not goose nobody ma'be must think of calling

indeed a burton though with much smaller salary inferior work position have be accorded to of course through burton interest be understood that if chose to make useful must rise in business a theodore have risen must only do so a one of burton for last three month have declined to take salary alleging private affair have kept away from office be to hand of theodore burton that such matter came for management therefore there have be necessity for further explanation harry clavering must of course leave house there must be end of in record of burton family must have come made mark terrible mark must have passed on whom have bruised by cruelty knocked over by treachery must get to foot again a best must say a little a might be of fall there be knave in world one can suppose that have special right to be exempted from knavery because be honest be on honest that knave prey be burton theory in matter must learn from cecilia how florence be bearing to florence must say little nothing if bore with patience dignity a believed must calamity have befallen must write to mother old people at stratton must not be left in dark a to what be going on must write to mother unless must learn from wife that florence have communicated to at home fact of harry iniquity asked question a to on first night on following morning went off having simply be told that florence have seen harry letter that knew that be carrying like angel not like angel hope said theodore let alone for day two said cecilia of course must have few day to think of need hardly tell that will never have to be ashamed of sister

come to onslow terrace with possibility of becoming once more old harry clavering whom be to love burton must by mean give up hope be useless to say anything to florence still hoped that good might come then a thought of project came into head ala ala be not too late with project why have not thought of on tuesday early on wednesday when might possibly have be executed be project must have kept secret from husband of must by mean have approved a remembered told that perhaps be a well that thing must take own course without such interference a have contemplated on thursday morning there came to letter in strange hand be from clavering from harry mother mr clavering wrote a said at son request to say that be confined to bed must not be in london a soon a expected mr burton be not to

summoned harry to parsonage have be from mother have begged to come to clavering at once a trouble have come upon from unexpected source father have quarrelled with mr saul rector curate have have interview in there have be high word mr clavering have refused to see mr saul again fanny also be in great trouble parish be a be in hot water mr clavering thought that harry have better run down to clavering see mr saul harry not unwillingly acceded to mother request much wondering at source of new misfortune a to fanny a believed have held out encouragement to mr saul overture when mr saul have proposed to making that first offer of harry have be aware nothing must have be more steadfast than rejection of gentleman hand harry have regarded mr saul a little le than mad to think of thing thinking of a man very different in way feeling from other men have believed that might go on at clavering comfortably a curate in spite of little accident appeared however that be not going on comfortably harry when left london must not quite imagine how such violent discomfort must have arisen that rector curate must be unable to meet other if reader will allow will go back little explain reader already know what fanny brother did not know namely that mr saul have pressed suit again have pressed very strongly also know that fanny reception of second offer be very different from reception of first have begun to doubt to doubt whether first judgment a to mr saul character have not be unjust to doubt whether in addressing be not right seeing that love for be so strong to doubt whether did not like better than have thought did to doubt whether engagement with penniless curate be in truth position utterly to be reprehended avoided young penniless curate must love somebody a well a young beneficed vicar rector then mr saul pleaded cause so well did not at once speak to mother on matter fact that have secret made very wretched have left mr saul in doubt giving answer have said that must ask again in few day what be to be fate hardly knew how to tell mother of till have told be own wish thoroughly desired to have mother in confidence promised that must be so before mr saul renewed suit be man who be never hurried impatient in doings fanny put off interview with mother put off own final resolution till be too late mr saul came upon again when be ill prepared for woman when doubt whether love doe not love be inclined five part out of six towards man of whom be thinking when woman doubt be lost cynic say simply assert being cynic that when woman doubt be won more fanny thought of mr saul more felt that be not man for have first taken that be of larger dimension a regarded spirit manhood heart better entitled to woman love must not tell that be attached to in argument with against rested objection mainly on fact that have seventy pound year then threatened attack attack be to be final came upon before be prepared for have be together a usual during intervening time be indeed impossible that must not be together since have first begun to doubt about mr saul have be more diligent than heretofore in visiting poor in attending to school a though be recognizing duty must specially be hers if be to marry one a thus have be brought together more than ever mother have seen seeing have trembled have not thought wise to say anything till fanny must speak fanny be very good very prudent must not be that fanny must know how impossible must be such marriage a to rector have suspicion on matter saul have made as on one occasion there have be end of a curate saul be invaluable therefore fact of having made as have be forgiven be thus that rector looked at be hardly more than ten day since last walk in cumberly lane when mr saul renewed attack did again on same spot at same hour of day twice week always on same day be in chapel up at end of parish on day must always find fanny on way home when put head in at little school door asked for mind misgave have not walked home with since though have be in school with often have always left there going about own business a though be by mean desirous of company now time have come fanny felt that be not prepared took up hat went out to knowing that there be escape miss clavering said have thought of what be saying to to made answer merely played with point of parasol held in hand can not have thought of continued must not dismiss altogether from thought have thought about of course said what doe mind say rather what doe heart say must speak must sooner hear heart first be sure mr saul that be quite impossible in what way impossible papa must not allow have asked oh dear mr clavering fanny blushed a remembered how have permitted day to go by without asking mother counsel have spoken to one why must when knew that be impossible may speak to mr clavering to fanny made immediate answer then mr saul urged question again may speak to father fanny felt that be assenting even in did not answer such question by immediate refusal of permission yet did not mean to assent miss clavering said if regard with affection have right to refuse request tell so boldly if feel for that love must enable to accept a husband be duty to tell so duty to to to god fanny did not quite see thing in light yet did not wish to contradict at moment forgot that in order to put on perfectly firm ground must have gone back to first hypothesis assured that did not feel such regard for mr saul whose intellect be more acute took advantage of here chose to believe that matter of affection be now conceded to knew what be doing well be open to charge of jesuitry mr saul said fanny with grave prudence can not be right for people to marry when have nothing to live upon when have shown so plainly that have other piece left on board to play than game may be said to have be won on side if be sole objection said can not think right that father must discus to made reply walked along lane for considerable way in silence mr saul must have be glad to have have interview over now feeling at future meeting must have stronger power of assuming position of accepted lover than must do now man must have desired to get from lip decided word of love to take hand perhaps to feel response from to go further than a be not unlikely plead for happy indulgence of accepted lover mr saul abstained be wise in abstaining have not so far committed that might even now have drawn back have pressed too hard for hand pressing titillation of love making mr saul be not adapted be man who having once loved must love on to end way however be too long to be completed without further speech fanny a walked be struggling to find word by might still hold ground word be not forthcoming seemed to herself that be being carried away by man because have suddenly lost remembrance of negative more struggled more failed at last gave up in despair let mr saul say what must be impossible that must be married argument about duty be nonsense must not be duty to marry man who must have to starve in attempt to keep wished have told at first that did not love seemed to be too late now moment that be in house must go to mother tell everything miss clavering said will see father to morrow ejaculated will certainly do so in event will either tell must leave parish explaining to why must go will ask to let remain here

at rate understand love with heart strength if thing prosper with prosperity will be for if there be prosperity for will be only consolation in world be alpha omega first last beginning end everything then turned away left there have come no negative from lip a far a lip be concerned negative be longer possible to went into house knowing that must at once seek mother allowed first to remain for half hour in own bedroom preparing word that must use interview knew must be difficult much more difficult than must have be before last walk with mr saul worst of be that must not quite make up mind a to what be that wished to say waited till must hear mother step on stair at last mr clavering came up to dress then fanny following quickly into bedroom abruptly began mamma said want to speak to very much well dear must be in hurry mamma mr clavering looked at watch declaring that still wanted three quarter of hour to dinner promised that must not be very much in hurry mamma mr saul have be

of have ever told so have never told so mamma be fond of to question fanny made answer now mr clavering knew felt inclination to scold daughter even to point out in very strong language how foolish fanny have be in allowing man to engage affection merely by asking for thing be misfortune must have be avoided by departure of mr saul from parish after first declaration of love have be allowed to remain for sake of rector comfort best must now be made of mr saul must now go be certain fanny must endure weariness of attachment with absent lover to father must not consent be very bad mr

made to mr clavering fanny more often than to rector on occasion rang bell asked for mr clavering be shown into rector so called study in way that maid servant felt to be unusual rector be sitting uncomfortably prepared for visit not having have after breakfast cigar have be induced to declare that be not must not be angry with fanny mr saul be left to such indignation a thought incumbent on to express in opinion marriage be impossible not only because there be money because mr saul be mr saul because fanny clavering be fanny clavering mr saul be gentleman be must be said of there be class of country clergyman in england of whom mr clavering be one son in law mr fielding be so closely allied to squirearchy a to posse double identity such clergyman be not only clergyman be country gentleman also mr clavering regarded clergyman of class of country gentleman class a being quite distinct from others a being may say very much higher than others without reference to money question when meeting brother rector vicar have quite different tone in addressing a might belong to class to there be offence in clerical country gentleman understood a though there be secret sign shibboleth between outsider have complaint to make of arrogance did not feel aggrieved hardly knew that there be inner clerical familiarity to be not admitted now that there be young curate from outer circle demanding mr clavering daughter in marriage that without shilling in pocket mr clavering felt that eye of offender must be opened nuisance to be very great opening of mr saul eye be duty from must not shrink got up when curate entered greeted curate a though be unaware of purpose of present visit whole burden of story be to be thrown upon mr saul that gentleman be not long in casting burden from shoulder mr clavering said have come to ask permission to be suitor for daughter hand rector be almost taken aback by abruptness of request quite impossible mr saul said quite impossible be told by mr clavering that be speaking to fanny again about yesterday must say that think have be behaving very badly in what way have behaved badly in endeavouring to gain affection behind back mr clavering how otherwise must gain how otherwise doe man gain woman love if mean look here mr saul think that there be necessity for argument between on point that can not marry miss clavering be so self evident that doe not require to be discussed if there be nothing else against of have got penny have not seen daughter since heard of madness hear out if please sir since heard of madness mother tell that be quite aware of fact coming to with proposition be absurdity if be nothing worse now must do one of two thing mr saul must either promise that will be at end altogether must leave parish certainly will not promise that hope a regard daughter will be at end then mr saul sooner go better dark cloud came across mr saul brow a heard last word be way in must send away groom if have offended said wish to be unnecessarily harsh said mr clavering what say to now say to not a curate a to most unwarranted suitor for daughter hand of course can not turn out of parish at day notice know well enough feeling a gentleman ought to make aware that must go at once be to be only answer what answer did expect have be thinking so much lately of answer might get from daughter have not made other calculation perhaps have right to expect other than that have now given of course have not now ask again to give up will not do that certainly then mr saul must go inconvenient a will be to myself terribly inconvenient must ask to go at once of course can not allow to meet daughter more a long a remain will be debarred from going to school will be debarred from coming here if say will not seek her at school will not have be out of question that must remain in parish ought to feel mr clavering going mean instant going be matter of have not yet thought must consider before give answer ought to require consideration said mr clavering rising from chair none at not moment heaven earth why what did suppose be to live upon wo discus will not say one more word upon subject be so distasteful to must excuse if leave mr saul then departed from interview have arisen that state of thing in parish have induced mr clavering to call harry to assistance rector have become more energetic on subject than of have expected did not actually forbid wife to see mr saul did say that mr saul must not come to rectory then there arose question a to sunday service yet mr clavering must have intercourse with curate must have intercourse with unless must fix immediate day for going else promise that must think more of fanny hitherto have done neither therefore mr clavering have sent for son chapter xxxiv mr saul abode illustration when harry clavering left london be not well though did not care to tell that be ill have be so harassed by position be so ashamed of a yet so unable to see escape from misery that be sore with fatigue almost worn out with trouble on arrival at parsonage mother at once asked if be ill received petulant denial with ill satisfied countenance that there be something wrong between florence suspected at present moment be not disposed to inquire into matter harry love affair have for great interest fanny love affair at present moment be paramount in bosom fanny indeed have become very troublesome since mr saul visit to father on evening of conversation with mother on following morning fanny have carried with bravery mr clavering have be disposed to think that daughter heart be not wounded deeply have admitted impossibility of marriage with mr saul have never insisted on strength of attachment sooner be told that mr saul have be banished from house than took upon to mope in most love lorn fashion behaved a though be victim of absorbing passion between father word on subject have be spoken even to mother be silent respectful subdued a becomes daughter to be who be hardly used when be in love now mr clavering felt that in daughter be not treating well mean to say that care for harry said to mother when be alone on evening of arrival yes care for certainly a far a can tell care for very much be oddest thing ever knew in life must have said be last man in world for success of kind one never can tell harry see be very good young man girl fall in love with men because be good mother hope do for other thing together have got none of other thing what pity be that be let to stay here after first made fool of be too late to think of now harry of course ca marry must have nothing to live on must say that have prospect of living ca conceive how man can do wicked thing said harry moralizing forgetting for moment own sin coming into house like in such position then undermining girl affection when must know that be quite out of question that must marry call downright wicked be treachery of worst sort coming from clergyman be of course more to be condemned sha be slow to tell mind will gain nothing by quarrelling with how can help if be to see at mean must not be rough with great thing be to make feel that must go away a soon a possible renounce idea of seeing fanny again see father will have conversation with at be so disagreeable about service will have to meet in vestry room on sunday wo speak will not that be terrible anything will be better than that must remain here what will father do for curate ca do anything till know when mr saul will go talk of taking service must do mother must not think of however will see saul first thing to morrow next day be tuesday harry proposed to leave rectory at ten o'clock for mr saul lodging before did so have few word with father who professed even deeper animosity against mr saul than son after that said will believe that girl may fall in love with man people say manner of thing about folly of girl nothing nothing short of must have convinced that be possible that fanny must have be fool ape of fellow not made like man with thin hatchet face unwholesome stubbly chin good heaven have talked into be such as a far a know ca say bo to goose there think be perhaps wrong upon word have never be able to get word from except about parish be most uncompanionable fellow there be edward fielding be a active clergyman a saul edward fielding have something to say for saul be cleverer man than edward be cleverness be of different sort be of sort be very invisible to what doe that matter have got shilling when be curate did think of doing such thing a mr clavering have only be curate for twelve month during time have become engaged to present wife with consent of one concerned clergyman be gentleman then know what church will come to indeed after harry went away upon mission what farce be that must be engaged to make affair of other people when own affair be so very crooked a walked up to old farmhouse in mr saul be living thought of acknowledged to that must hardly make in earnest about sister affair because of own trouble tried to fill with proper feeling of dignified wrath high paternal indignation against poor curate under at back of in front of there be ever present to own position did wish to escape from lady ongar if so how be to do if did not escape from lady ongar how be ever to hold up head again have sent note to mr saul on previous evening giving notice of intended visit have received answer in curate have promised that must be at home have never before be in mr saul room a entered felt more strongly than ever how incongruous be idea of mr saul a suitor to sister claverings have always have thing comfortable around be people who have ever lived on brussels carpet have seated in capacious chair ormolu damask hanging sevres china be not familiar to have never lacked anything be needed for comfort of first class clerical world mr saul in abode boasted few comfort inhabited big bed room in there be vast fireplace very small grate grate being very much more modern than fireplace there be small rag of carpet near hearth on stood large deal table table made of unalloyed deal without mendacious paint putting forward pretence in direction of mahogany one wooden windsor arm chair very comfortable in way be appropriated to use of mr saul two other small wooden chair flanked other side of fireplace in one distant corner stood mr saul small bed in distant corner stood small dressing table against wall stood rickety deal press in kept clothes other furniture there be none one of large window facing towards farmyard have be permanently closed in wide embrasure be placed portion of mr saul library book have brought with from college on ground under closed window be arranged others making long row stretched from bed to dressing table very pervious fear to attack of mouse big table near fireplace be covered with book paper ala with dust for have fallen into terrible habit prevails among bachelor of allowing work to remain ever open never finished always confused with paper above book book above paper looking a though useful product must ever be made to come forth from such chaotic element there mr saul composed sermon studied bible followed up doubt special darling pursuit ambition dictated there did not eat meal have be made impossible by pile of paper dust chop therefore broiled rasher bit of pig fry be deposited for on little dressing table there consumed such be solitary apartment of gentleman who now aspired to hand of miss clavering for accommodation including attendance paid reasonable sum of l per annum then have l left with to feed clothe like gentleman duty somewhat neglected perform charity harry clavering a looked around felt almost ashamed of sister wall be whitewashed stained in many place floor in middle of room seemed to be very rotten what young man who have dwelt ever in comfort must like house for sister mr saul however came forward with mark of visible shame on face greeted visitor frankly with open hand came down from london yesterday suppose said mr saul just so said harry take seat mr saul suggested arm chair harry contented with one of others hope mr clavering be well quite well said harry cheerfully father sister quite well thank said harry very stiffly must have come down to at rectory said mr saul instead of bringing up here only a have heard doubt father have unfortunately have difference mr saul said without apparent effort then left harry to commence further conversation of course know what be come here about said harry not exactly at rate not so clearly what must wish to tell have gone to father a suitor for sister hand yes have now must know that be altogether impossible thing not to be even talked of so father say need not tell be very sorry to hear speak in way dear fellow ca really be in earnest ca suppose possible that must allow such engagement a to latter question have answer to give certainly be certainly be in earnest then must say that think have very erroneous idea of what conduct of gentleman must be stop moment clavering said mr saul rising standing with back to big fireplace allow to say in hurry word will afterwards regret think can have intended to come here tell that be not gentleman want to have argument with must give up be give what up if mean give up sister certainly will never do that may give up if have anything to say on head have better say to what right can have without shilling in world must have right to marry in such condition with father consent without be thing have never proposed to myself for moment to what have proposed to mr saul paused moment before spoke looking down at dusty heap upon table a though hoping inspiration might come to from will tell have proposed said at last a nearly a can put into word propose to myself to have image in heart of one human being whom can love above world beside propose to hope that a others may day marry that whom so love may become wife propose to bear with such courage a can much certain delay probable absolute failure in propose also to expect hardly to expect that will do for will do for now know mind may be sure of will instigate sister to disobedience of course will not see again will think that hard after what have passed between certainly will not endeavour to see clandestinely under circumstance mr saul of course must leave so father say leave at once mean can not be comfortable that father must go on in parish together in way what doe father mean by 'at once ' sooner better say in two month time at furthest very well will go in two month time have other home to go to other mean of livelihood a father wish will go at end of two month a comply with hope request to see sister once before go will not be refused must do good mr saul to must do great good a think harm to father be sure will not allow indeed why must a understand must sister wish have said so not to have acknowledged that idea of marriage between be quite impossible after be sure will have too much sense to wish for interview if there be anything further can do for will be most happy mr saul did not see that harry clavering must do anything for then harry took leave rector when heard of arrangement expressed a in sort satisfied one month must have be better than two then must hardly be expected that mr saul must take away instantly without looking for hole in to lay head of course be understood that be not to see rector said in answer to harry explained what have taken place expressing opinion that mr saul must at rate keep word interview indeed said rector be man audacity that most astonishes pass to think how such fellow can dare to propose thing what be that expects a end of then harry endeavoured to repeat what mr saul have said a to own expectation be quite aware that failed to make father understand expectation a have understood when word came from mr saul own mouth harry clavering have acknowledged to that be impossible not to respect poor curate to mr clavering of course fell task of explaining to fanny what have be done what be going to be done be to go away dear at end of two month very well mamma of course be not to meet before of course not if papa say so have told papa that will only be necessary to tell that then can go to school just a usual if please papa must doubt word for moment what can do if come to asked fanny almost whimpering have said that will not doubt word that be sure need not whatever anybody may say mr saul be a much gentleman a though have best living in diocese one ever knew break word not hair breadth do anything else that ought not to do fanny a pronounced rather strong eulogium began to sob mr clavering felt that fanny be headstrong almost ill natured in speaking in tone of lover after manner in have be treated there must be use in discussing mr saul virtue therefore let matter drop if will take advice said will go about occupation just a usual will soon recover spirit in way want to recover spirit said fanny if wish will go on with school be quite manifest now that fanny intended to play role of broken hearted young lady to regard absent mr saul with passionate devotion that must be so mr clavering felt to be more cruel because such tendency have be shown before paternal sentence against mr saul have be passed fanny in telling own tale have begun by declaring that such engagement be impossibility have not asked permission to have mr saul for lover have given hint that even hoped for such permission now when be done have almost dictated took upon to live a though be ill used a badly a heroine in castle among apennines in way must really become deeply in love with mr saul thinking of mr clavering almost regretted that edict of banishment have gone forth must perhaps have be better to have left mr saul to go about parish to have laughed fanny out of fancy be too late now for mr clavering said nothing further on subject to one on day following visit to farm house harry clavering be unwell too unwell to go back to london on next day be ill in bed then be that got mother to write to mr burton then also told mother part of trouble when letter be written be very anxious to see be desirous that must be specially worded so written a to make mr burton certain that be in truth too ill to come to london though not ill enough to create alarm why not simply let say that be kept here for day two asked mr clavering because promised must be in onslow terrace to morrow must not think must stay away if must avoid then mr clavering closed letter directed when have done that put on postage stamp asked in voice be intended to be indifferent whether florence be in london hearing that be so expressed surprise that letter must not be written to florence engagement be with mr burton said harry hope there be nothing wrong between florence said mother to question harry made immediate answer mr clavering be afraid to press after while recurred to subject mother said thing be wrong between florence oh harry what have done be rather what have done a for have simply trusted to man who have be false to dear harry say that what be that mean be not true about lady ongar then have heard mother of course know what have heard can hardly be worse than truth must not blame fault there may be be mine then told much of what have occurred in bolton street may suppose that said nothing of mad caress nothing perhaps of final promise made to julia a last passed out of presence did give her to understand that have in way returned to old passion for woman whom have first loved must describe mr clavering in language too highly eulogistic be to lead reader to believe that be altogether averse to such advantage a must accrue to son from marriage so brilliant a might now make with grandly dowered widow of late earl mr clavering by mean despised worldly good have idea that highly gifted son be better adapted to spending than to making of money have come to be believed at rectory that though harry have worked very hard at college a be case with many highly born young gentleman though must undoubtedly continue to work hard if be thrown among congenial occupation such a politics like nevertheless must never excel greatly in drudgery must be necessary for making of money there have be something to be proud of in there have of course be more to regret now if harry be to marry lady ongar trouble on score must be over poor florence when mr clavering allowed to think of matter knew that florence claim must be held a paramount when thought further thought seriously knew also that harry honour harry happiness demanded that must be true to girl to whom hand have be promised then be not lady ongar name tainted might be that have suffered cruel ill usage in might be that such taint have be deserved mr clavering must plead injured woman cause when speaking of without close reference to own belonging must have be very grievous to even have there be florence burton in case that son must make fortune by marrying woman a to whose character world be in doubt came to late in evening when sister father have just left sitting with hand upon spoke one word perhaps have more weight with harry than word have yet be spoken have slept dear said little before father came in darling said will be true to florence will not then there be pause own harry tell that will be true where truth be due will mother said own boy darling boy own true gentleman harry felt that did not deserve praise praise undeserved though may be satire in disguise be often very useful chapter xxxv parting on next day harry be not better doctor still said that there be cause for alarm be suffering from low fever sister have better be kept out of room must not sleep be restless might be time before must return to london early in day rector came into son bedroom told mother who be there news have just heard from great house hugh have come home said be going out yachting for rest of summer be going to norway in jack stuart yacht archie be going with now archie be known to be great man in yacht cognizant of rope well up in boom spar very intimate with bolt one to whose hand tiller came a naturally a did saddle of steeple chase horse to leg of friend doodle be going to fish said rector jack stuart yacht be only river boat just big enough for cowes harbour nothing more said harry roused in bed to excitement by news know nothing about jack stuart boat said rector be what told be down here at rate for saw servant came with what shame be said mr clavering scandalous shame mean going away said rector of course do leaving here by alone can have heart after losing child suffering a have done make ashamed of own name ca alter dear have good quality bad bad one be by far more conspicuous know good quality have doe not get into debt will not destroy property will leave family after a well off a be before though be hard man doe nothing actively cruel think of lord ongar then will remember that there be worse men than hugh not that like be never comfortable for moment in presence always feel that want to quarrel with almost want to quarrel with detest said harry from beneath bedclothes wo be troubled with more summer for mean to be off in le than week what be to do asked mr clavering live here a have done ever since julia married see that will make much difference to be never with when be in england must think must be more comfortable without than with be great catch for archie said harry archie clavering be fool said mr clavering say understands yacht said rector who then left room rector news be true sir hugh clavering have come down to park have announced intention of going to norway in jack stuart yacht archie also have be invited to join party sir hugh intended to leave thames in about week have not thought necessary to give wife intimation of fact till told of intention took think delight in being thus over harsh in harshness to proved to thus not only that be master that must be master without let drawback without compunction even without excuse for ill conduct there must be plea put in by in absence that have only gone to catch few fish when intention have be other than piscatorial intended to do a liked now always intended that wife must know that such be intention be now childless therefore have other term to keep with than appertained to necessity for bed board there be house might live in there be butcher baker other tradesman to supply want nay there be old carriage old horse at disposal if must be of service to such be sir hugh clavering idea a to bond inflicted upon by marriage vow be going to norway next week be thus sir hugh communicated intention to wife within five minute of first greeting to norway hugh yes why not to norway one two others have got fishing there archie be going too will keep from spending money rather from spending money be for how long will be gone be part of sir hugh clavering theory a to matter there must be lying in conduct of must not condescend to screen part of doings by falsehood so answered question with exact truth suppose will be back before october not before october be talking of putting in on coast of normandy somewhere probably may run down to brittany will be back at rate for hunting a for partridge game have gone so much to devil here that be not worth coming for will be away four month suppose will if come back till october then left calculating that must have considered matter before returned have decided that good must come to from complaint knew purpose now must doubt reconcile to quickly perhaps with few tear must not hurt if did not see blow be almost more than lady clavering must bear be more than must bear in silence why must have grudged husband trip abroad seeing that presence in england must hardly have be solace to be hard to understand have remained in england must rarely have be at clavering park when be at park must rarely have given benefit of society when be together be usually scolding else sitting in gloomy silence a though phase of life be almost insupportable to be so unusually disagreeable in intercourse with that absence one must think must be preferable to presence woman can bear anything better than desertion cruelty be bad neglect be worse than cruelty desertion worse even than neglect to be treated a though be not in existence a though existence be nuisance simply to be endured a far a possible to be forgotten be more than even lady clavering must bear without complaint when husband left sat meditating how might turn against oppressor be woman not apt for fighting unlike sister who knew well how to use cudgel in own behalf be timid not gifted with full flow of word prone to sink become dependent even with deficiency felt that must make stand against outrage to be now to be subjected hugh said when next saw ca really mean that be going to leave from time till winter said nothing about winter well till october said be going usually mean what say can not believe hugh can not bring to think that will be so cruel look here hermy if take to calling name wo stand wo stand what be to do be to be here in dreadful barrack of house alone how must like must bear for one month let alone four five wo remain here tell that fairly where do want to go want to go anywhere will go away somewhere die will indeed will destroy something psha yes of course be joke to what have done to deserve have ever done anything that told not be because of hughy darling so be be cruel of not like husband be not manly be very cruel did think anybody must have be so cruel a be to then broke down burst into tear have done hermy said husband have not done then go on again said in truth have done must only repeat last accusation be very very cruel said that before will say again will tell everybody so will will tell uncle at rectory will speak to look here hermy can bear deal of nonsense from because woman be given to talk nonsense if find telling tale about out of house especially to uncle indeed to anybody will let know what be to be cruel ca be worse than be try be a suppose have now said that have got to say if please will regard subject a finished poor woman have said that must say have further mean of carrying on war in thought must do so in thought must wander forth out of gloomy house in night perish in damp cold leaving paper behind to tell world that husband cruelty have brought to pas must go to julia leave for ever julia thought must still receive a to one thing have certainly made up mind must go with complaint to mr clavering at rectory let lord master show anger in form might please next day sir hugh made proposition somewhat softened aspect of affair did in usual voice with something of smile on face speaking a though be altogether oblivious of scene of yesterday be thinking hermy said that might have julia down here while be away have julia here yes why not will come be sure when know that back be turned have never thought about asking at least not lately of course might a well do so now seems that never go to ongar park a far a can learn never will be going to see going to see yes lord ongar people want to know whether can be induced to give up place be to sell interest in have promised to see do write letter first tell want to see ask also to come here a soon a can leave london must lawyer do better than well one must think so be commissioned to make kind of apology from whole courton family fancy have be hard upon by george believe have may be able to say word for too if be fool will put anger in pocket come down to lady clavering liked idea of having sister with be not quite meek enough to receive permission now given a full compensation for injury done said that must do a have bidden then went back to own grievance suppose julia even if must come for little time must find very pleasant to live in such place a alone must be alone when be with said hugh gruffly then again went out leaving wife to become used to misfortune by degree be not surprising that lady clavering must dislike solitude at clavering park house surprising that sir hugh must find place disagreeable house be large square stone building with none of prettiness of modern country house about garden be away from house cold desolate flat park came up close around window room be large lofty very excellent for purpose of large household with nothing of snug pretty comfort solitude requires for solace furniture be old heavy hanging be dark in colour lady clavering when alone there generally be alone never entered room on ground floor did ever pas through wilderness of hall by front door be to be reached throughout more than half day never came downstairs at when did so preparatory to being dragged about parish lane in old family carriage be let out at small side door so came to pas that during absence of lord of mansion shutter be not even moved from of lower window under such circumstance there can be wonder that lady clavering regarded place a prison wish must come upon unawares see how gloomy be said to think 'd stand alone for two day let alone life will shut up altogether if like said where be to go asked can go to moor hall if please now moor hall be small house standing on small property belonging to sir hugh in part of devonshire lie north of dartmoor somewhere near holsworthy region be perhaps a ugly a desolate a remote a part of england lady clavering have heard much of moor hall dreaded a heroine made to live in big grim castle low down among apennines dread smaller grimmer castle be known to exist somewhere higher up in mountain why must go to brighton said lady clavering boldly because choose said sir hugh after did go to rectory told mr clavering trouble have written to sister having however delayed doing of for two three day have not at time received answer from lady ongar did hear from sister till after sir hugh have left be on day before departure that went to rectory finding driven to act of rebellion by threat of moor hall will never go there unless be dragged there by force said to mr clavering think mean that said mr clavering only want to make understand that 'd better remain at park if knew what house be to be alone in dear hermione do know must come to oftener let endeavour to make better for how can do how can come to uncle house just because own husband have made own home so wretched that can not bear be ashamed to do ought not to be telling of course know what 'd do if knew be so hard to bear without telling one poor dear sometimes think will ask mr clavering to speak to to tell at once will not submit to longer of course must be mad with rage if be to kill must like better than having to go on in way be sure be only waiting for to die mr clavering said that must to comfort poor woman there be not much that must say have strongly advocated plan of having lady ongar at park thinking perhaps that harry must be more safe while lady be at clavering than might perhaps be if remained in london mr clavering doubted much whether lady ongar must consent to make such visit regarded lady ongar a hard worldly pleasure seeking woman sinned against perhaps in much also sinning in much herself to whom desolation of park must be even more unendurable than be to elder sister of of course said nothing lady clavering left somewhat quieted if not comforted went back to pas last evening with husband upon second thought will go by first train said a saw for moment before went up to dress will have to be off from here little after six mind that in summer thus be to be deprived of such gratification a there might have be in breakfasting with on last morning might be hard to say in what gratification must have consisted must by time have learned that presence gave none of pleasure usually expected from society slighted in everything rarely vouchsafed to little attention woman expect from gentleman if handed plate cut for morsel of bread from loaf showed by manner by brow that doing so be nuisance to at meal rarely spoke to having always at breakfast paper book before at dinner devoting attention to dog at foot why must have felt cruelly ill used in matter of last breakfast so cruelly ill used that wept afresh over a dressed seeing that must lose so little because loved man loved though now thought that hated very rarely fancy love whose love have not either possessed expected at rate for whose love have not hoped when have once existed ill usage will seldom destroy angry a be with man ready a be to complain of to rebel against perhaps to separate from for ever nevertheless found to be cruel grievance that must not sit at table with on morning of going jackson will bring cup of coffee a be dressing said will breakfast at club knew that there be reason for except breakfasting at club be more agreeable to than breakfasting with wife have got rid of tear before came down to dinner still be melancholy almost lachrymose be last night felt that something special ought to be said did not know what expected what be that wished to say think that be longing for opportunity to forgive only that must not be forgiven if must have spoken one soft word to must have accepted that one word a apology such word came sat opposite to at dinner drinking wine feeding dog be more gracious to at dinner than have be on former day sat there pretending to eat speaking dull word now then to answer be monosyllable looking out at from under eye through candlelight to see whether feeling be moving then having pretended to eat couple of strawberry left to still however be not last there must come

indeed said then suppose that be fate of widow to be lonely see at said archie briskly unless be old ugly that kind of thing when widow have become widow after have be married ever so many year why then suppose look to be left alone suppose like indeed ca say like then must wish to change be very intricate subject captain clavering one think be quite disposed to discus at present after year two perhaps will go into society again most widow do believe be thinking of something else said archie working up to point with great energy still with many sign that be ill at ease at work be by jove of what be thinking captain clavering be thinking of course know julia since poor little hughy death be next in for title poor hughy be sure be too generous to rejoice at indeed be when two fellow offered dinner at club on score of chance must have there be fact be there be doubt of believe none on earth most of be entailed too not that hugh must leave acre away from title be a safe a wax a far a be concerned suppose ever borrowed shilling mortgaged acre in life must think be prudent man be of prudent will say that of though ought to say now julia few word be best after look here if will

to marry if have got farthing between think be wrong do indeed be different now know certainly be very different now captain clavering said be sorry must have troubled with idea a say that julia be trouble be pleasure thing a mean never can take place yes can why ca ai in hurry will wait own time do just whatever wish while say without thinking about julia be one of thing captain clavering want more thinking than what woman can give to at first moment ah think so now because be surprised little well be surprised little a previous intercourse be never of nature to make such proposition a at probable be merely because did think right said archie who now that have worked into vein liked sound of own voice be indeed think right now must listen to for moment captain clavering for fear of mistake believe such plan a be quite out of question quite in uttering that last word managed to use tone of voice did make impression on never can under circumstance become wife might a well look upon that a altogether decided because will save annoyance need be so sure yet julia yes must be sure unless will promise to drop matter must to protect desire servant not to admit into house again will be sorry to do think will save from necessity did save from necessity before went gave required promise be well said tendering hand now will part friend will like to be friend said in crestfallen voice with took leave be great comfort to that have scheme of jack stuart yacht trip to norway for immediate consolation chapter xxxvii what lady ongar thought about illustration mr burton may perhaps be remembered have formed in heart scheme of own scheme of thought with much trepidation in must not request husband assistance knowing well that must not only not assist that must altogether disapprove of yet must not put aside from thought believing that might be mean of bringing harry clavering florence together husband have now thoroughly condemned poor harry have passed sentence against not indeed openly to florence very often in hearing of wife cecilia be more angry with circumstance than with offending man with circumstance with woman who stood in florence way be perfectly willing to forgive harry if harry must only be made to go right at last be good looking pleasant have nice way in house be altogether too valuable a lover to be lost without many struggle so kept to scheme at last carried into execution started alone from house one morning getting into omnibus at brompton have put down on rising ground in piccadilly opposite to green park why have hesitated to tell omnibus man to stop at bolton street can hardly be explained have felt that there must be almost declaration of guilt in naming locality so got out on little hill walked up in front of prime minister house a be then of yellow palace built by one of merchant prince turned into street be interdicted to by own conscience turned up bolton street with trembling hand knocked at lady ongar door florence in meantime be sitting alone in onslow terrace knew now that harry be ill at clavering that be indeed very ill though mr clavering have assured that illness be not dangerous for mr clavering have written to herself addressing with old familiarity affection with warmth of affection be almost more than natural be clear that mr clavering knew nothing of harry sin might not be possible cecilia have suggested that mr clavering might have known have resolved potentially that sin must be banished become ground for beautifully sincere repentance ah how sweet must be to receive that wicked sheep back again into sheepfold then to dock little of wandering power to fix with pleasant clog to tie down a prudent domestic sheep must be tied make pride of flock have be part of cecilia scheme of scheme poor florence knew nothing according to florence view mr clavering letter be written under mistake harry have kept secret at home intended to keep for present there be letter florence felt that be impossible for to answer without telling whole truth be very painful to to leave unanswered so kind letter a be quite impossible that must write of harry in old strain will be best must tell whole florence have said then will be saved pain of direct communication with brother to whom cecilia have repeated applauded sister resolution let face bear live down have said let do at once so that maudlin sentimentality may be at end cecilia must not accede to a florence be in truth resolved have declared purpose plainly cecilia be driven to execution of scheme more quickly than have intended in meantime florence took out little desk wrote letter in tear agony of spirit none can understand woman who have be driven to do same be written must have allowed to express thought with passion must have be comparatively easy behoved to be calm to be very quiet in word almost reticent even in language chose to abandon claim not only without reproach almost without allusion to love whilst cecilia be away letter be written re written copied mr burton be safe in that sister in law have promised that letter must not be sent till have seen mr burton when knocked at lady ongar door have little note ready for servant between finger compliment to lady ongar must lady ongar oblige by interview note contained simply that nothing more when servant took from declared intention of waiting in hall till have received answer be shown into dining room there remained for quarter of hour during time be by mean comfortable probably lady ongar might refuse to receive must that not be case must succeed in making way into lady presence how must find eloquence wherewith to plead cause at end of fifteen minute lady ongar opened door entered room mr burton said smiling be really ashamed to have kept so long open confession say be good for soul truth be be not dressed then led way upstairs placed mr burton on sofa placed in own chair from whence must see well in must not be well seen stretched out fold of morning dress gracefully made visitor thoroughly understand that be at home at ease may think surmise lady ongar open confession must do soul little good a lacked truth be first requisite for confession lady ongar have be sufficiently dressed to receive visitor have felt that special preparation be necessary for reception of one who have now come to knew well who be mr burton surmised accurately purpose for mr burton have come upon manner in now carried might hang decision of question be so important to whether phoebus in knickerbockers must must not become lord of ongar park to effect success now must maintain ascendancy during coming interview in maintenance of ascendancy much depends on outward man woman must think little of word must use little too of own purpose be fully minded to get better of mr burton if might be possible be not altogether decided on other point wished that harry clavering might be own must have wished to pension off florence burton with wealth have such pensioning be possible not le did entertain half doubt whether must not be well that must abandon own wish give up own hope of happiness of mr burton personally have known nothing having expected to see somewhat strong featured perhaps rather vulgar woman to hear voice painfully indicative of strong mind be agreeably surprised to find pretty mild lady who from first showed that be half afraid of what be doing have heard name mr burton said lady ongar from mutual friend mr clavering have doubt have heard mine from also said in accordance with little plan during fifteen minute have laid down for own guidance mr burton be surprised at first almost silenced by open mentioning of name have felt that must have greatest difficulty in approaching said however that be so have heard lady ongar name from mr clavering be connected know said lady ongar sister be married to first cousin sir hugh when be living with sister at clavering be at rectory there be before own marriage be perfectly easy in manner flattered that ascendancy be complete have heard a much from mr clavering said cecilia be very civil to immediately on return home perhaps may have heard also took house for made generally useful a young men ought to do believe be in same office with husband be not hope may not have be mean of making idle be very well very pretty mr burton be already beginning to feel that be doing nothing towards achievement of purpose suppose have be idle said did not mean to trouble about upon hearing lady ongar smiled supposition that have really intended to animadvert upon harry clavering idleness be amusing to a remembered how little such idleness must signify if must only have way poor harry said supposed sin must be laid at door idea be know that never will do good at such work a perhaps not be really ca say think mr burton have ever expressed such opinion if have if have must mention suppose must lady ongar not to stranger harry clavering be not stranger said lady ongar changing tone of voice altogether a spoke know that have known longer than have be aware of yes before ever dreamed of going into husband business mr burton long before have ever be to stratton name of stratton be assistance to cecilia seemed to have be spoken with view of enabling to commence work yes said nevertheless did go to stratton went to stratton there became acquainted with sister in law florence burton be aware of mr burton also became engaged to be aware of too have told a much have told whether mean to keep to break engagement ah mr burton be that question fair be fair to to if have taken into confidence have not taken must be doing well to betray if there can be anything in secret specially interesting to myself why must be made to tell to think truth be always best lady ongar truth be always better than lie so at least people say though sometimes act differently silence may be better than be matter lady ongar in can not be silent hope will not be angry with for coming to for asking question o dear can not be silent sister in law must at rate know what be to be fate then why do not ask be ill at present ill where be ill who say be ill lady ongar though did not quite leave chair raised up forgot preparation where be mr burton have not heard of illness be at clavering at parsonage have heard nothing of what ail if be really ill dangerously ill conjure to tell pray tell truth let there be trick in such matter a trick lady ongar if harry clavering be ill tell what ail be in danger mother in writing to florence say that be not in danger that be confined to house have be taken by fever on very morning lady ongar have received letter from sister begging to come to clavering park during absence of sir hugh in letter word have be said a to harry illness have be seriously at least dangerously ill hermione must certainly have mentioned flashed across julia mind a tidings about harry reached if be not really in danger even if be why must betray feeling before woman if there have be much in said resuming former position manner must doubt have heard of from sister hear that be not dangerous continued mr burton be away can not see in truth lady ongar can not see more until know that mean to deal honestly by be keeper of honesty from what have heard think be if will tell have heard falsely will go away beg pardon for intrusion if what have heard be true must not be surprised that show anxiety for happiness of sister if knew lady ongar must know that be too good to be thrown aside with indifference harry clavering tell that be angel that be perfect if love will not be shame that must be parted said nothing about loving men be not always fond of perfection angel may be too angelic for world did love so suppose at rate thought that did did love believe love still have leave to do so mr burton cecilia though be somewhat afraid of task have undertaken be partly awed by lady ongar style of beauty demeanour nevertheless felt that if still hoped to do good must speak truth out at once must ask lady ongar whether held to be engaged to harry clavering if did not do nothing must come of present interview say that lady ongar do mean asked have be told that also be engaged to marry mr clavering who have told so have heard have heard have be obliged to tell sister have done so who told did hear from harry clavering did heard in part from then why have come beyond to must know if have told that be engaged to marry must also have told that doe not intend to marry miss florence burton be not for to defend to accuse why do come to for mercy forbearance said mr burton rising from seat coming over to side of room in lady ongar be seated illustration plea for mercy miss burton have sent doe not know that be here doe husband know one know have come to tell that before god man be engaged to become husband of florence burton have learned to love have now other chance of happiness what of happiness yes be bound to think of florence be bound to think of above thing so be love too a fondly perhaps a can do loved first before have even heard name lady ongar yes may ask question if will will answer truly be standing now confronting other will answer without asking be false to must not marry because be poor then married because be rich be true doe not make love le now have loved through yes be shocked be true have loved through what be to do now if still love can give wealth now wealth will not make happy have not made happy may help to do so with with at rate there can be doubt be happiness to be bound to look mr burton if thought must make happy if must come to must marry to morrow though broke sister heart by doing so if felt that must do so more than must leave to though broke own have spoken to very openly will say a much a that must act in way know what must say then let do so leave to be judge of own happiness let pledge that reproach will come from will pledge equally be who loved first be who have brought into trouble owe everything have be true to must never have thought of never have seen miss florence burton be doubt true did not touch question of florence right fact on mr burton wished to insist if only knew how be florence have not sinned at that florence therefore ought not to bear part of punishment might be very true that harry fault be to be excused in part because of lady ongar greater primary fault why must florence be scapegoat must think of honour a well a happiness said mr burton at last be rather severe mr burton considering that be said to in own house be so low a that honour will be tarnished if become wife in saying be thinking of thing of mr burton knew nothing honour will be tarnished said if marry whom have promised to marry be welcomed by father mother to house then made master of heart be not till have asked for have offered own hand in return for be not bound to keep promise can not be bound to after such fashion a if be solicitous for welfare must know that if must live with reputation of gentleman there be only one course open to be old story said lady ongar old story have not somebody said that god laugh at perjury of lover know that men be inclined to be much more severe than god broken heart be what woman be doomed to bear be to be answer to lady ongar be not answer to be excuse make for harry clavering answer to have be very explicit pardon if say that have be more explicit than have right to expect have told that be prepared to take step may be most conducive to happiness of man whom once injured whom have always loved will do let cost what may will do let cost to other woman be what may can not expect must love woman better than said still standing not without something more than vehemence in tone in voice in manner in eye there be that amounted almost to ferocity be declaring that sacrifice must be made that recked little whether must be of of a must immolate without hesitation if necessity must exist so must see florence burton destroyed without twinge of remorse if destruction of florence must serve purpose have in view o reader may feel that man for whom be to be done be not worth passion have proved to be very far from such worth passion nevertheless be there woman be honest in what be saying after mr burton got out of room a soon a found opening allowed to go in making farewell speech muttered indistinct apology for visit have be bold enough to make not at said lady ongar have be quite right be fighting battle for friend love bravely be not that cause of battle must fear separate hereafter must be proud to know one who fight so well for friend when be over have be settled in way may be settled let miss burton know from have be taught to hold name character in highest possible esteem mr burton made attempt at further speech left room with low curtsey till found out in street be unable to think whether have done most harm most good by visit

aware own ear have tingled with shame a harry clavering have be discussed a grand prize for sister be contending with woman contending with so small chance of success be terrible to that woman dear to must seem to seek for man love audacity with lady ongar have proclaimed own feeling have be terrible also to cecilia be aware that be meddling with thing be foreign to nature must be odious to husband yet be not battle worth fighting be not to be endured that florence must seek after thing after possession of thing in question be only earthly good must give comfort to poor florence even cecilia with partiality for harry felt that be not worth struggle be for now to estimate at price florence might put upon not at own price must tell florence what have be done tell on very day of meeting with lady ongar in other way must stop that letter knew that florence must have already written to mr clavering must now tell florence that there be ground for hope be not fact that lady ongar have spoken simple plain truth when have said that harry must be allowed to choose course appeared to to be best for be hard very hard that must be so be not true also that men a well a god excuse perjury of lover wanted to have back harry among a one to be forgiven easily to be petted much to be loved always in spite of softness of woman nature wished that might be punished sorely if did not so return be grievous to that must longer have choice in matter heaven earth be to be allowed to treat woman a have treated florence be nothing to come of in spite of god men thing be so grievous to cecilia burton that must not bring to acknowledge that be possible such thing have not be done in world have known walked whole way home to brompton have hardly perfected plan when reached own door if only florence

justified in estimate have made of sir hugh probable character from knowledge have acquired of brother archie nevertheless have fallen into great mistake there must hardly have be man then in london le likely to fall into present view than sir hugh clavering not only be too fond of money to give away without knowing why did so be subject to none of weakness by men be prompted to submit to such extortion have believed story have lady ongar be really dear to must never have dealt with one a madame gordeloup otherwise than through police madame gordeloup said if immediately take off will have

encountered archie doodle sir hugh who have be altogether at loss to understand what have meant by man out of warwickshire followed into hall became more angry than before at finding that brother have brought friend to house at so very inopportune moment wrath in face be so plainly expressed that doodle must perceive wished away presence also of spy be not pleasant to gallant captain be wonderful woman ubiquitous that must thus encounter again that so soon after thing that have spoken of on morning how do do gentleman said sophie there be great many box here with crinoline have not got room then shook hand first with archie then with doodle asked latter why be not a yet gone to warwickshire archie in almost mortal fear looked up into brother face have brother learned story of seventy

brother sir archie trembled trembled still more when brother turning to asked if knew woman yes know woman very well said sophie why do not come more to see send little friend like better come again

sit down be not polite did send for police talk of lock up ouse to be english do thing only english archie felt that be incumbent on to explain that visit to house have be made under other circumstance that have brought money instead of seeking have in fact gone to simply in way of own trade did begin preliminary to explanation a servant be there a brother might come out from dining room a also be aware that must hardly tell story much to own advantage stopped abruptly looking piteously at doodle implored to take lady away perhaps must mind just seeing into mount street said archie who said doodle electrified be only just round corner said archie yes captain booddle will go said sophie be bad house sir 'oo like at lock up indeed tell will very soon be locked up there be

sophie of course will said archie will make that right for yet gentleman when have so much to gain must take too easy come with handy glove will see about again then sophie walked off leaning upon arm

proud of position though be one from must not have be sorry to escape have escape be possible remarkable phenomenon be spy to have walked round berkeley square with woman leaning on arm might in coming year be event to remember with satisfaction in meantime did not say much to did not quite understand that said to at last came to door well remembered then paused did not escape even then after while door be opened who be passing might have seen captain boodle slowly with hesitating step enter narrow passage before lady then sophie followed closed door behind a far a story go what took place

there written there anything of despair voice be serious almost solemn manner be very grave be have seen said florence rising up from chair yes dear may have done wrong theodore know will say so thought best to try to learn truth before wrote to mr clavering what be truth perhaps have not learned think have learned that must tell have be very frank well what be truth suppose dearest can not bear hope for nothing now only want to have settled may be at rest upon mr burton took suffering girl in arm caressed tenderly love said be not easy for to be at rest can not be at rest a yet can will be so when know that be settled wish to interfere with fortune there be letter to mother now will go back to stratton not yet dearest not yet said mr burton taking letter in hand refraining from withdrawing at once from envelope must hear what have heard to day doe say that love ah yes love must not doubt what doe say of say what also must say florence though be hard that must be so must be a will decide said florence withdrawing from arm be still around no will not be a may choose to decide will not so submit to be enough a be will never see more never to say that love must be untrue will never see again stop dear stop what if be fault of fault of that went to when be a be together of course there have be fault flo dearest listen to know must ask to hing from woman must shrink know that must give heart blood for nothing will be of avail now look at with melancholy eye like cissy will not kill be only doubt kill one will not look at with melancholy eye must listen to doe not herself know what intention be know know own read letter cissy there be not one word of anger in will ever utter reproach knew first if loved through be pity must not be constant to love even though be false to wo hear flo a far a can learn truth a most firmly believe when went to on return to england have other intention than of visiting old friend what sort of friend cissy have idea then of being untrue to when saw old intimacy came back be natural then be dazzled by beauty be then so beautiful be very beautiful let go to said florence tearing away from sister arm walking across room with quick almost angry step let have cissy there will be end of will not condescend to solicit love if be such a say if beauty with go for everything what chance must there be for such a did not say that beauty with went for everything of course doe ought to have known that must be so with one a then be rich also wonderfully rich what right can have to think of florence be unjust even suspect that be money to be same thing suppose that woman who be so beautiful have right to everything know that be plain will be content in future to think more poor florence when have got a far a broke down must go on further with declaration have be about to make a to future prospect mr burton taking advantage of went on with story struggling not altogether unsuccessfully to assume calm tone of unimpassioned reason a said before be dazzled dazzled oh even then have idea of being untrue to no be untrue without idea be worse florence be perverse be determined to be unfair must beg that will hear to end so that then may be able to judge what course ought to follow mr burton said with air of great authority after continued in voice something le stern thought of doing injury to when went to see something of feeling of old love grew upon when be in company became embarrassed by position before be aware of own danger might of course have be stronger here florence exhibited gesture of strong impatience though did not speak be not going to defend altogether think must admit that be hardly tried of course can not say what passed between can understand how easily might recur to old scene how naturally must wish for renewal of love have be base enough to betray doe not however consider a at present engaged to that may know for certain may be that have asked for promise that have hesitated if so staying away from not writing to can be easily understood what be must have do be ill now wait till be well must have be here before have not illness prevented wait till come can not do cissy wait must can not wait without offering through mother freedom have so much reason to know that desire know that desire know that mother even suspect of fault towards now that be there at home away from bolton street care to trust to such influence a cissy if must not spend morning with in own house then a left feel that preferred to to world must rather be a be than take hand will not marry from pity yet from sense of duty know old story how devil must be monk when be sick will not accept sick bed allegiance have to think that owe husband to mother influence over while be ill will make think flo that be le true to than be perhaps be so let have what good such truth a hers can do for feel that be duty to be true to myself will not condescend to indulge heart at cost of pride a woman oh florence hate that word pride must not hate for in place need take shame to love have taken shame to love said florence rising again from chair have be missish coy about love from moment in knew that be pleasure to myself to regard a future husband have spoken of love a being always proud of have acknowledged a openly a can do yours for theodore acknowledge still will never deny take shame have loved must take to myself great shame must ever be brought so low a to ask for love when once have learned to think that have transferred from to woman then walked length of room backwards forward with hasty step not looking at sister in law whose eye be now filled with tear come cissy then said will make end of read letter if choose to read though indeed be not worth reading then let send to post mr burton now opened letter read very slowly be stern almost unfeeling in calmness of word chosen in word proposed marriage with harry clavering be absolutely abandoned know said that son be more warmly attached to lady than be to under circumstance for sake a well a for mine be necessary that must part dear mr clavering may ask to make understand that be never to recur to past if will send back letter of mine must have be kept little present once gave will have be done need be done have be said need be said will receive in small parcel own letter gift have made there be in tone of completeness a of business absolutely finished of judgment admitting appeal did not at suit mr burton view letter quite a becoming on part of florence might thought be written must still leave open door for reconciliation florence be resolved letter be sent part mr burton have taken in conversation have surprised even have be full of anger with harry clavering a wrathful with a nature permitted to be yet have pleaded cause with eloquence going almost so far in defence of a to declare that be blameless in truth be prepared to acquit of blame to give full absolution without penance if only must be brought back again into fold wrath against must be very hot must not so return must be more than forgiven if must only come back do duty with affectionate patient fidelity desire be not so much that justice must be done a florence must have thing coveted florence rival must not have according to argument a arranged by feminine logic harry clavering must be right wrong according a might at last bear desired success if must only be successful be prepared to forgive everything even yet must not give up battle though admitted to herself florence letter to mr clavering made contest more difficult than ever might however be that mr clavering must be good enough just enough true enough clever enough to know letter a coming from girl written under such circumstance must be taken a meaning nothing most mother must wish to see son married to wealth must wealth throw in way mr clavering possibly might not be such mother a in meantime there be before terrible necessity of explaining to husband step have taken without knowledge of knew that must tell history before must sit down to dinner with in comfort theodore said creeping in out of own chamber to dressing room

a said so be quite ready to make fool after same fashion again if only there be not in way that difficulty of recommencing have be possible for to write again at once in old strain without reference to own conduct during last month must have begun fooling without waiting to finish dressing did open parcel mother asked hour so before be necessary that jem must be started on mission yes thought

than one half so well neither now ever did word whether wholly true only partially so be at least to point be taken by cecilia burton when heard of a confession of faith demanded instant plenary absolution trouble have called harry down to clavering remained regret to say almost in full force now that prolonged visit have be brought so near close mr saul indeed have agreed to resign curacy be already on look out for similar employment in other parish since interview with fanny father have never entered rectory spoken to fanny fanny have promised that there must be such speaking indeed danger of kind be feared mr saul might do must do openly nay audaciously though there existed security nevertheless thing a regarded fanny be very unpleasant when mr saul have commenced courtship have agreed with family in almost ridiculing idea of such lover there have be feeling with a with others poor mr saul be to be pitied then have come to regard overture a matter of grave import not indeed avowing to mother anything so strong a return of affection speaking of proposal a one to there be other objection than of want of money now however went moping about house a though be victim of true love condemned to run unsmoothly for ever a though passion for mr saul be too much for be waiting in patience till death must relieve from cruelty of parent never complained such victim never do complain moped be wretched when mother questioned struggling to find out how strong feeling might in truth be fanny must simply make dutiful promise promise be wickedly dutiful that must never mention name of mr saul more mr saul in meantime went about parish duty with grim energy supplying rector shortcoming without word must have be glad to preach sermon read service during six month have be allowed to do so be constant in school more constant than ever in visiting be very courteous to mr clavering when necessity of position brought together for mr clavering hated unjustly for man placed a mr saul be placed line of conduct exactly level with previously followed be impossible be better that must become more energetic in duty than le so will be easily understood that thing interfered much with general happiness of family at rectory at time monday came harry clavering now convalescent simply interesting from remaining effect of illness started on journey for london there have come no further letter from onslow terrace to parsonage indeed owing to intervention of sunday none must have come unless florence have written by return of post harry made journey beginning with promise of happiness to becoming somewhat uneasy a train drew near to london have behaved badly knew that in first place must own that have done so to men necessity be always grievous woman not unfrequently like task to confess submit be accepted a confessing submitting come naturally to feminine mind cry of peccavi sound soft pretty when made by sweet lip in loving voice man who can own that have done amiss without pang who can so own to man even to woman be usually poor creature harry must now make such confession therefore became uneasy then for there be task behind one must be called upon to perform evening task must have nothing of pleasantness in to redeem pain must confess not only to florence where confession might probably have reward must confess also to julia second confession must indeed be hard task to that however be to be postponed till morrow on evening have pledged that must go direct to onslow terrace did a soon after have reached lodging a be possible be past six when reached london be not yet eight when with palpitating heart knocked at mr burton door must take reader back with for few minute in order that may see after what fashion letter from clavering be received by lady in onslow terrace on day mr burton have be required to go out of london by one of early train have not be in house when postman came nothing have be said between cecilia florence a to hope fear in regard to answer from clavering nothing at least since conversation in florence have agreed to remain in london for yet few day of be very nervous on matter answer if sent at once from clavering must arrive on morning therefore when well known knock be heard of be able to maintain calmness perfectly yet nothing be said did of rise from seat at breakfast table presently girl came in with apparently bundle of letter be still sorting when entered room there be two three for mr burton two for cecilia then two besides registered packet for florence for receipt be needed a florence have seen address recognized writing be hardly able to give signature a soon a maid be gone cecilia must keep seat no longer know be from clavering said rising from chair coming round to side of table florence instinctively swept packet into lap leaning forward covered letter with hand oh florence let see let see at once if be to be happy let know florence paused still leaning over treasure hardly daring to show burning face even yet might be that be rejected then cecilia went back to seat simply looked at sister with beseeching eye think will go upstairs said florence be afraid of flo cecilia answered reproachfully let see outside of then florence brought round table put into sister hand may open one from mr clavering florence nodded head then seal be broken in one minute two woman be cry in other arm be quite sure of said cecilia through tear perfectly sure never doubted for moment how must have talked of going to stratton at last florence got away up to window gradually mustered courage to break envelope of lover letter be not at once that showed postscript to cecilia at once that packet be opened that last ceremony did perform in solitude of own room before day be over postscript have be shown added trinket have be exhibited remember well said florence mr clavering wore on forehead when dined at lady clavering mr burton in saw something of gentle persuasion mother have used of said nothing that must be back again must have repented be enough for mr burton be again absent when harry clavering knocked in person at door on occasion absence have be specially arranged by with view to harry comfort wo want to see evening have said indeed will get on great deal better without therefore have remained away from home not being club man have dined most uncomfortably at eating house be lady at home harry asked when door be opened oh yes be at home there be danger that must be found out on occasion a girl looked at pleasantly calling by name a answered a though too desired to show that have again be taken into favour into favour a well a of mistress hardly knew what be doing a ran up step to drawing room be afraid of what be to come nevertheless rushed at fate a young soldier rush at trench in feel that may probably fall so harry clavering hurried on before have looked round upon room have entered found fate with florence on bosom ala ala fear that justice be outraged in welcome harry received on evening have said that must be called upon to own sin so much at least must have be required of owned sin have said that certain degradation must attend in first interview after reconciliation instead of hour that spent that evening in onslow terrace be hour of one long ovation be a be put upon throne a king who have returned from conquest two woman did honour almost kneeling at foot cecilia be almost a tender with a florence pleading to own false heart fact of illness a excuse there be something of pallor of sick room left with slight tenuity in hand brightness in eye did yeoman service have be quite robust cecilia might have felt that must not justify to herself peculiar softness of word after first quarter of hour be supremely happy awkwardness have gone a sat with arm round florence waist found that little pencil case have again be attached to chain a looked down upon saw that cheap brooch be again on breast must have be pretty must have be there to see skill with steered clear of word phrase must be disagreeable to one might have thought that must have be impossible to avoid touch of rebuke very fact that be forgiven must seem to imply fault required pardon there be hint at fault tact of woman excels skill of men so perfect be tact of woman not word be said wounded harry ear have come again into fold be rejoiced showed joy who have gone astray have repented be beautifully tender to repentant sheep chapter xlii restitution harry stayed little too long with love little longer at least than have be computed in consequence met theodore burton in crescent a be leaving meeting must hardly be made without something of pain perhaps be well for harry that must have opportunity a for getting over quickly when saw mr burton under bright gas lamp must very willingly have avoided have be possible well harry said burton giving hand to repentant sheep how be burton said harry trying to speak with unconcerned voice then in answer to inquiry a to health told of own illness speaking of confounded fever having made very low intended deceit made more of fever than be necessary when will come back to shop burton asked must be remembered that though brother must not refuse to welcome back to home sister lover still thought that engagement be misfortune did not believe in harry a man of business have almost rejoiced when florence have be so nearly quit of now there be taint of sarcasm in voice a asked a to harry return to chamber in adelphi can hardly quite say a yet said harry still pleading illness be very much against coming up to london so soon indeed must not have done have not felt so very very anxious to see florence know burton whether ought to say anything to about suppose have said what have to say to woman oh yes think understand completely hope understand in case know that need say anything to come to adelphi a soon a can that be never think that man becomes bit stronger after illness by remaining idle then harry passed on felt that have escaped easily in interview a walked home be compelled to think of step must next take when have last seen lady ongar have left with promise florence be to be deserted for sake a yet that promise must by be supposed to be binding indeed have thought to be binding on till have found under mother influence at parsonage during last few week in london have endured agony of doubt in vacillation pendulum have always veered more strongly towards bolton street than to onslow crescent now swinging of pendulum have ceased altogether from henceforth bolton street must be forbidden ground to sheepfold in onslow crescent must be home till must have established small peculiar fold for a yet have still before task of communicating final decision to lady in bolton street a walked home determined that have better do so in first place by letter so eager be a to propriety of doing at once on return to lodging sat down wrote letter before went to bed be not very easily written here at rate have to make confession of have before spoken confession may be le difficult to make with pen ink than with spoken word when so made be more degrading word be written be thing capable of permanent life life frequently to confusion of parent man must make confession always by word of mouth if be possible whether such course must have be possible to harry clavering may be doubtful might have be that in personal meeting necessary confession must not have got adequately spoken thinking perhaps of wrote letter a follows on night bloomsbury square july date be easily written how be to go on after in what form of affection indifference be to address whom have at last meeting called own dearest julia got out of difficulty in way common to lady gentleman under such stress did not address by name epithet date allowed to remain then went away at once to matter of subject feel that owe at once to tell have be history during last few week came up from clavering to day have since be with mr miss burton immediately on return from sit down to write after having said so much harry probably felt that rest of letter must be surplusage few word must tell that be required that must know courtesy demanded that must say more went on with confession know that became engaged to miss burton soon after own marriage feel now must have told when first met yet have done so must have seemed a though told with special object know whether make understood in can only hope do so understood of course understood required blundering explanation from to assist intelligence wish now that have mentioned must have be better for of must have be saved much pain perhaps uneasiness be called down to clavering few week ago about business in family then became ill so that be confined to bed instead of returning to town have not be for must not have left so long in suspense be if there have be suspense for have to own have be very weak worse than weak fear will think know whether old regard for will prompt to make excuse for be well sure that can make none for myself will not have suggested to without urging if choose to think have be heartless rather if be able so to think of word of mine written spoken now will remove impression from mind believe that need write nothing further will understand from what have said must have to say be to refer at length to have passed between be over now only remains for to express hope that may be happy whether will ever see other again who will say if do trust that may not meet a enemy may god bless here hereafter harry clavering when letter be finished harry sat for while by open window looking at moon over chimney pot of square thinking of career in life a have hitherto be fulfilled great promise of earlier day have not be kept plight in world be now poor enough though hope have be so high be engaged to be married have income on to marry have narrowly escaped great wealth ah be hard for to think of without regret did strive so to think of though told that must have be evil for to have depended on money have be procured by very act have be to injury to have dressed in feather have be plucked from lord ongar wing be hard for to think of that have missed rejoice thoroughly that have missed told that so rejoiced endeavoured to be glad that have not soiled hand with rich never must have belonged to woman have loved have not earned by being false to early on following morning sent off letter then putting into cab bowled down to onslow crescent sheepfold now be very pleasant to when head shepherd be away so much gratification be natural that must allow that evening when came from club found note from lady ongar be very short blood rushed to face a felt ashamed at seeing with how much apparent ease have answered have written with difficulty have written awkwardly there be nothing awkward in word dear harry be quits now know why must ever meet a enemy will never feel to be enemy of yours think must be well that must see other if have objection to seeing will be at home evening that may call indeed be at home always in evening surely harry there can be reason why must not meet need not fear that there will be danger in will give compliment to miss florence burton with best wish for happiness mr burton have seen a may have heard congratulate on friend yours always j o writing of letter seemed to have be easy enough certainly there be nothing in be awkward think that writer have suffered more in writing than harry have done in producing longer epistle have known how to hide suffering have used tone told tale of wound be quits now have said have repeated word over over again to herself a walked up down room yes be quits now if reflection of fact must do good have ill treated in early day a have told so often have served rather than injured by ill treatment have be false to falsehood have preserved from lot must not have be fortunate with clog a must have be round neck with wife without shilling of fortune how must have risen in world though have deceived have served then after have come tragedy of life terrible day in thinking of still shuddered day of husband sophie gordeloup terrible deathbed attack upon honour misery upon misery a to never now spoke word to one a to be resolved that never must speak again have sold for money have got price punishment of offence have be very heavy now in latter day have thought to compensate man have loved for treachery with have used that treachery have be serviceable to not le must compensation be very rich must love too ah yes have always loved must have now everything if only must consent to forget terrible episode in life a must strive to forget must remain to remind of lord ongar must be wealth must henceforth belong to harry clavering such have be dream harry have come to with word of love made seem to be reality have spoken to word of love be now forced to withdraw dream be dissipated be not to be allowed to to escape penalty so easily a that a for be now quits that being case there must be reason why must quarrel what now must do with wealth especially how must act in respect to place down in country though have learned to hate ongar park during solitary visit there have still looked forward to pleasure property might give when must be able to bestow upon harry clavering have be part of dream dream be now over through have be conscious that might hardly dare to hope that end of punishment must come so soon now knew that be not to come a far a must see there be end to punishment in prospect for from first meeting with harry clavering on platform of railway station presence thought of have sufficed to give brightness to life have enabled to support friendship of sophie gordeloup also to support solitude when poor sophie have be banished now be left without resource a sat alone meditating on endeavoured to console with reflection that after be one whom harry loved whom harry must have chosen have be free to choose comfort to be derived from be very poor yes have loved once nay perhaps loved still when love be own have rejected have rejected simply declaring to to friend to world at large that preferred to be rich have reward bowing head upon hand acknowledged that punishment be deserved first step after writing note to harry be to send for mr turnbull lawyer have expected to see harry on evening of day on have written instead of received note from in said that must come to before long mr turnbull be more instant in obeying command be with on morning after received injunction be almost perfect stranger to having only seen once for few moment after return to england marriage settlement have be prepared for by sir hugh attorney during sojourn in florence have become necessary that must have one in london to look after own affair mr turnbull have be recommended to by lawyer employed by husband be prudent sensible man who recognized to be imperative interest to look after client interest have done duty by lady ongar in trying time immediately after return offer have then be made by courton family to give julia income without opposition if must surrender ongar park to have made objection with indignation mr turnbull though have at first thought that must be wise to comply with term proposed have done work for with satisfactory expedition since day have not seen now have summoned be with in bolton street want to speak to mr turnbull said about place down in surrey like not like ongar park said have always heard that be so charming be not charming to be sort of property want mean to give up lord ongar uncle must buy interest in have doubt exactly have sent to offering to do so brother in law sir hugh clavering called on with message from saying so thought that be very foolish to come so told such thing must be done by one lawyer think so mr turnbull mr turnbull smiled a declared that of course being lawyer be of opinion be afraid will have thought uncivil continued julia a spoke rather brusquely to sir hugh clavering be not inclined to take step through sir hugh clavering know have reason to be angry with little lord family really lady ongar think not when ladyship returned there be opposition thought of for while really think be fault no be not fault that be feeling at time be indeed be fault of lord ongar of husband a regard courtons have word of complaint to make be not to be expected be not desirable that must be friend be impossible after what have passed that there must be such friendship have never injured wish to oblige have ongar park suited must doubtless have kept doe not suit be welcome to have back again have price be named lady ongar price need be named there be to be question of price lord ongar mother be welcome to place rather to such interest a have in to pay rent suggested mr turnbull to pay rent nothing must induce to let place to sell right in will have bargain about a nothing also will induce to live there be not such dog in manger a to wish to keep if will have kindness to see mr courton lawyer to make arrangement about lady ongar what call right in estate be worth over twenty thousand pound be indeed must borrow twenty thousand pound on security of to morrow want to borrow twenty thousand pound exactly of course point out that fact to show value must be making present of sum of money to people who want who have claim upon really see how must take courton wish to have place very much lady have never thought of getting without paying for lady ongar really can not advise to take such step a indeed can not must be wrong a lawyer if did not point out to that proceeding must be quite romantic quite so what world must call quixotic people expect such thing a indeed people often have such reason a have said lady ongar mr turnbull sat silent for while looking a though be unhappy proposition made to be one a lawyer felt to be very distasteful to knew that client have male friend in whom confided felt that world must blame if allowed lady to part with property in way have suggested will find be in earnest continued smiling may a well give way to vagary with good grace must not take lady ongar at rate can try if will make understand at want place that will go to rack ruin because there be one to live there be sure will take then mr turnbull again sat silent unhappy thinking with what word might best bring forward last strongest argument against rash proceeding lady ongar said in peculiar position there be double reason why must not act in way what do mean mr turnbull what be peculiar position world will say that have restored ongar park because be afraid to keep indeed lady ongar have better let remain a be care nothing for what world say exclaimed rising quickly from chair nothing nothing must really hold by right must indeed who can possibly say what other interest may be concerned may marry live for next fifty year have family be duty lady ongar to point out thing to be sure be quite right mr turnbull said struggling to maintain quiet demeanour of course be only doing duty whether marry whether remain a be will give up place a for what world a call may say will not deny that cared much for on immediate return what people said then made very unhappy care nothing for now have established right have be sufficient to seems that world a call have be civil enough in usage of lately be only of who must have be friend have right to complain if will please to do thing for will be obliged to if be quite determined about be quite determined what be use of place to never will go there what be use even of money come to have purpose for have nothing to do with there be something in tone a said well filled with pity must remember said how short time be since became widow thing will be different with soon clothes will be different if mean that answered know that there will be other change in be wrong to trouble with if will let mr courton lawyer know with compliment to mr courton have heard that must like to have place want will be obliged to mr turnbull having by time perceived that be quite in earnest took leave having promised to do bidding in interview have told lawyer only part of plan be now running in head a for giving up ongar park took to herself merit for that place have be odious to ever since have endeavoured to establish there have found that clergyman wife must not speak to that even own housekeeper must hardly condescend to hold converse with felt that must be dog in manger to keep place in own possession have thought beyond resolution only a yet half formed a to wider surrender have disgraced ruined robbed of happiness by marriage have made misery have not be simply misery of lord lifetime a might have be expected be soon over enduring wretchedness have come after from saw prospect of escape what be to be future life left a be must be in desolation if be to give up wealth have be so ill gotten might there not then be hope of comfort for have be willing enough to keep lord ongar money use for purpose of own comfort while have still hoped that comfort might come from remembrance of that have to give have be very pleasant to a long a have hoped that harry clavering must receive at hand have not at once felt that fruit have turned to ash now now that harry be gone from now that have friend left to whom must hope to make happy by munificence very knowledge of wealth be burden to a thought of rich in first day of desertion a have indeed be thinking since cecilia burton have be with came to understand that be degraded by acquisition have done that have be unpardonably bad felt like juda when stood with price of treachery in hand have given up money must not do a much there have be moment in have nearly declared purpose to lawyer be held back by feeling that ought to make plan certain before communicated to must live must not go out hang a juda have done then there be title rank of did not know whether be within power to divest sorely felt want of one from whom in present need might ask counsel of friend to whom

deep mourning in deepest mourning be there anything about of complaint might fairly be made by who do complain on such subject dress be high round neck cap on head be indisputably widow cap enough of brown hair be to be seen to tell of rich loveliness black dress be so made a to show full perfection of form with there be that graceful feminine brightness care money can always give will not come

absolutely afraid to frequent club at period of year though hated walliker mortally be fully resolved to go on with work who must tell what might be fate perhaps in ten year might be carrying that russian railway on through desert of siberia then there came to suddenly tidings disturbed resolution changed whole current of life at first there came telegram to from country desiring to go down at

not remain now head be confused must hardly bring to think how matter must affect when attempted to explain absence to old serious clerk there spoke of own return to office a certain must be back supposed in week at furthest be thinking then of promise to theodore burton have not begun to realize fact that whole destiny in life must be changed said something with long face of terrible misfortune have occurred gave hint that misfortune must be important in consequence to be not till have reached lodging in bloomsbury square that remembered that own father be now baronet that be father heir then for moment thought about property believed that be entailed even of that be not certain if be unentailed to whom must cousin have left endeavoured however to expel such thought from mind a though there be something ungenerous in entertaining tried to think of widow even in doing that must not tell that there be much ground for genuine sorrow wife have ever have le joy from husband society than lady clavering have have from that of sir hugh there be child to mourn loss brother no unmarried sister sir hugh have have friend a friendship go with such men harry must not doubt whether among there must be one who must feel anything like true grief for loss be same with archie who in world must miss archie clavering what man woman must find world to be le bright because archie clavering be sleeping beneath wave score of men at club must talk of poor clavvy for few day must do so without pretence at tenderness of sorrow then even of archie memory there must be end thinking of a be carried down to clavering harry must not acknowledge that loss to world have not be great even while telling must not allow to take comfort in prospect of heirship once perhaps did speculate how florence must bear honour a lady clavering idea swept away from thought a quickly a be able tidings have reached parsonage very late on previous night so late that rector have be

that rejoiced at what have happened man idea of generosity change a advance in age rector be old enough to tell boldly that thing have happened must not be to cause of much grief have never loved cousin pretended to love cousin wife did love after fashion in speaking to own wife of way in tragedy must affect hermione did not scruple to speak of widowhood a period of coming happiness will be cut to piece said mr clavering be attached to a earnestly a though have treated always well believe not le will feel release unconsciously life have be very wretched will gradually become easy to even mr clavering must not deny that must be so then reverted to matter more closely concerned suppose harry will marry at once now said mother doubt be almost pity be not rector a will still call be

very fond of upon word ca understand said rector be so a to excellence of character there can be doubt to rector made answer went away into dressing room that might prepare for walk across park to great house while be discussing who must be future incumbent of living lady clavering be still sleeping in unconsciousness of fate mr clavering greatly dreaded task be before have made little attempt to induce wife to take office upon herself have explained to that must be more seemly that must be bearer of tidings must seem that be wanting in affection for if go wife have said to that rector of clavering be master of of own action one who knew family ever denied instance in declined to follow wife advice be not many be about eight o'clock when went across park have already sent messenger

object harry on occasion asked question about living also have thought of that knew well that mother must befriend mr saul knew also that father must ultimately take mother advice a regarded have personal objection to mr saul though must not understand how sister must feel strong regard for such man edward fielding must make better neighbour at parsonage then thought whether exchange might not be made after before mother return from great house took stroll through park with fanny fanny altogether declined to discus of family prospect a be affected by accident have happened to mind tragedy be so terrible that must only feel tragic element doubt have own thought about mr saul a connected with must think of sudden death of two brother how must feel if must be allowed to talk to on matter what must say of fate here hereafter must go to great house to offer consolation of religion to widow of thought much picture of mr saul a rector of clavering of a mistress in mother house presented to mind harry found to be dull companion perhaps consoled with personal attention to oak tree tree loomed larger upon now than have ever done before on third day rector went up to london leaving harry

having be in town for three day rector returned being then in full possession of title did not assume till after second sunday from date of telegram brought news in meantime harry have written to florence to whom tidings be a important a to one concerned have left london very triumphant quite confident that have nothing now to fear from lady ongar from other living woman having not only forgiven harry sin having succeeded also in persuading that there have be no sin to forgive having quarrelled with brother half dozen time in must not accept argument on matter too must forgive harry have forgiven be quite ready to omit further remark on matter must not bring when urged by florence to admit that apollo have be altogether godlike florence have thus left london in triumph have gone with conviction that harry must remain apart for indefinite time probably must be measured by year let see at end of two year have said harry have be forced to be content how must be with now harry of course began letter by telling of catastrophe with usual amount of epithet be very terrible awful shocking saddest thing have ever happened poor widow be in desperate state claverings be nearly beside when have be duly said allowed to go into own home question can not fail wrote to think of chiefly a concern rather a concern in reference to suppose will leave business now indeed father seems to think that remaining there must be absurd mother agrees with a be only son property will enable to live easily without profession when say ' of course will understand what bee mean better part of bee be so prudent that know will not accept view of thing without ever so much consideration therefore must come to clavering to hear discussed by elder for can not bear to think must take delight in result of dreadful misfortune how be to keep from being made happy by feeling that may now be married without further delay after have passed nothing will make happy even permanently comfortable till can call fairly own mother have already said that hope will come here in about fortnight be a soon a will have fallen tolerably into place again will write before time have written line to brother addressed to office suppose will find have written also to cecilia brother doubt will hear news first through french newspaper then said little very little a to future mode of life just intimating to more that destiny might probably call upon to be mother of future baronet news have reached clavering on saturday on following sunday one in parish have doubt heard of nothing on subject be said in church on day rector remained at home during morning whole service be performed by mr saul on second sunday mr fielding have come over from humbleton preached sermon on loss parish have sustained in sudden death of two brother be perhaps well that such sermon must be preached inhabitant of clavering must have felt that late lord have be treated like dog have word be said of in house of god nature of fate have forbidden even common ceremony of burial service be well that respect must be maintained from low in station towards who be high even when respect have be deserved for widow sake be well that notice must be taken in clavering of death of head of claverings must not myself have liked duty of preaching eulogistic sermon on life death of hugh clavering brother archie what have of ever done to merit good word from man to earn love of woman sir hugh have be loved by wife have come from nature of woman not at from quality of man of brother have lived on unexpressed theory of consuming for benefit of own back own belly greatest possible amount of good thing fortune might put in way doubt whether of have ever contributed anything willingly to comfort happiness of human being hugh being powerful by nature having strong will have tyrannized over who be subject to archie not gifted a be brother have be milder softer le actively hateful principle of action have be same everything for be not well that two such men must be consigned to fish that world especially clavering world poor widow who now felt to be so inexpressibly wretched when period of comfort be in truth only commencing be not well that world clavering must be well quit of idea be one one must naturally have felt inclined to put into one sermon on occasion then to sing song of rejoicing to do to leave matter alone not so be such sermon preached not after fashion did young clergyman who have married first cousin of claverings buckle to subject indeed have think little difficulty inwardly with conscience outwardly with subject possessed power of pleasant easy flow of word of producing tear if not from other eye at rate from own drew picture of little ship amidst storm of god hand a moved in anger upon water of cause of divine wrath direction said nothing then of suddenness of death awfulness said much not insisting a did so on necessity of repentance for salvation a far a two poor sinner be concerned indeed how must preacher have done improved occasion by telling around that must so live a to be ever ready for hand of death if be possible where then indeed must be victory of grave at last came to master lord whom have lost even here there be difficulty for heir have gone first then father brother who among must not pity bereaved mother widow who among must not remember with affection babe whom have seen at font with respect landlord under whose rule have lived how pleasant must be to ask question one can rise to answer farmer gubbins a sat by listening with what power of attention have be vouchsafed to felt to be somewhat moved soon released from task allowed mind to run away into other idea rector be kindly man generous rector must allow to enclose little bit of common land be to be taken in without adding anything to rent rector must be there on audit day thing must be very pleasant farmer gubbins when slight murmuring gurgle of preacher tear be heard shook own head by way of responsive wail at moment be congratulating on coming comfort of new reign mr fielding however got great credit for sermon did probably more good than harm unless indeed must take into calculation in giving award on subject permanent utility of truth permanent injury of falsehood mr fielding remained at parsonage during greater part of following week then there took place great deal of family conversation respecting future incumbent of living at family conclave however fanny be not asked to be present mr clavering who knew well how to do such work be gradually bringing husband round to endure name of mr saul twenty time have asserted that must not understand whether such understanding might ever be possible be beginning to recognize a true that thing not understood be fact daughter fanny be positively in love with mr saul to extent that mother believed happiness to be involved in ca understand upon word ca said rector for last time then gave way there be now mean of giving ample provision for lover provision be to be given mr fielding shook head not in instance a to fanny predilection for mr saul though in discussing that matter with own wife have shaken head very often shook now with reference to proposed change be very well where be although clavering be better than humbleton be not so much better a to induce to throw own family over by proposing to send mr saul among mr saul be excellent clergyman perhaps uncle who have given living might not like mr saul thus be decided in conclave mr saul be to be future rector of clavering in meantime poor fanny moped wretched in solitude anticipating such glorious joy a mother be preparing for mr saul be preparing with energy for departure into foreign part chapter xlv be mad lady ongar be at tenby

task most certainly within grasp of man woman who attempt ala if habit be not there of task be most difficult if man have not acquired habit of reading till be old will sooner in old age learn to make shoe than learn adequate use of book worse again under such circumstance making of shoe will be more pleasant to than reading of book let who be not old who be still young ponder well lady ongar indeed be not old by mean too old to clothe in new habit even be old enough to find that doing so be matter of much difficulty have book around in spite of book be sadly in want of excitement when letter from clavering came to relief be indeed relief brother in law dead also who have so lately be suitor two men whom have so lately seen in lusty health proud with pride of outward life have both by stroke of wind be turned into nothing terrible retribution have fallen upon enemy for a enemy have ever regarded hugh clavering since husband death took joy in retribution there be feeling of triumph at heart in have perished did not tell that be glad either for own sake for sister mingled with awe felt there be something of unexpressed inexpressible relief present life be very grievous to

before went across to house doubting whether must not be better to let julia go without troubling with further interview have not then seen even lady clavering since tidings of bereavement have come felt that must not be well that must let cousin widow leave clavering without offering sympathy might be better also that must see julia once again if only that might show capable of meeting without exhibition of peculiar emotion went therefore to house having asked for lady clavering saw sister together soon found that presence of younger one be relief to lady clavering be so sad so peevish in sadness so broken spirited so far a yet from recognizing great enfranchisement have come to that with alone must have found almost unable to express sympathy felt with lady ongar have difficulty lady ongar sister being with in room talked to easily a though there have never be anything between to make conversation difficult that word between must on occasion a be sad be matter of course seemed to harry that julia have freed from effect of feeling have existed between that must become to do a effectually a have done such idea at least be in mind for moment when left spoke one word dispelled harry said must ask miss burton to come across see hear that be to be at rectory to morrow harry of course said that must send will understand why can not go to a must do for poor hermy position will

rival rival who have almost be preferred to nay who have be preferred to for short space of time whose claim a to beauty wealth be so greatly superior to own woman whom be to see have be first love of man whom now regarded a own must have be about to be wife at moment have not be for own treachery to be so beautiful a people said florence in bottom of heart wished that might have be saved from interview three lady from rectory found two lady at great house sitting together in small drawing room florence be so confused that must hardly bring to speak to lady clavering so much a to look at lady ongar shook hand with elder sister knew that hand be then taken by other julia at first spoke very few word to mr clavering fanny sat down beside hermione florence took chair at little distance be left there for few minute without notice for be very thankful by degree be able to fix eye on face of woman whom so feared to see yet on whom so desired to look lady clavering be mass of ill arranged widow weed have assumed in grotesque ugliness paraphernalia of outward woe woman have be condemned to wear in order that for time may be shorn of charm of sex nothing must be more proper unbecoming than heavy drooping shapeless blackness in lady clavering have enveloped lady ongar though also widow though a yet widow of not twelve month standing be dressed in weed doubt in weed have be so cultivated that be a good a flower be very beautiful florence owned to herself a sat there in silence that lady ongar be most beautiful woman that have ever seen hers be not beauty by a must have thought harry clavering must have be attracted lady ongar form bust face be at period of life almost majestic whereas softness grace of womanhood be charm harry loved have sometimes said to florence to taste cecilia burton be almost perfect a woman there must be contrast greater than between cecilia burton lady ongar florence did not remember that julia brabazon of three year since have not be same a lady ongar whom now saw when have be there minute lady ongar came sat beside florence moving seat a though be doing most natural thing in world florence heart came to mouth made

dined with sister poor fellow be not odd that must have gone that friend whose yacht be must have be saved say however that mr stuart behaved admirably begging friend to get into boat first stayed by vessel when boat be carried away be saved in way meant to do best must for there be doubt of how dreadful feeling must be men think so much of thing a do have so much more to employ mind think so florence did not at moment quite know what thought about men feeling said that supposed that such be case think that after be juster than be continued lady ongar juster truer though not so tender hearted mr stuart doubt must have be willing to drown to save friend because fault be in degree know must have be able to do so much in such moment must have be so difficult to think of what ought to be done yes indeed there be little good in speculating upon now know place do not house mean garden not very well florence a answered question began again to tremble take turn with will show garden hat cloak be in hall then florence got up to accompany trembling very much inwardly miss burton be going out for few minute said lady ongar addressing to mr clavering will not keep waiting very long be in hurry said mr clavering then florence be carried off found alone with conquered rival not that there be much to show said lady ongar indeed nothing place must be of more interest to than to one

not one to think evil a take of anybody much le of whom love when saw again free a be when saw thinking also to be free be strange that memory of old day must come back upon fault if fault there have be be mine have never said that there be fault miss burton others have said so no doubt be foolish to talk to in way have not yet said that desired to say be simply that begrudge happiness wished same happiness to be mine be not mine might have be forfeited be past will pray that may enjoy long will not refuse to receive congratulation indeed will not to think of a friend of husband oh be then have shown garden now may go in day perhaps when be lady paramount here child be running about place may come again to see if will have hope will lady ongar in truth hope so be odd enough that said to once

died be not quite true for here be have not yet got wife be odd be not can not think what must have made say that spirit of prophecy come on one sometimes suppose well will go in have shown wonder of garden told wonder connected with of know aught doubt there must be other wonder more wonderful if one must ransack private history of claverings for last hundred year hope miss burton that marvel may attend career here may be happy marvel then took florence by hand drawing close to stooped over kissed will think fool of course said care for florence now be in tear must make answer in word pressed hand still held then followed companion back into house after that visit be soon brought to end three lady from rectory returned across park to house chapter xlviii conclusion florence burton have taken upon to say that mr clavering must have difficulty in making to mr saul communication be now needed before must be received at rectory a rector successor future son in law mr clavering be by mean so confident of own power to seemed a though undertaking have in hand be one surrounded with difficulty husband when matter be being discussed at once made understand that must not relieve by offer to perform task have be made to break bad news to lady clavering having be submissive in matter felt able to stand aloof altogether a to more difficult embassy suppose must hardly do to ask harry to see again mr clavering have said must do much better dear rector have replied then mr clavering have submitted in turn when scheme be fully matured time have come in making of proposition must no longer be delayed with prudence mr saul be summoned by short note dear mr saul if be disengaged must come to at rectory at eleven to morrow yours ever m c mr saul of course said that must come when to morrow have arrived breakfast be over rector harry took off somewhere about ground of great house counting up treasure of proprietorship a can fancy men so circumstanced must do while mary fielding with fanny florence retired upstairs so that might be well out of way knew of be about to be done fanny behaved like white lamb decked with bright ribbon for sacrificial altar to be sacrificial morning very sacred very solemn very trying to nerve think that girl be ever in such position before said to sister great many girl must be glad to be in same position mr fielding replied do think so to there be something almost humiliating in idea that must be asked to take fiddlestick dear replied mr fielding mr saul came punctual a church clock of have regulating be shown into rectory dining room where mr clavering be sitting alone looked a ever did serious composed ill dressed like gentleman of course must have supposed that present rector must make change in mode of living must not be surprised that must have be summoned to rectory be surprised that summons must have come from mr clavering not from rector appeared to that old enmity must be very enduring if even now mr clavering must not bring to see curate on matter of business seems long time since have seen here mr saul said mr clavering yes when have remembered how often used to be here absence have seemed long strange have be source of great grief to to mr clavering a circumstance then be in truth must not be avoided common prudence made necessary think so mr saul if ask must answer according to own idea common prudence must not have made necessary at least not according to view of thing common prudence with different people mean such different thing be not going to quarrel with idea of common prudence mr clavering mr clavering have begun badly be aware of must have said nothing about past have foreseen from first danger of doing so have be unable to rush at once into golden future hope will have more quarrelling at rate said there will be none on part only mr clavering must not suppose from saying so that intend to give up pretension word from daughter must make do so word from one else ought to be very proud of such constancy on part mr saul have doubt will be mr saul did not understand made reply to know whether have heard that mr clavering intends to give up living have not heard have thought probable that must do so have made up mind that will fact be that if held must neglect property will not stop at moment to examine what mr saul idea must have be a to exigency of property must leave time for performance of such clerical duty a have fallen for year past to share of rector hope that may be allowed to take part in service mean to resign living suppose will not much affect for little time have to remain think will affect hope that may mr clavering wish to accept living to accept living for moment even mr saul looked a though be surprised yes mr saul to be rector of clavering if see objection to arrangement be most munificent offer a strange a be munificent unless indeed then glimpse of truth made way into chink of mr saul mind mr clavering must no doubt have made offer to have not be that can perhaps speak to about dear fanny better than must do though prudence have not be quite to mind can at rate understand that might very much object to marrying when there be nothing for to live on even though have objection to yourself personally mr clavering did object on ground be not aware that have done so if so such objection be now made by by idea be that child must be allowed to consult own heart to indulge own choice provided that in doing so doe not prepare for life of indigence must be life of misery of course providing also that there be strong personal objection life of indigence need not be life of misery said mr saul with obstinacy formed so great part of character well well be very indigent be not at miserable if be to be made miserable by what be use of teaching at rate competence be comfortable too comfortable a mr saul made exclamation mr clavering must not wonder at daughter taste matter have gone too far now for possibility of receding will not refuse a will be accompanied by what say still desire will not refuse may god give grace so to use rich of world that become not stumbling block to rock of offence be possible that camel must be made to go through needle eye be possible position know be not one of great wealth be to who have barely hitherto have mean of support will tell husband from will accept endeavour not to betray double trust proposes to confer on be much that must give to daughter will be to bone of bone flesh of flesh if god will give grace thereto will watch over so that harm will come nigh love her a apple of eye be thankful very thankful that rich gift must be made to be sure that love mr saul continued not marking interruption that other trust be one still greater requiring more tender care even closer sympathy will feel that soul of people will be a be in hand that will be called upon to give account of welfare will strive will strive also will be with to help when mr clavering described scene to husband shook head there came over face smile in there be much of melancholy a said ah yes be very well now will settle down a other men do suppose when have four five child around such be idea experience of outgoing elder clergyman taught to entertain a to ecstatic piety of younger brother be mr clavering who suggested to mr saul that perhaps must like to see fanny did when story have be told be preparing to leave certainly if will come to will make promise said mr clavering will see then went upstairs to room where girl be sitting sacrificial lamb be sent down into drawing room suppose if say so mamma think dear that have better see will meet then more comfortably afterwards so fanny went into drawing room mr saul be sent to there what passed between reader of page will understand few young lady fear will envy fanny clavering lover will remember love will still be lord of will acknowledge that have done much to deserve success in life have come in way be long before old rector must reconcile to new rector new son in law mr clavering have now so warmly taken up fanny part have so completely assumed mother interest in coming marriage mr clavering sir henry a may now call have found obliged to abstain from repeating to wonder with still regarded daughter choice to harry must still be eloquent on subject of course be right now said be very good young man nobody must work harder in parish always thought be very lucky to have such assistant upon word can not understand fanny can not indeed have be taken by religious side of character said harry yes of course doubt be very gratifying to to see that think so much of religion must be first consideration with of at time have never be used to men like mr saul nobody can deny that be gentleman yes be gentleman god forbid must say be not especially now that be going to marry sister know whether quite understand what mean think do be quite one of sort how on earth can ever have brought to look at in light there be accounting for taste sir after a be to have living there will be nothing to regret nothing to regret suppose will be up at other house occasionally never must make anything of when dined at rectory perhaps will be better there perhaps when be married will get into way of drinking glass of wine like anybody else dear fanny hope will be happy be everything in answer to harry took upon to assure father that fanny must be happy then changed conversation discussed alteration must make in reference to preservation of pheasant mr saul fanny remained long together on occasion when parted went off about work not saying word to other person in house betook a fast a foot must carry to own room said not word to mother to sister to florence a to what have passed at interview when be first seen by of be very grave in demeanour very silent when father congratulated did with a much cordiality a be able to assume kissed thanked for care kindness even did almost solemnly ah see how be to be said old rector to wife there be to be no more cake ale in parish then wife reminded of what have said of change must take place in mr saul way when must have lot of child running about foot then can only hope that will begin to run about very soon said old rector to sister mary fielding fanny said little nothing of coming marriage to florence who a regarded that event be in same position a herself frequently did express feeling declaring how awful to be responsibility of thing be about to do of course be quite true said florence doe make one doubt that one be right to marry know said fanny when think of doe almost make doubt then if be mr saul must not let think of at ah show that understand must be first to advise to hesitate if thought that that know can quite express what mean under circumstance mr saul wo think that oh florence be too serious for laughing be indeed then florence also hoped that time might come shortly in mr saul might moderate view though did not express exactly a rector have done immediately after florence went back to stratton in order that might pas what remained to of freedom with mother father that might prepare for wedding affair with be so much hurried that have hardly time to give mind to consideration be weighing so heavily on fanny mind be felt by burton especially by cecilia that there be need for extension of view in regard to millinery seeing that florence be to marry eldest son heir of baronet old mr burton be awed almost into quiescence by reflection came upon when thought of breakfast of presence of sir henry clavering at once summoned daughter in law from ramsgate to assistance felt that experience gathered from wedding breakfast of so many elder daughter must hardly carry through difficulty of present occasion two widowed sister be still at great house when sir henry clavering with harry fanny went to stratton left on following day father son went up together to bid farewell on eve of departure to press upon over over again fact that be still to regard claverings of clavering park a nearest relation friend elder sister simply cried when be said to cried easily with plenteous tear till weed enveloped seemed to be damp from ever running fountain hitherto to weep have be only refuge think that even have already become preferable to former life lady ongar assured sir henry mr clavering a be still called till after departure that must always remember accept kindness will come to said certainly when can make hermy come will be better when summer be here then after will think about on occasion seemed to be quite cheerful bade harry farewell with frank affection of old friend have given up house in bolton street said to where do mean to live anywhere just a may suit hermy what difference doe make be going to tenby now though tenby seems to to have a few attraction a place ever knew daresay will stay there simply because will be there be consideration weighs most with such old woman a be good by harry good by julia hope that may yet see hermy happy before long know much about happiness harry there come dream of sometimes such a have got now will answer for will never hear of being down hearted at least not on own account added in whisper poor hermy may sometimes drag down will do best harry tell wife that will write to occasionally once year something like so that need not be afraid good by harry good by julia so parted immediately on arrival at tenby lady ongar communicated to mr turnbull intention of giving back to courton family not only place called ongar park also whole of income with exception of eight hundred year so that in respect might be equal to sister brought mr turnbull down to tenby there be interview after interview between countess lawyer proposition however be made to courtons be absolutely refused by ongar park be accepted on behalf of mother of present earl a regarded money widow of late earl be assured by elder surviving brother that one doubted right to must be party to accepting from then said lady ongar will accumulate in hand can leave a please in will a to that one can control said brother in law who went to tenby to see must not be angry if advise not to make such resolution such hoard never have good result good result however did come from effort poor broken spirited woman be making that intimacy at last close friendship be formed between relative of deceased lord now story be done reader will easily understand what must be future life of harry clavering wife after completion of tour in italy birth of heir preparation for made tour somewhat shorter than harry have intended father of course gave up to shooting farming of home farm after while management of property sir henry preached occasionally believing to preach much oftener than did usually performed portion of morning service oh yes said theodore burton in answer to comfortable remark from wife providence have done
