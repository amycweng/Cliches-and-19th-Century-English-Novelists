unconsciously promised to certain delight in talking perhaps walking with owner of walking have not be achievednor even talking a yet truth be that dunn be bashful with young woman though must be so stiff necked with minister then felt angry with inasmuch a have advanced no further a lay in bedwhich perhaps pretty hand have helped to makehe resolved that must be thought bolder in bearing have

stick to work said hetta doubt have amusement when be in city added elder sister not wishing to leave too strong impression of young man virtue have now settled place in parlour hetta sat on one side of fire close to table having side to herself there sat always busy must have made dress bit of linen worn in house hemmed sheet towel so busy be always sometimes once in week so phineas beckard must come in then place be made for between hettas usual seat table for when there must read out loud on other side close also to table sat widow busy not savagely busy a elder daughter between mr bell

when frost come have have have more ought ill tell mcevoy mcevoy have be former engineer on line well that wont burst with frost guess oh how pretty said widow then susan of course jumped up to look over mother shoulder artful dodger have drawn coloured beautiful little sketch of bridge not engineer plan with section measurement vexatious to woman eye graceful little bridge with string of car running under must almost hear bell going well be pretty bridge said susan isnt hetta dont know anything about bridge said hetta to whose clever eye dodge be quite apparent in spite of cleverness mr bell susan have soon moved chair round to table be looking through content of aaron portfolio yet may be wolf thought poor widow just a be kneeling down to say prayer that evening certainly made commencement though hetta went on pertinaciously with body of new dress other two lady did not put in stitch night from drawing aaron got to instrument before bedtime be teaching susan how to draw parallel line susan found that have quite aptitude for parallel line altogether have good time of that evening be dull to go on week after week month after month talking only to one mother sister be dull though one doe not recognise to be so little change in such matter be so very pleasant susan have not slightest idea of regarding aaron a even possible lover young lady do like conversation of young gentleman oh exceedingly proper prim old lady who be so shocked at a general doctrine have never occurred to that creator have so intended susan understanding little of how why knew that have have good time be rather in spirit a went to bed hetta have be frightened by dodge oh hetta must have looked at drawing be so clever said susan dont know that must have done much good replied hetta good well theyd do more good than long sermon know said susan except on sunday of course added apologetically be ill tempered attack on hetta hettas admirer then why have hetta be so snappish im sure he wolf thought hetta a went to bed what very clever young man be thought susan to a pulled warm clothes round about shoulder ear well that certainly be improvement thought aaron a went through same operation with stronger feeling of self approbation than have enjoyed for time past in course of next fortnight family arrangement altered unless when beckard be there aaron must sit in widow place widow must take susans chair two girl must be opposite then dunn must read to not sermon passage from shakspeare byron longfellow read much better than mr beckard susan have said one night of course youre competent judge have be hettas retort mean that like better said susan well that people dont think alike replied hetta then there be deal of talking widow a unconscious in respect a youngest daughter certainly did find that little variety be agreeable on long winter night talked with unaccustomed freedom beckard came there oftener talked very much when be there two young men did talking pounded other immensely still there grew up sort of friendship between mr beckard seems quite to take to said mr bell to eldest daughter be great good nature mother replied hetta be at end of second month when aaron took step in advancea perilous step sometimes on evening still went on with drawing for hour so during three four evening never asked one to look at what be doing on one friday sat over work till late without reading talking at so late that at last mr bell said if youre going to sit much longer mr dunn ill get to put out candle thereby showing have known have that mother confidence in young man be growing fast hetta knew about dreaded that growth be too quick ive finished now said aaron looked carefully at cardboard on have be washing in water colour ive finished now then hesitated moment ultimately put card into portfolio carried up to bedroom who doe not perceive that be intended a present to susan bell question aaron asked that night hardly knew how to answer be must offer drawing to susan in presence of mother sister on occasion when two might be alone together such occasion have ever yet occurred aaron thought that might probably be brought about then wanted to make fuss about first intention have be to chuck drawing lightly across table when be completed so make nothing of have finished with more care than have at first intended then have hesitated when have finished be too late now for plan of chucking over table on saturday evening when came down from room mr beckard be there there be opportunity night on sunday in conformity with previous engagement went to hear mr beckard preach walked to from meeting with family pleased mr bell be very gracious that afternoon sunday be day for picture on thing have become of importance to thing always do when be kept over before tea that evening when came down mr bell susan only be in room knew hetta for foe therefore determined to use occasion miss susan said stammering somewhat blushing too poor fool have done little drawing want to accept put portfolio down on table oh dont know said susan who have seen blush mr bell have seen blush also pursed mouth up looked grave have there be stammering blush might have thought nothing of aaron saw at once that little gift be not to go down smoothly be however in for now so picked out from among other paper in case brought over to susan endeavoured to hand to with air of indifference can not say that succeeded be very pretty well finished water coloured drawing representing still same bridge with more adjunct in susans eye be work of high art of picture probably have seen little liking for artist doubt added to admiration more admired wished for stronger be feeling that ought not to take poor susan stood for minute looking at drawing said nothing not even word of praise felt that be red in face uncourteous to lodger mother be looking at did not know how to behave mr bell put out hand for sketch trying to bethink a did so in what least uncivil way must refuse present took moment to look at collecting thought a did so woman wit came to aid oh dear mr dunn be very pretty quite beautiful picture can not let susan rob of that must keep that for of own particular friend did for said aaron innocently susan looked down at ground half pleased at declaration drawing must look very pretty in small gilt frame put over dressing table matter now be altogether in mother hand be afraid be too valuable sir for susan to accept be not valuable at said aaron declining to take back from widow hand oh be quite sure be be worth ten dollar at leastor twenty said poor mr bell not in very best taste be perplexed did not know how to get out of scrape article in question now lay upon table cloth appropriated by one at moment hetta came into room be not worth ten cent said aaron with something like frown on brow a have be talking about bridge thought miss susan must accept accept what said hetta then eye fell upon drawing took up be beautifully done said mr bell wishing much to soften matter perhaps more so that hetta demure be now present be telling mr dunn that cant take present of anything so valuable oh dear said hetta wouldnt be right be cold frosty evening in march fire be burning brightly on hearth aaron dunn took up drawing quietlyvery quietlyand rolling up a such drawing be rolled put between blazing log be work of four evening chef duvre in way of art susan when saw what have done burst out into tear widow must very readily have done so also be able to refrain merely exclaimedoh mr dunn if mr dunn chooses to burn own picture have certainly right to do so said hetta aaron immediately felt ashamed of what have done also must have cried for manliness walked away to one of parlour window looked out upon frosty night be dark star be bright thought that must like to be walking fast by along line of rail towards balston there stood perhaps for three minute thought must be proper to give susan time to recover from tear will please to come to tea sir said soft voice of mr bell turned round to do so found that susan be gone be not quite in power to recover from tear in three minute then drawing have be so beautiful have be done expressly for too there have be something knew not what in eye a have so declared have watched intently over four evening work wondering why did not show till feminine curiosity have become rather strong be something very particular be sure have learned that precious work have be for now that precious work be destroyed how be possible that must not cry for more than three minute others took meal in perfect silence when be over two woman sat down to work aaron have book pretended to read instead of reading be bethinking that have behaved badly what right have to throw into such confusion by indulging in passion be ashamed of what have done fancied that susan must hate fancying that began to find at same time that by mean hated at last hetta got up left room knew that sister be sitting alone in cold hetta be affectionate susan have not be in fault therefore hetta went up to console mr bell said aaron a soon a door be closed beg pardon for what did just now oh sir im so sorry that picture be burnt said poor mr bell picture doe not matter straw said aaron see have disturbed alland be afraid have made miss susan unhappy be grieved because picture be burnt said mr bell putting emphasis on intending to show that daughter have not regarded drawing a own emphasis bore meaning so widow perceived a soon a have spoken oh can do twenty more of same if anybody wanted said aaron if do like will let take mr belljust to show that have forgiven that be friend a be before be be not wolf be question mr bell scarcely knew how to answer hetta have given voice saying be lupine mr beckards opinion have not liked to ask directly mr beckard thought must probably propose to hetta a yet have not done so a be still stranger in family did not like in way to compromise susans name indirectly have asked question indirectly also mr beckards answer have be favourable mustnt mean anything sir be widow weak answer when have paused on question for moment oh of course not said aaron joyously face became radiant happy do beg pardon for burning young lady pardon too then rapidly got out cardboard set to work about bridge widow meditating many thing in heart commenced hemming of handkerchief in about hour two girl came back to room silently took accustomed place aaron hardly looked up went on diligently with drawing bridge must be better bridge than other acceptance be now assured of course be to mean nothing be matter of course so worked away diligently said nothing to anybody when went off to bed two girl went into mother room oh mother hope be not very angry said susan angry said hetta if anybody must be angry be mother ought to have known susan must not accept must never have offered he doing said mr bell not for said hetta yes be said mr bell have promised that will take susan a heard sank gently into chair behind eye became full of tear intimation be almost too much for oh mother said hetta particularly said that be to mean nothing oh mother make worse why must hetta interfere in way thought susan to herself have interfered when mr beckard gave testament bound in morocco have not smiled looked gratified kissed sister declared that phineas beckard be nice dear man by far most elegant preacher at spring why must hetta be so cruel dont see that dear said mother hetta must not explain before sister so went to bed on thursday evening drawing be finished not word have be said about at rate in presence have gone on working in silence there said late on thursday evening dont know that will be better if go on daubing for hour there miss susan there bridge hope will burst with frost yet be destroyed by fire gave light flip with finger sent skimming over table susan blushed smiled took up oh be beautiful said isnt beautifully done mother then three got up to look at confessed that be excellently done be sure be very much obliged to said susan after pause remembering that have not yet thanked oh nothing said not quite liking word on following day returned from work to saratoga about noon have never done before therefore one expected that must be seen in house before evening on occasion however went straight thither a chance must have widow elder daughter be out susan be there alone in charge of house walked in opened parlour door there sat with foot on fender with work unheeded on table behind picture aaron drawing lying on knee be gazing at intently a entered thinking in young heart that possessed beauty picture must posse oh mr dunn said getting up holding telltale sketch behind skirt of dress miss susan have come here to tell mother must start for new york afternoon be there for six week perhaps longer mother be out said im so sorry be said aaron hetta too dear youll be wanting dinner ill go see about aaron began to swear that must not possibly eat dinner have dined once be going to dine againanything to keep from going must have something mr dunn walked towards door put back to miss susan said guess ive be here nearly two month yes sir believe have replied shaking in shoe not knowing way to look hope have be good friend yes sir said susan almost beside a to what be saying im going away now seems to be such time before ill be back will sir six week miss susan then paused looking into eye to see what must read there leant against table pulling to piece morsel of half ravelled muslin held in hand eye be turned to ground must hardly see miss susan continued may a well speak out now a at time too be looking towards ground clearly did not know what to do with hand truth be just ii love dearly with heart never saw one ever thought so beautiful so nice so goodand whats more never will im not very good at sort of thing know couldnt go away from saratoga for six week not tell then ceased did not ask for love in return presumption have not got so far a yet merely declared passion leaning against door there stood twiddling thumb susan have not slightest conception of way in ought to receive declaration have never have lover before have ever thought of aaron absolutely a lover though something very like love for have be crossing over spirit now at moment felt that be beau idal of manhood though boot be covered with railway mud though pantaloon be tucked up in roll round ankle be fine well grown open faced fellow whose eye be bold yet tender whose brow be full broad bearing manly love of course loved why else have heart melted with pleasure when mother said that second picture be to be accepted what be to say anything open truth well knew that open truth must not do at what must mother say hetta if be rashly to say that hetta knew must be dead against lover of mother approbation have hardly more hope why must disapprove of aaron a lover have never asked there be many nice thing seem to be wrong only because be so nice maybe that susan regarded lover a one of oh mr dunn shouldnt that in fact be that must say must not said well perhaps not there truth harm ever come of perhaps id better not ask for answer now thought better must know remember thisi only care for one thing now in world be for love then paused thinking possibly that in spite of what have said might perhaps get sort of answer inkling of state of heart disposition towards susan have at once resolved to take at word when suggested that immediate reply be not necessary to say that loved be of course impossible to say that did not be equally so determined therefore to close at once with offer of silence when ceased speaking there be moment pause during strove hard to read what might be written on down turned face be not good at such reading well guess ill go get thing ready now said then turned round to open door mother will be in before be gone suppose said susan have only got twenty minute said looking at watch susan tell what have said to goodbye put out hand knew must see again have be plan to get hand in good bye mr dunn gave hand held tight for moment so that must not draw awaycould not if must will tell mother asked yes answered quite in whisper guess id better tell then gave long sigh pressed hand again got up to lip mr dunn dont said did kiss god bless own dearest dearest girl ill just open door a come down perhaps mr bell will be here then rushed up stair mr bell did not come in hetta be at weekly service at mr beckards meeting house mr beckard seemed have much to say susan when left alone sat down tried to think must not think must only love must use mind only in recounting to herself perfection of demigod whose heavy step be so audible overhead a walked to fro collecting thing putting into bag then just when have finished bethought that must be hungry flew to kitchen be too late before must even reach at loaf of bread descended stair with clattering noise heard voice a spoke quickly to kate obrien miss susan said dont get anything for for im off oh mr dunn be so sorry youll be so hungry on journey came out to in passage will want nothing on journey dearest if youll say one kind word to again eye went to ground what do want to say mr dunn say god bless aaron god bless aaron said yet be sure that have not declared love however thought otherwise went up to new york with happy heart thing happened in next fortnight rather quickly susan at once resolved to tell mother resolved also not to tell hetta afternoon got mother to herself in mr bell own room then made clean breast of what did say to susan said nothing mother nothing dear mother not word told didnt want forgot how have used christian name in bidding god bless oh dear said widow be very wrong asked susan what do think child asked mr bell after while be own feeling mr bell be sitting on chair susan be standing opposite to against post of bed made answer moving from place threw into mother arm hid face on mother shoulder be easy enough to guess what be feeling darling said mother must not think that be engagement said susan sorrowfully young men say thing to amuse wolf must have said have spoken out mind freely oh mother be not like that daughter contrived to extract promise from mother hetta must not be told just at present mr bell calculated that have six week before a yet mr beckard have not spoken out there be reason to suppose that must do so before six week must be over then must be able to seek counsel from mr beckard spoke out at end of six day hetta frankly accepted hope youll love brother in law said to susan oh will indeed said susan in softness of heart at moment almost made up mind to tell hetta be full of own affair thus passed off be then arranged that hetta must go spend week with mr beckards parent old mr beckard be farmer living near utica now that match be declared approved be thought well that hetta must know future husband family so went for week mr beckard went with will be back in plenty of time for to speak to before aaron dunns six week be over said mr bell to herself thing did not go exactly a expected on very morning after departure of engaged couple there came letter from aaron saying that must be at saratoga very evening railway people have ordered down again for day special work then be to go elsewhere not to return to saratoga till june hoped so said letter mr bell must not turn into street even then though summer might have come regular lodger might be expected oh dear oh dear said mr bell to herself reflecting that have one of whom must ask advice that must decide very day why have let beckard go without telling then told susan susan spent day trembling perhaps thought mr bell will say nothing about in such case however must not be duty to say something poor mother trembled nearly a much a susan be dark when fatal knock came at door tea thing be already laid tea cake be already baked for must at rate be necessary to give mr dunn tea susan when heard knock rushed from chair took refuge up stair widow gave long sigh settled dress kate obrien with willing step opened door bade old friend welcome how be lady asked aaron trying to gather something from face voice of domestic miss hetta mr beckard be gone off to utica just man wife like so be more power to oh indeed im very glad said aaronand so be very glad to have hetta demure out of way then made way into parlour doubting much hoping much mr bell rose from chair tried to look grave aaron glancing round room saw that susan be not there walked straight up to widow offered hand took might be that susan have not thought fit to tell in such case must not be right for to compromise so said never word subject be too important to mother to allow of being silent when young man stood before oh mr dunn said what be have be saying to susan have asked to be wife said drawing up looking full in face mr bell heart be almost a soft a daughter be nearly gone at moment have nothing to say oh dear oh dear may not call mother said taking hand in oh dearoh dear will be good to oh aaron dunn if deceive child in quarter of hour susan be kneeling at mother knee with face on mother lap mother be wiping tear out of eye aaron be standing by holding one of widow hand be mother too now said what must hetta mr beckard say when came back then surely be not wolf there be four five day left for courtship before hetta mr beckard must return four five day during susan might be happy aaron triumphant mr bell nervous day have said after be only evening be so left morning susan got up to give aaron breakfast mr bell got up also susan boldly declared right to do so mr bell found objection must urge after aaron be always absent till seven eight in evening when must return to tea then came hour two of lover intercourse be very tame hour widow still felt undefined fear that be wrong though heart yearned to know that daughter be happy in sweet happiness of accepted love yet dreaded to be too confident not word have be said about money matter not word of aaron dunns relative so did not leave by waited with what patience must for return of wise counsellor then susan hardly knew how to behave with accepted suitor felt that be very happy perhaps be most happy when be thinking about through long day assisting in fixing little thing for comfort waiting for evening return a sat there in parlour must be happy then too if be allowed to sit still look at himnot stare at raise eye now again to face for shortest possible glance a have be used to do ever since came there unconscionable lover wanted to hear speak be desirous of being talked to perhaps thought that must by right be allowed to sit by hold hand such privilege be accorded to if have be alone together walking side by side on green turf a lover must walk must soon have found use of tonguehave talked fast enough doubt under such circumstance when girl shyness have given way to real intimacy there be in general end to power of chatting though there be much love between aaron susan there be a yet little intimacy then let mother be ever so motherlyand mother must have more of mother tenderness than mr bellstill presence must be restraint aaron be very fond of mr bell nevertheless did sometimes wish that domestic duty must take out of parlour for few happy minute susan went out very often mr bell seemed to be fixture once for moment did find love alone immediately a came into house own susan do love do say so to once contrived to slip arm round waist yes whispered slipped like eel from hand left only preparing for kiss then when got to room half frightened clasped hand together bethought that did really love with strength depth of love filled whole existence why must not have told something of so few day of second sojourn at saratoga passed away not altogether satisfactorily be settled that must return to new york on saturday night leaving saratoga on evening a beckardshetta be already regarded quite a beckardwere to be back to dinner on day mr bell must have opportunity of telling wondrous tale might be well that mr beckard must see aaron before departure on saturday beckards did arrive just in time for dinner may be imagined that susans appetite be not very keen manner very collected passed by unobserved in importance attached to various beckard arrangement came under discussion lady gentleman circumstanced a be hetta mr beckard be perhaps little too apt to think that own affair be paramount after dinner susan vanished at once when hetta prepared to follow desirous of further talk about matrimonial arrangement mother stopped disclosure be made proposed to said hetta who perhaps thought that one marriage in family be enough at time yes loveand did must say in very honourable way telling not to make answer till have spoken to menow be very nice be not phineas mr bell have become very anxious that aaron must not be voted wolf have be said to since asked discreet phineas whynothing absolutely decisive oh mr bell see know nothing a to mean nothing at said
