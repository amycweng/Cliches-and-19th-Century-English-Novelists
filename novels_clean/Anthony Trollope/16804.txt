charity dependent on poor brother who hated burden of such claim must have wedded commoner let wealth age have be a might knew lord scroope age knew gloom of scroope manor became wife to of course be told story of heir marriage knew that must expect light joy in old house from scion of rising family now be changed might be that must take new heir to heart chapter ii fred neville when fred neville first came to manor old earl trembled when called upon to receive of lad have heard almost nothing of appearance literally nothing might be that heir must be meanly visaged youth of whom must have cause to be ashamed one from whose countenance sign of high blood must shine out almost worse also might have look half of vanity half of vice of father have gradually become aware in own son in have degraded neville beauty fred to look at be gallant fellow youth a woman love to see about house well made active quick self asserting fair haired blue eyed short lipped with small whisker thinking little of own personal advantage thinking much of own way a far a appearance of young man went earl must not be satisfied to at rate in beginning of connexion fred be modest submissive be welcome to scroope said old man receiving with stately urbanity in middle of hall be so much obliged to uncle said be come to a son boy a son will be own fault if be not son to in everything then in lieu of further word there shone tear in of young man eye much more eloquent to earl than must have be word put arm over nephew shoulder in guise walked with into room in lady scroope be awaiting mary said to wife here be heir let be son to then lady scroope took young man in arm kissed thus auspiciously be commenced new connexion arrival be in september game keeper with under gamekeeper have for last month be told to be on mettle young mr neville be doubt sportsman old groom have be warned that hunter might be wanted in stable next winter mr bunce be made to understand that liberty must probably be taken with house such a have not yet be perpetrated in time for late heir have never made manor home from time of leaving school be felt by great change be to be effected be felt also that young man on whose behalf be to be permitted must not be elated by position of such elation however there be not many sign to uncle fred neville be a have be said modest submissive to aunt be gentle not submissive rest of household treated civilly with none of awe be perhaps expected from a for shooting have come direct from friend carnaby moor carnaby have forest a well a moor fred thought little of partridge little of such old fashioned partridge shooting a be prepared for at scroope after grouse deer a for hunting in dorsetshire if uncle wished why in case must think of according to idea dorsetshire be not best county in england for hunting last year regiment have be at bristol have ridden with duke hound winter be to be stationed in ireland have idea irish hunting be good if found that uncle made point of must bring horse to scroope for month at christmas thus spoke to head groom thus spoke also to aunt who felt surprise when talked of scotland horse have thought that only men of large fortune shot deer kept stud perhaps conceived that officer of th hussar be generally engaged in looking after affair of regiment in preparation for meeting enemy fred now remained month at scroope during time there be little personal intercourse between uncle in spite of affectionate greeting with acquaintance have be commenced old man habit of life be so confirmed that must not bring to alter throughout entire morning must sit in own room alone must then be visited by steward groom butler must think that gave order submitting however in almost thing to wife must sometimes sit with for hour holding hand in moment of tenderness unseen unsuspected by world around sometimes clergyman of parish must come to so that might know want of people must have newspaper in hand for while must daily read bible for hour then must slowly write letter almost measuring point pen made thinking that thus be performing duty a man of business few men perhaps did le what did do be good of self indulgence there be surely none between one young man who have now come to house there must be little real connexion between fred neville lady scroope there arose much closer intimacy woman can get nearer to young man than can old man can learn more of way better understand wish from very first there arose between matter of difference a to there be quarrel very much of argument in argument lady scroope be unable to prevail be very anxious that heir must at once abandon profession sell out of army of what use must be to now to run after regiment to ireland seeing that undoubtedly great duty of life centred at scroope there be many discussion on subject fred must not give way in regard to next year must have year said to after that must come settle at scroope yes doubt must marry a soon a must find fitting wife of course must be right that must marry fully understood responsibility of position so said in answer to aunt eager scrutinising beseeching question a have joined regiment thought must be good for to remain with one year longer particularly desired to see something of ireland if did not do so now must never have opportunity lady scroope understanding well that be pleading for year of grace from dulness of manor explained to that uncle must by mean expect that must remain always at scroope if must marry old london house must be prepared for bride might travel not however going very far afield might get into parliament a to if such be ambition uncle must give aid might have friend at scroope manor carnaby rest of allurement be offered to have commenced by claiming year of grace to claim adhered must uncle have brought to make request in person at first might probably have succeeded have succeeded there must have be story for a to fortune of scroope manor earl be too proud perhaps too diffident to make attempt from wife heard that took place though be grieved expressed no anger must not feel justified in expressing anger because nephew chose to remain for yet year attached to profession who know what may happen to said countess ah indeed be in hand of almighty earl bowed head lady scroope fully recognizing truth of husband pious ejaculation nevertheless thought that human care might advantageously be added to divine interposition for a well knew lord prayed fervently a soon a word be out of mouth must be so great thing if must be settled sophia mellerby have promised to come here for couple of month in winter must not possibly do better than that mellerbys be very good people said earl grandmother duchess be one of very best woman in england mother lady sophia be excellent creature religious with soundest principle mr mellerby a commoner stand a high a man in england have held same property since war of rose then suppose money must count for something added lady lord scroope must not admit importance of money be quite willing to acknowledge be heir to make sophia mellerby future lady scroope must be content must not interfere did not think wise to speak to young men on subject thought that by doing so young man might be rather diverted from than attracted to object in view must press wish upon nephew a to next year be to ask said be to refuse must be hurt be bound therefore to ask nothing be unreasonable lady scroope did not quite agree with husband in thought that a thing be to be done for young man a money almost without stint be to be placed at command a hunting parliament house in london be offered to a treatment due to dear only son be shown to ought to give something in return must say no more than have said knew already that in few matter in husband have decided will be not to be turned from be arranged therefore that fred must join regiment at limerick in october that must come home to scroope for fortnight three week at christmas sophia mellerby be to be lady scroope guest at time at last be decided that mr neville who have never be seen by earl must be asked to come bring with younger son john neville who have be successful in obtaining commission in engineer other guest must be invited attempt must be made to remove mantle of gloom from scroope manor with sole object of ingratiating heir early in october fred went to limerick from thence with detached troop of regiment be sent to cavalry barrack at assize town of neighbouring county clare be at first held to be misfortune by a limerick be in respect better town than ennis in county limerick hunting be far from being bad whereas clare be hardly country for nimrod young man with money at command need not regard distance limerick ball limerick covert be found to be equally within reach from ennis also must attend of galway meet then with other superior than captain hardly older than to interfere with movement must indulge in wild district spirit of adventure be strong within when young men be anxious to indulge spirit of adventure generally do so by falling in love with young woman of whom father mother must not approve in day spirit of adventure hardly go further than unless take young man to german gambling table when fred left scroope be understood that be to correspond with aunt earl must have be utterly lost have attempted to write letter to nephew without having something special to communicate to lady scroope be more facile with pen be rightly thought that heir must hardly bring to look upon scroope a home unless link be maintained between place lady scroope therefore wrote once week telling everything that there be to be told of horse game even of tenant studied letter endeavouring to make light agreeable such a young man of large prospect must like to receive from own mother be dearest fred in one of earliest written expressed hope must trouble ever fall upon must come to a to dearest friend fred be not bad correspondent answered about other letter reply be short be matter of course be a jolly a sandboy right a trivet have have one two very good thing thought that upon whole liked ennis better than limerick johnstone be such deuced good fellow johnstone be captain of th hussar who happened to be stationed with at limerick lady scroope did not quite like epithet knew that have to learn to hear thing to have hitherto not be accustomed be very well lady scroope having friend in co clare thought that might receive tidings of adopted one must be useful with object opened correspondence with lady mary quin lady mary quin be daughter of earl of kilfenora be well acquainted with county clare be almost sure to hear of doings of officer stationed at ennis must do so certainly in regard to officer be specially introduced to fred neville be invited to stay at castle quin a long a pleased actually did pas one night under roof unfortunately for spirit of adventure be determined to indulge led into neighbourhood of castle quin when be far from intention to interfere with earl with lady mary thus led to following letter lady scroope received about middle of december just week before fred return to manor quin castle ennistimon december dear lady scroope since wrote to before mr have be here once liked very much father be quite taken with be always fond of young officer be not le inclined to be so of one who be so dear near to wish must have stayed longer hope that will come again have not much to offer in way of amusement in january february there be good snipe shooting find that mr neville be very fond of shooting so much so that before knew anything of except name have heard that have be on coast after seal sea bird have very high cliff near here people say highest in world there be one called hag head from men get down shoot sea gull have be different time in village of liscannor think have boat there at lahinch believe have already killed ever so many seal tell for reason hope that may come to nothing think that ought to know there be widow lady living not very far from liscannor nearer up to cliff cottage be on papa property think hold from somebody else like to say anything to papa about name be mr o'hara have daughter when lady scroope have read so far almost let paper drop from hand of course knew what meant irish miss o'hara fred neville be spending time in pursuit of girl lady scroope have known what must be when young man be allowed to return to regiment in spite of manifold duty must have bound to scroope manor have seen young lady continued lady mary be certainly very pretty nobody know anything about can not even learn whether belong to real o'hara must think not a be roman catholic at rate miss o'hara can hardly be fitting companion for lord scroope heir believe be lady think that one know here except priest of kilmacrenny never must make out quite why came here only that father marty know something about be priest of kilmacrenny be very pretty girl never heard word against know whether doe not make worse because young man be so likely to get entangled daresay nothing will come of be sure hope that nothing may thought best to tell pray let know that have heard from young men be so very particular about thing know what might say of if knew that have written home to about private affair same if can be of service to pray let know excuse haste believe to be most sincerely mary quin roman catholic one whom one knew priest girl who perhaps never have father be terrible to lady scroope roman catholic especially irish roman catholic be people whom a thought one must fear in world for whom everything be to be feared in next how must be with earl if heir also be to tell day that be married must not grey hair be brought to grave with double load of sorrow however for present thought better to say not word to earl chapter iii sophie mellerby lady scroope thought great deal about friend communication at last made up mind that must hing till fred must have returned indeed hardly knew what must do when did come back more considered greater seemed to to be difficulty of doing anything how be woman how be even mother to caution young man against danger of becoming acquainted with pretty girl must not mention miss o'hara name without mentioning that of lady mary quin in connexion with when asked a of course must be asked a to own information what must say have be told that have made acquainted with widow lady who have pretty daughter be when young men will run into such difficulty be ala so very difficult to interfere with yet matter be of such importance a to justify almost interference roman catholic irish girl of whom nothing be known that mother be said to be widow be in lady scroope eye a formidable danger a must come in way of husband heir fred neville be thought with good quality exactly man to fall in love with wild irish girl if fred be to write home day say that be about to marry bride worse again that have married tidings must nearly kill earl after have be endured termination to hope of family must be too cruel lady scroope must not feel injustice of thing be being done for heir for whom nothing need have be done be treated a son be not son be treated with exceptional favour a son everything be at disposal might marry begin life at once with want amply supplied if must only marry such woman a be fit to be future countess of scroope very little be required from be not expected to marry heiress heiress indeed be prepared for must be there ready for at christmas heiress beautiful well born fit in respect religious too be not to be asked to marry sophie mellerby might choose for there be other well born young woman about world duchess granddaughter in abundance be imperative that must marry at least lady at least protestant lady scroope felt very strongly that must never have be allowed to rejoin regiment when home at scroope be offered to be free agent of course equally of course title property must ultimately be something of bargain might have be made with when privilege of son be offered to when be told that might have scroope to for amounted nearly to that might hunt there shoot there entertain friend that family house in london must be given up to if must marry properly that income almost without limit must be provided for surely must not have be too much to demand that a matter of course must leave army have not be done now there be irish roman catholic widow with daughter with seal shooting boat high cliff right in young man way lady scroope must not analyse felt danger a though be by instinct partridge pheasant shooting on gentleman own ground occasional day hunting with hound in own county be in lady scroope estimation becoming amusement for english gentleman did not interfere with exercise of duty have by mean brought to like yearly raid into scotland made latterly by sportsman if scotch moor forest be dangerous what be irish cliff deer stalking be bad in imagination be almost sure that when men went up to scotch forest did not go to church on sunday idea of seal shooting be much more horrible then there be that priest who be only friend of widow who have daughter on morning of day in fred be to reach manor lady scroope did speak to husband think dear that something might be done to prevent fred returning to horrid country what can do suppose must wish to oblige be being very good to be for old to give mary for young to accept do for because be to what be to that must sacrifice pleasure for can break heart be even to quarrel with worst must do must be to send to money lender for year two why must care about regiment now because regiment mean liberty wo ask to give up think not if be to ask must expect to yield then must be disappointed be to refuse wish to think tyrant be end of conversation for lady scroope did not a yet dare to speak to earl about widow daughter must now try skill eloquence with young man young man arrived be received with kindest greeting two horse have preceded so that might find mounted a soon a chose after arrival two others be coming be very well aunt be little hurt when declared purpose of going down to stable just a told that sophia mellerby be in house arrived on rd at pm have be declared that be to hunt on morrow be already dark surely might have be content on first evening of arrival to abstain from stable not word have be said to sophie mellerby of lady scroope future hope lady scroope lady sophia must have thought that be wicked to do so two woman have be fussy miss mellerby must have be le discerning than be young lady generally have not understood what be expected of girl be undoubtedly better prepared to fall in love with men whom have never seen than be men with girl be girl great business in life to love to be loved of young men may almost be said that be great business to avoid catastrophe such ought not to have be case with fred neville now in such light regarded have already said to that sophie mellerby be to be pitched at head knew reason none a yet why must not like miss mellerby well enough be little on guard against preferred seeing horse first sophie when according to custom indeed in instance in accordance with special arrangement went into lady scroope sitting room for tea be rather disappointed at not finding mr neville there knew that have visited uncle immediately on arrival having just come in from park have gone to room to make little preparation for meeting if be written in fate book that be to be next lady scroope meeting be important perhaps that writing in fate book might depend on very adjustment be now making of hair have gone to look at horse said lady scroope unable not to shew disappointment by tone of voice be so natural said sophie who be more cunning young men almost idolize horse must like to go see dandy whenever arrives anywhere only dare dandy be miss mellerby own horse be accustomed to make journey up down between mellerby london think horse gun dog must be too much thought of said lady scroope gravely there be tendency think at present to give undue importance when amusement become more serious to than business must be going astray suppose always be going astray said miss mellerby lady scroope sighed shook head in shaking shewed that completely agreed with opinion expressed by guest a there be only two horse to be inspected a fred neville absolutely refused groom invitation to look at old carriage horse belonging to family be back in aunt room before miss mellerby have gone upstairs to dress for dinner introduction be made fred did best to make agreeable be such man that girl must at first sight of think injured by being asked to love be good girl must have consented to marry man without feeling sure of affection fred neville be bold frank a well a handsome have plenty to say for might be that be vicious ill tempered selfish must be necessary that must know much of before must give into keeping a far a first sight went first hearing sophie mellerby impression be in fred favour be doubt fact that with very best of girl man be placed in very good light by being heir to peerage large property do hunt miss mellerby asked shook head looked grave then laughed among people hunting be not thought to be desirable accomplishment for young lady almost girl do hunt now said fred do think be nice amusement for young lady asked aunt in severe tone see why not be if know how to ride know how to ride said sophie mellerby riding be very well said lady scroope quite approve of for girl when be young everybody did not ride a do now nevertheless be very well be thought to be healthy a for hunting sophie be sure mamma must be very much distressed if be to think of thing dear lady scroope have thought of be not going to think of if thought of ever so much must do poor mamma must be frightened into fit only that nobody at mellerby must possibly be made to believe unless saw doing then there can be reason why must make attempt said fred upon lady scroope pretended to look grave told that be very wicked let old lady be ever so strict towards own sex like little wickedness in young man if only doe not carry to extent of marrying wrong sort of young woman sophia mellerby be

of respectability be very reverse of john how be when be that jack become re johned go back to original excellent name given to by godfather godmother nobody ever know jack neville probably through

professed that did not understand in carrying out profession always stopped conversation to have word explained to thought have be used in improper sense idea of young man making square with young woman be repulsive idea of young man making square with young woman be so much more repulsive misery to be so intensely heightened by unconcern displayed by heir in so speaking of girl with whom ought to have be making square that must hardly allow to be arrested by stumbling block impossible exclaimed be if mean if mean if mean anything at do mean good deal then believe word of be quite out of question be impossible be quite sure brother understands position a gentleman too thoroughly to dream of such thing be greek to fred neville why brother must not fall in love with pretty girl why

who have nothing commission in engineer sophie have be sent to scroope on purpose to be fallen in love with by heir how must be with lady scroope if in lieu of must not only have be fallen in love with by heir younger brother have responded favourably to so base affection same afternoon fred told uncle that be going back to ireland on day one following thus curtailing promised three week by two

on day before fred departure there came short note from lady mary quin made poor lady scroope more unhappy than ever tidings have reached in mysterious way that o'hara be eagerly expecting return of mr neville lady mary thought that if mr neville quarter must be moved from ennis must be very expedient for many reason knew that enquiry have be made for that be engaged to dine on certain day with father marty priest father marty must doubt go length to serve friend o'hara then lady mary be very anxious that not word must be said to mr neville might lead to suppose report respecting be being

join regiment again at be absurd that must do so in present position must be here learn circumstance of property before becomes own there can hardly be more than year two left for lesson earl manner

though such be conviction be so who must strive moil in world when heart have be broken spirit ground to dust by misery then such be god mercy eternity suffices to make life bearable when mr o'hara spoke to daughter of eternity there be cold comfort in word girl wanted something here pleasure companion work perhaps lover have happened before lieutenant neville of th hussar have be seen in part

there be other further look out in life be one of wretched to whom world offer nothing therefore a being human must hope build hope on eternity have word be read clearly that must have be true meaning what must do for child bread meat with roof over head raiment sufficed for life such a theirs must supply life must have be well enough have be fate within power to earn bread meat shelter raiment to have without work to have nothing more in absolute idleness be such misery that there be resource left eternity yet mother when looked at daughter almost persuaded that need not be so girl be very lovely so lovely that be seen men must quarrel for a to who must have in keeping such beauty such life such capability for giving receiving enjoyment must not have be intended to wither on lone cliff over atlantic there must be fault somewhere yet to live have be first necessity life in city among haunt of men have be impossible with such mean a woman possessed when have called daughter to have sought peace under roof friend priest have found for peace roof to shelter have be extent of desire to be at rest independent with child within arm have be that woman asked of god for herself sufficed

equal term seek friend among milliner of neighbouring town burden have be imposed must be borne even though isolated from world mother be always to be like of course mother knew what be needed be needed that girl must go out into world pair that must find shoulder on might lean arm must be strong to surround heart of man work of man to might devote girl when asked question did not know mother knew mother looked at child said that of living creature child be surely loveliest be not fit that must go forth be loved that must at rate go forth take chance with others how must such going forth be managed then be there not danger terrible danger danger specially terrible to one so friendless a child have not be wrecked among rock trusting to one who have be utterly unworthy loving one who have be utterly unlovely men so often be a ravenous wolf merciless rapacious without heart full of greed full of lust looking on female beauty a prey regarding love of woman very life a toy be higher in world there might be safety be lower there might be safety how must send girl forth into world without sending certainly among wolf yet piteous question be always sounding in ear mother be always to be like then lieutenant neville have appeared upon scene dressed in sailor jacket trowsers with sailor cap upon head with loose handkerchief round neck hair blowing to wind in eye of kate o'hara be apollo in eye of girl must have seemed to be a good looking fellow a ever tied sailor knot have made acquaintance with father marty at liscannor priest have dined with at ennis there have be return visit priest perhaps innocently have taken up on cliff there have met two lady hero have be introduced to kate o'hara chapter vi will go bail like might be that young man be ravenous wolf manner be not wolfish have mr o'hara be princess supreme in own right young neville must not have treated daughter with more respect at first kate have wondered at have said little have listened to a talked to mother priest about cliff bird seal have shot have felt that be something like be needed to make life so sweet that a yet there need be longing thought for eternity be not that at once loved felt that be thing to love very appearance on cliff power of thinking of when be gone for while banished tedium from life why must shoot poor gull be first question asked asked hardly in tenderness to bird because with unconscious cunning of sex understood that tenderness in woman be charm in eye of man only because be so difficult to get at said fred believe there be other reason except one must shoot something why must asked mr o'hara to justify one gun man take to shooting a matter of course be kind of institution there ai tiger so shoot bird in part of world there ai pheasant so shoot sea gull excellently argued said priest rather one for be impossible to get at will tell what father marty neville have already assumed fashion of calling priest by familiar priestly name a stranger do much more readily than who belong to country will tell what father marty have shot one of finest seal ever saw if morony can get at low water will send skin up to mr o'hara send oil to said priest there be use in shooting seal can hing with bird unless get enough of feather to make bed be in october before end of november fred neville be after fashion intimate at cottage have never broken bread at mr o'hara table to tell truth have outspoken clearly intelligible word of love be uttered by to girl have be seen with often enough story have become sufficiently current at liscannor to make lady mary quin think that be justified in sending bad news to friend lady scroope did not do till fred have be induced with difficulty to pas night at castle quin lady mary have not scrupled to ask question about miss o'hara have thought answer very unsatisfactory know what make live there be sure must have thought must have known replied neville in answer to question be perfect mystery to said lady mary think that miss o'hara be prettiest girl ever saw in life said fred boldly must say handsomest woman if be not that there may be question between mother be enthusiastic said lady mary quin after that letter to scroope be written in meantime seal skin be cured not perhaps in very best fashion be sent up to miss o'hara with mr neville compliment skin of seal have be shot by man not purchased be present that lady may receive from gentleman most prudent mamma that ever watched over dovecote with argus eye permitting touch of gallantry to come near must hardly insist that seal skin in rough must be sent back to donor mr o'hara be by mean that most prudent mamma made not only seal skin donor also welcome must not be that by chance advent such a that change must be effected in girl life must change ever be made girl be good why must fear for man have be brought there by only friend priest why must fear yet did fear though face be never clouded when girl spoke of new comer though always mentioned captain neville name a though liked man though even be gracious to when shewed near cottage still there be deep dread upon when eye rested upon when thought flew to men be wolf to woman utterly merciless when feeding high lust 't be thus own thought shaped though never uttered syllable to daughter in disparagement of man be girl chance be to rob of yet of duty be not duty of protecting girl highest dearest that owned if man meant well by girl must wash foot with hair kiss hem of garment love spot on have first seen stand like young sea god if evil if meant evil to girl if must do evil to kate then knew that there be so much of tiger within bosom a must serve to rend limb from limb with such thought a have hardly ever left together have such leaving together seemed to be desired by a for kate certainly must have shunned thought of fred neville during waking moment dreamed of at night coming have certainly be to a coming of god though did not appear on cliff above once twice week have done so for few week presence have altered whole tenour of life never asked mother now whether be to be always like there be freshness about life mother understood at once be full of play reading le than be wont still with sense of tedium of man in absence spoke seldom when name be on lip must jest with a though coming of young embryo lord to shoot gull on coast be quite joke seal skin have given be very dear to be at pain to hide liking of man a lover have never seemed to think did think of a lover be not by such thinking love grows did ever tell that while be there coming on one day telling that boat must be again there on life be blessed to that therefore when must have left life must be accursed to knew nothing of yet thought of dreamed of young head be full of little plan with one of be connected may almost be said that fred be a innocent in matter a be girl be true indeed that men be merciless a wolf to woman that become so taught by circumstance trained by year young man who begin by meaning to be wolf must be bad indeed fred neville have such meaning on behalf must be acknowledged that have meaning whatever when came again again to ardkill have examined in matter must have declared that liked mother quite a well a daughter when lady mary quin have thrown at very blunt arrow have defended on plea accident spirit of adventure have thrust lady in path doubt liked better because did not live a other people lived solitude close vicinity of ocean feeling that in meeting none of ordinary conventional usage of society be needed wildness strangeness of scene have charm admitted to knew that girl be very lovely of course said so to to others to take delight in beauty be assumed to be nature of young man young man be not one to wish to differ from others in respect when went back to spend christmas at scroope have never told even that intended to be lover good bye mr o'hara said day two before left ennis so be going oh yes be off order from home be imperative one have to cut one lump of christmas beef also one lump of christmas pudding be family religion know what happiness to have family to visit be very well suppose grumble

that priest might say without fault what must be very faulty if came from one else be in earnest now father marty what will do if darling kate think of young man more than be good for father marty raised hat began to scratch head if like to look at fair face of handsome lad do thin misthress o'hara must not like also will go bail like said priest what will come next will tell what be misthress

plucking philosophy be perhaps at fault may be that humanity be unrefined be human to core at rate unselfish that there might be danger be fact that looked full in face what victory can be won without danger thought that knew girl who three time year must open whole heart to in confession be sure that be not only innocent good of man too be prone to believe good though who on question ever trust man goodness there might be danger there must be discretion surely must not be wise because evil be possible that one a kate o'hara must be kept from intercourse without woman be only woman have considered though reader may perhaps think that a minister of gospel have come to strange conclusion in own defence must have said that having served many year in ministry have learned to know nature of men woman mr o'hara said not word to kate of doctrine priest have preached found encouraged to mention new friend name to girl during fred absence hardly word have be spoken concerning in cottage

got up threw at mother knee buried face in mother lap mr o'hara knew that act of larceny have already be perpetrated how must have be otherwise of such stealing be always better that mention must be made till theft have be sanctified by free gift till loss have be spoken of acknowledged may in most case be recovered have neville never returned from scroope name never be mentioned by mother to daughter may be that kate o'hara must not have known that have loved for while must have be sad for month two a lay wakeful in bed must have thought of dream must have thought of a only dream must have be sure that must have loved have fair ending be possible for such love must have assured that have be on guard that be safe in spite of dream now flame in heart have be confessed in degree

with so sweet voice a hurried down hill to beach at coolroone where morony be to meet with boat must not keep from comparison between kate o'hara sophie mellerby doubt comparison be made very incorrectly unfairly be in favour of girl who lived out of world in solitude on cliff of moher why must not be free to seek wife where pleased in such affair a affair of love in heart heart alone must be consulted what right must man have to dictate to certain idea occurred to friend in england must have called wild democratic revolutionary damnable owing perhaps to irish air irish whiskey spirit of adventure fostered by vicinity of rock ocean appeared to at moment to be not only charming reasonable also doubt be born to high state great rank nothing that rank state must give be so sweet a liberty to be free to choose for in thing be highest privilege of man what pleasure must have in love must be selected for by woman a aunt then gave rein to confused notion of irish bride wife who

scroope think duty to let know that general opinion about here be that mr neville will make miss o'hara wife if have not done so already most dangerous feature in whole matter be that be managed by priest of parish most unscrupulous person who must do anything be so daring have known many many year know to what length must go law have be so altered in favour of roman catholic against protestant that priest can do almost just what like think that must scruple for instant to marry if thought likely that prey must escape from own opinion be that there have be no marriage a yet though know that

cottage with one maid servant almost upon cliff nobody know anything about except priest if must be seduced into marriage nothing must be more unfortunate lady mary probably intended to insinuate be young neville prudently to get out of adventure simply leaving girl behind blasted ruined destroyed matter doubt must be bad in case great misfortune must have be avoided must not quite say in plain word felt doubt that lady scroope must understand then lady mary went on to assure friend that though father sister very greatly regretted that mr neville have not again given pleasure of seeing at castle quin feeling of injury on score have induced to write so strongly a have done have be prompted to do so simply by desire to prevent most ruinous alliance lady scroope acknowledged entirely truth of last word such alliance must be most ruinous what must do be to write to fred tell that heard throwing to wind lady mary stupid injunction respecting secrecy a must not have scrupled to do must have thus obtained object might not be quite possible that must precipitate calamity desired so eagerly to avoid neither have have husband power over young man except such a arose from own good

gloomier more comfortless than ever have hurried over to see dying man now there be nothing for to do to kick heel before went to bed ennui be dissipated by full explanation of aunt terror crept down to at about nine having commenced story by saying that have matter of most vital importance on to speak to told in fact that have heard from lady mary be mischief making gossiping old maid said neville angrily will tell that there be truth in what writes asked lady scroope be question fred neville be not prepared to answer sat silent fred tell truth be married be not married know that will not condescend to untruth if so word must be sufficient be not sufficient longed to extract from repeated prolonged assurance might bring satisfaction to own mind be glad at rate to hear that there be truth in suspicion to must not condescend to reply sat glowering at a though in wrath that question must be asked about private concern must feel fred for uncle in such matter must know how important be to have heard what have already suffered must know too that have endeavoured to be very good to do know that have be very good to perhaps be angry with for interfering must not deny that be angry must not do so be not that uncle be ill suffering have asked question have answered know what more want of will say that there be truth in lady mary say lady mary be impertinent old maid if be in uncle place if have heir a to whose character in world be anxious must not think anyone impertinent who endeavoured for sake of friendship to save name family from disreputable connexion have made disreputable connexion will not allow word disreputable to be used in regard to of friend do know people of name of o'hara of course do there be young lady may know dozen young lady a to whom will not choose to consult lady mary quin understand what mean fred of course wish to ask anything about general acquaintance doubt meet many girl whom admire must be very foolish be to make inquiry of of

future told uncle must never make marriage must be disgraceful to position will be called upon to fill will must not marriage be disgraceful even be young lady ever so estimable how be old family of country to be kept up old blood maintained if young men such a be will not remember something of be due to name bear know have forgotten anything then paused before must summon courage to ask question have made promise of marriage to miss o'hara sat dumb still looking at with angry frown surely uncle have right to expect that will answer question be quite sure that for sake will be much better that such question will be asked in point of fact have answered question when must not deny that such promise have be made there must no longer be doubt of truth of what lady mary have written of course whole truth have now be elicited be not married be engaged engaged to girl of whom knew nothing roman catholic irish fatherless almost nameless to one who have never be seen in good society one of whom description must be given of whom record must be made in peerage must not be altogether disgraceful girl of whom be ashamed to speak before to whom owed duty submission that there might be way to escape evil even yet lady scroope acknowledged to herself fully many men promise marriage keep promise have made lady who be really good unselfish affectionate religious actuated by sense of duty in that did whose life have be almost austerely moral entertained idea that young men such a fred neville very commonly made such promise with very little thought of keeping did not expect young men to be governed by principle such a to young lady be bound to submit almost supposed that heaven have different code of law for men woman in condition of life salvation be offered on very different term to two sex breach of such promise a heir of scroope must have made to such girl a miss o'hara must be perjury at jove might certainly be expected to laugh in catalogue there be sin for young men must hope to be forgiven sin of such marriage a must certainly be beyond pardon of injury be to be done to miss o'hara may be said with certainty that thought not at in eye must be injury simple justice no more than proper punishment for intrigue wicked ambition without having seen enemy to family of scroope even having heard word to disparagement must feel sure that girl be bad that o'hara be vulgar false impostor person against whom must put out strength without prick of conscience woman in such matter be always hard against woman especially hard against whom believe to belong to class below own certainly feeling of mercy must induce to hold hand in task of saving husband nephew from ill assorted marriage mercy to miss o'hara lady scroope have name of being very charitable woman gave away money visited poor have laboured hard to make cottage on estate clean comfortable denied many thing that might give to others must have more mercy on one a miss o'hara than farmer labourer must have

little ashamed of be said about priest neither be proud of pretty finished french hand writing over letter of love have taken so much pain in truth kate o'hara be better educated than perhaps knew a much a sophie mellerby must have written letter quite a well in french a in english did understand something of formation of sentence fred neville have be at excellent school may be doubted whether must have explained own written language nevertheless be little ashamed of kate thought that miss mellerby might perceive ignorance if shewed letter have sent for brother in order that might explain scheme get brother advice found very difficult to explain scheme to jack neville jack indeed from very first must not allow that scheme be in way practicable quite understand fred what mean intend to deceive by false marriage most assuredly not intend to deceive at must make wife not make wife undoubtedly will be wife be quite determined about have word over above be dearer to than anything else if marry eldest son must of course be heir to title be not at so sure of manner of queer thing may be arranged by marriage with roman catholic put that out of head said jack neville in first place must certainly find in mess in next place attempt must be dishonest dare say men have crept out of marriage because have be illegal man who arranges marriage with intention of creeping out of be scoundrel need bully about jack know very well that mean to creep out of anything be sure a ask must tell what think be in sort of dilemma between girl uncle scroope be not in dilemma at seem to think have made promise to will be broken if marry suppose certainly have made promise certainly mean to keep said fred right then must break promise to uncle scroope be sort of half half promise must not bear to see making unhappy about just so suppose miss o'hara can wait fred neville scratched head oh yes can wait there be nothing to bind to day month uncle may live for next ten year now advice to be to let miss o'hara understand clearly that will make other engagement that can not marry a long a uncle life of course say on supposition that affair can not be broken off certainly not said fred with decision be magnanimous can not think engagement fortunate one for in position like must marry like be quite sure of that must wish wife to be easily intimate with sort of people among whom must naturally be thrown a lady scroope among wife daughter of other earl such like must see how must be comfortable in other way must never live among other earl a call hate that kind of thing hate london must never live here what must do must have yacht live chiefly in must go about good deal get into manner of queer place say what might spend winter now then in leicestershire northamptonshire for be fond of hunting must have regular home according to scheme must have place sufficient of income to maintain of course must do fred said jack shaking head though know how generous be why must do be heir must take duty with privilege can have yacht if like yacht will soon get tired of kind of life take that yacht be bad place for nursery inconvenient for one old boot when man have home fixed for by circumstance a will have gravitates towards let own supposed predilection be what may circumstance be stronger than predilection be philosopher be always more sober than fred wish have be elder on condition of younger brother having tidy slice out of property to make comfortable be not elder must take position with encumbrance see nothing for to ask miss o'hara to wait if uncle life long probability be that one other of will change mind that affair will never come off when younger wiser brother gave advice did not think likely that miss o'hara must change mind penniless young lady often change mind when be engaged to heir of earl be not at probable that must repent bargain that have made jack neville did think very probable that brother might do so indeed felt sure that must do so if year be allowed to intervene residence in county clare must not be perpetual with in circumstance might well be that young lady being out of sight must be out of mind jack must not exactly declare opinion on head brother at present be full of promise full of love full of honour must jack have absolutely counselled to break word to young lady thought probable that in event of delay poor miss o'hara might go to wall also thought that for general interest of scroope family must be better that must do so what be going to do asked fred in respect of what in respect of miss mellerby in respect of miss mellerby be not going to do anything said jack a walked away in that younger brother said to elder a to poor kate o'hara be doubt wise prudent in what said about did not tell truth then question asked be one man be hardly bound to answer even to brother jack neville be much le likely to talk about love affair than fred not on account le likely to think about sophie mellerby have refused once young lady have be known to marry gentleman after refusing more than once at rate be determined to persevere having in in affair silent faith of possessor be so often unconscious so generally lead to success found miss mellerby to be very courteous to if not gracious have advantage of not being afraid of did not strike that because be granddaughter of duke because be younger son that therefore ought not to dare to look at understood very well that be brought there fred might marry fred be intent on marrying one else sophie mellerby be not girl to throw heart away upon man who did not want have come to scroope for only three day in spite of watchfulness on part of countess found opportunity for speaking before left house miss mellerby said know whether ought to thank fortune to upbraid for having again brought face to face with hope evil be not so oppressive a to make very loud in upbraiding will not at rate be heard know whether there be spice of malice about brother when asked to come here told in same letter that be at scroope must have meant for malice must think said young lady endeavouring not quite successfully to imitate manner of man who loved of course came not on behalf hope mr neville altogether on behalf fred need to see be not very great a uncle have not asked a aunt fancy doe not altogether approve of certainly must not have come be not that might find difficult to get other opportunity of seeing be hardly fair to lady scroope mr neville quite fair think did not come clandestinely be not ashamed of what be doing of what be going to do may be ashamed of must feel chance of success to be so small when be here before asked to allow to love now ask again allow said yes allow must be too bold be to ask to return love at once only ask to know because be repulsed once have not given up pursuit mr neville be sure that father mother must not permit may ask father miss mellerby certainly not with permission nevertheless will not forget that be suitor for love will make promise of anything mr neville then fearing that have encouraged spoke again think ought to take answer a final miss mellerby will take answer a final be not favourable must indeed hear that be to be married to man must be final that will not hear from own lip will say good bye to offered hand gave hand raised to lip kissed a men be wont to do in olden day chapter xii fred neville make promise fred neville felt that have not received from brother assistance sympathy have required have intended to make very generous offer not indeed quite understanding how offer must be carried out still of nature must thought have bound brother to service jack have simply answered by sermon by sermon assurance of impracticability of scheme nevertheless be by mean sure that scheme be impracticable be at least sure of human power must force to adopt mode of life be distasteful to one must make marry sophie mellerby other sophie maintain grand gloomy house in dorsetshire spending income not in manner congenial to in keeping large retinue of servant taking what called heavy line of english nobleman property must be own at rate life use of swore to over over again that nothing must induce to impoverish family to leave general affair of house of scroope worse than found much le than half of understood to be income coming from estate must suffice for let uncle aunt strait laced methodical brother say what must to nothing must induce to make slave to earldom yet mind be much confused contentment by mean complete knew that there must be disagreeable scene between uncle before returned to ireland knew also that uncle must if be so minded stop present very liberal allowance altogether there have be bargain doubt that must remain with regiment for year of year six month be still unexpired uncle must not quarrel with for going back to ireland what answer must make when uncle asked whether be engaged to marry miss o'hara a of course must ask what reply must make when uncle must demand of whether thought marriage fit for man in position knew that be not fit believed in title in sanctity of name in mysterious grandeur of family did not think that earl of scroope ought to marry girl of whom nothing be known pride of position stuck to irked to feel that sacrifice necessary to support pride must fall on own shoulder one thing be impossible to must not desert kate wished to have kate a thing apart if must have given six month of year to kate living yacht life of have spoken visiting strange sunny place imagination have pictured to unshackled by conventionality beyond sound of church bell unimpeded by consideration of family then have migrated for other six month to earldom estate to hunting perhaps to parliament leaving kate behind must have be perfect why not in day must come so soon must be own master who must impede motion gainsay will then remembered kate mother glance must come from mother eye there might be difficulty even though scroope be own be not villain simply self indulgent spoiled young man who have realized to idea of duty in life never once told that kate must be mistress in picture drew for of future life everything be to be done for happiness for gratification yacht must be made floating bower for delight during six month of year only provoking circumstance of position must enable to devote to joy love will must be law did not think to be fickle must never want kate must leave with sorrow must return to with ecstasy everybody around must treat with respect due to empress must be very expedient that must be called neville instead of lady scroope must thing not be so arranged for so arranged that might make promise to uncle yet be true to kate without breaking promise be scheme jack said that scheme be impracticable difficulty in way be not thought so much jack have propounded a angry eye of kate o'hara mother at last day be fixed for departure earl be already so much better a to be able to leave bedroom twice thrice day fred saw uncle there be much said about affair of estate heir have taken trouble have visited of tenant have striven to seem interested in affair of property earl must talk for ever about estate field fence almost tree on be familiar to that tenant must be easy in circumstance protestant church going rent paying people son following father daughter marrying a mother have married unchanging never sinking inch in social scale rising be wish nearest to heart fred be well disposed to talk about tenant a long a kate o'hara be not mentioned when earl must mournfully speak of own coming death a event must not now be far distant fred with fullest sincerity must promise that wish must be observed rent must be raised axe must be sparingly used seemed to strange that man going into eternity must care about tree a far a be concerned tree must stand while nature supported servant must be dismissed carriage horse must be allowed to die on place old charity must be maintained parson of parish must always be welcome guest at manor promise be difficult for to make so long a one question be left untouched when spoke of day of departure a fixed a being day after to morrow then knew that question must be touched be sorry very sorry that must go said earl see man ca leave service at moment notice think that must have got over fred perhaps a regard service might regiment must think ill of see so many thing depend on man staying going youngster may have money ready said must remain till october at wish to act tyrant to know that uncle then there be pause have spoken to yet fred on matter have caused great deal of uneasiness when first came be not strong enough to allude to left to aunt neville knew well what be coming now be aware that be moved in manner hardly became manhood aunt tell that have got into trouble with young lady in west of ireland trouble uncle hope who be then there be pause gave direct answer to question be miss o'hara roman catholic yes girl of whose family know nothing know that life with mother in absolute obscurity poverty be not rich said fred suppose that regard poverty a fault be not necessary that must marry girl with fortune suppose not uncle scroope understand that young lady be quite beneath in life life with mother in little cottage without servant there be servant know what mean fred doe not live a lady live be uneducated be wrong there lord have be at excellent school in france in france who be father what know what father be captain o'hara believe must marry such girl a roman catholic picked up on irish coast one of whom nobody know even parentage perhaps real name must kill fred have not said that mean to marry what do mean must ruin seduce by false promise then leave do tell that in cold blood look forward to such deed a certainly not hope not boy hope not that tell that heartless scoundrel be to take name when be gone be not heartless scoundrel said fred neville jumping up from seat then what be that mean have thought have not of duty of high position to be called suppose that wealth be to be given to great name appanage power of nobility in order that may eat more drink more lie softer than others be because think so act upon such base thought that only hereditary peerage left in world be in danger of encountering ill will of people be willing to be known only a one of who have disgraced order mean to disgrace will disgrace if marry girl a if be fit to be wife must not family of lord kilfenora have known think much of not knowing uncle who doe know who can say that be even what pretend to be did not promise that must make such marriage be not strong to defend kate such defence must have be in opposition to own idea in antagonism with scheme have made for understood almost a well a did uncle that kate o'hara ought not to be made countess of scroope too thought that be to be presented to world a countess of scroope must disgrace title yet must not be villain yet must not give up must only fall back upon scheme miss o'hara be a good a gold said acknowledge that be not fit to be mistress of house fred said earl almost in passion of affectionate solicitude go back to ireland will arrange about regiment harm will be done to one health will be excuse lawyer will arrange must go back said neville then earl fell back in chair covered face with hand must go back will give honour a gentleman to hing that will distress will not marry oh fred a value own soul injure poor girl so desolate a tell tell mother honest truth if there be tear will not that be better than sorrow disgrace ruin among evil there must always be choice earl thought that broken promise be lightest of evil to choice among nephew have subjected so interview be over there have be no quarrel fred neville have given earl positive promise that must not marry kate o'hara to whom have sworn thousand time that must be wife promise however so told be never intended to prevail beyond lifetime of person to whom be made have bound not to marry kate while uncle lived be might not be better to take uncle advice altogether tell truth not to kate for must not do to mr o'hara to father marty a thought of acknowledged to that task of telling such truth to mr o'hara must be almost beyond strength must not throw upon priest charity leave to then thought of own kate feeling akin to genuine love told that must not part with girl in such fashion a that must break heart be to lose kate when looked at in light seemed to that kate be more to than family of scroopes with glory dear sweet soft innocent beautiful kate kate who a knew well worshipped very ground on trod be not possible that must separate from kate o'hara on return to ireland turned that scheme of over over again in head surely something might be done if priest must stand friend what if be to tell whole truth to priest ask for such assistance a priest might give one assurance to came during journey be that when man go in for adventure requires good deal of skill courage too to carry through volume ii chapter from bad to worse a be returning to ennis neville be so far removed from immediate distress a to be able to look forward without fear to meeting with two lady at ardkill must a yet take kate in arm without hard load upon heart such a must be there if knew that be incumbent upon at once to explain difficulty uncle be still living be old still ill must naturally make most of old man age infirmity there be reason why must wait reason why such waiting must bring reproach upon head on night of arrival at quarter despatched note to kate dearest love here be again in land of freedom potato need not trouble with writing about home news a will see day after to morrow to morrow wednesday morning must stick close to gun here after one on wednesday will be free will drive over to lahinch come round in boat must come back here same night suppose will be next morning before get to bed sha' mind that if get something for pain love to mother own f n in accordance with plan did drive over to lahinch might have saved time by directing that boat must come across bay to meet at liscannor felt that must prefer not to meet father marty at present might be that before long must be driven to tell priest good deal to ask for priest assistance at present be not anxious to see father marty barney morony be waiting for at stable where put up horse went down with to beach lady according to barney be quite well more winsome than ever information be not given without much delay great beating about bush there be rumour about liscannor captain o'hara have turned up fred be so startled at that must not refrain from showing anxiety by question asked barney did not seem to think that captain have be at ardkill anywhere in neighbourhood at rate barney have not seen have just heard rumour shure captain must be telling honour lie do be saying that captain one time be a fine man a woman ever sot eye on why not seeing what kind young lady be god bless if be true that kate father have turned up such advent might very naturally alter neville plan must so change position of thing a to relieve in degree from force of past promise nevertheless when saw kate coming along cliff to meet one thing more certain to than other thing be that must never abandon have be watching for almost from hour at have said that must leave ennis creeping up among rock have seen boat a came round point from liscannor have first thought that must climb down path to meet tide be high there be now strip of strand below cliff barney morony must have be there to see resolved that must be nicer to wait for on summit oh fred have come back said throwing on breast yes be back did think be going to desert knew must not desert oh darling dear kate dearest kate have thought of sometimes have thought of always hour so swore to that be a much to a must possibly be to hung on arm a went down to cottage believed to be happiest most fortunate girl in ireland a yet touch of sorrow of love have fallen upon must not all at once ask a to rumour morony have mentioned to thought of a walked with arm round waist question must be asked might perhaps be better that must ask of mother mr o'hara be at cottage seemed almost a glad to see a kate have be be very pleasant to have back again said kate have be counting first hour then minute so have mother of course want to hear news said mr o'hara then neville with girl who be to be wife sitting close beside on sofa almost within embrace told how thing be going at scroope uncle be very weak evidently failing still so much better a to justify heir in coming away might perhaps live for twelve month doctor thought hardly possible that must last longer than then nephew went on to say that uncle be best most generous man in world finest gentleman truest christian told also of tenant who be not to be harassed servant who be not to be dismissed horse be to be allowed to die in bed tree be not to be cut down wish knew said kate wish must have seen once that can never be said fred sadly of course not then mr o'hara asked question have ever heard of yes have heard of from not first from there be many reason why must not have mentioned name must have helped have wished to marry girl especially protestant girl be impossible that must be impossible now fred said kate looking up into face quite so dearest why must have vexed seeing that be so good to that must be gone so soon who have told of asked mr o'hara that woman down there at castle quin lady mary foul tongued old maid that be exclaimed fred writes to aunt by post believe what evil can say of doe say evil never mind what woman always say evil of of sex who be good looking there mother be for said kate laughing care what say if tell aunt that live in small cottage without servant without society with just bare necessary of life tell truth of be just what doe say go on harping about religion never mind can understand that uncle must be old fashioned be very old must wait waiting be so weary said mr o'hara be not weary for at said kate then left without having said word about captain found captain to be subject very uncomfortable to mention thought a be sitting there that might perhaps be better to make first enquiry of priest one said word to about captain beyond what have heard from boatman for a happened did not see priest till may be nearly past during time thing be going from bad to worse a regarded service rendered to army at period of career excuse have made to uncle be certainly not valid pretence at positively necessary routine duty must be supposed that made spent more of time on sea among cliff with kate on road going backwards forward than did at quarter be known that be to leave regiment become great man at home in october brother officer be kind to be known also of course that there be young lady down on sea coast beyond ennistimon doubtless there be joke on subject there be one with at ennis having such weight of fear authority a might have served to help to rescue during time lady mary quin still made report aunt letter be full of caution entreaty be told said countess in one of now detested epistle that young woman have reprobate father who have escaped from galley oh fred break heart have almost forgotten captain when received further rumour have circulated to round by castle quin scroope manor be going from bad to worse be allowed by mother to be at cottage a much a pleased girl be allowed to wander with when must among cliff be so although father marty have more than once cautioned mr o'hara that be imprudent what can do said have not taught to believe that be true just spake word to miss kate can say to now regard a husband before god be not husband in way must prevent taking wife plases believe misthress o'hara sort of young men like girl dale better when there be little betand off ' about be too late to bid to be indifferent to now father marty be not saying that miss kate be to lose lover hope will have binding of 'em together will go bail will do fast enough in meanwhile let keep herself to herself little more advice be very good mr o'hara knew not how to make use of must tell young man that must have heart blood if deceived must look at a though meant to be a good a word have courage enough for great emergency now that lover have be made free of cottage knew not how to debar must not break kate heart by expressing doubt to be to be told to stay away must not be lost to for ever of course must desert if must then must die be going from bad to worse certainly not le so because be more than ever infatuated about girl when have calculated whether might be possible to desert have be at scroope be in county clare now did not hesitate to tell that be impossible whatever might happen to whomever might be false must be true to must at rate be so true to that must not leave if never made legal wife wife legal at point must always treat a wife when uncle earl must die when time came in must be absolutely free a to own motion must discover way in might best be done if be true that kate father be convict escaped from galley surely must be additional reason why must not be made countess of scroope even mr o'hara must understand that with kate with own kate thought that there must be difficulty from bad to worse ala ala there came day in pricelessness of girl loved sank to nothing vanished away be a thing utterly lost even in eye poor unfortunate one to whom beauty have be given grace softness beyond finer than innocence a unsullied a whiteness of plumage on breast of dove to whom ala have not be given protector strong enough to protect softness guardian wise enough to guard innocence to be godlike noble excellent holy be man whom fortune more than kind have sent to to be joy of existence fountain of life strong staff for weakness not to believe in must be foulest treason to lose must be to die to deny must be to deny god gave pricelessness in eye be gone for ever be sitting with one day towards end of may on edge of cliff looking down upon ocean listening to wave when occurred to that might a well ask about father be absurd thought to stand upon ceremony with be very good to intended to be always good to be essentially necessary to to know truth be not aware perhaps that be becoming rougher with than have be wont certainly be not aware of though there be touch of awe sometimes about a answered be aware that now shewed to absolute obedience in thing have not be customary with then be so sweet to obey so happy thing to have master if rebuked did with arm round waist so that must look into face smile a promised that must be good follow behest in thing have be telling now of fault in dress have be explaining that such fault must come when money be so scarce then have offered gift gift must of course take have already taken gift be treasure of heart must not pay thing for till till then again looked up into face smiled be not angry with said kate want to ask particular question what question must not suppose let answer be what may that can make difference between oh hope not replied trembling will make none answered with master assurance authority therefore need not be afraid to answer tidings have reached on matter a to ought to be informed what matter oh fred do so frighten will tell anything know have be told that father be alive looked down upon must see that face be red up to very hair mother once told that have never be certain of death used to think be dead now think be alive think be know never saw father so a to remember though do remember that used to be very unhappy when be in spain what have heard lately tell truth know of course will tell truth fred think mother got letter did not shew said just word nothing more father marty will certainly know if know know nothing nothing think must ask father marty will matter to kate asked at rate will not matter to said kissing then again be happy though there have now crept across heart shadow of sad foreboding foretaste of sorrow be not altogether bitter a sorrow be taught to cling closely to when be there must fill eye with tear when thought of in absence on day have not found mr o'hara at cottage have gone down to liscannor kate told have sent boat back to strand near village round point into bay a must not well lie under rock at high tide now asked kate to accompany a walked down must probably meet mother on road kate a tied on hat be only too happy to be companion think said that will try see father marty a go back if mother have really heard anything about father ought to have told be angry with mother fred wo be angry with darling said master with masterful tenderness although have intimated intention of calling on priest very afternoon may be doubted whether be altogether gratified when met very man with mr o'hara close to old burying ground ah mr neville said priest how be wid many day top of morning to thin father marty said fred trying to assume irish brogue nothing must be more friendly than greeting old priest took off hat to kate made low bow a though must say to future countess of scroope owe very especial respect mr o'hara held future son in law hand for moment a though might preserve for daughter by show of affection on own part now misthress o'hara said priest a have got companion to go back wid be thinking will not go up hill further then parted kate looked a though be being robbed of due

whisky cork whisky be always to fore mr neville how did lave matter with noble uncle neville at present moment be anxious rather to speak of kate ignoble father than of own noble uncle have declared intention of making inquiry of father marty thought that must do so with something of high hand still have scheme in head might perhaps be better prepared to discus with priest if must first make friend of o'hara family understand how much neville be personally injured by turning up of disreputable father must allow priest at once to run away to scroope noble uncle result of such conversation must simply be renewed promise on part in reference to future conduct to kate o'hara lord scroope be very well when left by bye father marty have be particularly anxious to see 'deed thin be aisy

road turning round looking neville full in face fred bore look fairly well perhaps at moment did not understand application may be that still have clear conscience in matter thought that be resolved to treat kate o'hara after fashion must in way detract from own character a gentleman a be continued priest be low blag guard have money suppose think be iver throubled much in respect of money money

to boast of along of captain be alive father marty be dead think have right to be told be glad to hear ask a right mr neville have right if young lady up there be to be wife fred made answer here though priest paused for moment hoping that must do so question must be asked again father marty went on to tell that knew that have heard of captain o'hara be alive mr o'hara have received letter purporting to be from husband giving address in london asking for money father marty have seen letter thought that there might perhaps be doubt whether be written by man of whom be speaking mr o'hara have declared that if be so written handwriting be much altered then in twelve year writing of man who drank hard will change be twelve year since have last received letter from what do believe think life that wrote mr neville will tell god truth about a believe because a said before think be entitled to know truth what be done sent off to london to friend have what did friend say say there be man calling captain o'hara be that got second letter got very last day be down here pat cleary took up to when be out wid miss kate want money suppose just that mr neville make difference doe how doe make difference well doe wonder see must see from moment father marty said in heart that kate o'hara have lost husband not that admitted for moment captain be return if have returned must justify lover in deserting girl that perceived that neville have already allowed to entertain plea whole affair have in priest estimation be full of peril then prize to be won be very great from first have liked young man have not doubted did not now doubt that if once married must do justice to wife even though kate must fail must come out of contest with scorched heart that have thought more than probable still prize be very high girl thought be one who must survive blow latterly in respect have changed opinion kate have shewn to be capable of so deep passion that be now sure that must be more than scorched must fire be one to injure not to cherish man promise have be so firm so often reiterated be so clearly written that priest have almost dared to hope that thing be assured now ala perceived that embryo english lord be already looking for mean of escape already thought that have found in unfortunate return of father whole extent of sorrow even priest did not know be determined to fight battle to very last man must make girl wife father marty parish priest of liscannor must know reason why be man who be wont to desire to know reason why a to matter have taken in hand when heard word neville spoke marked tone in be uttered felt that young man be preparing for way of escape see that must make difference said shortly if man be disreputable daughter be not therefore disreputable position be not changed have to think of friend must have thought of before declared to mr neville how true be now young man knew better than priest that a yet be own secret mean to tell that because father be not that must be be therefore to be thrown over can not be idea of honour have not promised that must make wife priest stopped for answer young man made none of course have promised suppose have told so to whom must tell story to whom must go for advice be who told so never did not swear to that must not injure why must there have be talk with about saw what be coming when young man like chooses to spend hour day after day week after week with one a be with beautiful young girl sweet innocent young lady so sweet a to make even ould priest like feel that very atmosphere breathes be perfumed hallowed must not mean one of two thing that desire to make wife else else something so vile will not name in connection with kate o'hara then a mother friend a hers a only friend near spoke out plainly to swore to that intended harm to must not harm for world when said that told a plainly a must spake that must be wife with own mouth never told mother have told daily mr o'hara have spoken to of hope fear by lord above whom worship by son in whom rest hope must not stand in shoe if intend to tell woman that after have passed mean to desert child who have talked of deserting asked neville angrily say that will be true to that will make wife before god man will humbly ask pardon say be that captain o'hara coming be nuisance if be there be end of be nuisance not that suppose ever will come if persists must send little money there will be difficulty about will never ask to supply mean of keeping husband be money think hardly understand position father marty seemed to neville that if be ever intention to open out scheme to priest now be time for doing so have come to cross road at one way led down to village to father marty house other to spot on beach where boat must be waiting ca very well go on to liscannor said neville give word before part that will keep promise to miss o'hara said priest if will step on few yard with will tell just how be situated then priest assented went on towards beach walking very slowly if alone be concerned must give up everything for miss o'hara be willing to give up everything a regard love so dearly that be more to than honour wealth be to come to when uncle dy what be to hinder that must have girl love uncle honour wealth into bargain be just by life of see difficulty be own masther ould earl ca disinherit if must be bound down how bound who can bind be bound not to make miss o'hara countess of scroope what bind be bound by hundred promise to make wife have taken oath that roman catholic will become countess scroope a wife then mr neville let tell that must break oath must have perjure faith must perjure one way certainly must av have taken oath a for have sworn many oath that must make catholic lady wife not make roman

seeing uncle ould man be told nigh to latter end be not saying what must respect even wakeness will not look in face tell that afther what be come gone that young lady be to be cast on one side like plucked rose because ould man have spoken foolish word because young man have made wicked promise be now standing again fred raised hat rubbed forehead a endeavoured to arrange word in must best propose scheme to priest have not yet escaped from idea because father marty be roman catholic priest living in village in extreme west of ireland listening night day to roll of atlantic drinking whisky punch therefore must be found to be romantic semi barbarous perhaps more than semi lawless in view of life irish priest have be made by chronicler of irish story to do marvellous thing fred neville thought that priest if only matter must be properly introduced might be persuaded to do for something romantic something marvellous perhaps something almost lawless in truth might have be difficult to find man more practical more honest than mr marty then difficulty of introducing subject be very great neville stood with face little averted rubbing forehead a raised sailor hat if must only read heart said 'd know be a true a steel 'd be lothe to doubt neville 'd give up everything to call kate own need give up nothing yet have own say that because completely understand may a well be taken for granted at once that can never be countess of scroope taken for granted said old man a fire flashed out of eye just listen to for one moment will marry to morrow at time may fix if marriage can be so arranged that will never be more than mr neville what must be mr must son be oh just same when grew up perhaps there must be son god forbid that there must on term intend that child child will be bastard be about mr neville romance seemed to vanish when matter be submitted to in very prosaic manner a to what might choose to call must be nothing to not very much must say to believe man need be lord unless like to be lord need call wife countess mr neville when have married miss o'hara when uncle will have died there can be other countess of scroope child must be heir to uncle title must give except that must have must have must be wife before god man child must be child of honour not of disgrace ah if priest have known must live abroad with mother must live with mean that must take kate a misthress make a proposal to upon word mr neville think that quite understand what be that be maning to say to be to be wife yes said neville urged by perturbation of spirit to give stronger assurance than have intended then must son if have one be future earl of scroope may be protesthant what will understand father marty faith be thrue be at baich mr neville have two mile along coast to liscannor will make barney take round in canoe believe may a well walk good bye mr neville be glad at rate to hear say so distinctly that be resolved at hazard to make dear girl wife said almost in whisper standing close to boat with hand on neville shoulder paused moment a though to give special strength to word neville did not dare be not able to protest against assertion father marty be certainly not romantic in manner of managing such affair a in be now concerned neville went back to ennis much depressed turning matter over in mind almost hopelessly be what have come from adventure doubt might marry girl postponing marriage till after uncle death for aught knew a yet that might still be possible be to do so must disgrace family disgrace by breaking solemn promise have made in such case must be encumbered possibly be put beyond pale of sort of life must be a earl of scroope by having captain o'hara a father in law be aware now that must be held by natural friend to have ruined by marriage on other hand must no doubt throw girl over must not make marry though must probably make pay very dearly for not doing so if must only harden heart sufficiently must escape in way be not hard did feel that so escaping must have load on breast must make life unendurable already be beginning to hate coast of ireland to think that gloom of scroope manor be preferable to chapter iii fred neville receives visitor at ennis for something over three week after walk with priest neville saw of two lady of ardkill letter be frequent between cottage barrack at ennis so said fred military duty detained with troop explained that have be absent great deal now captain johnstone be taking share of ease be alone at barrack must not get away there be truth in created perhaps by fact that a did stir johnstone must do so johnstone be backwards forward fishing at castle connel neville be very exact in explaining that for present be obliged to give up delight of coast day be day of trial to short history of life of captain o'hara be absolutely sent to by countess of scroope family lawyer at instance of earl a said though probably own interference have be more energetic than of earl have caused enquiry to be made captain o'hara husband of lady who be now living on coast of county clare who be undoubtedly father of miss o'hara whom fred knew have passed at least ten of latter year of life at galley in south of france have be engaged in extensive swindling transaction at bordeaux have thence be transferred to toulon have there be maintained by france be now in countess in sending interesting story to nephew at ennis with ample documentary evidence said that be sure that must not degrade family utterly by thinking of allying with people who be so thoroughly disreputable that after be passed uncle expected from renewed assurance on matter answered in anger did not understand why history of captain o'hara must have be raked up captain o'hara be nothing to supposed have come from castle quin anything from castle quin disbelieved have given promise once did understand why must be asked for further assurance thought very hard that life must be made burden to by foul mouthed rumour from castle quin be tenour of letter to aunt even that letter sufficed to make almost certain that must never marry girl acknowledged that have bound not to do so then in spite of that said about mendacity of castle quin did believe little history be quite out of question that must marry daughter of returned galley slave did not think that jury in england must hold to be bound by such promise of course must do whatever must for dear kate even after have passed must not pollute by marriage with child of so vile father poor kate suffering must have be occasioned not by by father in meantime kate letter to became more more frequent more more sad filled ever with still increasing warmth of entreaty at last came by post though knew how difficult must be for to find daily messenger into ennistimon must not come see must come see be ill must die unless came to did not always answer letter did write to perhaps twice week must come very soon a soon a johnstone have come back from fishing be not to fret herself of course must not always be at ardkill too have thing to trouble then told have received letter from home caused very much trouble there be something of sharpness in word brought from string of lamentation in however tear wailing did not a yet take form of reproach then there came short note from mr o'hara must beg that will come to ardkill at once be absolutely necessary for kate safety that must do so when received thought that must go on morrow when morrow came determined to postpone journey day call of duty be so much le imperious than of pleasure on further day still meant to go a sat about noon unbraced only partly dressed in room at barrack friend johnstone be back in ennis there be also cornet with troop have excuse on score of military duty for remaining at home on day sat idling time thinking of thing charm of adventure be gone be sick of canoe of barney morony did not care straw for seal wild gull moaning of ocean beneath cliff be no longer pleasurable to a to moaning at summit to tell truth be afraid of long drive thither back be tedious to thought now more of respectability of family than of beauty of kate o'hara still meant to go certainly must go on very day have desired that gig must be ready have sent word to say that might start at moment still sat in dressing gown at noon unbraced with novel in hand must not read pipe by side must not smoke close to on table lay that record of life of captain o'hara aunt have sent word of have now examined for third fourth time of course must not marry girl mr o'hara have deceived must not have known that husband be convict have kept knowledge back from in order that might allure to marriage anything that money must do must do if must consent must take girl away

be at french galley have just made up mind that must be firm in resolution when door opened mr o'hara entered room mr o'hara closed door carefully behind before spoke excluding military servant who have wished to bar entrance yes sir a must not come to have be forced to come to know when will make child wife yes in abjectness of misery poor girl have told mother story of disgrace rather in weakness have suffered secret to fall from lip that terrible retribution be to come upon when sin have be mutual fall with so crushing weight upon who of two sinner have ever be by far le sinful when knew doom simply found bound by still stronger tie of love to who have so cruelly injured be before now be more than ever to have near to give order that might obey be consolation that coveted only consolation must have availed anything to to lean against to whisper to with face averted with half formed syllable fervent word might convey to truth might be almost joy to if must make so be one thing must restore hope to bosom let come be near to so that might hide face upon breast came not did not come though a best knew how have thrown heart into letter then spirit sank within sickened a mother knelt over allowed secret to fall from fred neville sitting room at ennis be not chamber prepared for reception of lady be very rough a be usually barrack room in outlying quarter in small town in west of ireland be also very untidy more prudent orderly of mankind might hardly have understood why young man with prospect present wealth such a belonged to neville must choose to spend twelvemonth in such room contrary to wish of friend when london be open to continent score of best appointed house in england glory of ownership at scroope there be gun about whip hardly dozen book few paper there be couple of sword lying on table looked like dresser room be not above half covered with carpet though there be three large easy chair even be torn soiled have be compatible with adventure while adventure be simply romantic not bit troublesome barrack at ennis have be to by far preferable to gloomy grandeur of scroope now mr o'hara be there telling that knew of not for moment did remain ignorant of meaning of communication now argument to be used against in reference to marriage must be stronger than ever silly painful smile came across handsome face a attempted to welcome moved chair for accommodation be so sorry that have have trouble of coming over said that be nothing when will make child wife how be to answer in midst of difficulty have brought to one determination have resolved that under pressure must marry daughter of o'hara galley slave a far a that have seen way must now at once speak of galley slave with expression of regret decline alliance on reason having dishonoured woman daughter must shelter behind dishonour of husband that meant to do so ultimately be true at present moment task must have required harder heart than rose from chair stood close over a repeated demand when will make child wife want to answer at moment yes at moment why not answer at once have told mr neville must think not only of of child also hope not that said tell that be so now answer when will kate become wife still knew that such consummation a be quite out of question mother a be now present to seemed to be woman very different from quiet handsome high spirited low voiced widow whom have known thought that have known at ardkill of a have there appeared to have not be ashamed to think a one who might at future time be personally related to have recognized a lady whose outward trapping poor though might be be suited to seclusion in lived now although be only to ennis that have come from nest among rock seemed to be unfitted for even so much intercourse with world a in demand reiterated over hardly spoke a lady must speak must not all who be connected with at home have right to complain if be to bring woman with to england a mother of wife ca answer such question a on spur of moment said will not dare to tell that mean to desert certainly not be coming over to ardkill very day trap be ordered hope kate be well be not well how must be well why not did know if there be anything that want can get for have only to speak in utter contempt mr o'hara now felt for man probably forgot that immediate situation be one in be nearly impossible that man must conduct with dignity having brought to present pas by misconduct must discover line of good conduct now open to moralist might tell let girl parentage be what might ought to marry be stopped from that not only by oath by conviction that highest duty required to preserve family from degradation yet to mother with demand on lip a now made by mr o'hara whose demand be backed by such circumstance how be possible that must tell truth plead honour of family condition be so cruel that be no longer possible to to be dignified even true mother again made demand there be one thing must do for before other thing can be thought of when will become wife be for moment on tongue to tell that must not be so while uncle lived to at once felt that there be two objection directly opposed to other so strong a to make such reply very dangerous must imply promise certainly did not intend to keep of marrying girl when uncle must be dead although promising so much more than intended to perform must raise ungovernable wrath of woman before that must now hesitate now in kate present condition a to redeeming vow of marriage have made to in innocence must raise fury in mother bosom feared to encounter got up walked about room while stood with eye fixed upon ever anon reiterating demand day must now be lost when will make child wife at last made proposition to assented tidings have brought have come upon very suddenly be inexpressibly pained of course kate dearest kate be everything to let have afternoon to think about on morrow must assuredly visit ardkill mother full of fear resolving must attempt to play girl false escape from must follow to end of world feeling at present moment must not constrain accepted repeated promise a to following day at last left to chapter iv neville success neville sat in room alone without moving for couple of hour after mr o'hara have left in what way must escape from misery ruin seemed to surround idea did cross mind that must be better for to fly write truth from comparatively safe distance of london club there must be meanness in such conduct must make impossible that must ever again hold up head girl have trusted to by trusting to have brought to miserable pas must not desert must be better that must go endure vial of wrath than to must still be tenderly loving if must accept love without name must not give whole life must sacrifice to luxury money must purchase must lavish on must go make offer vial of wrath must doubtless be poured out upon head must not come from in heart of heart feared priest mother there be moment in man feel obliged to encounter that most fear man who doe not do so in such moment be coward quite made up mind to start early on following morning intermediate hour be very sad heavy whole outlook into life be troublesome to how infinitely better must have be for have allowed to be taught twelvemonth since duty required to give up army at once have made bed now must lie upon there be escape from journey to ardkill even though must be stunned by wrath must endure breakfasted early next day got into gig before nine must face enemy earlier that did better difficulty now lay in arranging proposition that must make word that must speak difficulty must be smoothed danger dispelled if must only say that must marry girl a quickly a legal form must allow father marty knew must see to marriage might be done effectually have quite come to understand that father marty be practical rather than romantic there must be cowardice in a mean a other cowardice believed to be bound by duty to family be now to renew promise of marriage such renewal must be caused by fear not by duty must be mean must tear piecemeal rather than get from promise then thought of captain perceived that must make possible use of captain character must anybody conceive that heir of scroope family be bound to marry daughter of convict returned from galley be not true that such promise a have made have be obtained under false pretence why have not be told of captain position when first made intimate with mother daughter instead of going a be custom to lahinch then rowing across bay round point drove gig to village of liscannor be sick of barney morony canoe never desired to see of again be sick indeed of everything irish thought that whole island be mistake drove however boldly through liscannor up to father marty yard not finding priest at home there left horse gig have determined that must first go to priest boldly declare that nothing must induce to marry daughter of convict father marty be not at home old woman who kept house believed that have gone into ennistown be away with horse must not be back till dinner time then neville having seen own nag taken from gig

fred kate man whom be expected that frederic future earl of scroope must take a father in law be captain o'hara said priest even father marty bold a be must not assume voice with have rebuked neville a walked with now nearly month ago down to beach neville did feel that abomination of man appearance strengthened position stood looking from one to while mr o'hara remained silent in corner perhaps said have better not be here be intruding be right that must know said priest a regard young lady can not now alter position gentleman must be arranged for oh certainly said captain must be arranged for so soon a possible man spoke with slightly foreign accent in tone a fred thought savoured altogether of galley have done honour be informed to make daughter own estimable people assure that hasten to make wife on instant consent o'hara who be of very oldest blood in europe have always connected highly uncle be most excellent nobleman whose hand will be proud to grasp a thus spoke stalked across room to fred intending at once to commence work of grasping neville family get back said fred retreating to door be that fail to believe that be bride father know not whose father may be get back be

condition of kate o'hara have sent news to friend with greedy rapidity in sending lady mary quin entertained slightest doubt a to duty of present earl of scroope according to thinking must not be duty of earl of scroope in circumstance to marry kate o'hara there be woman who in regard to such trouble a now existed at ardkill cottage always think that woman must be punished a sinner that man must be assisted to escape hardness of heart of such woman who in other view of life be perhaps tender soft natured be one of marvel of social system be a though certain line be drawn to include woman line ala little more than line by overstepping rather by being known to have overstepped woman cease to be woman in estimation of own sex that existence of feeling have strong effect in saving woman from passing line none of can doubt that general tendency may be good rather than evil be possible hardness necessary to preserve rule hardness must be exclusively feminine be seldom wanting be marvellous feature in female character lady mary quin probably thought little on subject woman in cottage on cliff who be befriended by father marty be to dangerous scheming roman catholic adventurer proper

suit will not regret said kate care nothing for grand house must only be afraid of know be dark sombre for have said so oh fred place will be paradise to if be there with felt that moment of existence so continued be renewed lie be lying in arm in mother presence almost a acknowledged wife be speaking of future home a being certainly also what must do how must begin to tell truth home must be home if must come to not a wife that idea of half valid morganatic marriage have again be dissipated by rough reproach of priest must only be used a prelude to viler proposal though loved girl after fashion desired to wound by such vile proposal did not wish to live life of sin if such life might be avoided if made proposal must be for sake rather that might show that did not wish to cast aside be by asserting to that for sake must relinquish own rank be that possible that attempted to relieve own conscience in mean time be in arm talking about joint future home where do think of living asked mr o'hara in tone shewed plainly anxiety with asked question probably abroad said mother may go with girl felt that tension of arm be relaxed knew that be not well with if there be ought amiss with how much more must be amiss with what be fred said there be secret will not tell to then whispered into ear word intended for alone though mother heard if there be secret must tell now think how be with word be life death to now still held with loosened arm did not answer sat looking out into middle of room with fixed eye felt that drop of perspiration be on brow knew that other woman be glaring at with eye of injured lioness though did not dare to turn own to face fred tell tell kate rose up with knee upon sofa bending over gazing into countenance imploring there must be disappointment said did not know sound of own voice what disappointment speak to what disappointment disappointment shrieked mother how disappointment there will be disappointment rising from chair hurried across room took girl from arm lord scroope tell mean say there will be disappointment sit away from kate till have told what be then heard sound of horse foot passing close to window knew that be priest there be father marty said mr o'hara will make tell have already told lord scroope a said rose moved towards door be almost unconscious of movement idea probably crossed mind that must meet priest mr o'hara thought that intended to escape from rushed between door held with hand leave in way though be twice earl be not thinking of leaving mother will not hurt will not insult said girl doe not mean to harm be own one will touch certainly will not harm here be father marty mr o'hara have better be tranquil must remember that have heard nothing yet of what must say to whose fault be that why do not speak father marty what doe mean when tell girl that there must be disappointment for doe dare to tell that hesitates to make wife priest took mother by hand placed on chair in usually sat then almost without word led kate from room to own chamber bade wait minute till must come back to then returned to sitting room at once addressed to lord scroope have dared said to tell what hardly dared to tell to have dared to tell nothing said mr o'hara wonder at think that man must say to that told that must do mr o'hara said young lord with return of courage now that girl have left that told mr marty morning will now tell to for daughter will do anything that may wish one thing can not make countess of scroope must make wife said woman shouting at will do so to morrow if way can be found by will not become countess of scroope be will marry without making wife said priest will jump over broomstick with will ask to help so that feeling hers may be spared for week so mr o'hara be villain vile heartless cowardly reprobate so low in scale of humanity that degrade by spaking to call english peer peer to what certainly to one worthy to be called man so speaking priest addressed to mr o'hara a spoke eye be fixed full on face of young lord will have heart out of body exclaimed mr o'hara heart have heart may touch pocket pride what call pride damnable devilish inhuman vanity name that bugbear of title by trust to cover baseness skin for be coward do see cheek now a for heart can not get at will get at life said woman mr marty allow liberty of speech even priesthood will not warrant lay hand upon if can there be not blood enough about to do be not that poor child have be wake too trusting must bid spit on rather than take for husband then paused only for moment sir must marry there must be end of in other way can be allowed to live must murder must crush like insect beneath nail murder have thought what murder be that there be more way of murder than one have thought of life of young girl who now bear in womb fruit of body must murder because loved trusted gave simply because asked then think of own life a god of heaven be above see now saviour in whose blood trust must lay down life instant if must save from heartlessness so saying too turned away face wept like child after priest be gentler in manner to young man almost seemed a though earl be driven from decision ceased at rate to assert that kate must never be countess of scroope allowed mother father marty to fall into state of doubt a to what last resolve might be be decided that must go down to ennistimon sleep upon on morrow must come up again in meantime must see father marty at inn there be many prayer addressed to by mother priest such argument used that have be almost shaken will come to morrow said mother looking at priest a spoke will certainly come to morrow doubt will come to morrow said father marty who intended to imply that if lord scroope escaped out of ennistimon without knowledge must be very much surprised will not say word to kate earl asked a be going not till be prepared to tell that will be wife said priest be matter a to kate have word to say when be in passage came out from room again rushed into lover arm oh fred let told let told will go with anywhere if will take be to come up to morrow kate said mother will be here early to morrow everything will be settled then said priest trying to assume happy contented tone dearest kate will be here by noon said lord scroope returning girl caress will not desert darling then went leaving priest behind at cottage father marty be to be with at inn by eight then whole matter must be again discussed felt that have be very weak that have made use almost use at of damning fact of captain existence have allowed priest to talk down in argument have be actually awed by girl mother yet be determined that must not yield felt more strongly than ever now that have again seen kate o'hara that must not be right that one a must be made countess of scroope not only must disgrace place must be unhappy in must shame after promise that have made must not must not take to scroope a wife how must hold up head before such woman a sophie mellerby others like must be known by friend that have be taken in swindled by low people in county clare must be regarded by around a one who have absolutely ruined have positively resolved that must not be countess of scroope to resolution must adhere foul mouthed priest have called coward must be coward mother have said that must have life if there be danger in respect must encounter a returned to ennistimon again determined that kate o'hara must never become countess of scroope for three hour father marty remained with night did not shake have now become accustomed to priest wrath must endure thought also that must now endure mother tear of girl reproach still did fear will do anything that can dictate short of that said again to father marty anything one thing that have sworn to do anything one thing have sworn not to do for have told priest of promise have made to uncle to uncle widow then said priest a crammed hat on head shook dust off foot if be must not go to ardkill to morrow if valued life nevertheless father marty slept at ennistimon night be prepared to bar way if attempt at escape be made chapter xi on cliff attempt at escape be made earl breakfasted by at about nine then lighting cigar roamed about for while round inn thinking of work be now before saw nothing of father marty though knew that priest be still in ennistimon felt that be watched might have saved that trouble for certainly have intention of breaking word to so told thinking a did so that people such a must not understand that earl of scroope must not be untrue to word yet since have be back in county clare have almost regretted that have not broken faith to remained in england at half past ten started on car having promised to be at cottage at noon told servant that must certainly leave ennistimon day at three horse gig be to be ready for exactly at hour on occasion did not go through liscannor took other road to burial ground there left car slowly walked along cliff till came to path leading down from to cottage in doing went somewhat out of way have time on hand did not desire to be at cottage before hour have named be hot midsummer day there seemed to be hardly ripple on wave tide be full in sat for while looking down upon blue water what as have made coming thither in quest of adventure began to see now meaning of such idleness of purpose a to have looked for pleasure excitement even ocean very rock have lost charm for be one blaze of blue light sky above water below in there be beauty variety how poor have be life have chosen have spent hour after hour in comfortless dirty boat in company with wretched ignorant creature in order that might shoot few bird possibly seal world have be open to yet how miserable have be ambition now must see way out of ruin have brought upon when time have come rose from seat took path down to cottage at corner of little patch of garden ground attached to met mr o'hara hat be on head light shawl be on shoulder a though have prepared for walking immediately asked after kate told that kate be within must see presently must not be better that two must go up on cliff together then say what might be necessary for mutual understanding of purpose there must be talking of before kate said mr o'hara be true can imagine what must feel if be told to doubt lord scroope will not say at once that there will be doubt must not ruin child in return for love if there must be ruin must sooner bear said then walked on without further speech till have reached point somewhat to right higher than on have sat before have ever be favourite spot with have often sat there between mother daughter be almost summit of cliff there be yet higher pitch screened from north so that force of wind be broken fall from be almost precipitous to ocean so that face of rock immediately below be not in view there be curve here in line of shore little bay in coast exposed to view whole side of opposite cliff so that varying colour of rock might be seen two lady have made seat upon turf by moving loose stone levelling earth around so that must sit securely on very edge many many hour have mr o'hara passed upon spot summer winter watching sunset in west listening to scream of bird there be gull now said a seated a though for moment have forgotten great subject filled mind never show in weather like only come when wind blow wonder where go when sun shine be just opposite to men woman who only come around in fine weather how hot be threw shawl back from shoulder yes indeed walked up from burial ground found that be very hot have seen father marty morning have asked question turning upon very shortly not to day be with till late last night well did not answer have nothing to say to in fact everything have be said yesterday if have question to ask must answer what did settle last night when went from hour after be gone said that be impossible that must mean to destroy god forbid must destroy said that that be afraid of father be of not of mr o'hara listen to said that one a can not endure presence of uneducated ill mannered mother in law interrupt lord scroope if will marry girl will never see face again will cling to man will not leave for moment so that will never put foot near door name will never be spoken in hearing will never even write to if think better that will be so separated be not that said what be then oh mr o'hara understand must love dearly must have keep love for do love be good enough for be too good so be be for family not for how will harm family swore to uncle must not make countess of scroope have not sworn to again again that must be wife do think that must have done for what have done have not so sworn lord scroope can not think that really mean put hand softly upon arm looked up to imploring mercy got up from seat roamed along cliff followed still imploring tone be soft word be word of suppliant must not relent save child from wretchedness from ruin from death will keep with till die said not a wife will have attention from everything that woman heart can desire two will be never separated not a wife will live where may please will want nothing that wife must posse not a wife not a countess of scroope must have a mistress then a asked question tone of voice be altogether altered threatening lion look have returned to eye be now near seat confronted to other fury of bosom for while have be dominated by tenderness of love for daughter be again raging within be possible that must be able to treat thus that must break word go from scathless happy joyous with delight of world before leaving crushed into dust beneath foot have be called upon from youth upwards to bear injustice of injustice surely must be worst a mistress repeated mother be to stand by see know girl be dishonoured must mother have borne that for sister how must be if sister be a girl be now have sister therefore be thus hard hearted will never

peril of position on top of cliff have not occurred to did occur to now have be there so often that place gave sense of danger have peril a be thought afterwards by who most closely made inquiry on matter ever occurred to have not brought there that might frighten with danger that might avenge by power gave now idea flashed across maddened mind miscreant said bore back to very edge of precipice will have over cliff exclaimed hardly even yet putting out strength against so will by help of god now think of now think of a spoke pressed backwards towards fall have power enough to bend knee to crouch beneath grasp on to loose crumbling soil of margin of rock still held by cuff seemed for moment a though must go with on sudden spurned with foot on breast rag of cloth parted in hand poor wretch tumbled forth alone into eternity be end of frederic neville earl of scroope end too of poor girl hope in world when stretch on edge of cliff look down over abyss on sea below seems a though rock be so absolutely perpendicular that stone dropped with extended hand must fall amidst wave in such measurement eye deceives for rock in truth slant down young man a fell struck again again at last be broken mangled corpse that reached blue water below kate be at last avenged woman stood there in solitude for minute thinking of thing have done man have injured sorely have punished have richly deserved death have received from hand in minute a regarded there be remorse how must tell news to child blow have thrust over must too probably destroy other life than must not be better that girl must so die what must prolonged life give must be worth having a for herself in first moment of awe took thought of own danger did not occur to that might tell how man have ventured too near edge have fallen by mischance a regarded herself be proud of thing have accomplished how must tell child that be done slowly took path not to cottage down towards burial ground liscannor passing car be waiting in vain for young lord on walked with rapid step indifferent to heat still proud of what have done raging with maddened pride how little have two asked of world then man have come to robbed of little have spoiled ruthlessly cheating with lie then excusing by grandeur of blood during walk be that first repeated to herself word be ever afterwards on tongue eye for eye be not that justice have not taken eye must court in world have given to yes eye for eye death in return for ruin one destruction for punishment have be just eye for eye let court of world now say what pleased must not return to earldom man who have plundered spoiled child have sworn that must not make kate countess of scroope must make other woman countess rapidly went down by burying ground into priest house father marty be there stalked at once into presence have mr o'hara where be lord scroope there said pointing out towards ocean under rock have fallen thrust down with hand with foot a said used hand foot a though be now using strength to push man over edge yes thrust down fell splashing into wave heard a body struck water will shoot more of sea gull now mean that have murdered may call murder if please father marty eye for eye father marty be justice have done eye for eye chapter xii conclusion story of poor mad woman who still proclaims in seclusion justice of deed did have now be told may perhaps be well to collect scattered end of thread of tale for benefit of reader who desire to know whole of history mr o'hara never returned to cottage on cliff after perpetration of deed on unhappy priest devolved duty of doing must be done police at neighbouring barrack be told that young lord have perished by fall from cliff by search be made for body real attempt be set on foot to screen woman who have done deed by concealment of fact be not alive to necessity of making such attempt eye for eye said to head constable when man interrogated soon became known to liscannor to ennistimon to lady at castle quin to barony of corcomroe that mr o'hara have thrust earl of scroope over cliff of moher that be now detained at house of father marty in custody of policeman before day be over be declared also
