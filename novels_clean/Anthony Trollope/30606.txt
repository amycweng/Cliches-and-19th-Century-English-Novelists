iii father brosnan there have come change among priest in ireland during last fifty year a have be natural among whom have there not come change in century in england statesman be different parson judge peer when entire country have be left unmoved by outside world so a to seem to have be left asleep while others have be awake different class will seem to be same at end of half century village lawyer in spain will be a be village lawyer fifty year ago parish priest in ireland will be altered personage because country generally have not be sleeping there used to be two distinct sort of priest of whom elder who have probably be abroad be better educated whereas younger who be home nurtured have le to say for on general topic be generally more zealous in religious duty elder be better read in doctrinal theology a to political question of day be apt to be on list against government though not so with such violence a to make often obnoxious to law be natural that must be opposed to government a long a protestant church claimed ascendency over feeling aspiration be based then on religious opinion now set of men have risen up with whom opposition to ruler of country be connected chiefly with political idea dream of home rule have made what be thus have be roused into waking life by american spirit have be imported into country there be still old difference between elder younger priest parish priest be not so frequently opposed to law a be curate parish priest be willing that landlord will receive rent be not at least anxious that will be dispossessed of land curate have idea of peasant proprietor be very hot for home rule be le obedient to authority of bishop than be of yore think more of political le of religious state of country variance of feeling might be seen in three priest who have be already mentioned in story father giles be parish pastor of headford in position have be for nearly forty year be man seventy year of age in full possession of faculty very zealous in well being of people prone to teach that if must say prayer do a be bid by better must in long run after various phase of catholic well ill being go to heaven must also have enough to eat in world seemed to be almost more prominent in father giles teaching than happy bliss of heaven older father giles became more thought of good thing of world on behalf of people le liked being troubled with political desire of curate have gone so far a to forbid father brosnan to do to do on various occasion to make political speech here to attend demonstration there in doing in not doing curate sometimes obeyed sometimes disobeyed priest thereby bringing father giles in old age into infinite trouble father malachi in neighbouring parish of ballintubber ran course somewhat intermediate between two at present moment have curate who interfered with happiness there be indeed curate of ballintubber so named lived away not inhabiting same house with father malachi a be usual in ireland having chapel to seldom making way into part of country father malachi be strong minded man who knew world too have inclination for home rule still entertained jealousy against quasi ascendency of protestant bishop have sympathy whatever with father brosnan ireland for irish might be very well did not at want to have ireland for american father giles father malachi certainly agreed on one thing brosnan be great trouble if conversion of florian jones be to be attributed to clerical influence father brosnan be entitled to claim good evil done in truth very few polemical argument have be used on occasion boy head have be filled with idea of doing something remarkable have gone to priest when protestant child doe go to priest on such mission can priest do accept be bound to look upon suppliant a brand to be saved from burning stupid young as priest may say to apostrophising boy why remain a be for present why do come to trouble with matter can know nothing about priest must do a church directs brand have to be saved from burning father brosnan sent boy to father malachi father malachi told lad to go to terrestrial father be mr jones have expected there boy be received a catholic to father brosnan matter be much more important in political view father brosnan knew application a to rent have be made by pat carroll to landlord be of opinion that rent ought to be paid by irish tenant to landlord rent at least to protestant landlord wrath boiled within bosom when heard of answer be given a though mr jones have robbed man by refusal mr brosnan thought that for present tenant be a matter of course entitled to abatement in rent a in short time must be entitled to land without paying considered not at circumstance whether a have be case on certain property in mayo money expended have be so expended by tenant by landlord a have be case with pat carroll land be injustice according to mr brosnan theory a be property in accordance with teaching of political doctor who be not burdened with must have be unfair to mr brosnan to say that sympathised with murderer that agreed with who considered that midnight outrage be fair atonement demanded right must have be hot with righteous indignation have charge be made against in quarrel be now beginning sympathy be with carroll at large not with jones at large at victory won by british parliament heart again boiled with indignation at triumphant note came over water from america be generally raised by record of dollar sent boiled on other hand with joy have gleam in mind of republic thought of saxon a evil being queen must say be very well be better at distance lord lieutenant be british vanity english pomp chief secretary be minister of evil one believed that england be enriched by many million year robbed from ireland ireland be impoverished to same extent be man thoroughly disloyal at same time thoroughly ignorant altogether in dark a to truth of thing man who might be fitness for duty of priesthood to have be educated have capability of perceiving political fact honesty in teaching must have be unjust to to say that be murderer that countenanced murder to be that young florian now betook found seated alone in back parlour in father giles house old priest be out father brosnan be engaged on portion of clerical duty to give due performed duty rigidly more rigidly when in doing obeyed letter of law rather than spirit a father giles in idea of duty took altogether other side of question in thinking of spirit have nearly altogether ignored letter may be imagined that two men did not agree together very well in truth father giles looked upon father brosnan a ignorant impertinent puppy whereas father brosnan returned compliment by regarding father giles a infidel almost a bad a protestant well master florian said priest how be thing going with oh father brosnan be in terrible throuble what throuble up now be agin at home father nearly a bad a of be along of religion thought

cause of trouble at castle morony be injury thus done father brosnan knew approved of pat carroll enmity to jones family be able to justify falsehood of own heart by stumbling over degree of knowledge

with tale of man in mask only half told chapter v mr obeahony daughter must now turn to personage in story tell reader something of adventure condition of gentleman something also of daughter adventure of early life will occupy much of time many of page though father may not be so interesting a be hoped that will become still be so peculiar in mode of thought so honest though by mean wise in manner of thinking a to make story also perhaps worth telling gerald obeahony be at time of flooding of mr jones meadow not much more than forty year old be already father of daughter nearly twenty where be born from what parent to what portion of ireland family belonged one knew have be heard to declare suspicion that father have come from county kerry a have be according to own statement probably born in united state county to father have belonged be not important have be bred up a roman catholic have long since thrown over prejudice of religion have married when be quite young have soon lost wife in talking of now always described a angel though looked to be so young a to be daughter brother rather than father have never thought of marrying again daughter declared be everything to who knew well said that politics be dearer to even than daughter since have be known in county galway have passed repassed nearly dozen time between new york ireland daughter have twice come with have declared mean have never be known to borrow shilling to leave bill unpaid have frequently said aloud that have money left that unless returned to own country daughter must be taken in by poor house for mr obeahony fond a be of ireland allowed one to say that be irishman trouble be apparently trouble to be always good humoured seemed always to be happy except when in public when be engaged upon politics then must work up to such state of indignant anger a seemed to be altogether antagonistic to good humour position filled have filled be that of lecturer on behalf of united state have lectured at manchester at glasgow at liverpool lately over ireland have risen to height of wrath in advocating doctrine of republicanism that have be stopped by police have be held to have said thing disrespectful of queen loudly denied have always said spoken of queen virtue grace general fitness for high office have declared be true that of king queen of whom have read in history be best have gone on to say there must be king queen practice be absurdity reverence paid even to high office be such a in idea degraded man even in kotooing took place before president toe be to abomination man in accordance with theory must worship man title must only be used a indicative of man trade occupation a one man be mr general grant man must be mr bricklayer green must not do away with queen for woman be quite disposed to worship woman be to be worshipped be privilege of man to worship woman when woman possessed so many virtue a did queen of england became man duty to worship be woman whom must worship not queen be carried to such length be so eloquent on subject that police be desired to interfere be made to hold tongue at rate a far a england ireland be concerned have made galway kind of centre home attracted thither by friendship daughter have made with ada edith jones for though ada edith be by mean republican in thought feeling have come to pas that dearly loved american girl who be so rachel obeahony have frequently be at morony castle a have also father mr jones have taken delight in controverting argument of american because a have said american have be unselfish true since lecturing have be stopped have become necessary that must go elsewhere to look for mean of livelihood have now betaken to london for purpose circumstance will be explained at greater length a story progress republicanism be not only matter in political creed to gerald obeahony be devoted though be irishman a delighted to intimate heart be irish during various visit to country have filled bosom with thought of irish wrong educated man be ever born bred in more utter ignorance of political truth than amiable philanthropic gentleman in regard to ireland theory be that land must be taken from present proprietor divided among peasant who tilled when asked what must be done with present owner be quite ready with answer let be paid for property by state must have man injured to extent of shilling when asked where state be to get money declared that be mere detail state did get money a for landlord with money in pocket let emigrate to united state if be in want of something to do a to division of land that said must settle one man must have ten acre fifty must be fair because one man have be used to pay for ten to pay for fifty a for men who got land in scramble must see injustice man who chanced to have be tenant for last twelve month must take benefit of position doubt such man must sell land immediately after got because freedom of sale be one of point of charter must see injustice of giving land at rent fixed by state because state have right to interfere in ordinary contract between man man if land be to be given up without rent then must see injustice thus thus only must ireland be made to return to beauty grace of original simplicity on wrong arising from want of home rule be warmer even than on land question have produced why must ireland be governed by british parliament british lord lieutenant british chief secretary british commander in chief trodden under foot by british soldiery why must scotland be so governed why must wale why must yorkshire mr jones must reply repeal union restore heptarchy mr obeahony have confused idea of what heptarchy have be be sure that must be for benefit of ireland that irish knife must be made of irish steel a undoubtedly must have be case if question of protection be to be left to irish parliament to settle said mr jones heaven help man who must want to cut mutton best chance must be that must soon have mutton to cut so dispute be carried on with much warmth on one side with many argument on other without quarrelling be impossible to quarrel with obeahony who be thoroughly unselfish desirous of violence when have heard what have be done in reference to mr jones meadow have be told of suspected conduct of pat carroll be a indignant a though have be landed proprietor even orangeman on mr jones part there be desire to do justice to around came within capacity of obeahony vision knew that mr jones be fair dealing honest gentleman must not therefore quarrel with there be steamer running from

young lady rachel obeahony have found dearer friend than of girl at morony castle have come to pas that frank jones rachel obeahony have declared to be engaged on such ground a want of wealth want of family want of education have mr jones based objection to match there have be peculiarity in position of rachel have made hesitate be not that be american such american be not that be republican such republican be more anxious to carry frank away with to united state to join in political partnership with father than to come settle down at castle thus there have arisen understanding on part of young people that though be engaged be engaged without consent of young man father rachel therefore be not to be brought to castle while frank be there to rachel father have assented in smiling indifferent manner half intended to ridicule who be concerned a be not question of politics mr obeahony must not work up to anger apparently even to anxiety in matter young people here meant english irish generally be taught to think must begin world where leave off young people be just a fond of what money will buy a be ours said mr jones be fonder of one even than of money when love one become

lecturing be brought to end by police must throw upon rachel capability for earning money rachel capability have be often discussed at castle with various feeling on three side into party have formed jones be on one side declared that capability have better not be exercised in be probably wrong be opinion have lived for many year away from london child have so lived life conceived that prejudice still existed have now be banished nearly banished from world mr obeahony who formed party thought that matter be one of supreme indifference a long a must earn money by lecturing be well that must earn be always better that men of family must work than woman if man talent be of use then might be well to fall back upon woman only laughed at existence of prejudice in matter have prejudice regarded all prejudice a triumph of folly over education rachel who be third party in discussion have very strong feeling of own be of opinion that if capability in question existed ought to be exercised on subject possession of capability entertained said strong doubt if capability existed certainly ought to be used be rachel opinion expressed with vigour knew how to throw into subject capability have already be exercised in new york where have be efficacious though effect have not be great have be brought up to sing great thing have be promised of voice american manager have

most happy tom daly on hearing only shook head shake be intended to signify that did not like advice tendered accompanying hospitable offer to go home must be to throw down arm at once acknowledge beaten if beaten to day why must not be beaten on day then what must become of tom daly employment sad idea came across mind a shook head warning that in terrible affair of to day might see end of life work thought have never occurred to before if crowd of disloyal roman catholic chose to prevent gentry in hunting undoubtedly have power daly be slow at thinking idea when have once come home to struck forcibly a shook head at moment bethought what must become of black daly if people of county refused to allow hound to run second idea struck that certainly must not lunch with lord ardrahan lord ardrahan be to thinking somewhat pompous have be felt by tom to expect that tom must acknowledge inferiority of position by demeanour now such idea a be altogether in opposition to tom mode of

plan spoken out within hearing of many of blackguard have better take offer come to ardrahan castle said lordship lord said daly with tone of authority master of hound always know how to assume will draw on barney get hound together then whispered to barney smith that hound must go on to kilcornan now kilcornan be place much beloved by fox about ten mile distant from moytubber be not among covert appointed to be drawn on day lay back towards ahaseragh at earth must be found to open must be better to trot off rapidly to distant home for fox even though day sport might be lost daly be very anxious that must not be said through country that have be driven home by set of rough from one covert day draw must be known line of country be in ordinary course of thing must follow on day by going to kilcornan might throw off scent so started for kilcornan having whispered order to barney smith communicating intention to one else what will do daly said sir jasper lynch go on where will go inquired baronet be man about daly age with whom daly be on comfortable term have cause for being crabbed with sir jasper a with lord ardrahan did not want to declare purpose to man there be one in

much in hunting way to day muster daly said one of intruder when heard be coming have little hunt of own there ai fox anywhere about place now muster daly tom daly turned round sat on big black horse frowning at world before sorrowful man what will do next doe not behove master of hound to seek counsel in difficulty from anyone man if be master must be sufficient to in emergency man felt more clearly than did black tom daly have be ashamed of once morning because have taken advice from mr persse now must think matter out for follow own device be a yet only two o'clock have come on at great pace taking much more out of horse than be usual to on such occasion sitting there did make up mind must go on to mr lambert place at clare must draw covert going there a fast a horse leg must carry there must borrow two horse if be possible one at least for barney smith then must draw back by impossible route to kennel at ahaseragh men might come with might go to none must tell mind if providence must only send fox on route thing thought might still be well with must be odd if barney smith between be not able to give account of fox when have done with if must find such fox if master of galway hound must have ridden backwards forward across county galway have be impeded altogether in effort by wretched landleaguers then a thought final day must have to come for spoke word to

three others in course about country for servant quick a lightning went from covert to covert conspiracy have be well arranged holiday for fox in county galway be established for day men be very stanch to going with whither knew not so that poor dear tom might not be left alone alone be during long evening of day a far a conversation went spoke to one except to barney to only few word giving direction a to where must go next into what covert must put hound too must have be much surprised very weary a dragged tired limb to kennel at about eight o'clock tom daly ride across country will long be remembered exertion made to find fox on day be in vain a tom ate solitary mutton chop drank cold whisky water then took to bed be melancholy man occupation of life thought be gone reprobate whom now hated worse than ever having learned power to disturb amusement of better must never allow day hunting in county be aware now though never have thought of before by how weak hold right of hunting country be held hound must go into covert so also must other man with without hound to disturb fox three four men must suffice one must suffice according to tom idea of fox occupation of life

hard payment made be very small in fact payment be made other than of being lifted into position in be able to hold head high among gentleman of property what must do with during remainder of life if hunting in county galway be brought to end be intent eager man whom be hard to teach that occupation of life be le worthy than of other men there have come moment of doubt a have sat alone in little room at ahaseragh have meditated whether pursuit of vermin be worthy energy have given to may sell brute of yours now then perhaps will be able to educate child so sir nicholas bodkin have addressed eldest son a rode home together on occasion why so peter have asked thinking more of brute alluded to than of child be accustomed to tone of father remark cared for not more than ordinary son care for expression of ordinary father ill humour now knew that reference be intended to interruption have be made in day sport be anxious to learn what father thought about why so asked because wo want for game longer hunting be done with in part when blackguard like kit mooney be able to address one a tom daly after fashion anything requires respect may be said to be over hunting have existed solely on respect have intended to buy mare of french sha now what doe that mean lynch said mr persse to sir jasper a rode home together mean quarrelling to knife in quarrel to knife said mr persse lighter

be given to before than be good for for father not only gave order to seldom spoke concerning be however terrible trouble to mind fact that own son must be thus possessed of own peculiar secret must continue from month to month hiding within own bosom with father malachi mr jones be on good term to must say nothing on subject absurdity of conversion perversion of boy in reference to religion made mr jones unwilling to speak of to roman catholic priest father malachi must no doubt have owned that boy have be altogether unable to see by own light difference between two religion must have attributed change to direct interposition of god must not have declared in so many word that miracle have be performed in boy favour must have be meaning of argument must have used in fact gaining of

weight with pat carroll whose great doctrine be that rent be evil per se that world must certainly go on great deal better if there be rent have got land of ballintubber in hand said carroll here florian in whisper reminded pat that land of ballintubber be at moment under water have be put so by operation why must make statement when asked for said carroll with coarse grin almost frightened

have resolved to disobey order rachel have given at rate during night following day made way up to london chapter xv captain yorke clayton at period of story much have already be said in outside world a to flooding meadow of ballintubber like other outrage of same kind have not at first be noticed otherwise than in immediate neighbourhood though terrible injury have be inflicted equal in value to loss of five six hundred pound have seemed a though must pas away unnoticed simply because mr jones have lacked evidence to bring home to guilty party gradually have become known that pat carroll have be sinner cause also have brought about crime be known be known that pat carroll have joined landleaguers in neighbouring county of mayo with great violence that have made threat that must pay further rent to landlord day of rent manifestation have not yet come a obnoxious member of parliament be not yet in prison rent be already firmly fixed in mind of many men about to lead in process of time to arrears bill other abomination of injustice among conspicuous in west who be ready to seize fortune by forelock be mr pat carroll in way name have come forward inquiry be made of mr jones distressed much for though be ready to sacrifice meadow tenant rent be most unwilling to do if must be called upon at same time to sacrifice boy character for loyalty there have be man stationed at castlerea for month past who in celebrity have almost beaten notorious pat carroll be one captain clayton who for nearly twelve month have be in county mayo be supposed that have first shown there a constabulary officer have then very suddenly be appointed resident magistrate why be captain nobody knew be fact indeed that have be employed a adjutant in volunteer regiment in england having gone over there from police force in north of ireland title have gone with by fault virtue of own have blossomed forth to world of connaught a captain clayton before knew why be about to become famous famous however did become have two attribute if fortune help may serve to make man famous be recklessness of life devotion to idea if fortune help recklessness of life amidst such danger a surrounded captain clayton will soon bring man to end so that there will be question of fame see men occasionally who seem to find impossible to encounter death be not at probable that man wished to die life seemed to to be pleasant enough be forlorn lover have fairly good health strength people said of that have small comfortable private mean be remarkable among men for good look lacked nothing necessary to make life happy appeared to be always in hurry to leave hundred men in mayo have sworn that must die be told to very freely have only laughed at be generally called woodcock a rode about among daily employment ordinary life of woodcock call upon to be shot at yet woodcock be not easy bird to hit then there be devotion to idea will not call loyalty lest must seem to praise man too vehemently for probably be simply instinct in own heart lived upon hatred of landleaguer be probably conviction on own part that original landleaguer have come from new york produced feeling must be acknowledged of with reference to lower order of landleaguers that did admit in mind possibility that be curable there be to landleaguers landleaguers landleaguer whom captain yorke clayton hated with bitterest prejudice be landleaguing member of parliament of worst enemy believed that might be detected in breaking out into illegal expression of hatred more unfortunately still into illegal act so government might be compelled to dismiss with disgrace others warmest friend hoped that by process life might be eventually saved for present captain yorke clayton have saved character neck to great surprise of who loved reverse have lately be appointed joint resident magistrate for galway mayo roscommon have removed residence to galway to also have pat carroll become intimately known to flood of ballintubber be peculiar case be one great desire of heart to have pat carroll incarcerated a penal felon did not very often express on subject pat carroll knew well nature of wish thundering bloody rapparee be name by carroll delighted to call carroll be one who exercised none of control over own tongue for captain clayton be said to be so conspicuous during last month mr jones have seen captain clayton more than once at galway on one occasion have come down to morony castle attended by man who be supposed to travel a servant who be known by world to be policeman in disguise for captain clayton have be strictly forbidden by authority of castle to travel without companion attempt have already be made to have dismissed for disobedience to order captain clayton when have be at morony castle have treated flory with great kindness declining to cross question at must endeavour to save from gentleman have said to father quite think that understand what be going on within mind have be before conversation last mentioned have taken place between flory sister now be to come again make further inquiry meet dozen policeman from neighbourhood florian have a yet half confessed almost hoped that captain clayton must appear among a friend girl to tell truth have be much taken with appearance of gallant captain seems to be almost shame to tell truth of what modest girl may think of man whom may chance to meet must never tell to even two sister can hardly do so when man come before just for once twice to be judged thought of at single interview girl such a be girl can hardly tell to herself be manly brave have so much to say for be so good looking that what can girl who have heart at own disposal wish for better than such lover must have be quite impossible that of mr jones daughter must ever have so whispered to herself be not natural that unwhispered thought must have passed through mind of ada ada beautiful ada sentimental ada young lady who certainly be in want of lover be very nice certainly said ada allowing not word to sister what be good of man being nice when be 'woodcock ' said edith everybody say that destiny be before daresay be nice what be use mean to say that think will be killed said ada do mean to say that if be man might be must have to be killed too man have to run chance if fall into position a of course must put up with mean to say that like better for why doe not go away leave horrid country said ada because more brave men go away more horrid country will become then think man be always happier if have something really to think of one a captain clayton doe not want to go to ball suppose not said ada plaintively a though thought thousand pity captain clayton must not want to go to ball such man said edith with air of firmness find woman when want to marry who will suit then marries there be necessity for ball there then ought not to dance at such man ought not to want to get married not if mean to be killed out of hand said possible young woman must be left to judge of must like to marry 'woodcock ' however much might admire do think well that there must be such men a captain clayton feel that if be man ought to wish to be one be sure must feel that ought to ask girl to share world with fancy marrying man merely to be left sorrowing widow be part of horror of business that must even venture to dance lest poor female must be captivated girl might be captivated without dancing said ada mean to say that man must absolutely tie up in bag so that poor female must run possible danger ought to encourage such risk to tell truth think that captain clayton doe ada afternoon thought great deal of position not of course in reference to be proper that man a captain yorke clayton must abstain from falling in love with girl even from allowing girl to fall in love with because be in danger of being shot be certainly difficult question be man to be debarred from pleasure incident natural excitement of man life because of possible danger might possibly happen to possible young woman looking at matter round ada did not see that man must help unless be to be shut up in bag a edith have said so a to prevent young woman from falling in love with although be woodcock thing must go on in own natural course if misfortune did come why misfortune must come be same thing with soldier sailor if be to fall in love with officer for supposition in vague undefined form be admissible even to poor ada imagination must not be debarred from marrying merely by fact that must have to go to war of course a regarded captain yorke clayton be merely speculation might be engaged to other girl already for anything knew cared a told with more le of truth captain yorke clayton came down by boat afternoon to morony castle frank

indifferently about landleaguers till reached castle people be not coward captain clayton have said believe that men do become coward when be tempted to become liar by getting into parliament irishman of certain class doe at rate fellow if be put into regiment must fight like grim death man there pointed back over shoulder be a brave fellow a ever came across in life think that must hesitate moment in attacking three four men armed with revolver gold must induce to be false to if mr pat carroll have by chance got hold of before have come way might have be very man to shoot from behind wall with

between young lady with without ribbon what evidence can give be question so saying edith descended to father room found florian with hand upon door entered room have said that captain clayton be remarkably good looking man ought perhaps to give explanation of term when first introducing to reader in presence of lady who be intended to become heroine of story must suffice have declared to be good looking add to that fact that though be thirty five year old did not look to be more than five twenty two peculiarity of face be very light blue eye very long moustachio florian have come to see latter day hero said edith laughing a entered room though know that be so done up with pistol peaceable young woman ought to come near to made sportive reply then before minute have passed over head

likely know will see to house mahomet m looked a though be going to jump into brougham in garment of imperial prince mr moss can go very well alone turned round upon stood in doorway so a to oppose coming out frowned upon with look of anger knew so well how to assume have to say to have to be said at once drive about london with in dress must be absurd be painted round eye must get into carriage

rys one after with still increasing emphasis rachel have doubt believed be taking great trouble with practising day for two hour together with looking glass before on pianoforte a mr moss have made quite understand that opening of mouth wide be chief qualification necessary to beyond nature have done for rachel did think possible that might become undoubted prima donna of day a m le gros have called thought much more probable that must do so under auspex of m le gros than of mr moss when therefore went down at last to sitting room did so determined to oppose mr moss a bidding for voice rather than a candidate for love when entered room must not help beginning with something of apology in have kept man waiting mr moss soon stopped doe not signify least in world said laying hand upon waistcoat if only can get opportunity of speaking to while father be present then when looked at brilliance of garment heard tone of voice be sure that attack on occasion be not to be made on m le gros remained silent sat square on chair looking at man must be well versed in feminine wile who must decipher under rachel manner determination to look a ugly a possible on occasion in moment have flattened jaunty twist turn out of habiliment have given to herself air of absolute dowdyism father sat by without saying word miss obeahony if may venture to ask question trust may not be offended

partner for evening must not write to especially call upon to come without doing must to make evening pleasant for included edith in promise of pleasantness edith if thing be to be done at must do for

taken into imagination that captain clayton be certainly in road to fall in love with ada why must not ada have chance why must not captain have why must not have chance of having gallant lovable gentleman for brother in law edith be not at all prepared to give world up for lost because pat carroll have made brute because neighbour be idiot have boycotted must depend upon father whether must

presence edith have of course known secret edith have frowned upon have said that lieutenant talbot be better than stick although have l year of own 'd give nothing to talk about said edith l year therefore when lieutenant talbot went to india ada jones did not break heart now edith called captain clayton hero seemed in respect to approve of edith seemed to think that certainly admired ada be dreadful thing to have to fall in love with woodcock ada felt if a thing went on woodcock must become woodcock bullet reached heart must certainly pierce own bosom also such be way of world edith have seemed to think that man be entitled to have lady of own to love if so ada seemed to think that place must be one very well suited to herself therefore be anxious for ball at present moment thought only of difficulty to be incurred by edith in discussing matter with father papa captain clayton want to go to ball at galway be thus that edith began task want to go ball have captain clayton to do with two nothing on earth at rate not with here be letter speaks for seems to think that must show to everybody around to let know that be not crushed by what one a pat carroll can do to who say that be crushed be people who be crushed that generally say so of there must be nothing unusual under ordinary circumstance in daughter going to ball at galway be a may be can stay night at mr d'arcy will

galway be destiny to remain at home so may know what have got to expect if must turn out to be so there will be one immeasurable comfort to in midst of trouble will be so said whispering into ear papa will let go to ball in galway will not ada have set heart upon so matter be settled answer to captain clayton sent by edith be a follows be not sent till boy have be allowed to stuff with buttered toast tea to boy be acme of happiness morony castle th of may dear captain clayton will come of course be infinitely obliged to for trouble have taken on behalf papa will not come of course frank will

to see if will come down to boat yours very truly edith jones must tell what ada said about dress only pray tell of officer of course have to have consultation about frock because everything in shop be boycotted for oh said ada there be gauze dress wore at hacketstown before flood only think of ada at ball with miss noah four five thousand year ago frank consented to go of course not without little difficulty did think be time for ball according to view of thing ginger must be no longer hot in mouth why not said edith if ball at time be good thing why must be bad now be to go into mourning because mr carroll have so decreed for care twopence for ball think be worth ten shilling will cost be for showing that care so much for mr carroll carroll be in prison said frank yet for terry lax tim brady terry carroll tony brady world be not to be turned away from proper course by such scum of men a of course will do a brother must do come with to frank assented on next day went out for salmon thinking more about party at galway party at galway be matter of infinite trouble infinite interest to two girl dress have be put by from before flood be brought forth ironed re ribboned re designed a though fate of hero heroine depended upon be clearly intended that fate of one hero of one heroine must depend on though nothing absolutely to effect be said at present between sister be not said be understood by of that be so understood what be in heart of other dear dear edith said ada let boycott a will said edith pet will be a bright a of there be ribbon have not be tossed false flower have on something of bloom of newness faint offer be made by ada to abandon of prettiness to sister edith must have none of edith pooh poohed idea a though be monstrous be goose ada said of course be to be night what doe signify what wear oh doe just same a for see why be not to be just a nice a be not true dear why not true there be quite a much depends on good fortune a on mine then be so much cleverer of two then when day for ball drew near there came to be more serious conversation between ada love mean to enjoy if can will when go to thing never know whether will lead to enjoyment reverse little thing happens so often everything seems to go wrong must go wrong with pet why not with a well a with others because be so beautiful to look at be made to be queen of ball room not london ball room where everything take be flash faded painted stale worn out down here in country where there be life among where girl may be supposed to be excited over dancing be in such room a heart be won lost bid made for diamond be be done in london never be at london ball said ada one read of can fancy man really caring for girl down in galway can fancy man caring for girl know said ada for now think anybody will ever care much for oh ada what fib be very pretty mock modestly be so untrue man not love why can fancy man thinking that god must not allow greater grace than privilege of taking in arm be anyone to take in arm then one be not thing to be looked at in light mean eventually to take to woman right to make generally odious only have promised to stick to papa have got to do first who will stick to know said ada if be to suggest captain yorke clayton if be to suppose that be man who be to have privilege edith be hero be pet want to bring two together want to have share in hero still to keep share in pet be not that rational know that there be anything rational in said ada still went to bed well pleased that night chapter xxv galway ball when th of may came three started off together for galway happy in spite of boycotting girl at least be happy though frank be still somewhat sombre a thought of edict rachel obeahony have pronounced against when boat arrived at quay at galway captain clayton with one of officer of west bromwich be there to meet be wise man whispered edith to ada take care to provide for number one see at said ada brave little warrior who be four foot half high be intended for escort two be company three be none quite agree a to then left boat edith so arranged party that be to walk between small warrior brother whereas ada followed with captain clayton in such strait of circumstance man always have to do what be told presence of mind readiness be needful readiness of man be never equal to of woman so went off to mr d'arcy house ada enjoyed little preliminary sweet of captain conversation word be spoken have reference to edith came from captain be assuredly sweet be really true that be boycotted mr d'arcy asked certainly be true what do do to do servant leave unless there be like peter who make up mind to face wrath of landleaguers peter have lived with long time have to ask whether will be best for to stay go stay what noble fellow said mr d'arcy what must do with if did stay said edith suppose 'd shoot get plenty to eat girl who be in house young men about place have friend of own living near so thought better to go everybody of course doe what be best for peter though have suited be already making favour of papa told only yesterday that might go if pleased only think have to send horse last week into galway to be shod then must do except one man who made tremendous favour of after doing charged double wo sell anything at tuam not have'porth must get so much a soap for house washing unless mr blake have stood by let have soap ada have to do bit of washing about place do think well of peter because insists on washing own shirt stocking unfortunately have got mangle have to iron sheet if want to look at nice ada sheet mine florian be only just rough pressed of course get tea thing down from dublin only think of way in tradespeople be ruining everything have to go to dublin to be sold potato cattle now butter papa say that wo pay for carriage when come to think of boycotting be most ruinous invention on side when poor florian declared that must go to mass after have first told story about pat carroll swore must boycott chapel if entered door not single person must stay to receive mass so must go be not long after when became afraid to show face outside hall door yet can come here to ball said mr d'arcy exactly so will go where please till boycott very road from under foot expect to hear soon that have boycotted ada so that young man will come marry of course understand such thing seems to that government must interfere to defend when evening came witching hour be there ada edith appeared at barrack a bright a second hand finery must make have awarded to something of especial glory a being boycotted heroine be regarded with certain amount of envy by miss blake miss bodkin miss lambert miss ffrenchs miss parson of neighbourhood have none of a yet achieved full honour of boycotting though of be half way to miss ffrenchs told how father sheep have be boycotted shepherd having be made to leave place miss blake have be boycotted because brother have be refused car bodkin of ballytowngal be held to have be boycotted en masse because of doings at moytubber gorse none of have be boycotted a have be miss jones therefore miss jones be heroine of evening declare be very nice ada said to sister night when got home to mr d'arcy because got for pick of partner got for one partner at rate said edith boycotting something else edith have determined that must be so have determined at rate that must seem to be so in resolution that hero of day must fall in love with sister have almost taught to think that process have already taken place be so natural that bravest man must fall in love with fairest lady that edith took for granted that already be so too in sort be in love with own sister ada to be so fair so soft so innocent so feminine so lovable that very heart be in project project that ada must have hero of hour to herself yet too have heart of own have told in so many word that must have loved man have be fitting that must burden with love have rejected idea a unfitting impossible almost unfeminine there be nothing in to attract man idea have sprung up for moment have be cast out a being monstrous there be ada very queen of beauty gallant hero be languishing in smile be thus that imagination carried on after notion have once be entertained at ball edith did in fact dance with captain clayton quite a often a did ada herself danced with said a darling sister of supposed bride talk have be about ada because edith have so chosen subject with conversation have be about edith because captain have selected subject know how little party be made up on such occasion though party dance also with other people on occasion be there especially to dance with other interloper two now again be very useful so a to keep up appearance little warrior whom edith have ill naturedly declared to be four foot half high who be in truth five foot half made up former frank did not do much dancing devoting to thinking of rachel obeahony little man who be distinguished officer named captain butler of west bromwich have very good time of dancing with ada when captain clayton be not doing so greatest brick ever saw in life be thus captain butler afterwards spoke of edith ada be girl for know have edith heard must not do because be then on boat going back to morony castle must have informed captain butler that ada be not girl for captain clayton who heard announcement made did not seem to be much disturbed by be very nice party mr d'arcy said edith next morning be there supper there be plenty to eat drink if mean that did not waste time sitting down hate having to sit down opposite to great ham when be in full tide of emotion there be emotion then of course there be what be good of ball without fancy captain butler emotion captain clayton ask ada if there be not a far a be concerned be who have best of captain butler be special man for evening have on beautiful red jacket with gold button never saw anything so lovely captain clayton have just simple black coat be so ugly know be captain clayton ada special young man most particularly special be not ada what nonsense do talk edith be not special young man at

got cattle tenant have to buy back pay rent when try to seize cattle at ballintubber be always driven away to county mayo do think captain clayton be real hero of course be dear that given up to long ago to in afternoon went home by boat frank made disagreeable by croaking upon word said think that be hardly fit time for giving ball ginger must not be hot in mouth said edith may put in what language like be about what mean people who go to ball can not in truth afford be officer look out be here on very sad occasion everything be going to ruin in country wo be put down by pat carroll said edith will not be able to boast to that have changed natural course of life have changed altogether know what mean be not going to yield to to of mean to hold own against a far a can do so will go to church to ball will visit friend will eat dinner day of life just a though pat carroll did exist be in prison just at present therefore so far have got best of ca sell head of cattle without

dancing at ball be so broken hearted at present moment for father for must cut place go to america taking rachel with said edith rachel just now be a prosperous a be reverse rachel must not go be very well for rachel a thing be prosperous with here have reverse of prosperity according to feeling there must be gaiety do ever realise to yourself what be to think that father be ruined ought not to have gone said ada never say die said edith slapping little hand down on gunwale of boat morony castle ballintubber belong to papa will never admit that be ruined because few dishonest tenant refuse to pay rent for time man such a pat carroll can do injury papa be big enough to rise above in long run at rate will live a becomes papa daughter a long a approves have power discussing matter reached quay near morony castle edith a jumped ashore felt something of triumph in bosom have at rate succeeded in object be sure be right to go whispered to ada father received with very few word have florian much to say a to glory of ball mind be devoted at present to coming trial indeed in more open energetic manner so be mind of captain clayton will be last holiday for have said to edith at ball before great day come off for patrick carroll esq be very well for man once in way there must not be too much of have not to complain deeply of yourself on head have have share of fun in world said

one of men who be ready to swear that assisted in pulling down gate of men asked will tell because trust a very soul own brother terry be man pat seems be terrible tyrant among own friend terry be willing to turn against on condition that passage to america be provided for of course be to have free pardon for do want one man to corroborate brother evidence brother doubt be not quite straight at first lied said edith when talk about together must tell simple truth have pardoned lie lied have now one man necessary to confirm testimony be brother doubt in such case a anything be fair to get at truth will employ falsehood younger carroll be instigated by brother to assist in deed be seen by brother to be one of who assisted seems to to be quite right be very terrible edith said yes be terrible brother will have to swear against brother will be bribed to do know what will be said to very well have tried to shoot down like rat mean to get better of when will have succeeded in removing mr pat carroll from present sphere of life will have second object of ambition before mr lax be gentleman whom wish to remove three time have shot at have not hit yet from time forth there

august ala rachel hardly knew what must do to support during dead month from august to october fashionable people always go out of town father said then let be fashionable fashionable people go to scotland wo take one in there without money sha have l left when debt be paid l must hing for have stopped altogether said mr obeahony at rate have stopped money making part of business have threatened to take man license away therefore place be shut up be that unjust father unjust everything done in england a to ireland be unjust carried act of parliament other day when in accordance with ancient privilege of member be within power of dozen stalwart irishman to stop dozen stalwart irishman be there be silenced by brutal majority dozen irishman be turned out of house one after other in direct opposition to ancient privilege so bill be passed robbing five million irishman of liberty so gross injustice be never before perpetrated not even when bribed member sold country effected accursed union know be very bad father bribe be taken by irishman be that a may what be to do with next autumn only thing for be to seek for assistance in united state wo lend l must overrun country by force of true liberal opinion people will rise when have american to lead what be wanted now be voice of true patriot loud enough to reach people l said speaking into ear to keep alive from middle of august to end of october for myself have be invited to come into parliament county of cavan will be vacant be there salary attached one two leading irish member be speaking of said mr obeahony carried away by grandeur of idea amount have not be fixed yet seem to think that be wanted chiefly for parliamentary session have not promised because quite see way to tell truth be not sure that be in parliament that honest irishman will shine best what be good when can be silenced at moment notice by word of mock speaker who upset rule of office to put gag upon dozen men when america have come to understand what be that lawless tyrant did on night when irishman be turned out of house will not rise in wrath declare such thing will no longer be occurred in cecil street rachel who well understood father wrath allowed to expend in word anger must last hardly longer than sound of wo be in parliament for county cavan before next august asked suppose not will united state have risen in wrath so a to have settled entire question before time perhaps not said mr obeahony if did see what good must do to a to finding for money that want be so full of ireland wrong at moment with manner in policeman interfered with can hardly bring to think of autumn plan what be yours asked suppose must always have money enough to go to america in america man can at rate open mouth woman according to what m le gros say in england pay better at present moment mr moss have offered to lend money for must sooner go into english workhouse than accept money from mr moss have not earned in truth rachel have be very foolish with money spending a though there be end to source from have come father have not be more prudent be utterly reckless in regard to such consideration must simply declare that be altogether indifferent to dinner to new hat have proposed to buy for when subject be brought under notice have latterly become more eager than ever a to politics be supremely happy a long a be at liberty to speak before audience angry word have however be unfortunately for declared to be treasonable have till lately be taught to understand that house of common be only arena on such permission must be freely granted must be granted of course only to member of house therefore idea have entered head that must suit to become member more especially a there have arisen grand scheme of salary for certain irish member of must be one even here brutality of england have at last interfered men be not to be allowed to say what pleased longer even in house of common therefore mr obeahony be much disturbed although be anxious to quarrel with one individually not even policeman who arrested be full of indignant wrath against tyranny of england generally rachel when must get good advice from father with regard to future fund went back again to singing be necessary at rate that must carry out present arrangement with mr moss be sure at least of receiving from money earned ala must not practise economy knew to be necessary people at theatre have talked into hiring one horse open carriage in delighted to drive about in to tell truth father delighted to accompany have thought that must allow indulgence out of l week though paid for indulgence monthly that joint living nearly consumed stipend now a father advice did not get beyond very doubtful salary might accrue to a future member for county cavan mind naturally turned to other source from m le gros from m le gros employer be to receive l for singing in two month before christmas with assurance of greatly increased though hitherto unfixed stipend afterwards personally a yet knew one connected with future theatrical home m le gros of m le gros thought have be favourable must ask le gros to lend small sum of money in advance for us of autumn mr moss have made to fixed proposition on subject have altogether declined have declined with scorn a be wont to do favour proffered by mr moss mr moss have still be gracious have smiled have ventured to express renewed hope a called that miss obeahony must even yet condescend to look with regard on sincere affection of most humble servant then have again expatiated on immense success in theatrical life must attend partnership entered into between skill beauty power of voice of miss obeahony on one side energy devotion capital of mr moss on other psha have be rachel only reply so that interview have be brought to end rachel when came to think of m le gros money be desirous of borrowing be afflicted by certain qualm that must have borrowed from mr moss considering length of acquaintance might not have be unnatural of m le gros knew nothing civility have reason for supposing m le gros have money of own at disposal did know where m le gros lived must go to covent garden ask for there be so dressed prettily neatly a called have driven to theatre there a chance must have found m le gros standing under portico with gentleman whom represented to herself a elderly old buck m le gros saw came down into street at once with hat in hand m le gros said want to do great favour have hardly impudence to ask can lend money autumn say l thereupon m le gros ' face fell cheek be elongated eye be very sorrowful ah then see ca said will not put to pain of saying so ought not to have suggested dealing with have seemed to be so pleasant have not be quite of same nature down at 'the embankment dear young lady not word beg pardon most heartily for having given moment annoyance there be one of lessee there said m le gros pointing back to gentleman on top of step who have be to hear to look at two time three time at 'the embankment do think will become grand singer of age who be judicious gentleman asked rachel whispering to m le gros out of carriage be lord castlewell be eldest son of marquis of beaulieu have oh lot of money be saying ah must not tell what lordship be saying of because will make vain nothing that lord can say of will make vain said rachel chucking up head then lordship thinking that have be kept long enough standing on top of theatre step lifted hat came down to carriage occupant of have recognised may have extreme honour

lord lord may do honour of waiting upon day at 'the embankment ' said lord again pulling off hat oh certainly said rachel must be delighted to see then be driven away did not know whether to be angry not in having given lord castlewell so warm welcome a mere stray lord there be possible reason why must call upon for why must receive though frank jones have be dismissed though felt to be free to accept eligible lover who might present still felt bound on behalf to keep free from elderly theatrical hanger on especially from such men when heard that be also lord a be driven away took glance at

with acceptance at rate from theatrical personage have gone to m le gros for money clearly a one of theatrical company with be about to connect m le gros have to intelligence distinctly though very courteously declined request might be well that company must accede to such request m le gros in questionable civility have told whole story to lord castlewell who have immediately offered loan of l out of own pocket have not occurred to in moment in have first read word in presence of mahomet m m that such must necessarily be case be probable that lord castlewell must on own behalf recover from

young lady at theatre accepted loan from unmarried lord of such character must have thought ill of young lady world ought to be perfectly innocent in regard to because believed to be innocent mr moss in expressing opinion of others exposing to position in have placed have simply proved to be blackest of human being be necessary that must at once do something to whitewash own character in own

for can get on very well apart madame socani though must be roused by jealousy to make threat once month knew very well that must not afford to sever from mr moss knew also that mr moss be bound to show observance at rate to find employment for a long a must sing mr moss be anxious to find out whether money arrangement did did not exist between miss obeahony lord be resolved to ask question in straightforward manner have already found out that old pupil have power of keeping secret to herself when thus asked must sternly refuse to give reply must make refusal in such manner a to tell whole truth in fact rachel among accomplishment have not power of telling lie in such language a to make believed be not that must scruple in least to declare to mr moss very opposite to truth in matter in have thought business to be inquisitive when did so have power to look lie might say of frequently that be downright liar of human being whom must meet be least sly dear child father used to say to word to be worth nothing unless be to sing can make impression with in other way therefore be that mr moss felt that must learn truth from simply questioning pupil miss obeahony may say few word to so said mr moss having knocked at door of rachel sitting room have month ago fallen into habit of announcing when have come to give lesson must inform servant that must take up own name rachel have done what must do to put end to practice still prevailed certainly mr moss be not girl there to show up doubt be such ceremony between be hardly necessary must prefer to be warned of coming of master will see to in future such little ceremony do have us will go down make say that be here then come up again will not be necessary take chair begin then mr moss considered how have better do so knew well that girl must not answer kindly to such question a be desirous of asking might be that must be very uncivil be by mean coward have vivid recollection of gleam of dagger smiled looked at more suspiciously because of smile be sitting on sofa opposite to a sat on music stool have turned round so a to face fancied that must see right hand hide among fold of dress be about theatre well be yet be wish be something about theatre always seems to come more natural between want to tell what did at last about lord castlewell money why be to tell did for friendship feel be uncivil word to say mademoiselle be true have business to ask about lord money wo be questioned will be so deleterious to if accept can take care of said jumping off chair will have left place now in month will utterly disregard word anyone at theatre may say of will not tell whether lord have lent money not know have very well then leave room knowing a do be living here with own father interference be grossly impertinent father be not going with be afraid rushed at bell pulled till bell rope came down from wire nobody answered bell can be possible that must not be anxious to begin new career under respectable auspex will not stand leave room sir apartment be own miss obeahony see hand with be ready to offer at once to place in position in world must look up to have done so before mr moss doing so again be insult must not be done to young lady unless be on stage be thought on account to be open to man about theatre to say what pleased to gentleman be at liberty to make lady offer have answered now leave room can not do so until have heard that have not taken money from reprobate at moment door opened reprobate entered room servant told that mr moss be here therefore walked up at once said reprobate be so much obliged to said rachel oh lord castlewell be so much obliged to tell in first place that be reprobate never mind said lord mind what say of declares that character will be gone for ever because have lent father money so will said moss who be not afraid to stand up to gun how if have accepted offer one must have thought of come lord know difference be anxious only to save be to father have lent money who explained to somewhat cruel treatment have received at hand of police think be making as of mr moss very well lord very well said mr moss world doubt will know that have lent money to irish landleaguer because of political sympathy with will not think for minute that have be attracted by pretty young friend here will not suspect that be who have paid for loan mr moss be brute said lord ca be turned out of room asked rachel well yes be possible said lord who slowly prepared to walk up take step towards expelling mr moss will not be necessary said mahomet m m must not get out there must be terrible row in house must not fail to be disagreeable to miss obeahony leave in hand think must possibly leave in worse have wished to make honest woman what want of can explain to herself in saying mr moss walked downstairs left house feeling a went that have got better of lord of lady with mr moss there be double motive neither of be very bright of followed with considerable energy have at first be attracted by good look have desired to make own at cheapest price at might be have in market if marriage be necessary so be might be that young lady must not be so exigeant be probably expression of such feeling in early day of acquaintance have made so odious to then frank jones have come forward like good honest girl in position so public have at once let fact of mr jones be made known so a to protect have not protected mr moss have be doubly odious then by degree have become aware of value of voice perceived charm that there be in what pictured to a professional partnership a well a marriage various idea floated through mind down even to creation of fresh name grand married name for wife if must be got to see in light saw what stroke of business might do be aware that expressed personal dislike to did not think much of that did not in least understand nature of such dislike a exhibited thought to be very good looking man be one of profession to also belonged have idea that be not gentleman that be lady did not know that there be such thing madame socani told that young woman be already married to mr jones have left that gentleman because have money did not believe in case must be willing to risk peril must be hers not be object to establish partnership did not even yet see fatal impediment to lord who have be trapped by beauty by by theatrical standing be impediment must be removed have known lord castlewell to be in love with dozen singer partly because thought to be judge of music partly simply because have liked look lord have now taken fancy to miss obeahony have begun by lending money that father must take money instead of daughter be quite natural to thinking might still succeed in looking after miss obeahony rescuing singer from lord by keeping close watch on must make impossible for lord to hold therefore when went away leaving lord singer together thought that for present have got better of why did tell be reprobate said lord when found alone with lady well perhaps be because be one lord said rachel laughing must constantly remember tell that a long a called by title be protecting from familiarity must be dangerous hope think so gentleman generally be reprobate believe be not disgraceful for gentleman to be reprobate be pleasant young woman daresay find pleasant then be disgraceful mean to disgrace lord castlewell be sure will not want to be sure of quite sure be singing girl mean to be man mistress stared at a said mean to be man wife unless downright love now may keep out of way if please daresay be reprobate lord with have got nothing to do touching money suppose father have not got yet have sent be to get nothing for simply to have returned without interest a soon a have earned have only to say word will take care that father will send back again lord castlewell felt that girl be very unlike others whom have known who have rejected offer with scorn have accepted with delight young lady did apparently accepted proffered friendship simply desired to carry reprobate quality elsewhere there be frankness about pleased much though hardly tended to make in love with one thing did resolve on spur of moment that must never say word to father might not hear be quite new sensation to of simple friendship with singer with singer whom have met in doubtful custody of mr moss did believe to be good girl good girl who must speak out mind freely a such respected liked of course sha take back money till becomes due will have to work hard for before get will be quite contented to do lord then interview be over lordship left room lord castlewell felt a went home that girl be worth more than other girl laughed at for being lord must accept favour from then tell to face that must do harm because have accepted have met terrible rebuff in career memory of have be unpleasant to have be greeted with many smile of have be insipid what must do with girl so a to make best of only thing occurred to be to marry yet such marriage must be altogether out of line of life chapter xxix what be done with fund l be not spent in manner of lord castlewell must have altogether approved about end of august mr obeahony be summoned back to ireland be induced at meeting held at rotunda to give certain pledge justified advanced irish party in putting forward a new member for county of cavan advanced irish party have doubt be attracted by eloquence have exhibited in galway in london by patriotic sentiment have displayed be known to be republican to look for formation of republic to american aid have expressed most sincere scorn for everything english professed idea a to irish property generally in regard to be altogether ignorant of meaning a be sincerely honest man did think that something good for old country must be achieved by home rule though how home ruler must set to work when home rule must be law of land have not remotest conception there be many reason therefore why must be fit member for irish county must be admitted that must not have be so unanimously selected have peculiarity of mind be known might be probable that must run riot under lash of leader a others have done before since when must come to see wile of strategy must be called upon to support in such case quarrel with must be more internecine than with other foe such a english member scotch member conservative irish member liberal irish member not sworn to follow certain leader recreant one out of twenty friend must be regarded with more bitter hatred than perhaps six hundred thirty ordinary enemy might be therefore that time of tribulation be in store for mr obeahony did not consider matter very deeply when cheer rang loud in hall of rotunda did then reflect that be about to spend in injudicious manner money must be earned by rachel future work when rachel have completed engagement with mr moss have be intended that must go down to ambleside there spend lord castlewell money in humble innocent enjoyment of nature there have at moment be nothing decided a to county of cavan pork butcher possessed of small mean unlimited impudence have put forward twenty have managed to put through facing have found to be very ignorant in use of queen english now of late there have come up notion that small party required to make up for thinness of member by strength of eloquence practice make perfect be not to be wondered at therefore if large proportion of twenty have become fluent more be wanted of friend obeahony fluency there must be doubt therefore be sent for on very day of arrival proved to patriotic spirit of dublin that be man for cavan three day afterwards went down cavan obediently accepted man with father went rachel be carried through town of virginia bailyborough ballyjamesduff in great triumph on one horse car occurred about end of august lord castlewell l be very soon spent have not thought much about have be quite willing to be

looking glass even mr moss have expressed approval during year that have be so at work have never seen father do anything knew that talked what called patriotic buncombe might be that must become very fitting member of parliament rachel have doubt must see however that l quickly vanished during triumphant journeying on one horse car everybody in county cavan seemed to know that there be l more to be spent by new member there be however member of parliament for county of cavan breast be filled with new aspiration enmity bitterest enmity to everything english be one lesson taught have other feeling what if must talk over speaker that prime minister government generally house of common house of lord why must not england go way ireland hers england have monarchy ireland republic still with kind of union between a to nature of mr obeahony have fixed idea in brain whatsoever knew that must talk knew also that must now talk on arena for admission to public must not pay twenty five cent

against so that there be money in coffer who have chiefly sinned against who be first to sin be sinner whom be about to prosecute at galway must be supposed therefore that be not in good humour a be driven along road to ballyglunin have not yet passed boundary fence between carnlough property of one of numerous race of bodkin when mr jones saw mask supposed to be mask worn by man through hole in wall just in front of high above head at same moment must see muzzle of double barrelled rifle presented through hole in wall what saw saw for few second must see plainly saw so plainly a to be able afterwards to swear to black mask to double barrelled gun then trigger be pulled one bullet second went through collar of own coat while first have have more fatal truer aim father jumped up turning round saw that boy have fallen to ground oh god said peter stopped horse suddenly place be one where commencement have be made of cutting in road during potato failure of so that wall rifle have be passed through be about four five foot above car mr jones rushed up elevation clambered did not know how into field there saw back of man speeding along from wall in man hand there be gun mr jones looked around there be one nigh peter old servant dying boy must see however that man who ran be short of stature though rage have sufficed to carry up from road into field idea that son have be shot caused to pause a ran to return to road when got there found two girl about seventeen eighteen year of age one sitting on road with florian head on lap other kneeling holding boy hand oh yer honour sorrow taste in life do know about said kneeling girl not sight did see sound did hear said other only going off of blunderbuss oh wirra shure oh musha musha be dead be darling boy mr jones came round picked up poor florian laid on car bullet have gone true to mark have buried in brain there be end of poor florian jones trouble father did not say word not even in reply to peter wailing to girl easy sorrow taking rein in own hand drove car with body on back to carnlough can hardly analyse father mind a went not tear came to relief during half hour can hardly have be said to sorrow intensity of wrath filled breast have spent time for many long year in doing in power for around now have brought to have robbed of boy heart have taught boy to be one of to be untrue to own people now because have yielded to better teaching have murdered have taught boy to be coward for even in bereavement remembered poor florian failing accursed papist people be coward down to backbone so said of in rage there be not one of who must look peril in face a did yorke clayton son frank be terribly powerful in wretched want of manliness must murder be protected in bloodthirstiness one by did not doubt that two girl who be wailing on road knew well enough who be murderer one must tell in accursed unhallowed godless country honour honesty of one man did not in day prompt to abstain from vice only heroism left in country be heroism of mystery of secret bloodshed of hidden attack have driven back methodically to carnlough gate hesitated to carry burden up to hall door must not be better for at once to go home there to endure suffering be in store for remembered that must behove to take what step might be possible for tracing murderer by step must anything be done be sure still attempt be necessary have however paused minute two at open gate when be rebuked by peter shure yer honour be going up to house to get constable to scour counthry scour country said father country will turn out to defend murderer of boy drove up to front peter knocked at door good heaven jones said mr blake a looked at car occupant poor boy head be supported on pillow behind driver seat on one sat peter held by foot

see yours have double barrelled gun fired two shot boy be killed by first have struck too on collar of coat got into field with murderer must have caught man have be younger what must have be use jury must have found guilty what be to do oh god what be to do mr blake daughter be now out upon step be filling hall with wailing tell blake what have better do then mr blake decided that body must remain there that night mr jones also that police must be sent for to do might seem fitting to policeman mind peter be sent off to morony castle with letter a miss blake be able to write to two jones girl police came from tuam result of enquiry on night need not be told here chapter xxxi galway court house there be feeling very general in county that murder have be committed by man named lax who be known to have be in neighbourhood lately be declared by friend at headford to be now in galway waiting for trial of pat carroll there seemed to be feeling about country florian jones have deserved fate have be said be untrue to religion have given solemn promise to father brosnan of what nature be not generally known have broken bittherness of orange feud be in blood said father brosnan did explain meaning of what said a none of jones family have ever be orangeman idea be common about tuam headford that pat carroll be martyr that florian have be persuaded to turn protestant in order that might give false evidence against reader however must understand that florian still professed catholic religion at moment of death that headford be aware that pat carroll have broken sluice gate at ballintubber after interval of two day trial be about to go on at galway in spite of murder be quite true that by nothing must breath of life be restored to florian jones evidence such a be must now be taken only from deposition such evidence be regarded a being very unfair on one side on other a given against pat carroll be regarded a unfair a being incapable of subjection to cross examination boy evidence have be extracted from by parent by captain yorke clayton in opposition to statement have be made score of time by on other side if true must tend to exonerate prisoner have be intention of mr o'donnell senior counsel employed to defend carroll to insist with greatest severity on lie told by poor boy be treatment florian have especially feared there must be such treatment now mr o'donnell must know well how to insist on injustice of deposition in allusion must be made to falsehood previously told on other side be said that witness have be removed so that evidence must not be given must now depend solely on statement of terry carroll pat brother who also have lied terribly before told truth too be condemned more bitterly even by mr jones friend in be giving evidence against brother than have continued to lie on behalf circumstance being such a be be felt to be almost impossible to secure conviction of pat carroll for offence have committed yet there be certainly dozen person who have seen that offence committed in light of day many other dozen who knew by whom offence have be committed indeed feeling have become common through country lawyer judge in ireland lawyer judge be who be opposed to landleague must not secure conviction of kind against prisoner whom landleague be bound to support have come to be whispered about there be men in county of galway men also in other county too strong for government men who must beat government on point men whom jury must be brought to convict by evidence men who boasted of possession of certain secret power generally meant murder came to be believed that men be possessed of certain mysterious capability police must not handle magistrate touch danger to be feared from men arose chiefly from belief in have become common be not that must do anything special if left to own device that crowd by whom be surrounded trembled at existence man living next to ignorant roman catholic inspired with mysterious awe must wish in heart that country be rid of such fire brand knew well that country a part of country have more to get from law order than from murder misrule murder misrule have so raised head for present a to make appear to more powerful than law order mr lax others like be keenly alive to necessity of maintaining belief in mysterious power trial came on having be delayed two day by murder of poor florian jones body have in meantime be taken home only visitor received at morony castle have be yorke clayton on coming have be at first closeted with mr jones have then gone out seen two girl together have taken ada hand first then edith have held edith longer girl have known that be so of have said word to rebuke who be asked ada clayton shook head ground teeth do know have idea know so much about country said edith to two to only do know can not exist together man name be lax may be imagined that trial be not commenced at galway without expression of much sympathy for mr jones family at morony castle be hard to explain different feeling existed feeling exactly opposed to other still be in way general true be poor mr jones who have lost son worse still eighty acre of grass be also that fellow jones enemy to landleague whom behoved patriotic irishman to get better of to conquer florian have be murdered on th of august be tuesday trial have be postponed until friday nd of september be understood that boy be to be buried at headford on rd nevertheless father be in assize town on friday be in town at eleven o'clock took place in crown court be man who be still continually summoned a grand juror a such have difficulty in securing for place to right of judge sat twelve juror who have be summoned to try case to left be grand juror box in mr jones took seat early in day frank be also in court have be stopped by one when accompanied father into grand juror box court be crowded in wonderful manner so that who understood way of criminal court in ireland knew that something special be boded a soon a mr justice parry took seat be seen that court be much more than ordinarily filled be filled by men who did not make amenable to police many be instruction given by judge who have be selected with special view to trial judge parry be roman catholic who have sat in house of common a strong liberal have be attorney general to liberal government have be suspected of holding home rule sentiment men when become judge be apt to change idea judge parry be now known to be firm man whom nothing must turn from execution of duty there have be many judge parry in ireland who have gone same gait have followed same course when have accepted ermine man be at liberty to indulge what vagary plea a long a be simply member of parliament judge be not at liberty now gave special instruction to officer of court to keep quiet to preserve order court be full densely crowded noise arose from crowd be only noise a of people whispering loudly among jury be quickly sworn trial be set on foot pat carroll be made to stand up in dock mr jones looked at face of man who have be first on property to show hostility to idea of paying rent lax have be great friend be known that lax have sworn that in short time not shilling of rent must be paid in county mayo from assurance trouble have come then attorney general opened case to tell truth made speech though very eloquent be longer than necessary spoke of dreadful state of country matter might have left to judge almost burst into tear when alluded to condition of mr jones gentleman who sat opposite to spoke at full length of evidence of poor boy whose deposition held in hand told jury must read to later on in day doubt lad have deceived father since offence have be committed have long declared that knew nothing of perpetrator boy have seemed to entertain in mind certain idea friendly to landleague have made promise on behalf of landleaguers to have long adhered father have at last succeeded truth have be forthcoming lordship must instruct how far boy deposition must be accepted a evidence how far must fail so at last attorney general brought eloquent speech to end now there arose murmuring sound in court stirring of foot moving of shoulder louder than have be heard before judge there on bench looking out from under bushy eyebrow must see that people before be of one class must see also that half dozen policeman who be kept close among crowd be so pressed a to be hardly master of own action called out word even from bench in there be something a to clearing court attempt to clear court be made be apparently possible first witness be summoned attempt be made to bring up through dock into witness box witness be terry carroll brother of pat be known to be there that might swear away brother liberty head sooner appeared a about to leave dock than whole court be filled with yell of hatred there be two policeman standing between two brother pat only turned round looked at traitor with scorn voice through court sounded louder more venomous a terry carroll stepped out of dock among policeman who be to make avenue for up to witness box be last step ever made at moment flash of pistol be seen in court of pistol close at man ear terry carroll be dead man pistol have touched head a have be fired so that there have be chance of escape in way be other witness removed who have be brought thither by crown to give evidence a to demolition of mr jones flood gate be said afterwards for week afterwards that such must be fate of witness who appeared in west of ireland to obey behest of crown then be seen reason why special crowd have be gathered there of what nature be men who have swarmed into court clayton who have be sitting at end of row of barrister jumped up over back of bench rushed in among people who now tried simply to hold own place appeared to be anxious to go in out tear age musther clayton what be after jumping on to fellow way be said by brawny miletian on to whose shoulder friend have leaped meaning to get down among crowd miletian have struck hard must have knocked down have there be room enough for on to fall clayton have minded blow not at have minded judge a little making way in through crowd over dead body of terry carroll have be aware that lax be in court have seated opposite to place where man have stood lax have moved during attorney general speech with view of avoiding captain eye if be to be murderer of finding best place from deed must be done if have be object certainly place have be well selected be afterwards stated that though fifty people at judge end of court have seen pistol eye have seen face of who held many face have be seen nobody must connect single face with pistol be proved also that ball have entered head just under ear with slant upwards towards brain a though weapon have be used by someone crouching towards ground clayton made way out of court followed by faithful hunter be soon surrounded by score of policeman hunter be left to watch door of court because be well acquainted with lax because must lax come across hunter god help mr lax a clayton expressed others be sent by two three through city to catch man if be possible to obtain tidings respecting man can not bury under ground said clayton have always pull upon that can not make invisible in case almost did appear that mr lax have power though pat carroll be not at once set at liberty trial be brought to end be felt to be impossible to send case to jury when only two witness belonging to crown have be murdered prisoner be remanded sent back to gaol so that crown might look for more evidence if more might chance to be found everybody else connected in matter be sent home dark gloom settled on galway men be heard to whisper among that queen law be no longer in force there be rowdy readiness to oppose force force of police for instance force of military there be men there who seemed to think that now have come good time when might knock anyone on head at leisure did not come quite to a police be still combined enemy be not so such men a captain clayton began to look a though doubted what must become of if think be big enough to catch hold of terry lax keep will precious soon find mistake be said by con heffernan of captain clayton chapter xxxii mr obeahony a member of parliament frank jones have

of time so thought of that knew that must be countess be nothing at to to think of in other light must be abomination to yet be worth while to make marchioness of beaulieu must only get rid of present engagement by absolute change in mode of life for instance must shut up in castle devote entirely to religious life must explain to that circumstance must not admit marrying must offer to pay sum of money that father might think fit to name if wished to escape must be way a looked at when came off stage where always attended assured that did not wish to escape chapter xxxv mr obeahony apology time went on parliament met mr obeahony went before speaker table be sworn in be introduced by two brother landleaguers really did take place with enthusiasm wanted to speak on first day be judiciously kept silent by colleague expressed idea until ireland wrong have be redressed there ought not to be moment devoted to other subject became very violent in expression of opinion be not long kept dumb great thing be expected from power of speech though have to be brought to silence ignominiously on three four occasion still at last power of speech be permitted to there be among own special brother who greatly admired praised with others of same class there be shaking of head many doubt with house generally fear laughter prevailed rather than true admiration mr obeahony doubt must speak well in debating society music hall word came from tongue sweeter than honey just at beginning of session speaker be bound to put limit even to irish eloquence in case be able to do so a mr obeahony contrived to get upon foot very frequently in asking question in endeavouring to animadvert on answer given there be something of tussle between authority in chair did not take much above week to make speaker thoroughly tired of new member threat be used towards of nature joint milesian american nature must not stand be told of dreadful thing must be done to though a yet must not be turned out of house for state of young session have not a yet admitted of new mode of torture still must be named let name name be mr obeahony mr obeahony be not man who must be happy when be quarrelling with around be soon worked into violent passion in made ridiculous when have subsided storm be past knew have misbehaved be unhappy a be thoroughly honest must not be got to obey leader in everything wanted to abolish irish landlord be desirous of abolishing after special plan of own must hardly be got to work efficiently in harness together with others think father be making as of just little know be said by lord castlewell to rachel when session be not yet fortnight old made rachel very unhappy did think that father be making as of did not like to be told of much a liked music dear a be own profession to still felt that to be member of parliament to have achieved power of making speech there be better than to run after opera singer loved man who be going to marry very well rather intended to do so be not to love young dream intended that lordship must become love old reality felt that must not become case if love old reality be to tell often that father be as lord castlewell father be thought making as of heard on different side that be foolish pompous old peer who must hardly say bo to goose must not thought become to tell future husband own opinion on matter saw reason why must be le reticent in opinion a to father of course be older perhaps did not think of a much a ought to have done ought also to have remembered that be earl singing girl that something be due to for honour be doing of must take account be to be wife wife ought to be equal to husband such at least be american view of matter in fact idea on matter ran a follows future husband be not entitled to call father as because be lord seeing that father be member of parliament be entitled to call so because be as because same thing be true of own father thus there came to be discord in mind suppose parliament people make ass of sometimes lord a well a common see how man be to go on talking for ever about law landleagues sort of thing without doing so be bosh to so must think must be to a do think that father be worse than anybody else think that word be sometimes very beautiful why dear there be not man about london who be not laughing at saw in time other day that be considered very true very honest man of course said that talked nonsense sometimes if put honesty against nonsense will be a good a anybody else think understand dear honesty be not what want oh what want especially be nonsense poor papa doe mean to consult a to what want idea be that if everybody can be got to be honest question may be settled among must be talked about at rate be eloquent have heard said that there be not more eloquent man in new york think have got a many good gift a anyone else in way there rose bad feeling lord castlewell did think that there be something wanting in manner in be treated by bride be sure that loved be sure also that when lord marries singing girl ought to expect special observance fact that singing girl father be member of parliament be much le to than to indeed must have be glad to have father abolished altogether have become very proud of father since have become member of parliament idea of british constitution be rather vague thought that member of parliament be at least a good a lord who be not peer have wealth be sure that be too proud to think of just at period when session be beginning rachel began to doubt wisdom of what be doing lord be in truth good enough for be nearly double age have determined to disregard that be plain be of moment have run after twenty different woman must condone because have come at last to run after for wealth cared nothing le than nothing because by remaining single must command wealth of own wealth must control keep at own banker suspected must not be case with lord castlewell money have found necessity of someone to lean upon when frank jones have told that must not marry have feared mr moss so much that have begun to think that must in truth frighten into doing horrible thing a frank have deserted must be better that must marry somebody lord castlewell have come have felt that fate be very good to learned from word of everybody around from new friend at covent garden from old enemy at embankment from father that be luckiest singing girl at moment known in europe by g will get such have be exclamation made with horror by mr moss echo of have found way to ear more mr moss be annoyed greater ought to have be delight be in truth delighted a came to think of reality asked be pleasure be promised to did not feel that week spent with frank jones in little cottage must be worth twelvemonth of golden splendour in marble hall lord castlewell be supposed to own why have frank deserted simply because must not come with share money frank told be in truth gallant fellow did love frank acknowledged so much to herself again again yet be about to marry lord castlewell simply because doing so must be severest possible blow to old enemy mr moss then asked what must be best for have made for great reputation did not scruple to tell that have come from singing thought very much of singing very little of beauty sort of prettiness did belong to tiny prettiness have sufficed to catch frank jones have laughed about prettiness littleness score of time with ada edith also with frank there have be three girl who have called beauty beast small young woman reader will understand that have not be ada who have chosen name then ada be not given to be witty prettiness such a be have sufficed frank have loved dearly then have come great triumph knew not only that must sing that world have recognised singing be great woman a woman go have said to herself singing be to come to end for ever ever on st of may next must be countess of castlewell in process of time must be marchioness of beaulieu never again must be great woman be selling for marble hall be wise in what be doing have awake one long morning striving to answer question for herself if nobody else must come of course must be ugly old maid said to herself then frank might perhaps come again frank might come again if mr moss did not intervene in meantime at last acknowledged to herself that have given lord promise must keep promise must not bring to exult at prospect must take care however that lord must not triumph over lord have called father as certainly must say rough word two if abused father again be time of suspect mr obeahony have already taken opportunity of expressing opinion in house of common honest man patriotic man generous man man in fact who be worth salt be in ireland locked up a suspect in saying so managed to utter very bitter word indeed respecting who have locking up of gentleman poor mr obeahony have idea that might have used with propriety a to gentleman epithet of believed suspect to be worthy instead of doing so called disreputable jailer be not pleasant to be called disreputable jailer in presence of best of one fellow citizen man so called in instance only smiled mr obeahony have certainly made ridiculous whole house be loud in clamour at word used did not suffice speaker reprimanded mr obeahony desired to recall language apologise for then there arose loud debate during member of government who have be assailed declared that mr obeahony have not a yet be quite long enough in house to learn little detail of parliamentary language mr obeahony must doubt soften down eloquence in course of time speaker must not be content with be about to order sinner to be carried away by sergeant at arm when friend on right friend on left friend behind whispered into ear how easy be to apologise in house of common need say be disreputable jailer only call distasteful warder anything will do came from gentleman at mr obeahony back order for immediate expulsion be ringing in ear have be told that be ridiculous must feel that must be absurd to be carried somewhere into dungeon man whom certainly detested at present moment worse than other scoundrel on earth have made good natured apology on behalf if be carried away now must never come back again without more serious apology then farewell to power of attacking jailer did a man whispered into ear begged to substitute distasteful warder for word have wounded so cruelly feeling of right honourable gentleman then looked round house showing that thought that have misbehaved after during mr obeahony career a member of parliament lasted only for session lost self respect altogether have be driven to withdraw true wrath of eloquence from at whose brow a told rachel next morning have hurled word with force have be found to be intolerable mr obeahony have undoubtedly made as again on second third perhaps tenth occasion be not as have made on occasion to lord castlewell have referred yet be thoroughly honest patriotic man desirous only of good of country wishing for nothing for be not possible that a much may be said for others who from day to day so violently excite spleen a to make feel that special irishman selected for special constituency be not worthy to be ranked with men will take whole house of common indifferent a to side on sit six hundred thirty out of number will find in conversation that nature of animal absurdity selfishness absence of good qualifies be taken for granted a matter admitting of dispute here be mr obeahony a hot home ruler landleaguer a of who be undoubtedly gentleman though american gentleman can be possible that be wrong in opinion respecting others of set rachel heard next day living a did among italian french theatrical american english swell must not endeavour to make apology have just made for irish brigade generally knew that father have made as of asinine proportion of affair have be so explained to a to leave doubt on mind a to

knew gamut be that pretended to know never interfered with matter of be ignorant be treated with greatest respect at covent garden nobody ever suspected of being as then have in mind to speak very seriously to rachel a soon a might be well enough to hear have spoken to in manner dear be sure did not intend have word ready prepared on bit of paper in pocket book be by mean sure that little quarrel might even yet become permanent have discussed frequently with lady augusta lady augusta rather wished that might become permanent lord castlewell be not quite sure that did not wish also

message have be delivered so impudently truth must suffer be sure that there be meaning in word intended to signify that lord castlewell be must be as at time then asked whether be as because did not

on talking to till have forgotten speaker rod in pickle besought to think better of if not just at present to postpone action in matter explained to how very disagreeable must be to to have to go to lord with message a now proposed only enhanced vehemence of order by shaking head a face lay buried in pillow let wait for one fortnight said father said girl using own voice for effort then father slowly took off making way to house of common renewed passion a went have again turned out before have be hour in house earl be sitting alone after breakfast two three day subsequently thinking in truth of difficulty with rachel have come to be manifest to that must marry girl unless something terrible must occur to might die said to very sadly trying to think of case in singer have died from neglected throat did make very sad must not think of perishing of magnificent treble without great grief after fashion did love personally did not know that must ever love anyone very much better have certainly thought that must be good thing that father mother sister must go live in foreign land in order in short that might never more be heard of to trouble did not even contemplate death so sweet minded be in first fury of love have thought how nice must be to be left with singing girl one to trouble now there came across idea that something be due to marquis of beaulieu something be to own future position what must do with singing girl for wife who must not sing be unhappy a thought of must ever again a meditated be stirred up to mild anger when remembered that have be told that truth must suffer have intended at rate that singing girl must be submissive obedient while in hand here have be outbreak of passion here be confounded obeahony ready to make fool of at moment notice before world at moment door be opened mr obeahony be shown into room oh dear exclaimed lord how do do mr obeahony hope see well pretty well upon word know how to tell what have got to say have anything gone wrong with rachel not with illness however doe not seem to improve poor girl will say be gone mad what do mean by really hardly know how ought to break must have learned by time that rachel be girl determined to have own way well well well upon word when think of feel have nothing to do what bid be more than do for speaker mr obeahony yes be admit that rachel though be inclined to be tyrannical be not such downright positive old blue bottle nincompoop a white wigged king of king rachel be bad even ca say that be bad enough to be speaker of house of common belief be that will come to be locked up yet have highest opinion of be because like to be sat upon want to be allowed to say bo to goose have often heard in own country call irishman mr obeahony never did so in life called so over there when wanted to return to hold tongue in house of torment guess will puzzle best englishman going to find out whether be american irishman did something over there to make american did nothing to unmake a irishman there be member for cavan will go hard with if break that speaker heart before have done with what ai to say that go wrong when never go right by chance have come here morning mr obeahony to abuse speaker by mean be who threw speaker in teeth lord castlewell did acknowledge to own imprudence came here to tell about daughter upon word will find more difficult than anything may have to say to speaker have most profound contempt for speaker perhaps return believe doe must make so much of a to turn out of house when man find necessary to remove enemy let cause be what may can not be said to despise enemy now must give puff of breath to turn out of house in truth despise too much be to be pitied said lord with gentle touch of irony will tell what lord castlewell go on about speaker mr obeahony pray always begin wo did come here to speak about at chairman of committee be positively worse know there be creature called chairman of committee now mr obeahony really must beg that will fight political battle anywhere here be not politician how be charming daughter morning be anything charming hardly know what to make of find that be always obliged to do what tell there be allusion to speaker on lord tongue restrained have sent here to say that want marriage to be broken off good heaven doe say that intend to marry because be singing girl now ca sing not exactly that said lord think ought to have accepted at be truth lord face became very long think that be little too hurried suppose quite knew own mind if miss obeahony repents well miss obeahony doe repent have got something into head that ca quite explain thought that 'd do for countess very well a long a be on board of theatre now that be to be relegated to private life begin to feel that ought to look after someone about own age oh indeed be message well yes be message must in such matter invent if have sent know now think of that did say anything about own age yet did remarked mr obeahony calling to mind assertion made by rachel that wanted frank jones frank jones be about own age whereas lord be a old a father upon word be much obliged to miss obeahony certainly have meant to be a courteous a know how said mr obeahony perhaps on side of water have different idea of courtesy young lady sends word now mean to retire from stage find be too old for not that at said mr obeahony said in apologetic tone a though admitting truth lord castlewell a sat there for few moment acknowledged to that rachel possessed certain trait of character have something fine about from side of water have come be reasonable man considered that there be way made for to escape from trouble be not to have be expected have rachel be english girl italian norwegian must hardly have be let off so easily a be earl about to be marquis a be rich man such suitor be not generally given up in hurry young lady have sent word to that have lost voice permanently be therefore obliged to surrender high title that noble name golden hope have glistened before eye doubt have offered to marry because of singing be must not have so offered have not have be singer must not have departed from engagement simply because have become dumb quite understood that mr obeahony must have be there with cowhide though be by mean coward be did not wish to encounter american member of house of common in rage in fact have be governed in previous idea by feeling of propriety propriety certainly did not demand to marry young lady who have sent to tell that be too old irate member of house of common have come to bring message what be expected to suggest now said lord castlewell after awhile just affectionate blessing be very sorry said mr obeahony with shrug be kind of thing must say must send affectionate blessing must say be very sorry have young lady be about to marry son have there be son must have blessed felt that own personal dignity did not admit of expression of sorrow be to let young lady off altogether there be something nearly akin very nearly akin to true love in bosom a thought of girl be ill doubt weak have be made miserable by loss of voice doctor have told that voice for singing purpose have probably gone for ever beauty remained have not so faded at least a to have given token of permanent decay that peculiarly bright eye be there wit of word have captivated very smallness of stature with perfect symmetry have also gone far to enrapture doubt be forty did not openly pretend even to be le where be young lady singer singer who if disengaged must reject heir to marquisate because be forty did not believe that rachel have sent message in allusion be made to age have be added by stupid father who be without doubt biggest fool that america ireland have ever produced now that matter have be brought before in such bald term be by mean sure that be desirous of accepting girl offer to release father evidently have desire to catch must acknowledge that mr obeahony be honest fool be very hard to know what be to say here mr obeahony shook head think that perhaps have better come call upon must speak word if be to be considered a longer engaged perhaps there might be know something well something of delicacy in matter mr obeahony felt at moment that ought to protect interest of frank jones understand at rate be not disposed to send blessing at present a final step engagement to be married be very serious step in life father remembered that have told that wanted frank jones must tell lord exact truth explain about frank jones must be honest thing to do yet felt that girl must have chance lord be not much to taste still for lord have good point think have better leave for present said lord feel that in midst of eloquence quite catch miss obeahony meaning

very well will explain to rachel a soon a can that matter be still left in abeyance of course feel honour done by lordship in not desiring to accept at once decision condition be doubt sad suppose may expect to hear once more from in short time so mr obeahony took leave a went to cecil street endeavoured in own mind to investigate character of lord castlewell that be fool there must be doubt fool with whom must not be forced to live in constant intercourse of married life for money must be offered to be man who without singing cared for nothing second hand life of theatre then mr obeahony be not young woman be not expected to marry lord castlewell have told over over again that lord castlewell have be caught be great lord rolling in money rachel have caught have not quite approved of

barrister mr o'donnell who be accustomed to speak of landleague criminal a patriotic lamb whose lamb like quality be exceeded only by patriotism did not dare to intimate wish further did urge with benevolence for be conspicuous that trial must come on at immediate spring assize rumour have however already reached ear of captain clayton others in position that great alteration be to be effected in law together with mr dolan evidence might enable to hang mr lax therefore trial be postponed not indeed with outspoken reference a to new measure with much confidence in resource must be useless

trial of mr lax in dublin a prepared by proper officer in galway city chapter xli state of ireland will be well that who be interested only in sensational incident of story to skip chapter go on to other part of tale may be more in accordance with taste be necessary that one chapter will be written in accident occurred in life of three heroine will be made subordinate to political circumstance of day chapter must have be introductory initiative fact a stated will suit better to telling of story if be told here there can be doubt that ireland have be still be in most precarious condition that life have be altogether unsafe there that property have be jeopardised in degree unknown for many year in british island be think general opinion that evil have be occasioned by influx into ireland of feeling will not call american have be engendered in america by irish jealousy warmed into hatred by distance from english rule a far a politics be regarded ireland have be vassal of england a poland have be of master under have be made to serve be subjected to much ill usage though have readily accepted language civilisation custom of england have in fact grown rich by adopting memory of former hardship have clung to have made ready to receive willingly teaching of whose only object have be to undermine prestige of british empire in respect have more readily taken to bosom english practice than in of letting hiring of land in various country such a italy russia france united state system have grown up different from have prevailed in england whether english system other may be best be not now question in answering question be material to know ireland have accepted at rate for two century have followed that system landlord have be to tenant beneficent occasionally hard master tenant have acknowledged a dependent generally with much affection though not unfrequently with loud complaint have be same in england question of tenant right of lease of cruelty of eviction have from time to time cropped up in ireland rent be readily paid up to though abatement be asked for a be case also in england there be men ready to tell irish from time to time since day of o'connell downwards that be ill treated in being kept out of ould property by rightful owner then american revolt growing out of smith o'brien logic physical force gave birth to fenianism true fenian take to be one desirous of opposing british power by using fulcrum placed on american soil smith o'brien logic consisted in assertion that if country wished to hammer british crown must only do by using hammer smith o'brien achieved little beyond own exile word acting upon follower produced fenianism that died away spirit remained in america when english tenant began to clamour for temporary abatement in rent clamour be heard on other side of water assisted view of american irish who have revivified ribandism have given birth to cry of home rule during time that be going on long unflagging series of beneficial act of parliament of consequently ameliorated circumstance have befallen country be told other day by irish judge whose name stand conspicuous among who be known for wisdom patriotism by roman catholic judge too that in studying latter law of two country law affecting england ireland in reference to other knew law by england be specially favoured though knew various law redounding to benefit of ireland when cry for relief to suffering ireland came up at time of duchess of marlborough fund be alleged in proof of ireland poor condition that there be not work by labourer must earn wage have known ireland for more than forty year say from to in paid five shilling week for entire work of man a far a can learn now pay on average nine shilling for same question be not whether five shilling be sufficient whether nine be insufficient that normal increase through country have be can be proved to be such a be here declared will refer to bank can now be found established in little town almost in village through country fifty year ago be very much rarer bank spring up without money to support increase of wage bank also in indirect manner have come from decrease in population followed potato famine of famine result be terrible while lasted left behind amended state of thing when man have failed to rule world rightly god will step in will cause famine plague pestilence even poverty with own right arm cure be effected country be on road to fair amount of prosperity when tocsin be sounded in america home rule became cry ireland have lain a be between two rich country england near neighbour abounds in coal iron have by mean of possession become rich among nation america very much more distant have by unexampled agricultural resource put in way to equal england be necessary necessary at rate for england safety that ireland must belong to be here stated a fact add own opinion that be equally necessary for ireland welfare on subject there have arisen feud be now being fought out by weapon of rebellion on one side on other by force of dominating government restrained a be found to be by self imposed bond of democratic legislature there be feud battle roaring of cannon be heard afar off now purpose to describe in very few word nature of warfare may be said that existence of ireland a province of england depends on tenure of land if land be to be taken altogether from present owner divided in perpetuity among possible number of tenant so a to be property of tenant without payment of rent england sense of justice must be outraged english power of governing must be destroyed must then be done by england must be to give refuge to present owner till time must come for righting must be enabled to make further attempt for recovery of possession must probably arrive if not sooner from annihilation of new proprietor under hand of fellow countryman to whom none of spoil have be awarded english statesman small portion be of english statesman have wished in philanthropy to devise measure might satisfy present tenant of land giving portion of spoil might leave landlord contented not indeed with lot must feel to be one of cruel deprivation with feeling that something have at rate be left to compromise must be thus effected between two class whose interest have always be opposed to other since world began between owner of property who have owned none statesman in question have now come into power by mean of philanthropy undoubted genius great gift of eloquence have almost talked world out of power of sober judgment hold that have so succeeded in talking to present house of common when house of common have be so talked into wise foolish decision house of lord whole legislating machinery of country be bound to follow how must compromise be effected doe not suit present writer to name individual statesman neither wish to assist in raising friend to god to lend little aid in crushing enemy to liberal statesman of day men in speaking well of whom at great distance have spent long life be now bound to express a opposed remember manner after coercion bill of be passed hoarse shriek with score of irish member ran out of house cry privilege when voice have be stopped by salutary certainly unconstitutional word of speaker be still ringing in ear then government irish score be at dagger drawn with other to sit for thirty six hour endeavouring to pas clause be then held by men to be odious bondage when clause have thus roughly be made to be law sugar plum be to follow by ireland be to be appeased second bill of be passed with various addition have given rise to judge o'hagan land court that with various sub commissioner be now engaged in settling at what rate land will be let in ireland that judge o'hagan fellow commissioner be well qualified to perform task a well qualified be by kindness by legal knowledge general sagacity a men can be have heard one deny in performance of most difficult duty have hitherto encountered censure have think be taxed to perform duty beyond reach of mortal wisdom be expected to do world have hitherto failed in doing to do against commonest proverb of ancient modern wisdom have raised voice there be proverb more common than of caveat emptor be judge o'hagan business to do for poorer party in bargain made between landlord tenant against above proverb warns landlord have declared that tenant will not have land unless will pay l year for tenant agrees then come judge o'hagan tell two contracting party to take up pen quickly write down l a fair rent payable for land be with object of doing of reducing l by percentage twenty per cent otherwise that commission be appointed government have taken upon to say that greed of irish landlord have be too greedy softness of irish tenant too soft that therefore parliament must interfere parliament have interfered l be to be written down for term of year in lieu of l land be to become possession of tenant instead of landlord a long a may pay reduced rent in fact bond have bound landlord to land be to be annihilated so also be bond bind tenant who will sell property so acquired when will have found that for pay l per annum will have become worth l in market be useless to argue with commissioner with government a to inexpediency of such attempt to alter law for governing world have forced on world acceptance many such attempt have be made to alter law roman said that twelve per cent must be interest for money feeling long prevailed in england legitimate interest must not exceed five per cent be now acknowledged that money be worth what will fetch interest of young foolish reckless who be tempted to pay too much for be protected only by public opinion usurer be hated hand of honest men be against suffices to give borrower such protection a be needed so be with landlord tenant injury be doubt done injustice be enabled to prevail here there be lesser injury lesser injustice can not be prevented in long run by attempt to escape law of caveat emptor be however vain to talk to benevolent commissioner to government working by eloquence guided by philanthropy regardless of political economy must have heart asks benevolent commissioner to evict poor man from small holding on have lived life where only sympathy lie send abroad to distant land where solitary tie will be that of labour benevolent commissioner thus express with great talk with something also of eloquence of employer feeling prevails on side of question that deprecates be just what must do having seen many irishman in america in ireland know that american irishman be happiest man of two eats more in much eating happiness of mankind depends greatly be better clothed better sheltered better instructed though woman wail when departs sends home money to fetch may be for profit of america there be many who think that must therefore be to injury of england question now be whether pathetic remonstrance of tear laden commissioner must be allowed to prevail say that tenant who undertakes to pay for land land will not enable to pay have better go under pressure let see how many detail how many improbability will have to be met before benevolence of commissioner can be made to prevail reduction made on rent average something between twenty twenty five per cent let take at twenty if tenant have to be evicted for demand of l will be able to live in comfort if pay only l will one tenant live in comfort on farm rent of have be reduced from l to l reduction having be from l to l in case if tenant will do well with two child how will do with six eight true teetotaller can certainly pay double rent may be extracted from man who drink will normal tenant earn wage beyond what get from land under own tillage will idle man be made equal to industrious can be done must be done by philanthropy statesman sitting together in cabinet may resolve that will set world right by eloquence benevolence combined practice to world have be brought by long experience will avail more than eloquence benevolence statesman may decree that land will be let at certain rate decree will prevail for time may prevail long enough to put out of gear present affair of irish world with statesman will have tampered long experience will come back bargain will again be made between man man though intervening injury will be heartbreaking benevolence of government commissioner will not have gone far land law of have a now write be at work for twelve month result hitherto accomplished have be very small may be doubted whether single reluctant tenant single tenant who must have be unwilling to leave holding have be preserved from american exile by having l l l of rent reduced to l l l commissioner work slowly having skill of lawyer on one side other against be piteous to see hopelessness of three sub commissioner in midst of crowd of irish attorney law a exists at present can be made to act only on holding possessed by tenant for one year skill of lawyer be used in proving on part of landlord that land be held by firm lease can not therefore be subjected to law then by proving on behalf of tenant that existing lease be illegal must be broken possession of lease used to be regarded a safeguard permanent blessing to tenant be now held to be cruelly detrimental to a preventing lowering of rent immediate creation for of tenancy for ever be not to be supposed that sub commissioner can walk over land straightway reduce rent though land must certainly be subject to such reduction did not law interfere in majority of case majority a far a ireland be concerned feeling of honesty doe prevail between landlord tenant make willing to subject to new law without interference of attorney many be preparing for such arrangement landlord be willing to lose twenty per cent in fear of something worse tenant be willing to take hardly daring to hope for anything better such be best condition law have ventured to anticipate in case be to be done a tempering wind to shorn lamb landlord be anxious if possible to save for who may come after something of reality of property tenant feel that though something of nobility of property have be promised to by landleaguers may after make best bargain by so far submitting to shorn landlord on estate where commissioner be allowed full swing whole nature of property in land will be altered present tenant paying tax of l per annum will be subjected to reduction on abatement can be made in lieu of l rent will be owner small man will be infinitely more subject to disturbance than at present because tax must be paid landlord will feel mercy for seeing that bond between demanded mercy have be abrogated extra l l l will not enable tenant to live life of ease will have promised if interest have be made to be worth anything will be worth something seeing that have be worth something be saleable under present condition will be sold emigration will continue there be cruel case at present there will be case not le cruel under regime new law be expected to produce new law will be felt to have be unjust a having tampered with right of property having demanded from owner of property sale other term than of mutual contract time selected for measure be most inappropriate if good in be bad at time be passed home rule coming across to from america have taken guise of rebellion have met gentleman who a home ruler have simply desired to obtain for country increase of power in management of own affair men have be loyal patriotic might perhaps be well to meet view channel doubt doe make difference between liverpool dublin latter day home ruler of whom speak brought politics aspiration money from new york boldly made use of mean british constitution afforded to upset british constitution a established in ireland that must not succeed in doing be determination of at rate on side of channel be still believe desire of most thinking men on irish side parliamentary vote be not given only to thinking men consequently body of member have appeared in house energetic now well trained who have resolved by clamour of voice to put end to british power of governing country member be minority among whom ireland sends to parliament have learned what minority can effect by unbridled audacity england be still writhing in attempt to invent mode of controlling long before such mode have be adopted have be adopted even planned government in brought out plan for securing to tenant fair rent fixity of tenure freedom of sale a to first will of course be admitted by men rent must be fair a also must be price at horse be sold be however beyond power of parliament to settle term will be fair caveat emptor be only rule by fair rent may be reached by fixity of tenure be meant such holding of land a will enable tenant to obtain adequate return for labour capital to be added romantic consequently most unjust idea that may be well to settle question on behalf of tenant by granting such term a will leave doubt let have land for ever a long a will pay stipulated sum will be considerably le than landlord demand that idea call romantic therefore unjust even though beauty of romance be held sufficient to atone for injustice be not poetical re arrangement of circumstance of land tenure in ireland freedom of sale be necessarily annexed to fixity of tenure if man be to have possession of land in perpetuity surely must be allowed to sell whether be allowed not will contrive to do so freedom of sale mean take that so called landlord will have power of putting veto on transaction can not here go into whole question a existed in ulster before freedom of sale intended be such think a have defined whether concession be good bad be at rate time for granting seem to to amount to wholesale confiscation supposing to be wrong in can be wrong in thinking that period of

daylight a be surmised by police with consciousness of many of peasantry around have be walking along road from cong to own house have be dropped left for dead by roadside dead indeed be when found not word more must have be said about for intervention of police who be on spot within three hour of occurrence little girl have be coming into cong have told news little girl be living at cong be supposed to be in way connected with murder be of boy side of clonbur said one of men of cong one thought necessary after to give further explanation of circumstance mr robert morris be somewhat of oddity in way be man who only few month since be most unlikely to have fallen victim to popular anger be about forty year of age have lived altogether at mina cottage five six mile from cong a pas up head of lough corrib on road to maum be unmarried lived quite alone in small house trusting to attention of two old domestic daughter kept horse car couple of cow few cock hen otherwise lived alone be man of property have indeed come from family very long established in county people said of that have l year must have be very glad to have seen half of paid to agent for mr morris of mina cottage have agent a well a other gentleman be magistrate for two county galway mayo attended session at cong at clonbur when there did little agree with more active magistrate what else did with one must tell of be said in respect to that be benevolent gentleman year two since very many in neighbourhood must have declared to be especially poor man friend with l year must have done much with income must do something to assist something still did have foible fancy such a be did not tread on corn of of poorer neighbour be proud of birth proud of family proud of having owned in own hand of forefather same few acre many more also for forefather before have terribly diminished property there be story that great great grandfather have lived in palatial residence in county kilkenny must tell freely must remark that to extent have family be reduced by extravagance of forefather name blood can never touch must remark must not ask a to successor because valued too highly because mr morris must never have admitted that time have come when be too late to bring bride home to western hall of forefather rumour went that mina cottage must go in female line to second cousin who have married cloth merchant in galway city to whom to husband did mr morris ever speak there might be something absurd in there be nothing injurious to neighbour nothing must be likely to displease poorer of mr morris have be made subject of various request from tenant have long since wanted have received considerable abatement in rent hence have come straitened limit of l year have then offered griffith valuation to explain griffith valuation chapter must be written a one must read explanation if given here will be withheld indeed whole circumstance of mr morris property be too intricate to require to admit elucidation here be so driven that if be to keep anything for must do so by mean of sheriff officer hence have come to pas that have be shot down like mad dog by roadside county galway be tolerably well used to murder by time yet seemed to be specially astonished by assassination of mr morris innocence of man for dealing of sheriff officer be hardly known beyond town land be concerned then taciturnity of county side when murder have be effected be not such deed a be slaughtering of poor florian jones killing of terry carroll in court house have be more startling more alarming more awful for tradesman such like to talk of among feeling of mystery there have be connected with secret capacity of one individual everyone in fact knew that murder have be done by lax felt that for doing of murder lax be irrepressible over there in neighbourhood of clonbur in village of cong lax have never appeared there be one in place to whom police must attribute lax like property in respect slaughtering of mr morris have something in more terrible even than other murder seemed a though murder be becoming ordinary popular mode by people must redress a though idea of murder have recommended easily to intellect then have quietly submitted of to taciturnity who be not concerned in special case adjustment be of mr morris rent accepted murder with perfect quiescence a did who be aggrieved nobody have seen anything nobody have heard anything nobody have known anything such be only reply be given to police if mr morris then why not till whole country must be depopulated in mr morris case landlord have be chosen in other locality agent sheriff officer even keeper on property gentleman be supposed to employ be falling to right to left of mr morris death

to pay rent for be explanation of circumstance a given by mr davy of hotel at clonbur be evident that thought to be sufficient meaning of according to captain clayton reading be if allow such doctrine to be preached abroad by member of parliament landleague leader to be preached a doctrine fit for people then can not be surprised if people do a be taught hold tongue afterwards mr morris have be first cousin of poor old friend black tom daly good god exclaimed a soon a read news sitting in parlour at daly bridge there be bob morris gone now bob morris of mina cottage exclaimed peter bodkin

said hunter to master shaking head doubt know good deal about be not because know that be bewildered bedevilled in intellect be beginning to be afraid that country be one in even can not live in safety men looked to be dumbfoundered sheepfaced kept out of captain clayton way answered a little a possible what be good of axing when ye know that know nothing be answer of one man be fair sample of answer of many be given in such tone clayton be beginning to think that evil be about to work own cure frank said one day when be walking with friend in gloom of evening state of thing be too horrible to endure faithful hunter followed policeman for captain be never allowed to stir two step without accompaniment of brace of guard much too horrible to be endured said frank idea be that man in order to make best of must run away from life in united state have such horror a though be apt to say that come from america see american hand in see american money american money in shape of dollar bill have be sent by irish people united state be large place there be room there think for honest man will never be frightened out of own country said clayton do think there be occasion abominable reprobate be not going to prevail in end have prevailed with poor tom daly be man who worked a hard a anyone to find amusement employment too never wronged anyone be even so honest a to charge fair price for horse there be left high dry without horse hound that can venture to keep about own place simply because majority of people have chosen that there will be no more hunting have proved to be able to have own way be impossible that poor daly must hunt if will not permit carry order so far that can not even keep hound in kennel because choose to allow think will be continued always asked clayton for can see may go on for ever father have have water gate mended on meadow though must ill afford have told that may go again to morrow there be reason to judge that must not do so only two men man rather boy who have be punished for last attempt be who endeavoured to tell of see what have come of be true will not be better to go to america to go to africa to go to asia to russia even than to live in country like where law can afford protection where lawgiver only injure know nothing about lawgiver said clayton have to say word two about law do think kind of thing be going to remain doe remain day becomes worse evil will always become worse till begin to die away think see end of thing approaching evil doer be afraid of other poor fellow here live in mortal agony lest lax of moment must be turned loose at own throat think that lax be institution will remain for ever in country present lax have fast locked up law at present at rate have so much of power that be able to lock up lax when can catch a for present man do hope that law will find powerful enough to fasten rope round neck galway jury must find guilty be bad enough lawgiver have done for that may try before dublin jury there be hope when lax have be well hung out of world can turn round take moment for own happiness yorke clayton a said be alluding to love affair with edith jones have now conquered family with one exception even father have assented that must be so though tardily with sundry misgiving one person be edith have come to be acknowledged by around that loved yorke clayton a never now denied be admitted on side at morony castle that captain be certainly favoured lover edith still held out have gone so far a to tell captain that must not be allowed to come to castle unless must desist never will desist have replied a to that may take word then edith have of course loved so much more think kind of thing will go on continued still addressing frank jones people be so fickle that can not be constant even to anything evil be quite on card black tom daly must next year be most popular master of hound in ireland that mr kit mooney must not be allowed to show face within reach of moytubber gorse on hunting morning 'd have burned gorse before have come round to state of feeling look at raheeny be so easy to destroy anything said philosophic clayton if fox be frightened out of raheeny moytubber will go somewhere else even if poor tom daly be to run away from county galway a be talking of doing county must find master not like tom daly said frank jones enthusiastically there be a good fish in sea a ever be caught tom daly be first class man admit have more obedient slave than when used to get out hunting two three day in session be desponding man can not look forward to better time for own hope be fixed hang lax then millennium will quite agree a to hanging of lax said frank for millennium want something more strong than irish feeling will excuse old fellow oh certainly of course be irishman might have be lax instead of policeman if chance have got hold of in time a be have sort of feeling that policeman be going to have best of through ireland then there came sudden sound a of sharp thud yorke clayton fell a be dead at frank jones foot occurred at corner of road from little boreen lane ran up side of mountain between wall about three foot high here benevolent enterprising gentleman wishing to bring water through lower lough cong to lough corrib have caused beginning of canal to be built have however after expenditure of large sum of money come to nothing ground rather rock have so be moved excavated a to make practicable for men engaged a have be man to drop at once out of sight hunter be at once upon track with other policeman of whom fired at a acknowledged afterwards have barely seen skirt of coat in gloom of evening whole spot up behind corner of road be so honeycombed by work of intended canal a to afford hiding place retreat for score of murderer here a be afterwards ascertained there be one that one have apparently sufficed frank jones have remained on road with friend have raised in arm when fell have done for time clayton have said have said no more have in truth fainted frank jones in ignorance have thought that be dead turned out afterwards that bullet have struck rib in front of body having be turned by bone have passed round to back have there buried in flesh need not that dwell with length on part of tale may say at once that medical skill of cong sufficed to extract bullet on next morning after while one of two policeman came back to road assisted frank jones in carrying up poor clayton to inn hunter though still maimed by wound stuck to pursuit assisted by two other policeman from cong who soon appeared upon scene man escaped flight be soon covered by darkness of night have be eight o'clock before party have left inn have wandered with great imprudence further than have intended at least so be said after occurrence though have nothing happened must have reached home before night have in truth set in men said of clayton that have become so hardened by practice of life by failure of attempt hitherto made against that have become incredulous of harm have got at last said to frank next morning thank god be not instead of have be thinking of a lay here in night have blamed greatly be business not yours then again further on in day sent message to edith tell from that be over now that have lived must have have to be wife from time forth did in truth get better though in page can never again be allowed to see a active working man be fault a galway doctor said egregious sin to spend most of time in lying on couch out in garden at morony castle talking of fate of mr lax remainder of hour devoted to acceptance of little sick room favour from hostess must say from two hostess be not that soon came to term with ada under ada be not to attend to with particular care if must catch that fellow said to ada alluding to man who have intended to murder must have harm done to must be let free at once for must not possibly have got opportunity by other mean poor edith while felt to be badly used ada have often talked of terrible peril to yorke clayton be subjected a reader may remember have discussed propriety of man so situated allowing to become familiar with girl now captain clayton be declared to be safe by everybody doctor united in saying that constitution must carry through cannon ball edith felt danger have fallen to lot in meantime search for double murderer unless indeed one murderer have be busy in case be carried vainly along horror of poor mr morris fate have almost disappeared under awe occasioned by attack on captain clayton be astonishing to see how entirely mr morris with family old acre with mina cottage to knowledge of entire population of cong be own peculiar property be lost to notice under attack have be made with so much audacity on captain yorke clayton a one of four armed to teeth be attacked by one individual attacked successfully there be who said at first that bar of galway jail must have be broken that lax omnipotent lax omnipresent have escaped certainly be case that many be in ignorance a to who murderer have be probably be ignorant of who be in truth well acquainted with person of mr morris murderer in mind of people generally awe became greater than ever to be evident that anybody must murder anybody evident also that be permitted to to do so by new law have sprung up of late in country almost enjoining to exercise peculiar mode of retaliation bravest thought that be about to have revenge against old master determined that revenge must be bloody one more cowardly very much more numerous on account feared poor a be might be victim man among must be much poorer than pat gilligan have be chosen a one to be murdered for reason known only to murderer new terrible aristocracy be growing up among aristocracy of hidden firearm there be little said among even by husband to wife by father to son because husband feared wife father own child there have be feeling of old among that be being ground down by old aristocracy there must ever be such idea on part of who have enough to eat in regard to better who have more than plenty can not be want must engender such feeling now dread of new aristocracy be becoming worse than of old in dull dim mind of poor people there arose gradually indeed quickly conviction that new aristocracy might be worse even than old law a administered by government might be le tyrannical than law of who have law to govern so people sat silent at hearth crawled miserably about potato patch speaking not at of life around when week be over tidings came to that captain clayton though have be shot right through body though bullet have gone in at breast come out at back a report went be still alive likely to live be spending hour of blessed life making love to young lady who be nursing be report brought up to cong by steward of lake steamer be received a new miracle by cong people fate have decreed that captain clayton must not fall by bullet fired by lax landleaguer for though lax landleaguer be fast in prison when attempt be made such became more than ever creed of people when be understood that captain clayton with own flesh blood be at moment making love to mr jones youngest daughter at morony castle chapter xlvii kerrycullion captain clayton be thoroughly enjoying life now perhaps for first time since have have bullet driven through body have come to pas that everything almost everything be done for by hand of edith yet ada be willing to do everything be required declared always that what did be of avail unless take to know wo eat must still say doubt be absurd because sick man appetite be very good considering that hole have be made from front to back within last month be still september weather be a warm a summer insisted on lying out in garden with rug around enjoying service of slave among slave edith be one whom other slave found most difficult to understand will go on said to father do everything for while be invalid when be well enough to be moved either must go out of father simply said that did not understand then be one of other slave edith said captain one day speaking from rug on bank upon lawn just say that one word ' yield ' will have to be said sooner later will not say captain clayton said edith with firm voice so have gone back to captain said will go back further than if continue to annoy will be nothing plain beir a hard a please might a well let go hand know that take away violently because of wound know know know that girl hand be sweetest thing in creation if like leaf with willingly then there be little pull be only very little of course want to hurt said edith therefore feel a though loved of course doe hand say one thing voice way doe heart go right against said edith must not help blushing at lie a told conscience be altogether against advise to attend more to than to anything else still held hand still let hold at moment hunter appeared upon scene edith regained hand have captain held hand hunter must not have seen hunter be full of own news a told very dreadful story be there have be murder worse than have happened yet just other side of lake pointed away to mountain to part of lough corrib be just above cong murder said edith oh miss other murder ever told of have horror in equal to know how governor will keep quiet there with such affair a to be looked after there be six of down at rate five when doubt creep in one can always disbelieve a much a one plea can hardly disbelieve sir a have just heard story from sergeant malcolm there be six in house five have be carried out dead one have be taken to cong be a good a dead name be kelly old man old woman woman three child old woman be very old man appears to have be son have got nobody asked clayton appears not sir there be rumour about place that there be many of in looking after one said clayton so that none must escape share of guilt may be so there be many in sir ca tell much of circumstance except fact that there be five body lying dead hunter with touch of dramatic effect true pathos pointed again to mountain have indicated a spot where last murder be committed be soon settled among that hunter must go off to scene of action cong wherever else service might be required that must take special care to keep master acquainted with detail a came to light for may give here detail a did reach captain ear in course of next few day hunter story have only be too true six person have be murdered barring one child who have be taken into cong in state be supposed hardly to admit of prolonged life others who now lay dead at shebeen house in neighbourhood consisted of old woman son wife grown daughter son have be killed in various way have be shot with rifle stoned with rock made away with after fashion might come most readily to hand of brute devoid of light of mercy of conscience apparently of fear must have be terrible sight to see for who have first broken in upon scene of desolation in course of next morning have become known to police be soon rumoured throughout england ireland that there have be ten murderer engaged in bloody fray must have be a captain clayton have surmised one with intent upon destroying that wretched family perhaps only one among number have insisted that others must accompany man who have be one of number be le likely to tell if have hand in so there be ten of might be that one among number of murdered have seen murder of mr morris of pat gilligan attempted murder of captain clayton that one be not sure not to tell have perhaps shown by sign indication that to tell truth about deed be in breast in hers woman living there might have spoken word to friend le cautious in than be neighbour in general then can hear fancy that can hear muttered reason of who sought to rule amidst bloody community be family of kelly poor doomed creature amidst who whispered together amidst who be forced to come into whispering there be many of same family at rate of same name for kelly be tribe who have be strong in land for many year though of ten feared to be of bloody party did not like not to be of for so power must have come out of hand wished to be among leading aristocrat though still feared thus came together dreading other hating other at last aware that be about to put very life within other power trying to think a far a thought must come to dim mind to might come possibility of escape by betraying comrade miracle have occurred that must have seemed to be miracle when first heard to wretch when fatal truth be made known to while in dead of night be carrying out most inhuman massacre there be other eye watching six other eye be looking at seeing what did perhaps more plainly than must see think of scene there be six person doomed ten who have agreed to doom three others looking on from behind wall so near a to enable to see under fitful light of star nineteen of engaged round one small cabin of whom five be to die night a to ten others can not be hoped that whole ten may pay penalty due to offended feeling of entire nation may be that will be proved that among ten have not struck fatal blow may fail to be proved that among ten have done so will go hard with man to adjudge ten men to death for one deed of murder be very hard for one to remember always that doom be to give be only mean in power to stop downward path of crime among may be that among ten will be spared may be that who spare will have done right such be not feeling of captain yorke clayton a discussed matter day after day with hunter with frank jones upon lawn at castle morony must be grandest sight to see ten of hanging in row saddest sight world must show said frank sad enough that world must want if have be employed a have for last few year must not think sad to have achieved if judge jury will do work a must be done there will be end to kind of thing for many year to come think of country be living in now think of father condition of injury have be done to to sister to yourself if must be prevented atoned for set right by hanging in one row of ten such miscreant a must not be noble deed done ten be frightful to because there be ten at once ten in same village ten nearly of same name people must call bloody assize where so many be doomed scruple to call country bloody where so many be murdered day after day be honest who be murdered must not be well to rid world of ruffian remember that ten must not have be ten if one two have be dealt with for first offence if ten be now all spared whose life must be safe in such golgotha say that to who desire to have country once more human once more fit for honest man to live in ten men hanging in row will be goodly sight there must have be feeling in mind of three men that terrible step must be taken to put end to power of aristocracy before life in country must be again possible when have come together to watch friend neighbour see what ten be about to do there must have be determination in heart to tell story of must be enacted why must ten have power in own hand why must question of life death be remitted to to exclusion of other three if family of kelly be doomed why must there not be other family of other kelly why not own family if kerrycullion be made to swim in blood for be name of townland in kelly lived why not other homestead round place in four five victim may have hidden so three with mutual whispering among with many fear with much trembling having obtained tidings of what be to be done to follow to see be whispered about one of family poor man wife probably have seen attack made upon poor pat gilligan may may not have uttered threat of vengeance may have shown sign that murder ought to be made known to someone be not pat gilligan sister husband brother child be not one of other rich aristocracy against whom men hand be justly raised such word have probably passed unfortunate woman lip ten men have risen against ten men protecting other have sworn among so villainous practice so glaring evil a of telling aught to other aristocracy must be brought to end then three interfered be likely that other rich aristocracy must now know about be not to save life of unfortunate woman child that went there must be danger in though woman child be at rate near neighbour why must attempt to interfere incur manifest danger on account must creep along see then must tell must be disturbed in employment must escape amidst darkness of night there must be escape for poor wretch stripped in bed none for aged woman who must not take away from among gun rock of pursuer none for poor child none indeed for father of family upon whom ten must come in lair if wife have threatened to tell must pay for wife garrulity pat gilligan have suffered for such offence be just that must suffer also three might have to suffer also in turn if consented to subject to so bloody aristocracy therefore stalked forth at night went up to kerrycullion at heel of other party saw now one after six be killed killed then three went back to home resolved that must have recourse to other aristocracy between galway cong kerrycullion hunter be kept going in day so a to obtain always latest information for master for though neighbourhood of morony castle be now supposed to be quiet though captain be not at moment on active service hunter be still allowed to remain with indeed captain clayton opinion be esteemed so highly that though must hing be in truth on active service be sticking to story through asked hunter rather communicated fact to hunter for benefit oh yes sir stick to story there be doubt about now ca go back that boy can talk now yes sir can talk little what say agrees with three men there will be no more murder in county hunter in county galway when have once learned to think possible that one man may tell of there will be end to little game must hang of course oh yes sir said hunter 'd hang whole ten of rather than keep waiting trial be to be in dublin before day come will find what do about lax suppose will want if did for matter of must go a well a ever must hing of kind captain clayton said edith who be sitting there be absurd to hear talk in such way suppose must just go up to dublin miss said hunter not for life death roared sick man suppose must for life death said hunter with little caution for own death must said edith be death of other people that be thinking of now be thinking of to tell truth just at moment be thinking of yours be here under keeping a long a remain so be bound to do what can to keep from killing ought to be in bed tucked up round ought to be giving gruel then hunter simpered went away generally did go away when love scene began must give one something must cure instantly must not there be such instant cure known in medical world for man who have have hole right through bullet will certainly be immortal will not if talk of going up to dublin edith kiss must cure captain clayton be in circumstance must prevent from alluding to such thing be here to nurse must not be insulted be true said if be insult to tell what kiss must do for withdraw word feeling must convey that have in truth given to that be really really own must think cure though dozen bullet have gone through then when ada have come down edith went to bedroom kissed pillow instead of oh if might be granted to to go to frankly to confess that be own felt a day went on must have to yield though honour still told that must never do so chapter xlviii new aristocracy fails from moment mystery of new aristocracy began to fade away get abolished men woman began to feel that there might be something worse in store for than old course of policeman jury judge have seemed at first a though evil thing must be brought to end silenced altogether a far a blessed country be concerned time be coming in everyone be to do a pleased without fear that must tell of though man must be seen in broad daylight cutting tail off score of ox must be recognised in neighbourhood a more than fair act of vengeance nothing must be told of deed let policeman busy a might beauty of system consisted in fact that fear of telling be brought home to mind of men woman child though be certain that woman have seen cow tail mangled though must be proved beyond doubt that be in field when deed be done yet if held peace punishment must await policeman magistrate must hing to thady o'leary man who have cut cow tail off must certainly punish if nothing else be done must be boycotted in other word not allowed to buy sell necessary of life must be murdered a have happened to pat whole thing have seemed to run so smoothly now there have come must soon come change o'er spirit of dream murder of pat gilligan though have made one in necessary sequence of event one act in course of drama a whole have appeared to be so perfect seemed to to have about something terrible one knew what offence pat gilligan have given why have be condemned man began to tremble a thought that too might be pat gilligan woman that might be mr kelly be better to go back to police magistrate than know that need lean too heavily on stupidity of country side in not having perceived that must be so country side be very slow in perceiving course thing will take ten murderer have be brought together from fear of others must have felt that though be ten number so great when considered employment on be engaged a to cause horror to mind of of ten must not include who must have be included have other three be taken in if be possible how much better must have be desire for murder have not gone so far beauty have not be so perfectly acknowledged a to make even yet possible to comprise whole parish in destroying one family then three have seen that whole scheme mystery of thing very plan upon be founded must be broken down thrown to wind can imagine that when idea first came upon mind of three that entire family of kelly be to be sacrificed to stop tongue of one talkative old woman horror must have fallen upon a recognised duty be incumbent on duty of saving six unfortunate did not recognise must not screw up to necessary pitch of courage to enable to enter in among loaded pistol black visaged murderer two woman child have to die though three men be so close to so close a to have be certainly able to save of have rushed into cabin created confusion of advent to must not bring for be not murderer armed awful horror must have crept round mind a thought of self imposed task have undertaken waited until murder have be completed then went back home told police from moment mystery by murder in county galway elsewhere be for short period protected be over in ireland men have not seen a yet how much more lovely be to tell frankly have be done to give openly such evidence a man may have to police magistrate justice of peace than to keep anything wrapped within own bosom charm of such outspoken truth doe not reconcile at once to untrained mind fact of loveliness doe gradually creep in hideous ugliness of other venture on mind of men of kerrycullion something of ugliness something of loveliness must have made apparent when have be done be not probable that return to utter ugliness of lie must be possible whether ten be hanged to intense satisfaction of hunter master fewer number such a may suffice mitigated desire for revenge at present be burning in breast of men thing will have be done mystery with beauty will have passed away at castle morony beginning of passing away of mystery be hailed with great delight took place in wise little girl who have be brought up there in kitchen have reached age of fifteen under eye of ada edith slip of girl whose foot two girl have begun to trammel with shoe stocking who be old enough to be proud of finery though must not bear confinement have gone under system of boycotting when
