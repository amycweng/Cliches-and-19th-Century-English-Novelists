discussing that subject others settling who must pay who must pay at convocation of tenant to be held on coming friday who must who must be ejected who not will obtain little insight into captain ussher affair account for residence of so gallant gentleman in little town of mohill chapter iv myles ussher one know that ireland for sin maintains two distinct regularly organised body of police duty of one being to prevent distillation of potheen illicit whiskey of other to check riot created by consumption force for be in fact military force have officer sub officer private a army have dress full dress half dress arm field arm house arm barrack station military regulation captain colonel commander in chief called by other name in fact body be regularly disciplined force only differing from standing army by being carried on in more expensive manner first of that for preventing distillation of potheen commonly called revenue police be at time of story honoured by service of myles ussher held office of one of sub inspector in county of leitrim resided in town of mohill have body of about five twenty men under with sergeant duty be a have before said to prevent distillation of potheen be only to be done by seizing when made in process of making a considerable portion of fine levied in case possible from dealer in trade became perquisite of sub inspector officer effecting seizure situation in wild lawless district be one of considerable emolument consequently gentleman of repute good family be glad to get son into service at present time commission in revenue police be considered if not more fashionable at rate more lucrative appointment than commission in army among officer of course must be more active than others must consequently make more money will be easily imagined that however much activity of sub inspector of revenue police might add to character standing at headquarters must not be likely to make popular in neighbourhood in resided myles ussher be most active in situation filled whether impartial judge must have said that be too much so must be question difficult to settle a have impartial judge on subject to whom can refer person among whom lived thought that be at time allude to about ten year ago great deal of whiskey be distilled in mountain running between county of leitrim cavan in different part of county leitrim father mathew pledge be then unknown district be wild country not much favoured by gentleman residence very poor though may seem to be anomaly will always be found to be case that poorer people be more drink consequently captain ussher a be usually called in neighbourhood found sufficient occupation for men now case be different revenue police remain duty have in most district gone may be seen patrolling road with officer accompanying being bound to walk so many mile day be very seldom one hears of effecting seizure inactivity be doubt owing to prevalence of father mathew pledge of total abstinence myles ussher be protestant from county antrim in north of ireland illegitimate son of gentleman of large property who have procured situation held have be tolerably well educated be must read write sufficiently understood somewhat of nature of figure have learnt since utterly forgotten latin grammar have natural ability somewhat above par be good looking strongly made possessed that kind of courage arises more from animal spirit from not having yet experienced evil effect of danger than from real capability of enduring consequence myles ussher have never yet be hit in duel must therefore have hesitation in fighting one have never yet be seriously injured in riding must therefore ride horse boldly have never have head broken in row therefore must readily go into one cared little for bodily pain if did not incapacitate little at least for pain have a yet endured imagination be not strong enough to suggest worse evil kind of courage be specie by far most generally met with be sufficient for life have to lead quality in ussher chiefly excelled be most conducive to give character certainly held in country for courage talent gallantry be self confidence assurance believed inferior to none in power of body mind that must accomplish perseveringly attempted have overwhelming contempt for poor amongst whom duty so constantly brought be not therefore wonderful that be equally feared execrated by must also state that myles ussher have have sagacity enough to keep of money have received added not little to reputation standing in country also to real power possessed for in connaught ready money be scarce scarcity creates importance then be feemy lover certainly did love dearly have chief ornament of novel hero be handsome carried arm be man of danger talked of deed of courage wore uniform rode more gracefully talked more fluently seemed more mighty personage than other one whom feemy usually met besides gloried in title of captain must not that be sufficient to engage heart of girl in feemy position let alone irish girl to whom ornament of arm be always dear whether loved a truly might fear be considered doubtful if so why be not married larry macdermot be too broken hearted man too low spirited to have objected to myles on ground of being protestant be not that be indifferent about religion have not heart enough left to be energetic on subject in other respect myles be more than match for daughter in present fallen condition of family matter have not even be mentioned to by daughter lover ussher be constantly at ballycloran be in habit of riding over from mohill only three mile almost daily when disengaged giving horse to patsy only male attendant at ballycloran staying whole morning evening there without invitation larry if never seemed particularly glad at rate never evinced dislike to visit war sub inspector might wage against run spirit in mountain bog always appeared on good term with at ballycloran a macdermots have little else to give in way of hospitality be well young thady must not see that sister be attached to ussher knew that must not do better than marry if considered much about thought that be only taking fun out of a other girl did that must come right thady be warmly attached to sister have have one else really to love be too sullen at prospect too gloomy from situation to have chosen for loved one on whom to expend heart be of disposition too saturnine though irishman to go look for love when did not fall in way that have to give gave to sister must be remembered that poor thady have refinement how must though must let one injure feemy if must help hardly knew how effectually to protect suspicion be now aroused by counsellor pat brady effect be rather to create increased dislike in against ussher than to give rise to properly concerted scheme for sister welfare on evening previous to fair at mohill mentioned in last chapter captain ussher with party of men have succeeded in making seizure of half malted barley in cabin on margin of little lake on low mountain lay between mohill cashcarrigan have a in case be always practice received information from spy in pay who accompanied dressed a one of own men to prevent chance of being recognised man name be cogan have be in habit of buying illicit whiskey from maker at very cheap rate carrying round to farmer house town for sale whereby obtained considerable profit at considerable risk with employment captain ussher have made acquainted instead of seizing man whilst in possession of whiskey have sounded finding sufficiently villain have taken into pay a spy trade cogan found more lucrative even than former also more dangerous a if detected might reckon on death a certain still continued to buy spirit from people in smaller quantity offered lower price though nominally kept up trade be more for purpose of knowing where potheen be than of buying selling be not wonderful therefore that more seizure than ever have be lately made that men be getting more cautious at same time more irate violent in language in present instance party have come on cabin in question unawares not that might not have be noticed that people be confident of not being suspected whiskey have be run there barley have only lately be brought in turf kishes from cabin where be not thought to be safe three men old woman be found in cabin when captain ussher entered with three of own men on being questioned denied existence of whiskey malt barley on searching illicit article be found in

ever have must not be said to have be impaired by age for lawrence macdermot be not in year old man be not above fifty total want of energy joined to despairing apathy have rendered by time little better than idiot very soon after coming to property flannelly have become daily intolerant burthen to have in prime made ineffectual fight again man have made faint attempt rather to parry blow than overcome foe from time that keegan cunning have be added to flannelly weight poor lawrence macdermot have a be owned thoroughly vanquished for world since time have done nothing complain joined to

persecution till have again drank into silence passive tolerance not only hair whisker very face have become grey from effect of miserable torpid life led looked a if be degenerating into grub even before died only visible feeling left to be kind of stupid family pride solely chiefly showed in continual complaint that descendant present family of macdermots must be harrowed brought to ground by such low born ruffian a flannelly keegan be odd that though feemy often thwarted thady rarely did though thady be making best fight must poor fellow for macdermots ballycloran old man always seemed cross to never be so to may be spent more of time with be more afraid of so be though certainly loved better than anything excepting ballycloran own name will be owned that be guide for girl like

ground that lover be protestant must have be easiest line then father john have especially barred be to scold because lover must not marry at once seemed unreasonable have never occurred to in indignation to think of difficulty now stood with back to fire looking awfully black saying nothing well thady what be will be doing for instead of going to aughermore morning at last said first to begin disagreeable conversation when thady looked up thinking what to answer to plain speech eye luckily for fell on new mohill collar where be getting that collar feemy be afther making stay at home

worst disgrace can happen family to blacken name of macdermot feemy be now really surprised fear at brother strange word brought out at once what be ever most present in mind oh heaven thady sure be to be married must be remembered that be not interview between fashionable brother elegant sister highly educated in former have considered called upon to remonstrate with latter for having waltzed too often with same gentleman in expression of actual blame must highly offend delicacy of lady thady sister have not be accustomed to delicacy though be much shocked at violence hardly felt strong imputation against a have so good answer for therefore exclaimed oh heaven thady sure be to be married well now feemy jist listen to if captain ussher mane to marry under circumstance know must do better like a how must for be protestant low born impudent ruffian do like suppose if marries be becase like if not why must do when once married will have to fight own battle joke will be for of if a be thinking have idea on arth of marrying more than have of mary brady will be d d if let come here fooling though have sperit enough to prevent be low enough already feemy for heaven sake be making lower yet well now thady be that be wrong then a always be for captain ussher have asked to have just a plain a be telling now be ruffian be be ruffian to snubbing when speaks good naturedly to a for being protestant suppose be none worse for if be none better know why do be hating so unless be because love be not talking about hating loving if be honest to will say do anything to cross if doe mane to marry be time did be did say anything to father about must be saying to of course dada must have objection must then be letting come here a like settling nothing just maning to marry not a like talked of over counthry four month back talking about jist a misthress through counthry feemy be now regularly roused be lie for thady black lie about own sister too to say ever spoke bad word against pat brady be telling that perhaps be what never did must do for be a true a be false be from jealousy just from hate because everybody else like make say now be on thady will just tell one thing be not to do what tell will for be much more able to manage than be for for say about 'd attend more to one word from myles than to say if stood talking till night talk may will not stand hear bounced out of room slamming door in manner made mr flannelly building shake to foundation poor thady be signally defeated there stood with back to fire old dirty hat pulled low over brow hand stuck into pocket of much worn shooting coat strong brogue bottom of corduroy trowsers covered with dirt dry mould with same heavy discontented look about face always now wore certainly appeared sorry mentor for young lady in love affair felt that sister despised more from being accustomed to comparatively gentleman like appearance refined manner of lover there stood long time without stirring so stood in absolute silence have put pipe down when first captain ussher left room have not resumed now even that be alone with thady be sign that heart be very full indeed so be full almost to breaking have come there eager with two high feeling love for sister real fond brotherly affection love respect for family name have wished to protect former from insult unhappiness to sustain fallen respectability of latter have only be scoffed at upbraided by sister loved for did love though little real communication have ever passed between have always supposed that loved have taken for granted have asked for demonstrative affection manner word now cut very deep be not aware how very uncouth own manner have be that instead of reasoning with gently have begun by sneering at lover that have taken very course to offend self love that therefore feemy be quite a convinced at end of meeting that have right to be angry a be that be injured party at rate there stood perfectly baffled object have be to advise if captain ussher did not at once declare purpose to family to put stop to further visit if refused to comply with advice to tell that must ask captain ussher intention that if be not such a approved must inform that be no longer welcome at ballycloran have seemed though disagreeable straightforward easy enough before meeting now that be over must not think why have not said exactly what have come there to say to give due blamed a much a did sister be very unhappy about must not think how have be so very stupid have lived more in world must have have recourse to common resort in case where speech be difficult must have written letter to sister never occurred to even have done so thady epistolary power be very small practice very limited memento to better sort of tenant a to thrifle of rint few written direction to pat brady about seizing crop driving pig be extent be written on piece of coarse paper have be ruled for account be smeared rather than fastened with very much salivated wafer writing too be very slow choice of language not extensive letter on subject from brother to sister must be well turned impressive terse sententious that scheme must never have done for thady what then must do if be to go to captain ussher now tell to discontinue visit must only be asked if have sister authority for doing so father must get try to get father authority old man knew be moping over parlour fire half drunk half stupid half asleep after thinking over alone there in feemy sitting room for hour determined that must do be to go back again to only friend father john when feemy slammed door a did at end of violent oration above given betook to bedroom began to cry though have so well assumed air of injured person have to best of ability vindicated absent lover still be very unhappy at what brother have said to in truth be only because thady have expressed unkindly about myles also must not feel that there be something wrong never for moment believed that lover spoke loosely of behind back for never for moment doubted love did feel that must be more comfortable if myles must speak let speak to of family if be only to father though knew so little of what be usual in world still felt that even sanction stupid tipsy unconscious a be must give to attachment respectability wanted now if day for marriage be fixed though circumstance might require that must be ever so distant must be able to talk much more satisfactorily of prospect to mary cassidy miss mckeons besides if must bring matter to state must so triumphantly prove that thady be wrong in unhandsome conjecture determined before have done thinking on subject to give myles few hint a to wish next day must be sure to come to ballycloran on way to mcgovery wedding must probably ask why thady have prevented walk to aughermore then must have good opportunity of saying what wanted chapter vii priest dinner party thady a said walked off to priest cottage to partake of

father brother that wished to see priest began task feemy dear be not father brother want to see turn just own self father john sat down by fire be come just to have little chat with mu be angry with

out of love for thady be speaking real friend to ca do harm if after must take advice oh father john be sure be very much obliged to father john hardly knew how to take sting from rebuke be aware mission must not convey be le aware that unless dose have little sugar in at rate to hide unprepossessing appearance even if did not render palatable patient must never take thady know be dining with yesterday be talking over ballycloran old flannelly money matter be see just making bad tenant excuse to so on from one thing to till got talking about feemy in short did seem quite happy about know ever did anything to make unhappy be anything have done to make unhappy be afraid ai happy in feemy dear must always remember that though thady be rough in manner perhaps not at time so gentle in word a must be heart be in right place at rate where be concerned though maybe doe say so a often a others might be very fond brother to be sure be always very fond of then be so queer john if have offended thady will beg pardon for be sure want to be out with be sure feemy be not exactly thady be not least in life offended with be not at easy to take offence at least not with doe think be just at ease with to come to truth at once be telling what passed between yesterday feemy blushed up to paper curl said nothing now be thinking thady did go about saying what wanted to say yesterday quite way must have done be not sure will do better thought a well to step up a be certain 'd hear priest have to say to think better of thady though for going talking about if 'd only let alone by 'd do well enough be that talking doe harm father john father john did exactly like to tell feemy girl in situation be just people ought not to be left alone by probably mean being left alone with one of own choosing that be of opinion that must not do very well if left alone in way that however be what wished to convey to oh dear must think better of thady for wishing to protect a well a can left alone so much here so know father john even blushed little a said be about fine lover of yours be speaking now dear have nothing whatever to say against captain ussher for know be great crony indeed be only last night be taking punch with brother cullen down at cottage be saying anything to captain ussher about father john may take oath of dear respect lady secret great deal too much for be only saying that be down at cottage last night to prove that be friend be not out of prejudice be speaking about being protestant that not that 'd sooner be marrying to good catholic feemy be here there have known now long time be now four month since heard for certain be to be match to tell truth dear people be saying that captain ussher doe mean anything serious think will dhrive mad with talk what good will do for thady to be coming telling what say good feemy if what say be false unfounded a be sure hope be if be so fond of captain ussher think must be a well to put end to report by telling father brother of being engaged settling something about marriage did tell brother be engaged father john what must have will tell what 'd have 'd have captain ussher ask father brother consent there be doubt know 'd get be customary in mind must only be decent so will dare say may there be rasons why wish to have talked about yet then feemy in situation do think long clandestine engagement be quite thing for be quite prudent how can be clandestine father john when thady one else almost know about feemy sharpness be too much for father john so have to put on tack well feemy now just look at matter way one moment supposing now only just for supposition lover of yours be not sort of man take to be that be to turn out false inconstant suppose now turned out have wife somewhere else oh that be nonsense know father john yes just supposing that took vagary into head changed mind must have heard of men doing such thing why must lover a well a girl be likely to be deceived in people why may be a well deceived in captain ussher a others have be in loved a well will hope think believe be not so be a well to be on safe side particularly in so important thing a happiness feemy must like to be said through country that 'd be jilted by handsome captain that 'd be thrown off by lover a soon a be tired of be thrue for father john myles be tired of else why must be coming up here to see oftener than ever be that never may be tired of feemy take word for will respect great deal more if will show more respect to well father john what be 'd have be doing why then 'd just ask to speak word to thady just to propose in regular way thady hate so thady hate be only jealous lest captain ussher be treating quite a ought to do thady be so queer in manner know myles must like to be asking leave permission to be courting feemy must like must like lover more for thinking so little of brother for matter of of know father john ca help what think of thady a to thinking of be quite satisfied with suppose be enough father john be beginning to wax partly because be displeased with feemy partly because feemy answered too knowingly well then feemy will be one of two captain ussher will have to speak to thady settle something about marriage in proper decent way else thady will be speaking to now do think will be best be not like father john to be making thady quarrel with captain ussher know 'd come to quarrel if thady be to be spaking to myles way must never think of doing so av did be putting up to be little like feemy to be saying that to priest telling put young men up to be quarrelling be to save many heart ache many sting of sorrow remorse be to prevent evil of unlawful love bad blood false look that have come here on most disagreeable thankless errand now tell 'd be putting young men up to fight feemy have by time become sullen did dare go farther with priest did say 'd be making fight father john only said if told thady not to be meddling with myles why in course must be quarrelling how must tell brother not to meddle with sister honour reputation happiness now feemy will propose plan to if think advice on subject likely to be good very likely be for see never have lover of own what do say to speaking to friend mr mckeon about if like will speak to then perhaps wo be against taking advice on subject supposing now be to speak to captain ussher from know a friend do think 'd love girl be to be wife worse for having friend be willing to stand in place of mother to when 'd none of own why do think must look odd mr mckeon meddling with well then feemy what in blessed name do mean to do if wo let of friend act for think must be very much afraid of lover of yours when wo allow one speak to about be afraid of feemy afraid of of course be not afraid of men like to be bothered about such thing be very true men when be false try to deceive young girl be playing own wicked game with like to be bothered about such thing never heard of honest man who really wanted to marry young woman being bothered by getting friend consent think then thing must go on just a be now father john only have be scolding so much 'd have told before mane to spake to myles to night just to arrange thing then wo have mr mckeon cocking over that made up match there be little danger of kind fear feemy must be doing so if be actually going to speak to captain ussher to night will say no more about now hope will tell thady to morrow what pass oh father john wo promise will tell then mr mckeon oh perhaps will be telling know when come down to confession at christmas indeed sha be telling mr mckeon anything about to go talking over counthry then feemy may a well tell at once if will not trust to to brother friend who may be able to protect from insult prevail on lover to come forward in decent respectable way avow purpose will become brother duty to tell that visit can no longer be allowed at ballycloran ballycloran doe belong to thady ca tell not to come be not well said of feemy for know father be not capable of interfering in business if a under circumstance will do thady quietly firmly desire captain ussher to stay away from ballycloran think will not venture to come here if doe there be who will still interfere to prevent if among be so set up against because be not one of own set dhrive out of ballycloran can tell will not remain in then sin sorrow must be on own head without saying anything further father john took hat walked off feemy snatched novel into lap to show how little what be said impressed resumed attitude over fire did read spirit be stubborn must bend reason conscience be touched by what priest have said to bitter thought for first time came over that lover perhaps be not so true to a to there sat sorrowfully musing though did not repent of what thought own firmness be bitterly tormented by doubt with brother mary brady priest have gradually disturbed happiness loved ussher a well a ever yes almost more than ever a idea that might perhaps lose came across began to be discontented with to think that have not played part a well a might in fact felt to be miserable for time hated brother father john for having made so father john walked sorrowfully back to cottage thinking miss feemy macdermot most stiff necked young lady have ever be hard lot to meet chapter ix mohill must now

walked out into road a said last word turning round a did so so a to face young man stood still for second two a if meaning of word have hardly reached then rushed at attorney with clenched fist man of law be too quick for for striking out with stick cried by lord of heaven if come nearer will brain a young man endeavoured to get within sweep of stick received blow on arm elbow for moment disabled pain be so sharp a to prevent from further immediate attack mr keegan by living lord day work will cost dear then indulging that ready profuseness of threat in le educated of countryman be so prone to indulge returned within gateway of avenue proceeded short way towards house here reached felled tree lying somewhat across path on sat down for felt that must not go to house before have considered in sad heart what must say there how must say keegan when found that antagonist like dog cowed by blow be not inclined to come again to fight turned on heel walked back to place where have left horse for time thady did not recover from immediate sharp pain arising from blow during minute firm determination of signal vengeance filled imagination damped by thought of punishment to might thereby be subjecting luxury of resolve for have certain luxury be soon banished by thought crowded on mind when pain gave liberty to think firstly own impotence with regard to retaliating on keegan secondly horrid charge brought against feemy conviction that scurrility of must not have occurred to keegan have not previously be rumoured suggested by others dreadful doubt for be dreadful to thady whether there must be ground for then recollection of defenceless state certainty flannelly must take legal step against that keegan threat that must be turned out to wander through road must be realized thing forced on recollection must not go up to house must not meet father tell between have destroyed hope of conciliation that must wander forth a beggar to starve must not ask counsel from feemy inability to protect made averse to see in misery half broken hearted a be made up mind to join boy who knew be meeting with secret plan for proposed deliverance from superior better at rate join now thought than be driven to do when be better than a must soon be case if be to perish better first strike blow at who have pressed so low then occurred to that at rate must first go to only good counsellor accordingly retraced step to bottom of avenue resolved if must find to tell new sorrow to father john chapter xi pat brady when thady reached end of avenue where fracas have taken place between keegan met pat brady a fear that talented young man must by time be subject to heavy suspicion that faith honesty must be greatly doubted a even with who may still look upon a trusty servant must be impossible to keep up delusion much longer may a well now make character no longer doubtful by explaining passage have occurred in life during last few month in first place however must return for short time to mr keegan will be remembered that gentleman be son in law of larry macdermot creditor mr flannelly have be arranged between two worthy relation that if by law craft other mean keegan must obtain possession of estate of ballycloran in payment of debt due by proprietor must become keegan property now gentleman have long looked forward to day when must be able to describe a hyacinth keegan esq of ballycloran having be aware that after father in law death right in property must become own since have induced old man to make gift instead of legacy of debt passion to become estated gentleman have hourly increased ambitious man in own way be hyacinth keegan have first longed to obtain admission into more decent society of carrick on shannon that have time since achieved then sought to mix among second rate country gentleman by making useful to by plausibility by degree of talent by great effrontery have become sufficiently intimate with many of to shake hand with at race course ordinary to talk of to others a blake brown jones to few who now usually called hyacinth occasionally invited to drinking party at house have lent small sum of money on good security now be looking to obtain sub shrievalty of county to be hyacinth keegan esq of ballycloran since immediate probability of realizing brilliant vision have occurred to have left nothing undone must a thought lead to completion from constant business have with thady pretty well knew difficulty of macdermots great poverty of house have observed how completely pat brady be in young macdermot confidence also knew that if direct legal step be necessary in selling estate under mortgage if underhand scheming must be required to drive macdermots into further difficulty pat brady must probably must for consideration give zealous co operation there be also other reason why desired assistance of friend pat be part of mr keegan daily practice to obtain what information must of habit of with whom be likely to form connection be generally believed through county that must usually tell who be who be not guilty of common crime of time illicit distillation secret conspiracy among poor to injure superior to redress fancied wrong be from accurate information on point that be usually employed in defence when be brought to trial that have be able to detect punish by whom have be attacked moreover a character became known have materially led to own safety for boy knew that knew everything through county thus have learnt to become afraid of felt therefore that a be probable that ballycloran must become own pat brady assured service might be of great utility found little difficulty in obtaining pat be clever enough to foresee that day of macdermots be over that be necessary for to ingratiate with probable future masther though of course made sufficiently good market of treachery felt that in way consulted own interest best in making useful to keegan have dim prospect too of great worldly advantage might accrue from being chief informer to so conspicuous man a mr keegan be likely to prove with false self vanity felt qualified for such situation there be considerable danger in being always among people of wild savage nature to entrap ensnare whom must be duty felt that have requisite courage moreover there be certain cunning prudence necessary in also with truth fancied not deficient a mr keegan scheme opened upon idea of entrapping young master into difficulty lay around offered not bad opportunity for display of talent that man a brady be described to be must exist find employment in country be fact must shock disgust that be fact in great part of ireland who be most conversant with country will not pretend to deny be true that by paid spy informer real criminal may not unfrequently be brought to justice who have observed working of system must admit that treachery creates feeling of suspicion generates above villanies to give have given rise in allowing informer by prospect of blood money to give false information to entrap unwary into crime be by mean atoned for by occasional detection punishment of criminal let police use such open mean a have god know in ireland must be effective enough can not think system of secret informer to in position of inferior authority too often have recourse have greatly increased crime in many district of

party of revenue police in quest of illicit still who be dressed a policeman though not belonging to force who be brought in disguise that might not be known by neighbour whose haunt be going to disclose momentary success doubt reconciles usage to officer employing result must be to create suspicion of other among poor fearfully to increase instead of diminishing crime now that friend brady

then betook to dress for evening amusement be to make something decent before met ussher to brush hair to dismiss trace of disenchanting dishabille have attempted to describe whilst at toilet feemy turned over in mind that brother father john have said firmly resolved not to let evening pas without telling lover comfort must be to have decided step taken a to engagement yet almost shuddered at thought of doing so there be frown occasionally came over ussher face made dread must feel that if wished to take such step must do so without asking in fact that must be much better that must do so unasked then if got angry if must tell that a must not wait trust must part how must bear idea of losing what must say do if answered sternly if scolded perhaps worse absolutely quarrelled with poor feemy began to wish evening over to have looked forward a source of so much pleasure feared to neglect warning have received felt that thing must not go on always a be trembled at idea of telling to ussher silent dinner be soon over made father punch sat down to wait for lover larry kept up continual growl about thady absence suggesting keegan have cozened off to carrick to sign estate away accusing of conspiracy with attorney to rob father wondering why must come to dinner c to feemy made reply never noticed grumbling sat absorbed in own thought meditating what must say to ussher till

head that thady have gone off to carrick with keegan be determined to make most of new grievance must not be comforted seemed cunning enough in determination to thwart attorney in plan of buying estate explained to ussher that have made up mind not to be taken personally assuring that from time nothing must induce to leave own fireside so much a show at hall door that must have hall door barricadoed in short that must take precaution brady have enumerated to son a proper to be put in practice on occasion from time with one sad exception be many month before larry macdermot be seen to cross threshold strictly adhered to resolution although during time many attempt to arrest be made eluded must not however be brought to understand for present be useless that one must arrest till after christmas dread of losing property have come upon must not allow even to be seen by one of own household by ussher after listening to grievance a long a thought necessary ussher followed feemy into own room here will leave till meet again at denis mcgovery wedding merely remarking that poor feemy though more than once prepared to make dreaded speech to lover time hesitated stopped at last made up mind that must be just a well to put off evil hour till pleasure be over finally determined to have conversation on return home for well knew that ussher must walk back with to ballycloran where horse must be left chapter xii wedding when ussher first came into parlour at ballycloran asked after thady will be necessary to explain why did so term on two men stood towards other not being such a to render probable that must be very anxious for presence of other have come to knowledge of denis mcgovery that brady have asked to wedding lot of men from drumleesh also from mohill character with whom denis be not apt to consort whom looked on a pauper rapparees have also made out be presumed with aid of affianced that other motive be probably ensuring attendance than merely that of doing honour to denis nuptials pat brady be not likely to have made confidant of sister of denis on occasion nevertheless bridegroom have discovered that meeting be to extent to be political one moreover thady macdermot be expected to be there now mcgovery although must be presumed that in common with irishman of lower order conceived that be to certain degree injured oppressed by operation of existing law nevertheless have always thought wiser course to be with law bad a might be than against when therefore learnt that brother of men whom ussher have put into prison be to be of party that many of more immediate neighbour must be there remembered also that captain ussher have promised to come to divarsion mighty fear suggested to began to dread that occasion must be taken for offering personal injury to latter in case might not be implicated among number dear person for whom denis felt tenderest regard viz actuated by apprehension denis on morning of wedding have gone to ussher to unfold budget of dreadful news to assure captain that only object be to get married to see that pig thrifle of change be right strongly to advise captain to stay away not that must be great honer for poor boy like to see honer down there for have greatest rispect in life for wore king sword there war knowing what boy might be afther when got dhrink in ussher thanked denis for communication at same time begged not to disquiet told that there be danger in life declared that felt so confident of good feeling of men through country towards particularly at drumleesh mohill that must always feel perfectly safe in company in fact that looked on presence a protection poor denis stared hard at a soon perceived that captain be laughing at for solicitude retreated with grin on face remarking that have meant for best though captain ussher affected to set value on mcgovery tale nevertheless thought that there might be something in determined however not to be deterred from going to wedding though in many respect bad man ussher be very vigilant in performance of official duty a have be before said be possessed of sufficient courage have be part of mcgovery disclosure that thady macdermot be to be at wedding occurred to ussher at rate personal violence must be offered a long a young macdermot be with therefore determined to see first tell what have heard be true have great love for poor fellow still must have be sorry to see from cause of uneasiness distress throw into hand of men who might probably induce to join in act must render subject to severest penalty of law ussher understood thady character tolerably well though have real sympathy for suffering still have manly feeling enough to wish to save a feemy brother from danger into believed so likely to fall be for purpose of talking on subject that asked for thady when found be not in house expected home to dinner be obliged to postpone what have to say till met at mary brady wedding about seven o'clock feemy lover arrived at mr mehan little whiskey shop where marriage be to take place whole party be already there father john be standing with back to huge turf fire in outer room usual drinking room of

derision well understood appreciated contempt always showed for be one of reason why be so particularly hated through country though now guest of brady must not help showing same feeling moreover

have swallowed couple of glass of raw whiskey to drive a said to sorrow out of heart have now come down to seek friend whom brady have recommended to determined at cost to revenge by aid against keegan for insult have heaped upon against ussher for name believed have put upon sister be with feeling determination thady have come down to mcgovery wedding a entered room ussher feemy be just standing up to dance chapter xiii how wedding party be concluded when thady entered room where party be dancing welcome with be greeted by mcgovery wife prevented from immediately seeking pat brady a have intended for be obliged to stop to refuse invitation offer received that supper must be got for be well for made offer that did refuse for vestige of what be eatable in house have be devoured have acceded to mary reiterated wish that must take jist laste bit in world must have puzzled to make good offer in most literal sense of word luckily however thady declined hospitality be passing through to inner room when be stopped by ussher who a have before said be standing up to dance with feemy last time two young men have met be at priest house when will be remembered thady have shown resolution not to be on good term with captain subsequent event have not at mollified temper so when ussher good humoredly asked how be told wanted to speak to word two a soon a must have tired feemy dancing what be more probable feemy must have tired thady answered surlily enough saying that if captain ussher have anything to say to must be within that did mean to stay there night that perhaps captain ussher have better say at once well macdermot perhaps have so if sister will excuse wo be minute just step to door moment will thady followed out well captain ussher what be know why be macdermot for last two three day seem to want to quarrel with if be so why speak out like man be that what be wanting to say to indeed be not for be little care whether choose to quarrel let alone heard something to night though wholly believe may like enough be partly true if choose to listen will tell what be perhaps can tell whether be false if can not what tell may keep out of scrape well mcgovery tell that think of boy be here to night be come to hold secret meeting that from brother of two men arrested other day being in think purpose be to revenge on if war so captain ussher have to do with ussher looked very hard at thady face be much too dark for to see anything be there probably not much thought that a men be father tenant might feel unwilling that must turn murderer a be father friend might for sake wish to prevent murdering be from what gaping fool a mcgovery say have become afraid that men must murder who never so much a raised hand agin of who be from day to day crushing ruining if have be afraid must not have come here indeed be to show be not afraid of coming among without own men at back came here though be not afraid though be not what mcgovery say mind be not such fool a others nevertheless do think in fact from different source know that there be something going on through country will bring poor into worse trouble than have suffered yet if a much think have come here to talk of plan to night if know that be so be foolish to be among be that have to say to captain ussher not quite wanted to ask on honour a man irishman do know whether there be conspiracy among to murder do injury to ussher paused for moment a thady did not answer went on wanted to warn against one who be know trying best to ruin father who be captain ussher believe know own friend own inimies said thady who thought revenue officer alluded to keegan answer question first suppose choose to answer why if wo answer can not think be aware of such conspiracy that approve of do mean to say captain ussher have conspired to murdher say such thing surely if heard of scheme thought there be such intention in country must tell one else be so doomed that might be on guard be very much frightened on sudden captain be not true macdermot know be not frightened will answer question thady be puzzled did not know what to say exactly have not absolutely heard that men whom be going to meet night whom knew meant to join intended to murder ussher brady have told that be determined to have fling at be by promise to treat attorney in same way that thady have be induced to come down to have never struck that be going to join body of men pledged to commit murder that be to become murderer that be to become so that very night feeling have be confined to desire of revenging for gross palpable injury with have be afflicted whilst endeavouring to do best must for father sister house now confronted with ussher asked by a to plot of men whom be on point of joining directly questioned a to intention by very man knew be determined to destroy thady felt awed abashed confused then occurred to that have not at rate a yet pledged to such deed even in mind conceived idea of such deed that there be cause why must give surmise respecting what believed might be intention of others to man whom of others perhaps not excepting lawyer disliked hated that there must be reason why must warn captain ussher against danger though thing passed through thady mind very quickly still paused time leaning against corner of outhouse till ussher said well macdermot surely will not refuse to answer such question a though god know why may be friend must not wish to have such ill a happen to know why must come to captain ussher to ask such question if be to ask own frinds that consort with in course must feel more concerned in answering than can not want to have art part in blood to have murdhered one else to tell god holy truth if be out of counthry intirely must be better plased a must be many others since be axing will tell captain ussher do think way do be going on with poor in counthry dhriving sazing having spy over be such a be likely to make frinds in counthry except with such a jonas brown like though mind know nothing of plot conspiracy among boy think be over safe whilst staying among thim have be trating way if be to shoot night be more than many must expect to tell truth then captain ussher think 'd be safer anywhere than at mohill thady considered that thus made just compromise between faith thought owed to men with whom be going to league duty must not feel ought to perform of warning ussher of danger in be placed ussher felt quite satisfied with what thady have said be not at surprised at expression of personal dislike felt confident from manner in young macdermot have spoken of perilous situation even if conspiracy have be formed of be object there be intention to put into immediate operation at rate in macdermot opinion no concerted plan have yet be made to attack good many reason also induced ussher to think that stood in danger of personal assault in first place though country be in lawless state though illicit distillation be carried to great extent though many of tenant refused to pay rent tithe county ce till compelled to do so disturbance arising from cause have not lately led to murder bloodshed have carried on official duty in same manner for considerable time without molestation custom have begotten feeling of security moreover thought poor be cowed frightened despised too much to think must have spirit to rise up against in fact made up mind that thady intention be to frighten out of country if possible resolved that must not allow anything have heard on subject to disturb comfort actuate conduct well macdermot be fair above board what expected though be friendly flattering be not vexed with for for if feel friendly to must speak a if did therefore be obliged to will say that if be to be shot down like dog whilst performing duty to best of ability at rate wo let fear of thing frighten out of comfort before happens now if will let say word two to about be much obliged to captain ussher if can take care of so can of why how cranky be man if hate hate in god name be so absurd a to forget be man to act like child listened to why ca listen to well spake on will listen mind pretend to know more of affair than must wish a be intimate with father can not see that in managing father concern put great confidence in man within there what pat brady yes brady now if only employed a other farm servant must not probably have much power to injure believe doe more than that that collect rent know affair of tenant well have very strong reason to think that be also in employment at rate in pay of mr keegan attorney at carrick what make think that captain ussher must hardly explain different thing make think so be sure of be for to judge whether if such be case confidence will not enable under present state of affair at ballycloran to do father much injury be also to certain knowledge joined in society of illegal be being formed in country be man therefore not to be trusted may add also that if listen too much to advice counsel will be likely to find in worse trouble than even father property brings on alarm about be in habit of taking servant advice about thing captain ussher there be back up again mean to offend tell however if remember what have said to may prevent much trouble to ussher walked into house prevent throubles soliloquised thady there be way with to prevent manner of throuble believe will go in get tumbler of punch determined to adopt mode of quieting trouble if must not prevent followed ussher ussher be now dancing with feemy fun have become universal

standing up have ceased now only difficulty be for aspirant to get room on to make complicated step oh precision regularity energy of motion although piper played with rapidity must have convinced

over injury ussher have inflicted on have quietly heard canvas be conduct to sister that in measured term have gone much against grain with at first because must not strongly feel that in abusing ussher be equally reproaching feemy fall of high fine feeling when once commenced be soon accomplished even when fall be from higher dignity than of thady have ever reached though few hour since must have allowed one father john even to connect sister name with ussher have soon accustomed to hear poorest tenant on father property speak familiarly on subject when urging to join in common cause against enemy though have so far sacrificed sister dignity in drunken conversation with men be not le indignant with man whose name have so unceremoniously joined with hers got up with resolution to inform ussher that intercourse between feemy must immediately cease spirit have taken gave false feeling of confidence that must find mean to carry resolution into effect without delay when got into

occasioned be very happy in ussher good humour be bootless to repeat conversation to tell how often be interrupted by unchided caress on part of ussher feemy however have not forgotten resolution be bringing up courage to make gentle hint to myles on subject on have promised father john to speak to when heart sunk within on hearing brother voice calling to from behind good heaven myles there be

have commenced cry be now sobbing away at desperate rate distress feemy said ussher brother will be more to morrow morning will be sorry for what have said then if be so be not man to remember what one say when have taken little too much punch have now come near enough to mr mehan to see that there be number of people outside door a soon after thady departure a denis mcgovery rest have be able to make up mind what must be best to do in emergency of case denis wife sallied forth former to carry home whichever of combatant might be slaughtered in battle mary to give to feemy what comfort assistance might be in power pat brady prudently thought that under circumstance must be safest for to remain where be married pair however bent on peace if possible if not on assuaging horror of war have barely got into road when encountered father john returning to wedding party oh be yer riverence be welcome agin blessed evening god be praised that sent for be will be wanted be afeard immediately be time before priest must learn what be matter at last discovered that ussher feemy have gone out walking that thady have got drunk have gone after be inquiring whether have gone towards mohill towards ballycloran none of knew when three came in sight father john instantly walked up to if have learnt from nothing else soon discovered from feemy tear that something be matter how be thady said putting out hand to take young man be given with apparent reluctance how be be there anything wrong that feemy be cry so oh know father john there be d d deal wrong have jist told captain what be be will not have girl humbugged longer be there must be great deal wrong thady when 'd curse way before ca be picking word now for priest parson be now surrounded by whole crowd out of house who be staring gaping absolutely shocked at thady impudence to friend priest feemy be sobbing on ussher offering arm to take from crowd took by g d exclaimed thady if touch that ruffian arm again will niver call sisther will iver call brother so now choose betwixt feemy dropped hand from ussher arm turning to priest said for heaven sake take away father john be drunk drunk sober may choose now be if disgrace will not disgrace father john took feemy arm on telling people to go back to dancing laid hand on thady shoulder said at rate thady come little out of if must speak to sister in way wish parish to hear what be saying what matthers father john what matthers shure have heard too much already say be blackguard misthress oh thady how can repeat that word of sobbed poor girl why did let say why tell man be blackening name while be desaving to be laving now not following through country like curse by time whole party consisting of father john two young men feemy be walking on rapidly towards ballycloran feemy be cry saying nothing ussher be silent although thady be heaping on term of abuse must think of john be in vain attempting to moderate wrath thus continued until came to avenue leading up to house on ussher proceeding with through gate thady put in way stopping will not come step in here captain if know might follow along road for must help by g d come in here nonsense man do think will stop out for drunken man riot let pas set foot in here blackguard will stretch thady have alpine in hand be preparing to strike blow at captain exactly on spot where keegan have struck when priest pushed burly body in between will have blow boy at rate while be with put stick down thady forced young man stick down run up to house feemy get to bed will see in morning feemy however did not move now captain ussher be not saying word on matter one way other for well know how quarrel began do think be well to be forcing way in here when master desire not mr mcgrath have yet to learn that drunken fellow be master here besides suppose be not part of project to rob of horse be in father stable thady be at length persuaded to allow ussher to go to stable for horse captain after what have passed did not now wish to go into house be however going up to feemy to shake hand with when priest caught by arm saying why must anger drunken man that too when feeling in heart be right will tell what captain if what that young man fear be true be almost a much worse than a vice be than virtue spare sermon now father john if see to morrow will hear in patience galloped down avenue thady feemy went into house hope got to bed without further word father john walked slowly home thinking of misery saw in store for parishioner at ballycloran chapter xiv denis m'govery tidings a soon a have finished breakfast on morning after night event just recorded father john took hat stick walked down to drumsna still charitably intent on finding mean to soften if must not avert storm saw must follow scene have witnessed on previous evening ussher must have considered want of pluck to stay away because thady have told to do so feemy also must encourage visit must lean more to lover than brother especially a father if be attempted to make aware of state of case must be sure to take feemy part father john felt must be impossible to induce old man to desire ussher to discontinue visit be confident that unless did so captain must take advantage of unfortunate state of affair at ballycloran consider a invited guest in spite of effort thady might make to induce to leave what priest most feared be that unfortunate girl must be induced to go off with lover who knew under such circumstance must never marry present object be to take out of way of such temptation father john gave feemy credit for principle feeling sufficiently high to prevent from falling immediately into vice at same time feared that with strong influence ussher have over might easily persuade to leave home partly by promising at early time to marry partly by threatening with desertion thought that if be at present domiciled at mr mckeon ussher might then be brought to hear reason be made to understand that if be not contented to propose for marry feemy in proper decent manner must altogether drop acquaintance be not far wrong in estimate formed of character though ussher loved feemy perhaps a well a be ever likely to love woman circumstance might easily have induced to give up be impediment in way opposition now met with must give affair fresh interest in eye certainly did not intend to marry poor girl have have sufficient tact might perhaps have persuaded to do so fervent love perfect confidence though very gratifying to vanity did not inspire with feeling of respect man must wish to have for girl be going to marry say that premeditated object have be to persuade to leave home father john be not far wrong in fearing that unless step be taken to prevent must be most probable termination to whole affair with regard to feemy be quite right in thinking that love of ussher be strong enough to induce to take almost step that might desire that love joined to own obstinacy determined resistance to advice of to whom must have listened be such a to render most unlikely that must be induced to give up though so well understood weakness of character be not aware of for have have opportunity of trying strength a long a feemy have own way a at present time have must a have seen yield entirely to strong love be not have circumstance enabled friend to remove entirely out of ussher way have done so love must have remained same passion be so strong that must not be weakened strengthened by absence opposition when father john calculated that by good management ussher might be brought to relinquish feemy be right be far from right when thought that feemy must be taught to forget literally cared for one life have be so dull before knew so full of interest since so nearly came up to beau ideal of what man must be for have seen at rate have known no better so greatly excelled brother father be so much better looking than young cassidy so much more spirited than frank mckeon to young heart be perfection have lately be vexed tormented even frightened fear be merely that ussher did not love a did that might be made to leave be learning to hate brother for opposing a must have said only source of happiness a to being induced by prudence propriety to be cool to lover a to taking first step towards making breach between nothing that brother priest have said nothing that must ever say must either make think of doing so think that must be advisable in way proper that must do so for strong feeling father john did not give heroine credit still felt that be headstrong enough to make very difficult task for to manage in way a charity be unbounded so be zeal courage great present plan be to induce friend mr mckeon to ask feemy to come over spend time with daughter at drumsna there be difficulty in for in first place although feemy miss mckeons have be very good friend still report have lately be afloat about affair of family might make mr mckeon prudent woman unwilling to comply with priest wish though indeed be not often that contradicted in anything then after have talked mr mckeon over when have aroused charitable feeling excited good nature to tell truth be never very dormant in bosom have more difficult task of persuading feemy to accept invitation not that under ordinary circumstance must not be willing enough to go to mr mckeon at present must be likely to suspect double meaning in everything father john have already mentioned mr mckeon name to in reference to attachment to ussher be more than probable that if now brought invitation from lady must perceive that object be to separate from lover that must obstinately persist in remaining at ballycloran a father john be entering drumsna met curate cullen mcgovery who considering that have only be married evening before that if have not be dancing have be kept up by guest doing so till four five in morning have left bride rather early for according to custom have slept first night after wedding at wife house though be only ten o'clock have be on visit to father cullen with whom be now eagerly talking on previous evening when feigning to be asleep have managed to overhear small portion of what have passed between thady joe reynolds rest what have overheard have reference solely to keegan for when began to speak of ussher everything have be said in so low voice that have be unable to comprehend word have contrived however to pick up something in ballycloran rent keegan bog hole be introduced in marvellous close connection be not slow in coming to determination that have be wrong when fancied that ussher be object against whom plot be being formed that keegan be doomed man what be worse still be led to imagine that perpetrator of mr keegan future watery grave be instigated by young macdermot be well aware that flannelly keegan for be one have greater portion of rent out of ballycloran now plainly saw that more active of firm be to be made away with while collecting attempting to collect rent denis be puzzled a to what must do conscience must not allow man to be murdered without interference have great love for mr keegan sympathy be not more strongly excited than have be when thought ussher be to be victim must tell mr keegan must be setting devil in arm against wife brother against wife brother master against wife brother master tenant be too near cutting own throat to be line of action agreeable to denis then occurred to to have recourse again to father john father john have made light of former warning besides fact of having be wrong in last surmise must have thrown stronger doubt on now entertained father john too be always quizzing denis did not like to be quizzed after much consideration mcgovery resolved to go to father cullen disclose secret to father cullen be modest steady man who must neither make light of ridicule what heard if after keegan be drowned in bog hole must be entirely off denis conscience when father john met pair have just be discussing subject cullen be far from making light of for in first place believed word mcgovery told in next be shocked greatly grieved that one of own parishioner one also of most respectable of must be concerned in such business felt towards keegan abhorrence very bigoted ignorant roman catholic must feel towards protestant convert must have done anything to prevent meeting death by hand with connivance of thady macdermot a soon a cullen have heard mcgovery statement by by have be made without reference to previous statement to father john warning to captain ussher determined to tell to parish priest to take mcgovery with plan did not however suit denis at used eloquence to persuade father cullen that if told mr mcgrath at denis have better not make one of party be at moment considering what excuse must give for refusing to go into priest cottage when met father john on road coming into drumsna denis be greatly disconcerted cullen full of news a eager to communicate a if have be arranged definitely that keegan be to be put into bog hole at noon precisely be very glad to see instantly opened budget be very glad to meet morning mr mcgrath began be well since be out so early that be not other way went for 'd be greatly bothered if have found here be see if be only after be going suppose can turn for be going to drumsna oh to be sure can be going denis mcgovery denis have taken off hat muttering something about wife good morning yer riverence be decamping towards ballycloran why man said father john what business have so far from wife at hour of morning after wedding have be to take two pig home father john will niver have done with pig wife will be waiting for a yer riverence say must be baulking first morning stay while a have come so far without can stop moment oh yes said cullen wait till have told mr mcgrath what told denis be unwillingly obliged to remain repeat to father john whole story have told cullen though must hardly tell why softened down little strong assurance have given cullen that thady have be urging boy to make away with keegan father john listened to in silence till denis ended by wishing that two young men got home safe last night that there war nothing worse harder than word betwixt get home safe fool answered father john why must know difference yet between few foolish word said half in fun quarrel to be sure got home safe let tell denis for sensible fellow a pretend to be 'd be deal better employed minding business than thinking of other people quarrel trying to pick up story of murder heaven know what filling own mind other people too with foolish fear for there be ground now if 'd take advice will go home leave better to take care of for will find quite enough to take care of mind mcgovery if find cock bull story of yours get through country so a to reach mr keegan ear to annoy mr macdermot will know where came from perhaps be not aware that person inventing such story a have be telling mr cullen might soon find in carrick gaol must be impossible to say whether cullen be most astonished mcgovery disconcerted by father john address began cullen if man really heard plan proposed mr mcgrath if mr thady be one of ah nonsense cullen have invented word father john said mcgovery heard word shure afther hearing with own ear be to let man be shot into bog hole without saying word to one about father john ah be nice boy denis why did pas gate to come way down to father cullen to tell dreadful tale why did come to eh when knew not only that be nearer than mr cullen also nearer to place where be to happen why then father john not to tell lie be because do be going on with gagging at so nonsense man how can say be not going to lie when know have lie in mouth at moment sorrow lie be there in at father john wish tongue of have be blistered morning before said word of wish have be why cullen be only last night that wanted to persuade that lot of boy be to meet at place where be married to agree to murder ussher to hear man 'd think be arranged who be to strike blow now here be with with similar story about keegan be afraid to come to because knew 'd half humbugged with other story last night tell father john heard with own ear time tell be dreaming do think 'd make believe that young gentleman a mr thady must turn murderer of sudden now go home take advice if want to find in worse scrape than captain ussher mr keegan repeat tale a to one mcgovery sneaked off with tail allegorically speaking between leg did exactly know what to make of for though a have be before said did not wish on occasion to make father john depositary of fear did not expect even from to meet with such total discomfiture consoled however with recollection that if anything did happen now to revenue officer attorney almost hoped there must must fairly say that have given warning premonitory tidings of to parish priest if attended to might have prevented harm with comfortable feeling to atone for father john displeasure now not quite sure whether have overheard allusion last night to keegan bog hole not returned to wife a soon a be gone cullen a much surprised a mcgovery at manner in father john have received story asked if thought be lie perhaps not lie answered priest perhaps heard something about keegan not very flattering to attorney doubt thady be asking boy about rent threatening with keegan a receiver over property something of sort very likely one of boy from drumleesh said something about bog hole may be thady did reprove a ought to have done have doubt came about in way that fellow with tale story will get ear cut off of day serve right why wanted yesterday to make believe that fellow who be to drown keegan morning be to shoot ussher last night be just fellow to do more harm in country than still if be listened to well cullen good day be going into mr mckeon here cullen went away quite satisfied with father john view of affair not so father john for thady sake to screen character because did not think there be immediate danger have given affair turn have just taken feared more than feared felt sure that there be too much truth in what man have said thady unusual intoxication last night brutal conduct to sister to ussher to men with whom have be drinking own knowledge of feeling young man entertained towards keegan hatred tenant felt for attorney thing conspired to convince father john mcgovery have too surely overheard conversation if repeated to keegan might probably considering how many have be present at give desperate hold over young macdermot must not fail to use either by frightening into measure destructive to property by proceeding criminally against father john be not only greatly grieved that meeting must have be held with reference to immediate consequence be shocked that thady must so far have forgotten duty a to have attended with unceasing charity made great beauty of father john character in heart instantly made allowance for remembered distress misery want of friend grief for sister continued attempt continued inability to relieve father from difficulty determined to endeavour to screen success with mcgovery whom have made to disbelieve own sens with cullen who be ready enough to take superior view in secular affair have be complete did not think that must now be likely to repeat story in manner must do injury will in short time see what step took in matter with thady in meanwhile will follow into mr mckeon house at whose door have now arrived

mckeon have gone so far a to ask whether anything have be settled yet at ballycloran about ussher whether thought that young man really intended to marry girl way question be asked be great damper to father john hope if there have be kindly feeling towards poor feemy at moment in breast must have called by name not spoken of a girl showed that mr mckeon be losing have lost whatever good opinion might ever have have of feemy when louey ill naturedly added oh law not man never thought of father john felt sure that there be slight feeling of triumph among female mckeons at idea of feemy losing lover of whom perhaps have be somewhat too proud still however did not despair knew that if spoke with ill nature arose from thoughtlessness that be at rate with mother only necessary to point out to benefit must confer to arouse kindly feeling within think be wrong there miss louey said father john think not only did think of doe think of will tell know that if feemy macdermot have great blessing have be kind good careful mother to fore 'd have be married to before father john said kind good careful mother what be there to prevent marrying if be ready always pitied feemy being left alone there with father brother if captain ussher be in earnest see how twenty mother must make bit easier for mr mckeon then be little know advantage own girl have in think man must prefer taking girl from house where good mother gave sign that daughter must make good wife than from one where there be one to mind silly old man young one like thady very good young man in way not very fit mr mckeon to act mother part to girl like feemy be true enough then why did make world believe be engaged to if be if be why did let go on a though be being at hour be told with at ballycloran if be not to be married why doe brother let be coming there at know be fond of father john 'd be sorry to think ill of friend must say begin to look odd be right how in saying be very fond of indeed be so be mr mckeon know though speak in way to must say anything must hurt poor girl where just among if be in kind mother with heart a own especially in one 'd known so long in whom must poor motherless friendless girl like feemy expect to find friend god forbid must hurt father john indeed 'd befriend if knew how think now be played foolish game with young man why a never be young lady in love ca exactly say how young lady in love must behave dear woman look at way suppose there be harm in feemy wishing to get married more than other young lady oh dear father john quite right must one seems to think captain ussher must be proper match for why barring that be protestant of course be very good match for oh a to being protestant wo mind now well then mr mckeon under circumstance what must feemy do better than encourage captain never blamed for encouraging only must not have gone length have unless downright proposed for have downright proposed for father john said louey have though really exclaimed lyddy then why in name of blessed virgin marry said mother be poor feemy difficulty see mr mckeon now if man approved of be to make off with miss lyddy heart be sure will never give to one approve of why of course 'd naturally come to father matter must be settled have mother for to go to father know ca mind such thing now have brother in short if meant to marry must soon be done where there be will there be way be where be know young men what be deal better than do can understand that young man may propose to girl be accepted afterwards shilly willy about perhaps at last change mind altogether merely because girl friend take care that affair be regularly properly carried on now be that so mr mckeon indeed father john be true well be just feemy case may be after a say having given young man so much encouragement will lose because have mother to keep steady a be fix blame to in matter be there mr mckeon why if look at in way of course be not so much to blame of course not said father john obliged to be satisfied with modicum of applause of course not be pity for poor girl think will jilt altogether then think mean yet think will mean soon unless indeed mr mckeon 'd befriend now father john if 'd take mother part with for week so must all be right know greater charity one christian must do side grave than must do what must do father john said good woman rather frightened for must now be called on to take active part in matter perhaps might not altogether relish what must do see ballycloran be three mile out of must always be up there when ussher be coming though believe 'd be bold enough where one of own girl be concerned 'd be shy of speaking to man like captain ussher when be business of own a for believe 'd never want wit spirit to say what 'd wish to say to man that in very best manner be true enough though must be always up at ballycloran why must feemy be down at drumsna father john paused minute mr mckeon said nothing looked very grave now be good woman mr mckeon ask poor girl down here for fortnight so know lyddy louey be very fond of friend feemy 'd be nice company for then a be acquainted with captain ussher of course 'd be coming after sweetheart then when feemy be under protection of course 'd speak to in own quiet lady like way then take word for 'd be marrying in very room before christmas must have dancing up stair eh miss louey mr mckeon still said nothing even supposing ussher did not come down here nothing be done why must be evident match be not to take place that ussher be blackguard then of course feemy must give up thought of though maybe 'd grieve awhile must be better so than going on a be now up at old place with one to give advice tell what ought to do say to man way see must be doing kind service come mr mckeon make up mind to be kind good neighbour to poor girl do two young lady go up to ballycloran ask to come down spend week two with here perhaps said louey feemy wo like to leave ballycloran come so far from beau because must see here a doe there know father john why miss louey think know how see believe go call there much a 'd like beau to come call here if have one indeed father john when do have one hope will

hear say word against old friend why must be le good natured than mother see be thinking how can best do what be asking a for old friend said louey miss macdermot be never so very intimate a for being ill natured never be told before be more ill natured than mother of course mamma will do a like only ca very well turn mr gayner out of house after having asked to come for race be miss louey flounced out of room come mr mckeon continued father john think of benefit must be to feemy ca have real objection race ball be only for one night girl will be too tired after to think very much of sleeping together seem to forget very likely mr mckeon must like asking know must think of doing without asking oh mr mckeon be good joke will make believe wo that be not a much mistress of own house a woman in ireland a if mr mckeon must interfere with asking one pleased to own house see girl be against hope be not against anything must be charitable kind in mother if be be quite sure mother must give way to must be glad to have miss feemy here short time miss lyddy indeed 'd have objection if mamma plea father john there see mr mckeon be afraid said something rude set miss louey back up be sure in heart 'd be glad of anything must be of service to feemy come mr mckeon will drive over to ballycloran fine morning ask suppose wo come then wo be fault can tell be just for race ball be asking that may see mr mckeon horse win race dance with ussher at ball afterwards oh if mean to come will come fast enough let alone for carrying point when be in earnest know way of asking when mean to take refusal to give due day never heard give invitation did mean to be accepted well father john a think will be of so much service to feemy a a say have mother poor girl of own female friend that can look to will ask over here must be for week fortnight till affair of captain ussher be finally settled if girl behaves a ought when once be here tony wo see wronged by man be own friend said john with tear in eye what must poor priest like do in parish if be that there be such woman a to help father john whisper here took aside into window spoke in low voice ca have helped hearing story people have be talking about feemy a have heard of course must heard of course have know what lie get talked abroad say walk with after dark go in out there at ballycloran at hour just a plea of course can have none of doings here of course not be because have one there to tell what be right wrong that wish to be here of course have regular hour here will find will have difficulty with way well father john have only one more thing to say will answer that a priest christian god know must believe ill natured story against poor girl situated a feemy be know such thing will get about people say ussher speaks of a mistress instead of a wife now father john if unfortunate girl whom be ready willing to help have done anything really wrong must not be mean of bringing into house with own dear girl have father john told know about attachment to man indeed then if be unfit to associate with girl mr mckeon 'd be last man on earth to ask to invite here if feemy have be imprudent in going out too much alone with ussher be most that with truth can be said against a ask to tell will tell one thing did wish to mention before girl father john told how thady have got drunk insulted ussher telling not to come to ballycloran again did not tell how strongly suspected that thady be right in fear for sister that chief object in getting feemy away from ballycloran be to remove a far a possible from ussher influence well father john will go to ballycloran ask here suppose will hardly be ready to come to day if plea will drive over again for after to morrow will go now talk louey over for seem to have quarrelled somehow god bless mr mckeon be be good woman never did kinder action than one be going to do morning father john took leave breakfast party at morning after wedding be not very lively one indeed meal at ballycloran seldom be very gay be more than usually sombre larry be brooding over keegan threat fear that thady meant to betray into attorney hand determination never from day forth to stir from fireside lest horrid myrmidon of law must pounce upon feemy be intent on insult have be offered to lover temper be somewhat soured by remembrance that have not effected purpose of questioning ussher about intention thady however be blackest looking of family everything be dark within breast thought of ruffian with whom have leagued though previously have only considered a poor hard used somewhat lawless character now appeared to everything be iniquitous bad secret murder be object black foul midnight murder be sworn soon must be sworn not only to help to lead on what have already done might hang felt life to be in power of of blackguard with whom in wretched equality have be drinking on previous evening what have led to if have be wronged injured why must not redress like other injured men if revenge be necessary to why must not avenge like man instead of leaguing with others to commit murder in dark like coward felon then thought of position with keegan ussher there be something manly in original disposition must have given anything for stand up fight with attorney with equal weapon if have be sure death to must have fought to death have such opportunity dastardly brute have trampled on when must not turn against then with rancorous hatred thought of blow keegan have struck of manner in have insulted father worse than of name have applied to sister remembering almost reconciled to only mean have of punishing wretch have inflicted injury on then thought of ussher scene have passed between last night knew have be drunk have very confused recollection of what have done said remembered however that have insulted ussher did not annoy have faint recollection of having committed sister name by talking of in drunken brawl of having done said something knew not what to father john though thady have never known refinement of gentleman comfort of good society still felt that fall even from present station to in be going to place must be dreadful be not privation might suffer disgrace additional disgrace must bring on family afflicted how must now presume to prescribe to feemy what conduct must be to father in what way must act respecting property already felt a though be unworthy of of be afraid to look in face after breakfast wandered forth striving to attend to usual work incentive to industry be gone have no longer hope that industry must be of service to walked along hedge ditch unconsciously planning in mind different way of committing crime really so abhorred in be about to pledge to join thought if must be lot to murder keegan how must accomplish must be at night in day must shoot if did must not powder gun be traced home to must not footstep in bog be tracked known if struck down on road must not blood be found on coat shirt be torn in struggle above must not own comrade betray have short time since whole of trial for murder at carrick assize though have not then paid particular attention to horrid detail circumstance of case now came vividly before mind eye planned plotted how have in case be murderer must have foreseen provided against different thing untoward accident then came in evidence against prisoner thought how much more wary must be than poor wretch who be then tried of what benefit experience have gained must be to then remembered that principal witness in case be ill featured sullen looking fellow who have be called king evidence one who in answering tormenting question put to have appeared almost more miserable than prisoner that man have be friend assistant of murderer sharer promoter of plan man who have led on to murder sworn friend remembered how have come out on trial that two have for month shared same bed tilled in same field eat from same mess have sinned together in same great sin yet man have come forward to hang friend thady shuddered coldly a thought how likely might be that associate must betray have not slept eat worked with be not leagued to by equal rank equal want equal suffering if wretched witness have be induced to give evidence against man so strongly bound to how much more likely that byrne reynolds must hang pat brady a brady name occurred to remembered caution respecting that man assurance that be in keegan pay if be true have already committed oversight to guard against have calculated that superior cunning must be sufficient then cold perspiration trickled from brow abruptly stopped leaning against bank to meditate again on position in stood be not that during time thady have be absolutely planning murder have not be making definite scheme to be carried into immediate execution against individual be not murderer even in mind wish must have given anything to have driven idea from mind must not must not avoid thinking what must do if have resolved to do deed how crime must be most safely perpetrated how law most cunningly evaded then half resolved to have nothing more to do with reynolds follower to quiet conscience while yet possibly must insolence of keegan injury of ussher sure enmity of whom have sworn to join now scarcely dared to desert stifled remorse destroyed resolution before be half made thought of enlisting must not desert sister of going to father john confessing must father john befriend after late conduct to thus wandered on through whole long morning twice returned to house creeping in through back door got glass of spirit swallowed again sallied forth to find if movement must give comfort thought suggest anything to in mitigation of sorrow a be returning third time for same bad purpose for short stimulus of dram be only relief must find to depression seemed to weigh down make heart feel like cold lump within just a be turning from avenue to back of house met ussher walking down did not know what to do remembered that evening before have defied man even recollected that have arrogantly declared that must not again set foot on ballycloran have forbad house a if

forget word have be applied to on previous evening to nod to feemy brother with a pleasant air a though there be ground for ill feeling between poor feemy vain word after tuesday week must have nothing more to make unhappy sounded strangely in ear nothing more to make unhappy must have anything more then ever to make happy must ever be happy again have happened during last few day passed through mind added to torment how indignant have be when brother have hinted to that ussher did not intend honestly by into what passion have flown with father john when have cautioned that must be

mass maker of potheen fellow who be known to be meeting nightly at house of mr mulready at mohill who be strongly suspected to be ribbonmen terryalts to call by infernal name sect by belonging to have become liable to death transportation priest paused thady sat quite still listening with eye fixed on fender now thady if be so what must gain by mixing with be drunk when went among must think nothing about for drunken man doe know what doe be from chance for man never seek society so much beneath from chance be from habit for know habit well enough be not one of fear be there by agreement if so what must get by secret meeting with such men a know character vice be fool enough to think that will find comfort in society assistance in advice did think so father john then why be with know most of sorrow thady most of care also know appreciate courage with have tried to bear if must make friend assistant counsellor though might do much for think must do more show how to do more than be

respecting keegan flannelly went to induce poor misguided men not to pay rent to oh thady if what have heard be true went there to consult with respecting greater crime than will now name to instigate to do must lead to eternal shame punishment thady now shook in chair a though must hardly keep seat felt perspiration stand upon brow wiped off with sleeve did not dare to deny that have done of father john be accusing though felt that have be far from instigating to crime like murder father john continued if have joined men if have bound to men by oath if there be league between let implore to disregard nothing can be binding be only to bind to greater wickedness ask to tell of secret plan though god know what tell now must be a sacred a if heard in confessional if have such secret if know sign may be consequence at once renounce know secret sign john belong to society then if can have nothing to bind be true that be rash enough mad enough to speak to men about murdering keegan

message from just before dinner said 'd not go to morrow have said 'd never join again have sent to to say 'd never put foot in hole of sin did say be mad when promised that must never keep that

of god that will never go to place join men in lawless plan secret meeting thady swore most solemnly on sacred volume that must do a priest directed respecting men father john then gradually drew from in conversation what have really taken place told what have heard from mcgovery how have quieted that man cullen advised by own demeanour to tenant to pas over what have be said a though have be drunken frolic asked however whether considered that mr keegan ussher be in real danger thady assured that did not think be that there be plot laid that men be angry violent that unless further instigated did not think must commit act of absolute violence opinion be not given spontaneously in answer to various question from priest who at last satisfied that in confirming horror with thady evidently regarded what have already done in preventing from following further course be about to pursue have done be possible in case to prevent crime whether thought that of who have be named a object of hatred to unruly men might ultimately fall victim to feeling to action have given rise in country be question if did must not prevent be especial business to attend to felt tolerably sure that to whatever bad feeling hardship cruelty might have given rise in thady breast must not now gratify by such atrocious mean a mcgovery statement have induced to apprehend under impression bade good night with kind shake of hand telling that though at present there might be much to sadden distress if confronted difficulty with manly courage honest purpose must be sure sooner later to overcome thady returned home more comfortable than have be in morning must not bring to state of mind in father john have hoped to dismiss felt that though be determined not to go to mr mulready

remarkable to attracted notice from father brother then mixed punch have thady be looking at might have seen tear drop into tumbler a handed to eye be on fireplace slipped out of room without tell tale face having be observed be now a calculated about time that must start with trembling hand tied on bonnet having thrown shawl over shivering shoulder opened book upon table with handkerchief upon

avenue so sat down on stump of tree have be lately felled determined to wait till heard sound of gig there remained for what seemed to cruelly long time became so cold that must hardly feel ground beneath foot teeth shook in head a sat there alone in cold night air of october night with warmer wrapping than slight shawl thrown over shoulder there sat listening for sound longing to catch rattle of wheel be to carry away fancying moment that heard footstep approaching dreading lest awful creak of house door opening must reach ear must not conceive why ussher did not come have absolutely be there hour thought must be past ten have long be cry be now really suffering with bodily pain from cold fright then whole of ussher conduct to since horrid morning passed through mind saw thing now in

forgitting for be niver man for mane action wish may trate well that be for be hard man be bad for to be leaving ould place without priest blessing ussher be at gateway when got there must not see feemy waited about minute then whistled minute more whistled again what must do must be so foolish now for to go without knew horse be steady must stand so got out walked up avenue till saw figure of feemy still sitting on root of tree where left there be light colour in shawl little white collar round neck enabled to see at distance saw at rate heard neither moved to from have caught time since sound of gig wheel just a did so again saw figure of thady a came round from stable evidently have heard also for stood still on open space before house be smoking for caught smell of tobacco plainly heard stone on pathway rattle a now then struck with stick in hand did move towards there stood a if determined to ascertain whether vehicle must have heard must pas along road by gate then sound ceased be when biddy be putting in cloak bundle again continued closer closer road came round little shrubbery through avenue passed gig be therefore at one time even nearer to feemy than must be when stopped at avenue gate when passed place fancied must hear ussher moving in seat did not dare to stir however for there still stood thady listening like to sound within forty yard of have risen must have seen now gig stopped at avenue gate feemy be fainting what with cold former fear dreadful position in found must not have moved if have tried just preserved sens sufficiently to torture be plainly heard lover whistle plainly thady heard too for kept stick completely still took pipe from mouth then second whistle then heard be foot on ground heard approaching saw figure draw nearer in

nonsense hurry there be love come feemy stand ca when thady have first come out of house have merely be for purpose of going into stable a be practice to see two farm horse fed a returned caught sound of ussher gig be more for purpose of smoking pipe in open air than from curiosity that lingered out of door when however vehicle stopped at ballycloran gate heard whistle twice repeated interest be excited thought that something be not right then heard be footstep up avenue fancied must hear speak have idea who be have slightest suspicion that sister be so near when ussher stopped thady gently came down avenue unperceived saw stoop lift something in arm still up to time have not recognised voice be thady idea that something have be stolen from yard thief be now removing under cover of darkness by degree a got nearer perceived be woman form that man be half dragging half carrying then heard be voice say loudly somewhat angrily be d d nonsense feemy know must come now be last word ever uttered thady be soon close to with heavy stick always carried in hand struck violently upon head ussher when have heard footstep immediately behind dropped feemy who be still insensible upon path must not do so quick enough to prevent stunning blow brought on knee hat partially saved be on point of rising when thady again struck with power time heavy bludgeon came down on bare temple young man fell never to rise again neither moved groaned force of blow great weight of stick falling on uncovered head a be rising have shattered brain lay a dead a though have be struck down by thunder bolt from heaven though be so dark that thady must not see blood have shed watch how immovable be body of man have attacked still knew that ussher be more have felt skull give way beneath stroke have heard body fall heavily on earth be sure enemy be dead at first felt completely paralysed unable to do anything be soon aroused by long sigh from poor feemy cold have revived now regained sens thady threw stick upon ground stooping to lift up said oh feemy feemy what have brought upon when recognised brother voice found that be in arm said where be thady what have done with where be never mind now be gone come to house gone be not gone know must not go without then escaping from brother arm screamed myles myles what have done with will not stir with till tell where be then poor

in getting to house pushing open front door be still unlatched with foot took into own room on left hand side of passage deposited still insensible on sofa then went into kitchen sent katty to assistance pat brady be sitting over kitchen fire smoking though man be still hanging about place have not come to actual rupture with master still there have be cordiality confidence between since brady have failed to induce thady to keep appointment at widow mulready for last two day not even single word have passed between now however there be one else pat about place thady felt that must tell one of deed that have done must be useless to consult father sister be already insensible two girl must be worse than useless besides must not now conceal deed must not leave body to lie there on road brady said come out want to spake to be there lanthern in place at mr thady there be not said without moving what be want to night come out bring lighted candle if can brady now saw from master pale face fear struck expression that something extraordinary have happened followed with candle under hat precaution be useless wind blew out at once pat said thady a soon a two be out before front door pat did know how to pronounce thing wished to tell good god mr thady what be matther have anything happened owld man what owld man father nothing happened captain ussher be dead gracious glory why be laving for good night how did die whispered in master ear did boy do for killed by answered thady in whisper killed mr thady ah now be joking stop said thady for be now in avenue joking not body be somewhere here have feemy here dragging along road struck with stick across head now will say have murdhered brady soon touched body with foot two raised together put off path on grass then held council together a to what step have better be taken brady after first surprise awe at hearing of ussher death be over spoke of very unconcernedly rather a good thing done than otherwise recommended master to get out of way advised at once to go down to drumleesh find out joe reynolds assured thady that man must even now be willing to befriend get out of harm way told that reynolds others have place up in mountain where might lie concealed where police must never be able to find that if only got out of way for time might probably not be found murder by coroner that in case must return quietly to ballycloran thady listened sadly to brady advice did not know what better to propose to remembered last word reynolds have said to made up mind to go down at once to corney dolan who be tenant of own from find out where reynolds be pat said thady when have made up mind to line of conduct meant to pursue what will do with man body ca let lie here a trust in god have thought to kill must not run away lave body here a though 'd murdhered jist lay asy among tree mr thady till be out of counthry then will find by accident in course get police to carry off thim fellow be paid for sich work pat must do at wo have say body one will know 't be did mind ask to tell lie about will not have left here a though 'd run away moment afther struck must take into house brady into house yer honer not foot of why 'd have miss feemy in fit owld man 'd be worse still wid thim fellow coming from carrick sitting on body discoursing whether wor to be murdher not well then will take to mr mehan av do mr thady country will have in time howsomever must take there if choose a be public 'd better lave where be let send down by by jist to give hour start so thady absolutely refused stating that must not leave body till have seen deposited in decent proper place two men took up between carried away meaning to take to mr mehan at avenue gate found fred brown horse gig exactly where ussher have left excepting that horse be leisurely employed in browsing grass from ditch side brady soon recognised horse gig a belonging to brown hall then proposed putting body of former occupant in driving to station of police at carrick on shannon restoring at same time horse gig to proper owner at brown hall to scheme thady at last agreed made man promise that when got to police at carrick must tell that thady have desired to do so that instead of running away have not left body till have seen put into vehicle to be carried into carrick on shannon with injunction brady departed with charge chapter xxi coroner inquest during short time elapsed between heavy blow have occasioned ussher death departure of pat brady with gig great many thought have passed through thady mind although have be in action whole time first idea have certainly be that ussher be carrying off feemy against will last word ussher have spoken before death be only word of thady have heard be d d nonsense know must come now certainly be calculated to make think so soon reflected have be so feemy must not have be sitting alone in place where ussher found besides own conduct when came to disproved feemy have therefore evidently be consenting party still however thought that must not be justified in doing what have done in sister defence even though interference be in opposition to wish then thought of man whom have known so long seen so frequently hated so bitterly there be now dead cold corpse entirely harmless unable to injure more thady already felt enemy blood heavy on conscience must have died to see rise on foot thought a to own safety crowded on mind felt that if intended boldly to justify deed must declare what have done see that body be properly taken care of give up at once to police a to fact of having killed man that have declared to sister before have at thought what conduct ought to be have done same to brady be useless for therefore to attempt to conceal even if have wished to do so felt afraid to give up to police abhorred idea of what thought must be disgrace of being in confinement instead of going a at first thought to have done at once to father john telling have happened listened to brady traitorous advice determined to take at rate for time to fancied security of joe reynolds haunt after brady have departed stood on road till must hear no longer sound of retreating wheel while standing there determined must not leave place for last time perhaps till have told father what have happened ascertained whether feemy have recovered reflected that must be dreadful thing for to tell father servant to be called on to explain why brother be away having made resolution walked again up to house pushed door open at once went into sister room here be still lying on sofa katty be sitting beside begging mistress to tell be matter feemy have not spoken since have be there have recovered sens for held hand before eye tear be falling fast beneath have not spoken word to katty since brother have placed on sofa when entered room uncovered eye for moment a soon a saw buried face in pillow be plain from sobbing that be cry more violently than before thady walked up to sofa a did so girl got up go out katty said want to spake word to misthress be in kitchen will call when have done retreated not however farther than door closed left brother sister together last time have be so in room last time two have conversed alone together before be when thady cautioned sister against man just now killed thought of be too generous to let reflection dwell on mind at moment feemy said a attempted to take sister hand however violently drew back from feemy be going to lave long time must spake to first perhaps last word will ever be able to say to at feemy darling wo listen to then eh feemy feemy however only buried head further in sofa did not answer word must spake word to continued thady about be now be with on avenue told feemy be dead what told then be only

must know dearest that be for sake raised hand though blow struck have killed loved must now at moment turn from brother who have brought upon only to protect honer name still feemy did not turn face towards answer well know what be on heart may be be a heavy a be weighing on own must say word two to owld man that may not larn from sthrangers what be son have done then must wish good bye to ballycloran trust for iver there be one thing will ask feemy before go there will be men from carrick here before night be over looking for when come will be asking manner of question about deed tell

reached door returned putting hand on sister shoulder said sister own sister will kiss before lave for so long feemy shuddered horribly a felt hand upon thady quickly withdrew for saw be covered with blood feemy however have seen for screamed loudly have raised head to answer at last said kiss hate be murdherer have murdhered because knew loved go away go out of that will kill too if stand there with blood upon hand thady who have fallen on knee to kiss sister now hastily jumped upon foot dark frown came upon brow be just upon lip to tell sister to whose folly be owing that myles be now corpse before word have left mouth checked even then at saddest moment of when horrid word so dreaded have be applied to by only person whom really loved be able to restrain passion be too high minded to add to suffering of sister though be so unjust cruel to god forgive feemy said be cruel word to come from left room met two girl in passage for biddy have returned from mr mehan whither have gone after ussher have passed be now horrified to find that mistress plan have be a thought defeated by brother departure prevented good god mr thady said with pretended astonishment what ail misthress

of must be examined when book on be to be sworn be handed to larry macdermot at first refused when be again tendered to put in pocket made man who gave to bow coroner seeing be in such state of mind a rendered unable to give evidence unfit to be sworn asked question on subject larry instantly began to cry protest own innocence swearing a have done before that have loved ussher better even than own family be most melancholy sight poor weak old man whom so many of now present have known so long who so very few year before have be in full strength of manhood health for even now be hardly more than fifty sad a be examination of feemy be still worse a have be actually present at moment when ussher have be killed be absolutely necessary that evidence must be taken by coroner sergeant of police who came with car from carrick for in morning insisted in spite of that maid must say to contrary that must accompany back have got on same car with father biddy other girl be on same seat with one on side before reached drumsna be in such state that must hardly keep her on seat when reached that village car be stopped by father john have heard of sad occurrence late on previous evening for pat brady have spared exertion in disseminating news of catastrophe far wide a returned from carrick have stopped at priest gate finding father john absent on sick visit have nearly frightened judy out of life by telling what have happened father john have not returned home till two in morning then heard garbled version of story from be led to believe that thady be in custody at carrick for murder of ussher early on morning of inquest went into carrick there learnt from police truth ascertained fact that inquest be held on body day that old macdermot daughter be to be examined at up to time father john did not know that feemy have left drumsna though police informed that have be absolutely present when fatal blow be struck must not believe hurried off to mr mckeon to tell that knew learn from that must tell kind hearted man hardly knew what be doing so shocked be surprised by what have heard must hardly believe that after what thady have said to after promise have made must deliberately with premeditation plan execute ussher murder idea be incompatible with knowledge that have of thady disposition concluded that there must have be quarrel between two men in ussher have fallen victim little dreamt when started for mr mckeon how much more justly blood have be shed be to be attributed to sister than to brother must hardly dared again to solicit kind office for protegee when got to drumsna mckeons be only just rising from breakfast father john saw on entering room from grave anxious face that have heard news tony have be out to field before breakfast have there be told by one of men that ussher body have on previous night be taken through drumsna to police station at carrick that be said that thady macdermot murderer have already escaped out of country tale tony have communicated in whisper to wife have afterwards told girl be good of keeping secret before evening must be known to whole country when father john came in crowded round to learn what really might be relied on a truth of case must only tell that be too sure that ussher have died by thady hand that young man be not in custody that have be informed that feemy be present when blow have be struck feemy poor father added father john be to be examined to day before coroner will be dreadful thing for poor girl to be forced to tell secret to declare that must most wish to conceal before mob will be in room at carrick yes added tony to stand there without one to support to be asked question if be answered correctly may be will hang brother will never believe said father john that killed in cold blood mr mckeon have kinder heart within than young man never must have committed wilful premeditated murder think will come to be so bad a what mckeon say when did feemy leave thought be here be to stay here for time to come mr mckeon then explained how feemy have insisted on returning home morning after ball with promise of returning again after talking over various unaccountable circumstance of case without once suspecting that feemy have consented to have actually be in act of going off with ussher mr mckeon agreed at instigation of husband priest to accompany feemy to inquest after be over to bring to own house to allow to remain there till something must be definitely arranged a to future residence for said tony ballycloran will be place for again county for matter of now that be unhappy sha want roof over head be glad enough to see when held head high must advise one to say much against now be in throuble unless wished to quarrel with tony mckeon closed fist a much a to show that if one did entertain so preposterous wish must be little better than born idiot tony then sent message into carrick for postchaise feemy might not be exposed to curiosity of one in street by sitting on outside vehicle when arrived in drumsna from ballycloran be taken off car on father be sitting brought into mr mckeon house must not however speak to one must hardly sit on chair without being supported squeezed however kind friend hand when promised to go to inquest with seemed grateful when be told that must not return to ballycloran must again occupy old quarter at drumsna at length got into hack chaise be driven into yard of hotel where inquest be to be held be same house in mckeon party have dined on evening before race there cold stiff body of man be lying on same table round so many others be carousing few hour since there lay at least mortal remained of who be then so joyous so reckless so triumphant in very room in have boasted in wilful wickedness of sad tragedy be intending to inflict on who have be so friendly to at ballycloran of be now first victim table on be laid out have be hastily removed for dance have now be a hastily replaced for present purpose laurel wreath with wall have be decorated be yet remaining when coroner entered room foot slipped on faded flower wearied beauty have dropped when leaving on previous morning little more than four twenty hour have elapsed since fiddle be playing there of who be now summoned upon oath to decide in what manner ussher have met death have on that morning be nearly last to leave room in be now to exercise so different vocation biddy katty be first examined be from evidence of former that father john first heard that feemy have agreed to elope with ussher appeared from what girl said that mistress be to have left house time previous to time at other girl proved that have be brought back by brother added greatly to sorrow at same time now instantly perceived under what provocation thady have struck fatal blow brady proved that master have confessed to that be who have killed ussher that have said that when did so sister be in ussher arm stick be then brought forward be proved to be one usually carried by thady blood upon stick nature of wound upon dead man head left doubt that be weapon with have be killed father be then brought in have already seen manner in conducted be now necessary to examine feemy at last came in almost carried in mr mckeon arm with thick veil over face however well hid countenance by mean rendered sob inaudible two chair be placed for by table when be seated book be handed to feemy then have to take glove from right hand be so wetted with tear be so weak that be long before must get off when have taken oath when have sworn to tell not only truth whole truth found impossible to speak word coroner be obliged to ask question to mr mckeon be allowed to get answer spoken below breath in whisper did know captain ussher be dead did did know that be brother who have killed be brother thady yes be how did know be who have done did see do did see how then did know have told so afterwards must say how killed must not why to question even mr mckeon must get answer where be when captain ussher be killed answer be with captain ussher believed be why for what purpose be with to question although pressed for time must not answer mr mckeon who be up to time totally ignorant of locality in ussher have be killed be really unaware how have come to pas feemy be present at time be quite unable to suggest to what answer ought to make finding that be with difficulty must keep feemy from falling from chair told coroner be really afraid miss macdermot be so ill that must be quite incapable of answering more question added that considering circumstance of case that young lady have be engaged to unfortunate man who be dead be sister of man who have killed be not to be wondered at if found dreadful position too much for coroner answered that be quite prepared to give miss macdermot indulgence in power a felt a strongly a one must do distressing situation in young lady be placed that be absolutely imperative that last question have asked must be answered that be sure when stated that result of inquest very probably depended on what answer to question might be a from that juror must probably have to decide whether brother be to be accused of murder merely homicide be quite sure said under circumstance miss macdermot must make effort to answer fully firmly be willing added to put question in form might render more simple for to answer though must oblige to say that feared must be still further distressing to feeling then told mr mckeon that from evidence of servant have appeared that feemy have agreed to elope with captain ussher that a far a must be judged from circumstantial evidence be in fact eloping with when thady have killed now be necessary for to state whether be there of own good will going away with if not what be doing at moment of tragical occurrence after many fruitless attempt made by mr mckeon to get answer to feemy said through friend that be sitting down doe mean that be sitting down when blow be struck doe know where be when be sitting down be sitting down till captain ussher lifted up when captain ussher lifted up be going away willingly with yes be did struggle with at did of friend know be going with before however poor girl must be got to answer question have fainted be found impossible to restore for long time when have recovered be only to give way to most distressing cry hysterical shriek threw on floor of bedroom to have be taken mr mckeon be afraid that must have broken blood vessel in violence of emotion a be be for long time spitting blood fell from one fit into until medical man who be now with be afraid that must become entirely delirious have long be found impossible to proceed with examination further have however unwittingly hardly knowing at time what be saying given evidence against brother fact of case did not warrant for when thady have first seen be not going willingly with ussher have then fainted be dragging apparently with violence along road when be found in inquest room that feemy macdermot must not possibly attend again coroner gave jury substance of evidence on case pointed out to that though there must be doubt that young macdermot be man by whom captain ussher have be killed still if thought there be sufficient ground for to believe that ussher be ill treating sister that brother have interfered on behalf must not come to decision that murder have be committed jury after consulting for short time brought in verdict of wilful murder against thaddeus macdermot accordingly coroner warrant be issued for apprehension trial be handed over to police that might lose time in endeavouring to take prisoner chapter xxii escape thady left house immediately after last cruel speech father made to with tear running fast down face leapt down step hurried across lawn through little shrubbery over wall into road did not dare to go alone down avenue by spot where ussher body have lain where ground must still be moist with blood father word still rang dreadfully in ear murdered of course will call murder of course will be sure to hang then thought of bearing of case seemed to that father must be right that there must be doubt that men must call by horrid name sounded so hideously in ear if have done be not murder what manner in one man must kill must be thought so be now evident to that feemy have be with ussher willingly that be there of own consent by appointment merely because have fainted in arm have struck down killed of course father be right of course must call murder then again even if must justify deed to even if must make believe that man be at time using violence to sister how must get proved whereas proof of having consented to go off with must no doubt not be wanting then again thady remembered a did so cold sweat stood upon brow how lately have sat in company where murder of very man whom now have killed have be coolly canvassed decided on have be one of who be to be banded together for execution must all be forgotten at trial must there not certainly be one to come forward at horrid hour swear thing against ay truly swear then fancied precision with knew damning word have lightly uttered must be brought against must not thing surely condemn must not surely hang must be useless for then to open bosom to declare to how hateful even during feverish hour of detested evening idea of murder have be to soul must be useless for to tell even then at same time have cautioned ussher to avoid danger with be threatened must be vain for to declare how soon how entirely have since repented of folly of have on occasion be guilty stern face by whom must be surrounded at trial when must stand in disgraceful spot with head leaning on bar so often pressed by murderer miscreant thief must receive protestation very differently from benign friend who have previously comforted in misery must neither listen to believe assurance said involuntarily to murder of course will call murder of course will hang oftener thought of more hurried for felt that police must be soon in search of at most have that night to escape from a idea crossed mind hastened along lane leading to drumleesh sometimes running sometimes walking till perspiration stood upon brow if be murder that have done if world must consider a murder then must most probably soon be in same condition a criminal whose trial have so vividly occurred to recollection few day ago at time idea have only haunted have only then dreamt of possibility of situation being same a man very horror have then felt at bare thought have made determined to avoid who must even talk of crime must lead to situation now have of own accord committed that crime how have done in manner that must by possibility escape detection then again tried to comfort by reflecting that be not murder that intention have not be to murder man father horrid word again rang through ear felt that there be hope for in flight moon got up when be about half way to destination left road lest by chance there might be one out at hour who must recognise crept on by hedge ditch sometimes running along bit of grass between tillage fence

overcome great repugnance still felt to break solemn promise have given father john have so faithfully intended to keep reynolds reflected that though be contrary to regulation to bring stranger to haunt where companion carried on illegal trade must hardly be unwilling to give shelter to man who have killed enemy whom so cordially hated to murder whom be sworn particularly when present necessity of concealment arose from fact of having done so reynolds have idea of justice in composition knew that have murdered ussher companion must have used effort to conceal to baffle pursuer be determined that must do a much for thady went back to cabin for corney dolan told story have just heard at about midnight party started for mountain aughacashel be mountain on eastern side of loch allen near border of county cavan uncultivated rocky at top nevertheless inhabited studded with many miserably poor cabin till within about quarter of mile of summit owner of cabin with great labour have contrived to obtain wretchedly poor crop of potato from barren soil immediately round cabin to agricultural pursuit many joined more profitable hazardous business of making potheen be generally speaking lawless reckless set of people paying little others rent living without common blessing restraint of civilization road sign of road came within mile of drumshambo nearest village be seven eight mile distant from although knew that barrenness of locality want of mean of approach must altogether secure from unwelcome visit of revenue police constabulary still felt sure that of inimical force must come into immediate neighbourhood without making aware of approach in time to guard against injury might do either by removing vestige of trade by sending who be in fear of being taken up into more inaccessible portion of mountain on western side of aughacashel immediately over loch allen about half way between lowland summit kind of rude limekiln have be made apparently for purpose of burning lime for neighbouring land very poor state of rocky ground about gave sign of little industry afforded evidence that limekiln have not added much to agricultural wealth of country be now at rate made use of for other purpose for be in here that joe reynolds at present usually worked still there be only two cabin immediately close to one of be occupied by very old man daughter in corney dolan reynolds resided when be away from drumleesh other belonged to partner in business who considered owner of limekiln head of party concerned in man name be daniel kennedy to reckless desperate

be said between a went excepting observation made between joe comrade a to character occupation of resident in various cabin by passed after going for considerable way across field bog bottom land came out on lane running close round small lake lying in bed of low hill rose on other side of water be beautifully calm moon shining immediately down upon gave appearance of large surface of polished silver at spot field came close down to road also to water in corner thus formed stood very small poor cabin lake be loch sheen be in cabin that ussher have apprehended tim reynolds two other men little more than fortnight ago joe stopped moment when reached spot till thady who be following other man have come up then pointing to low door close to stood said last deed a ruffian did a now lie

with more curse on than there be stone on shingle come on lad must be standing here must be in aughacashel before sunrise else will be stopping a pas through counthry again went through clear bright moonlight passed loch sheen soon afterwards little lake lying also to left of road then found in small village of cashcarrigan passed through silently quickly without speaking word having proceeded about mile on road towards ballinamore again left took to field went along northern margin of loch dieney running where ground be hard enough at other time stepping from one dry sod to through gap fence seemed a well known to thady guide a cabin in have passed life left drumshambo to left at about four in morning came to loch allen here got upon road for way skirt eastern side of lake along ran

weary that must hardly drag leg along who have seated for moment upon one of big loose stone be scattered over side of hill again rose resumed journey soon lost track of boreen still continued to ascend keeping by side of loose built wall with land be subdivided be astonishing what labour have seemingly be wasted in piling wall after wall in barren place even in spot where attempt have be made at tillage where only produce land afforded be food of few miserable sheep goat might be thought must have grazed in safety without necessity for numerous fence however after time ceased too just at spot where open mountain no longer showed sign of man handiwork dan kennedy lime kiln be built immediately behind be two cabin of have before spoken be at door of furthest of two joe did not knock

at priest door heart palpitated violently within a waited little time for answer be about eleven knew that at hour father john must still be up if be at home though judy must probably have retired to slumber be right in calculation for in short time heard heavy step of father john in hall then rusty door key grated in lock thady knee shook beneath a listened to rising latch how must meet father john eye after what have done how must find word to tell that have broken solemn vow that have taken on holy scripture have in first difficulty flown to disreputable security to be found in haunt of such men a joe reynolds dan kennedy however must have to tell for door be now open there stood priest with eye fixed on thady sad face soiled appearance thady have not have clothes off for last two night now bore soil stain of two midnight walk countenance be pale in extreme never full healthy now seemed more thin wan than forty eight hour sorrow must possibly have made be much fatigued for shoe have become soaked with water in moist ground through have passed repassed foot be blistered with long unaccustomed walk when father john saw heart melted within at sight of young man sad melancholy figure already know that from moment have first heard of catastrophe have made excuse in own heart for thady when have heard a did at inquest that sister have be with ussher when lifted stick against have not only acquitted in own estimation from anything like crime of murder also felt certain that have be in same situation must most assuredly have done same a thady have done have be much surprised at coroner verdict must not think how twelve men on oath must call death murder when so evidently appeared to that man stigmatised by verdict a murderer have only be actuated by praiseworthy purpose of defending sister from disgrace violence when moreover be so plain that thady presence on scene at moment be accidental that attack must not have be premeditated juror however have not be thady friend a father john be be inclined to look upon deed with same lenient eye appeared to that ussher be not using violence to young lady who have admitted in evidence that be willing party to ussher proceeding doubtless there might be circumstance at prisoner trial must be properly put forward in palliation of murder by counsel with jury before coroner must have nothing to do on consideration juror with very little delay have come to conclusion have so surprised grieved father john still however looked forward with almost absolute certainty to thady acquittal at trial be by far more angry with young man at folly in attempting to fly from justice than be at deed have put under power now however when saw pale fatigued harassed in sorrow at door anger turned to pity only feeling left in bosom led to think how must assuage suffering comfort in affliction thady be first to speak father john said have come to give up thought 'd tell a passed door oh son son said father john come in though thady come in till think what be best to do in sad time went again into little parlour where so short time ago thady have made promise now have to confess have broken then gave priest by degree whole history of affair told how different event have happened explained how feemy appearance a lay fainting in ussher arm man word to when declared that must come with have at moment made think that be being dragged away by violence that have have conviction on mind when raised stick to strike then told father john exactly what have done since occurrence precaution took respecting body visit paid to father sister lastly how have fled for sake of security passed two miserable day among mountain in aughacashel ah poor boy said john be have to blame for what made fly there what made fly anywhere why did not with honest face at once place in hand of police from whom must know must have remained concealed oh father john av must feel felt when first knew man be dead when own sisther spurned when father told be murdherer must wonder at flying av be only for hour be true boy be very true wo ask now where be who be with what folly may have done whilst there for have heart to blame for what have done in extremity of misery now thady must think of future of course know that having come to house having seen must at once place in hand of police in course father john be only on way to carrick when called here in truth wanted kind word from before put in horrid place poor dear boy be little comfort can give except to tell that think that be mckeon rest of when trial come on must acquit jury must acquit till time come may be sure can be done for by warmest friend will be done by know thady till time doe come till trial be over must remain in prison father john do think will acquit do think doe mr mckeon think will not find murder indeed doe thady so do so be sure doe coroner by what said to jury be sure did expect to find murder at inquest be great comfort father john always have comfort for tell what be hear about feemy father be thrue be ill have little comfort for in quarter be afraid though feemy ill think be dangerously so will want time to bring round have doubt time will bring round have have great deal to try too be very fond of man though be so unworthy of be easy for girl like feemy to get over at once loss of loved so dearly god send may recover did for best larry be long ailing fear have knocked up intirely what will tinants do now at will have one over thim keegan suppose will be resaving rints now father john wo mind that now boy have enough on heart now without troubling about well then will be wishing good bye will go on to carrick thady not to night stay here to night must not have go in give up under cover of dark early to morrow a soon a counsellor webb will be up will go with to will no doubt commit indeed must do so will be better for than lying night in guard room at police station being dragged out in morning cold comfortless hungry father john then got supper have bed prepared for early in morning sent down to ballycloran for linen clothes that might appear in more respectable manner before magistrate have horse car ready for after breakfast at about ten started for counsellor webb found magistrate at home father john sent in word to that mr macdermot having heard verdict have be returned at coroner inquest have come to surrender mr webb received two into study having explained to thady that be of course duty immediately to commit sent to carrick for police in whose charge must be necessary that prisoner must be sent from thence be very sorry said webb that must be principal duty must be obliged to hand over to constable must have be aware must do so when came to father john then took mr webb aside explained to particular of case have not come out at inquest at last be agreed that mr webb must go with into carrick that must call at police office to inform sergeant there that prisoner be in custody that must go direct to gaol that thady must be immediately handed over to custody of gaoler be accordingly done avoided disgrace so feared of being led through town with handcuff on wrist father john did not leave until have seen settled with comfort prison must afford of thing now that be there seemed to think much le than priest when father john be kindly petitioning with governor to allow prisoner light in cell said what matter light wo make time pas over quicker next assize must not take place till april six month after present time be finally agreed that father john must take on care connected with defence must from time to time visit in confinement give such news respecting father sister affair at ballycloran a might have to bring then took leave when be gone thady be once more alone in solitude moreover felt strongly gloom of big cold wall around of huge lock kept austerity discomfort of prison discipline misery of confinement yet even there in gaol committed to take trial for life though doomed to monotony of dull cell for six month still felt infinitely le wretched than have done whilst sitting in andy mcevoy cabin wondering at torpidity of owner feeling of suspense of inactivity dread of being found dragged away joined to horror felt at remaining in so desolate place must have driven mad now knew that have daily accident to fear new misfortune to dread nerved to bear six long coming month with fortitude patience though time be long weary day generally unbroken by anything must interest enliven still from hour when father john first spoke to at hall door to in be led into court house dock a prisoner to take trial for life never once repented that have quitted aughacashel mountain security to give up a prisoner to authority of carrick chapter xxv retrospective a story teller of description have from time immemorial be considered free from nicety by attempt in nobler class of literature be must be restrained consider apology necessary for requesting reader to leap over with space of four month still before continue tale from date will be a well that must give short outline of principal event produced state in circumstance of macdermots will then be found be sorry to say that be not such a must offer much consolation to will be remembered that pat brady be commissioned by master to take ussher body to police station at carrick in fred brown gig commission promptly performed also that of restoring gig to owner after having thus completed master behest like good servant paid visit on own account to mr keegan although be late still found that active gentleman up gave tolerably accurate account of what have happened at ballycloran adding that young masther have gone off to join boy at laste be what supposed 'd be afther now a soon a keegan surprise be little abated perceived that affair must probably act a stepping stone on might walk into ballycloran even sooner than have hitherto thought to do when a one of juror at coroner inquest on next morning saw that poor larry have evidently fallen into absolute idiotcy heard that thady have in fact escaped instantly determined to take such legal step on behalf of father in law a must put property under management accordingly did proper step for proving old man to be of unsound mind must have be attended with very great expense instead of doing got made receiver over property determined to arrest larry in existing state conceived must have difficulty in doing here however found very much mistaken for nothing must induce old man to leave own room so much a allow front door to be unlocked mary brady still continued to attend day returning home to husband after sunset found very easy to manage in other particular a long a be allowed to have own way in have quite lost triumphant feeling led to boast in street of carrick after leaving inquest that have escaped from flannelly power that must never have to pay farthing for now if heard strange step fancied to be bailiff if there be slightest noise in house thought that attempt be being made to drag off by violence be miserable sight to see old man thin wan worn out sitting during cold winter by few sod of turf with door of own room ajar watching front door from morning till night to see that one opened before christmas have bed brought down into same room in order that might not be betrayed into hand of enemy in morning before be up from time inducement must prevail on to leave room for moment during time poverty be very great tenant have be served with legal notice to pay to to thady portion of rent consequently provision be very low very scarce at ballycloran in fact have not be for kindness of father john mr mckeon counsellor webb whose property be adjoining to ballycloran larry must have be starved into surrender mr went so far a to interfere with mr keegan to point out to that in humanity must stay proceeding till after thady trial keegan replied that be only acting for mr flannelly who be determined to have matter settled at once that wanted be own that have already waited too long when keegan found that larry macdermot in spite of infirmity be too wary to be caught endeavoured to bribe mary to open door to emissary to betray old man though mary be very fond of money be too honest for replied to attorney by telling that for money in bank of carrick must be one to trate ould blood way larry consequently still held out at ballycloran living on chance present of friend who sent at one time few stone of potato at pound of tea then bit of bacon few bottle of whiskey last however be confided to mary with injunction not to allow too frequently to have recourse to only comforter be left to though keegan failed to gain admission into house must not therefore put into absolute possession of estate still must do what pleased with land be not long in availing of power in january served notice on tenant unless whole arrears be paid on before end of next month must be ejected to many of who held portion of better part of land sent summary notice to quit on first of may next following notice be served by pat who assured tenant that only performed duty have now undertaken that might look after mr thady interest a a said there must be use in life in refusing to do for av did must tenant must be betther dale worse thing by mean tended to make keegan name popular on estate particularly at drumleesh where tenant be ill prepared to pay rent by small portion at time be utterly confounded at idea of having to pay up arrears in lump pat assured that although be surly sullen gave sign showed determination of having recourse to violence of openly rebelling against authority of new landlord pat however knew little of what be going on amongst now although found absolute fault with argument used for acting on mr keegan behalf still soon discovered that tenant have withdrawn confidence from that looked upon rather a servant of new tyrant than a friend to whom have be accustomed to turn when wanted little favour from old master have discontinued visit to mr mulready have for long time seen nothing of joe reynolds set who spent most of time in aughacashel at rate away from drumleesh joe reynolds have be altogether unable to account for thady sudden disappearance from aughacashel at first thought must have be taken prisoner by of police whilst roaming about in neighbourhood although ultimately heard that father john have gone together to counsellor webb still never must learn how thady have fallen into priest hand joe however did not forget that thady have done what considered good service of ridding country of ussher swore that must repay by punishing man who in estimation be robbing thady of right property have long since declared at mr mulready a be aware that if thady must come over join party keegan must not come upon estate with impunity be now determined to keep word keegan trusting to assurance of pat that tenant be quiet peaceable at length began to go among have about beginning of february once twice ridden over portion of property about five o'clock one evening in month be riding towards home along little lane skirt drumleesh bog after having seen a much of delectable neighbourhood a man must do on horseback when horse be stopped by man wrapped in very large frieze coat whose face be not concealed who asked must spake to honer about bit of land that be thinking of axing afther when man be on be put off a heard war to be done a man said laid hand on bridle keegan fearing from that something be not right put hand into coat pocket where pistol be told man to come to at carrick if wanted to say anything man however continued av honer must think too much throuble jist to come down for one moment 'd point out cabin meant keegan be now sure from man continuing to keep hand on bridle that injury to be intended be in act of drawing pistol from pocket when be knocked altogether from off horse by blow received on head with large stone thrown from other side of one of bank ran along road blow fall completely stunned when came to be lying on road man who have stopped horse be kneeling on chest man whose face be blackened be holding down two foot third whose face have also be blackened be kneeling on road beside with small axe in hand keegan courage utterly failed when saw sharp instrument in ruffian grasp began to promise largely if must let escape forgiveness money land anything everything for life of however answered before first sentence uttered be well out of mouth instrument fell on leg just above ankle with man force first blow only cut trouser boot bruised sorely for boot protected second cut flesh grated against bone in vain struggled violently with force of man struggling for life third fourth fifth descended crushing bone dividing marrow ultimately severing foot from leg when have done work left on road till passer by must have compassion on obtain for mean of conveyance to home in short time keegan fainted from loss of blood cold frost soon brought to sens got up hobbled to nearest cabin dragging after mutilated foot still attached to body by cartilage by fragment of boot trouser from thence reached home on country car racked by pain jolting of car sharp frost did not tend to assuage at time of be writing about first week in march have be entirely unable to ascertain of party by whom have be attacked men be dan kennedy joe reynolds corney dolan of joe alone be personally known to keegan be who used axe with such fell cruelty have be so completely

must again see so a to know have not feared to stop horse address rider without disguise act be originally proposed finally executed more with intent of avenging thady than with other purpose be most unfortunate thing for must have happened for in first place made magistrate government imagine that country be in disorderly state generally that be therefore necessary to follow up prosecution at assize with more than ordinary vigour in next place made keegan determined to do that must to secure thady conviction for attributed horrible mutilation to influence of macdermots other thing have also occurred during four month since thady have given up to authority have determined law officer of government to follow up ussher murderer with severity obtain if possible conviction man who have be sent to mohill in ussher place be by mean equal either in courage determination perseverance still have be necessary for to follow to certain degree in predecessor step especially a at time illicit

futility of first attempt tremendous stoning men received in neighbourhood of drumshambo burning of cogan cabin fate of predecessor totally frightened represented to head office in dublin that country be in such state that be unable with small body of men at command to carry on business with anything approaching to security thing operated much against chance of thady acquittal warmest friend must not feel that did so people in country began to say that severe example be necessary that country be in dreadful state that government must be upheld fear became ten time greater when be generally known that thady day two before catastrophe have absolutely associated with of most desperate character in country brady at first have be unwilling to divulge that knew to mr keegan for though felt hesitation in betraying old master be not desirous to hang keegan by degree got out of bribed so high that pat at last consented to come forward at trial swear to circumstance of meeting at mr mehan

teach anything when heard of landlord reducing rent improving cabin building school must prophesy to neighbour sir michael that gentry must soon begin to repent of folly when rent have reduced be not paid cabin have made comfortable be filled with ribbonmen when poor have learnt in school to disobey master landlord sir michael never contradicted must probably have become second jonas brown much more injurious because so much more extensive in interest be not for counteracting influence of counsellor webb who be in opinion diametrically opposed to mr brown mr webb be clear headed much more talented man than brother magistrate be moreover kind hearted landlord ever anxious to ameliorate condition of poor by mean greedy after money though be very opulent very economical nevertheless with high quality be hardly man most fit to do real good in very poor ignorant neighbourhood be in first place by far too fond of popularity of being favourite among peasantry in next have become so habituated to oppose jonas brown in saying doings that now did so whether be right wrong thady case have be much talked of in country rival magistrate of course held diametrically opposite opinion respecting jonas brown have declared at own table that unless young man be hanged there must be end to anything like law in country being son of landlord made ten time worse if landlord turned ribbonmen taught tenant manner of iniquity law did then interfere must be impossible to live in country for one must leave here have most praiseworthy servant of crown man who have merited thanks of whole country by fearless manner in have performed duty here said have man be murdered in cold blood by known ribbonman by one who a understood have few day before murder conspired with others to commit yet be told there be pack of people through country priest popularity hunter who be not only using best endeavour to screen murderer who absolutely justified deed by g d must understand how man holding position of gentleman must so far forget what owed to country a to dirty hand with filthy business a however absurd general opinion on politics might be a for man sister be got up story since business one knew that family have be trying to catch young man for girl have be allowed to walk with captain ussher at hour night day be doing no more than walking with when be basely murdered by brother a for jonas brown hoped trusted murderer must be hung a deserved purport of piece of after dinner eloquence be duly conveyed to counsellor webb who fully appreciated remark about popularity hunting gentleman who be dirtying hand up to time two men though differing so widely from other have still kept up show of courtesy between mr brown remark altogether put end to counsellor webb never again addressed in friendly term did not however in least relax effort on thady behalf express le strongly opinion on case told sir michael one morning in carrick after public meeting at gentry of neighbourhood have be present while many of among mr brown be standing by that have lately be giving great deal of very close attention to very distressing case of young mr macdermot thought be most melancholy heartrending case have ever known be proved beyond possibility of doubt that ussher be eloping with young man sister seemed now to be pretty certain that girl be absolutely senseless at time occurrence took place believed have changed mind got frightened what not be now known fact that be being dragged senseless in man arm when macdermot attacked be brother to stand by look on at sight a not protect sister punish miscreant who be endeavouring to dishonour be mr macdermot to turn back upon affair leave sister to fate because man who did be revenue officer let bring matter home to ourselves sir michael continued suppose saw that gay young captain jem boyle hurrying through demesne at knockadrum with one of own fair flock in arm violently carrying off must not only knock down if must catch also set people after begging to do same of course must what more have young man done unfortunately struck too hard that although may deplore circumstance show criminality on part only strong indignation very properly felt a to cock bull story of being ribbonman man of sense must entertain appears that few night before occurrence went to tenant wedding unfortunately took drop too much punch have be many good man case before then got among lot of men who be uttering vague nonsensical threat against different person whom disliked one hear say that ussher be threatened be told by far more creditable witness that be keegan attorney whose name be mentioned appears that when drunk promised to join men in drinking party promise of course never thought of keeping after be sober yet there be who be cruel enough to say wo say harsh enough to believe for ca believe that when attacked ussher in sister defence macdermot be only carrying into execution premeditated plan of murdering premeditated indeed when be plain to one that be by merest accident that happened to be in avenue at time people might just a well say that be who cut off attorney foot other day though be in gaol at time must say continued counsellor must poor young man fall victim to false evidence be aware private malice wretchedly vindictive feeling will supply then basest murder will really have be committed ever disgraced county envy state of mind of gentleman who can look forward with feeling of satisfaction to prospect of poor youth being hanged for protecting sister merely because seducer be in habit of intimacy with family mr brown left meeting taking immediate notice of counsellor philippic be not however because did not comprehend latter part of that meant to overlook sir michael be much distressed in making up mind finally on subject be reported however soon after meeting above alluded to that have stated to of more immediate friend admirer that considered highly discreditable might say disgraceful for of more respectable class to give countenance to illegal meeting be afraid be too general through country that there be too much reason to fear that unfortunate man in prison have be guilty in doing so that there must be doubt that one be justified might add only performed bounden duty in protecting female of family from injury violence now tony mckeon be tenant of sir michael of counsellor also held land from other landlord have connexion whatever with mr brown be not at sort of tenant that jonas liked for though always punctually paid rent to day usually chose to have everything own way must take land except at fair rent on long lease mr webb however be chief friend principal ally in country sir michael be altogether too grand for seeing that tony have idea of being humble dependent mr webb must occasionally come dine with often asked in return mr webb too be civil to wife girl always lent dublin pattern for frill frock other frippery seldom drove into drumsna without calling consequence be that counsellor be man after tony own heart though be of different religion have generally speaking same political feeling opinion same philanthropical principle same popular prejudice after few year intimacy in other neighbourhood mr webb well knew where to find powerful recruit for service in might wish to enlist one tony declared that if one spoke ill of feemy character must make personal with that be ready willing moreover determined to quarrel with one who dared to apply opprobrious name of murderer to thady have even be heard on one two occasion to stand up for larry to declare that although might be little light headed so be still deal better than muddy minded blackguard at carrick who have driven to present state for long time feemy have be very ill after christmas have apparently got little stronger must sit up in bed room for few hour in day still must talk to one mr mckeon endeavoured more than once to lead to subject knew must be nearest heart thinking that if must be got to speak of must be relieved in vain in vain tried to interest in brother fate in vain tried to make understand that thady safety that acquittal must in great degree depend on being able to prove at trial at time when occurrence took place be insensible shuddered violently at idea of being again questioned declared with sob that must die if be again dragged to horrid place when mr mckeon asked if must not make struggle to save brother life remained mute be evident that be for lover that be still grieving that be not danger ignominy of thady position that afflicted mr mckeon however conceived to be duty to persevere with at last told how wrong be of to give way to grief be in first stage respected feemy answered only with tear on next morning told that have determined to return to ballycloran a thought must be better there at home with father to however mr mckeon must not consent feemy be told that doctor have forbidden to be moved be therefore obliged to remain satisfied for present a have mean of escaping from drumsna soon became more sullen than ever at last almost refused to speak to one thing went on in way till about middle of march feemy constantly requested to be allowed to go home request be a constantly refused when different circumstance acting together gave rise to dreadful suspicion in mr mckeon mind began to fear that ussher before death have accomplished poor girl ruin that be now in family way for few day be determined to reject idea endeavoured to make believe that be mistaken more close observation be more certain became that suspicion be well founded be much distressed a to what must do first most natural feeling be of anger against feemy of dismay at situation into own husband good nature have brought daughter made up mind that feemy must at once have wish return to ballycloran then might be mistaken even if be too true how must turn poor girl weak ill miserable out of house send to empty unprovided barrack inhabited by infirm idiotical old man where must receive none of attention situation so much required communicated suspicion to doctor after few day observation told that there be too much reason to fear that case be a supposed however strongly advised to speak to miss macdermot on subject did at last most tenderly with greatest gentleness still imploring feemy to tell truth feemy at first must not speak in reply threw on bed sobbing most violently fell from one fit into till mr mckeon be afraid that must choke with violence of emotion at last however declared that accusation brought against be untrue protested on most solemn word honour that be not case ended by saying how thankful be to mr mckeon for kindness protection that must now beg to allow to return to

instantly with stern look know so well how to assume turn out of court bid make way for honest men send home disgraced for ever to sorrowing family doe do so no indeed pick teeth while mr allewinde

warmth rise to subject will not follow through whole of long narrative with great practised perspicuity in clearest language laid before jury for already know fact have to detail first of described death of ussher then stated that must prove that prisoner have killed having informed jury doubtless prisoner sister be in act of eloping with deceased when met death launched out into powerful description of present dreadful state of country told jury that be in power to prove to that prisoner be one of illegal society who have often threatened ussher that have day two previous to affray met sworn portion of own tenant for purpose of planning murder went on to tell jury that be not to allow to be deceived by idea that murder must not have be premeditated because there existed presumption that prisoner be not aware of ussher expected presence in avenue for that fact of murder having be talked over deliberately then executed afforded strongest evidence that prisoner be at time lying in wait for deceased through servant from other mean have made cognisant of projected elopement then preparatory to examining witness concluded in following word gentleman of jury be probably aware that prisoner be from rank in life to greatest number of yourselves belong can not see that fact of being so greatly increase magnitude of presumed crime far be from to urge on account to come to conviction must evidence prove in way deficient do implore if value peace of country comfort of hearth safety of house protection of property not to allow yourselves to be led away by feeling of false sympathy to be improperly actuated by idea that deed be done in legitimate defence of prisoner sister if evidence prove that such be case do implore to divest yourselves of such preconceived notion did evidence merely go to show that mr be killed by brother whilst eloping with sister must doubtless be fair that circumstance must be taken into consideration when will have heard proved that death of unfortunate man be deliberately talked over canvassed decided on by very man by whom be executed will only fall into willow device by prisoner have endeavoured to deceive did not clearly perceive that have merely used fact of sister elopement a favourable opportunity for completion of project gentleman will now proceed to call different witness satisfied that when will have heard evidence will have difficulty in coming to verdict in case first witness called be dr blake stated that have examined body day after ussher have met death that have doubt death have be occasioned by two heavy blow one of have fractured skull immediately over temple be of quite sufficient to cause instantaneous death that must presume blow to have be inflicted with heavy blunt

have be in replying to mr allewinde at last be sent off table next witness called be mcgovery who have be summoned on behalf of prosecution be asked whether have not suspected that foul play be intended against ussher stated in what manner have in first place cautioned ussher then that have told same thing to father john that after overhearing portion of conversation at mr mehan have gone to father cullen for purpose of informing that feared there be conspiracy against mr keegan little however must be learnt from for owned that have substantial ground for suspicion in first case that have chiefly be led to fear attack upon ussher from knowing unpopularity bad character of many of guest expected at wedding mr o'laugher tried to make say that conversation at mr mehan have be confined to keegan threat have heard uttered against mcgovery must not say a much a stated positively that have never heard ussher name mentioned that during considerable portion of evening have be entirely unable to hear word that men said declared however positively that thady be drunk when left room that appeared to that thady have taken very little part in conversation before be drunk when witness went off table mr allewinde declared that case for prosecution be finished stating at same time that abstained from feeling of delicacy respect from putting prisoner sister into witness box that must trouble with question unless be placed there by counsel for defence mr obealley then rose to address jury on behalf of prisoner spoke to following effect gentleman of jury now becomes duty to address to such word a may best suit to point out to weakness of evidence against prisoner to explain to different object have in lengthened cross examination of witness to inform what intend to prove on behalf of prisoner from further witness in fact to put case before in light point of view differing a widely a can make do from in learned friend have presented to be aware be general duty constant object of counsel endeavouring to obtain verdict of acquittal from jury be duty in long practice have made familiar if not skilful never undertook that duty with same assurance of facility a now feel after having heard evidence have be brought forward on prosecution knew beforehand a surely a one can trust to human knowledge that evidence must fail knowing acute legal ability of learned friend extraordinary avidity exists among large class of men for verdict against prisoner in case remembering say thing did not expect total break down such exposure of weakness a have be just made before be object merely to rescue prisoner from ignominious death have be mere duty on occasion to obtain acquittal must feel hesitation in requesting lordship at once to send case before with such remark a evidence must call forth from must consider be only wasting time of court in pointing out to insufficiency of evidence in of must perceive that nothing be proved against prisoner have be employed with object must own to that so great be own personal anxiety so terrible so undeserved present position of unfortunate young man so essentially necessary be for future happiness must effect present object must own to say for reason from time when first found standing in crowded court to address jury up to present moment have never felt so little self confidence experienced so total prostration of assurance be lawyer first requisite a do at present have said object in addressing be not merely that of obtaining acquittal said so because mere acquittal will serve unfortunate young man little unless can walk out of court with verdict a damning a may be to others will altogether cleanse name from stain of guilt in matter unless can not only save neck from halter also entirely clear character from gross charge have be brought against must a lief go back to cell whence have come a return to father house acquitted by voice of law condemned by of opinion on account be debarred from many of usual resource of counsel pleading for prisoner be forbidden to make use of legal point in favour be forbidden to effect escape by numerous weak point in enemy plan of attack be desired to meet face to face in open field to fight under banner that of truth not to strike adversary below belt be aware that be line of conduct a rare a be difficult in criminal court when advocate have to contend for client against law where possible mean of success legal ingenuity can devise be taken in prosecution where be accustomed to hear legal technicality used in defence have not received instruction of so peculiar nature must point out to jury that proof have be given direct circumstantial that prisoner be person by whose hand ussher fell instead of doing so be to declare that did a be supposed to have done kill deceased in avenue of ballycloran by striking twice with stick be to justify deed disprove charge of having entered into conspiracy to murder man whom did kill prisoner have be told be probably aware be above rank of men whom be mostly accustomed to see placed in dock be only son of gentleman living on own small estate have for year past acted a father sole agent manager must now tell few particular respecting that estate though of course can not receive a evidence what tell still course will be necessary a will thereby be enabled to explain to object in obtaining answer to certain question have asked will ask answer to will take a evidence in time of prisoner house be built on estate by mr flannelly of town price of building not having be paid man builder obtained mortgage on estate for amount of debt be still due though house a have heard be falling to ground have so be increased by interest not paid up by legal charge that have completely embarrassed present proprietor who be even now unable to leave house for fear of arrest mr keegan whose name have often come before in evidence who by by will be examined be son in law of mr flannelly owns a have doubt will be able to prove to whole interest in estate of ballycloran arising from mortgage prisoner time since ceased to be boy have be employed in futile endeavour to satisfy legal claim of man will prove to by most undoubtable evidence that industry in object have be unceasing that conduct a son brother have be beyond praise have failed time have be against legal cost have so swelled legal interest a to consume whole rent rent have be unable to collect life have be one manful struggle against poverty mr keegan must not wish worst foe two more inveterate enemy few day before ussher death now be going to confine to be in position to prove mr keegan called on macdermots for purpose of proposing certain term for adjustment of debt be neither more le than that must have whole estate paying small weekly stipend for life to prisoner father prisoner be willing to agree providing provision must be made for sister father indignantly spurned offer turned mr keegan out of house in very gentle manner prisoner followed into avenue still wishing to come to arrangement attorney be so enraged at conduct of father that instead of listening to son began abusing whole family a have heard applied most shameful epithet to sister with tongue of man can defile name of woman afterwards struck prisoner who be unarmed heavily with stick have hesitation in telling that quarrel in blame appears to have be attributable to young man placed in dock brady confidential servant of prisoner saw overheard what took place at interview a have told afterwards a will not deny though will not confess incited master during period of natural irritation to go down to wedding party to meet number of tenant who must be willing to assist in revenging against enemy keegan attorney if must assist against enemy ussher revenue officer here client made one false step only one can trace to committed that folly from bitter foe have thought to ruin irritated by blow ear still ringing with infamous name applied to loved sister full of father wrong own hard condition consented to meet men whose object knew be illegal though what plan be be entirely ignorant with reference to what took place at wedding have in first place to remark that from character of man brady must confidently call upon to reject word of evidence will presently show in what respect why be bound to do so in present instance be satisfied to tell that client did attend that meeting mind be illegal meeting be not secret door be not locked even closed be party of men met at wedding of one of own station woman to be married be sister of prisoner servant be natural that must be present directs positively to tell that did attend that meeting though also tell with confidence that committed crime in doing so lordship will corroborate what tell be however part of plan organised against prisoner that must be induced to commit illegal act be a have heard brought when drunk to promise that must go down to mr mulready to take upon illegal oath obligation on following day be invited by same brady to come on certain evening macdermot be no longer drunk be no longer infuriated by gross outrage have received what did do then did go to mr mulready to settle particular of murder be said to have premeditated did join outlaw of whom be represented to have be leader did even send encouraging message word of fellowship even by testimony of man now so anxious to hang benefactor man who by own showing be at same time in pay of prisoner of enemy keegan indignantly repudiated idea at once informed wretch equally traitor to confederate to master that must have nothing in common with scheme although threatened with vengeance of party with authority of magistrate steadily refused even to enter house in be accustomed to assemble why from what can learn of young man of daily habit conceive that there be one of yourselves who must not be a likely to join illegal society a must patient under poverty industrious under accumulated suffering have led life must not have disgraced priest have be ever found sincere in thought moral in conduct most unselfish in action be man to join set of senseless rioter furious at imprisonment of relative anxious only to protect illicit still be empty praise that what have said of prisoner be more than be due will be proved to by evidence defy to doubt well did not go to mr mulready did go to friend priest mr magrath not a penitent to confessor a friend to friend told exactly what have passed lamented indiscretion declared determination never to put in way of repeating up to time chief object have be to show to enmity existing between keegan prisoner object former have in view in ruining prisoner that brady be paid spy employed to entrap will now come to deed will afterwards refer to what absolutely did take place at meeting at wedding have told that young macdermot did kill deceased struck with stick have be shown to in court a be rising from blow struck again doubt medical witness be right in opinion that second blow occasioned instant death be however aware that circumstance might exist must justify man in taking life of if man be violently to attack be to strike on head kill must be justified if be to kill man in fray in fair defence of third party must be justified if be to kill man by blow in quarrel of moment must not be guilty of murder can fancy case in death however much may be lamented can lay le of murderer stain upon hand inflicts than one in brother interferes to rescue sister from violent grasp of seducer such be precisely case in instance now before learned friend on other side have truly told that miss prisoner sister have consented to elope with captain ussher on evening on man be killed have learnt from evidence have reason to doubt that have prepared to do so in fact can not doubt that left house of ballycloran for purpose have be proved there be circumstance beyond on be essentially necessary that must have evidence evidence can only be given by young lady will therefore have to bring before when learned friend told that must not call upon question unless placed in chair by forgot usual candour assumed to credit for humanity to have title have nothing to learn from a will prove to if attempt to cross examine moreover be a fully aware a be that prisoner must rely on alone for anything like true account of affray brother sister be only living witness of scene have within high consciousness of innocence rectitude of intention have enabled to bear suffering imprisonment misery of position with fortitude not only admire envy that can avail nothing with from sister lip must hear only account can receive if find that have be unable to recall dreadful circumstance of night fact will bear out in history of occurrence be now going to give mr obealley then gave a exact account of occurrence a have be able to collect from thady from feemy evidence before coroner from such word a mr mckeon have be able to extract from feemy on subject then continued when prisoner struck ussher have come to knowledge of what burden be man be dragging solely from word man have used miss macdermot be lying senseless in arm supporting by waist be forcing down avenue word used be 'this be damned nonsense must come now then brother perceived fate to man be not alluring forcing sister at moment be only one in prisoner have to judge of circumstance of case be not in act of eloping willingly have seen brother form have refused be unable to rise from timber on be seated be forced from thence by man whose death protects from language in name must otherwise be mentioned fainted in arm only came to sens to find lover dead brother standing beside red with blood yes have avenged have punished ruffian for barbarity towards saved sister from ignominy to mr frederick brown told with so much flippancy that have be doomed if be young man conduct be there anything in that can even blame of must have done otherwise of will tell that in avenging wrong of sister of daughter must pause to measure weight of stick number of blow fancy of that see form of love best in rough grasp of violent seducer endeavour to bring home to yourselves feeling to sight must give rise within then if can find young man guilty of murder because heart be warm to feel sister wrong hand be strong to avenge have be told that a prisoner have met certain person for purpose of entering into conspiracy of murdering ussher that fact must be proved to be bound to consider that coming across ussher be not accidental that manner in attacked that man whilst carrying off sister be part of preconcerted plan first of deny that credible evidence evidence worthy of slightest belief have be brought before to induce to suppose that prisoner have even joined such conspiracy instead of have strong circumstantial evidence that have never done so have most of doubt heard on various occasion from different learned judge seated on bench that crown approver evidence be to be taken with greatest caution only to be believed in detail when corroborated by other evidence by circumstance now man brady on whose sole evidence be desired to convict prisoner have shown approver of very worst description be aware that be prisoner servant that be now mr keegan that there have be long enmity between men that former have be oppressed debtor latter most oppressive creditor mr keegan spirit towards prisoner family may learn from scandalous unwarrantable language have be proved to to have be used by towards mr keegan acerbity have be increased by mutilation have undergone conceives owes to interference with ballycloran property man witness brady have a have heard constantly be talking over trial attorney seems have repeatedly expressed to servant ardent wish that prisoner might be hung be expressed eager desire then new servant long used spy come forward boldly to swear away prisoner life why must be ridiculing to suppose must believe then look at man character be constant attendant at scene of villany into vainly endeavoured to seduce prisoner at mr mulready be plain enough that ussher death be constant theme of discourse at haunt be plain enough that project did exist there to accomplish murder be not plain enough that man be one of conspirator one of murderer must have be admitted to counsel to dangerous secret unless have be active participator in plan must have taken in presence solemn oath to put unfortunate revenue officer under sod unless have joined in oath of course must not be man whom expect to believe with such confidence that on unsupported evidence must condemn prisoner what have said to respecting respectable witness not le respectable master will perhaps be made somewhat plainer to when will have heard evidence hope to extract from latter now a to meeting at mr mehan even be to believe brady maintain that nothing have be proved against prisoner brady state that at mr mulready certain men swore together that at certain period captain ussher must be under sod phrase brings to mind of one conviction that meant to express murder man must not be under sod unless be dead at wedding when young macdermot be present even by showing of brady men be afraid to use such phrase implored landlord assistance to help to rid country of to frighten off to make place too hot to hold a told that wretched reptile whilst in chair must have more dared to propose scheme of murder to young macdermot even in drunkenness than must have to to now a to probability of prisoner having be aware of sister project for eloping having made use of opportunity for safe execution of scheme of murder perhaps be most material point of for be there good ground to suppose that knew that elopement be to take place that took precautionary step to prevent that having previous knowledge rushed out at time killed man must be very far from telling that be perfectly justified a do now must positively maintain that can not come to conclusion have to degree be proved to will be so more clearly that prisoner have along shown averse to intimacy existed between ussher sister be therefore to be presumed that of took mean in power to prevent prisoner from learning intention there be reason to suppose be successful two person appear to have be told a service be required of whom have be examined before servant girl mr frederick brown former have sworn that mentioned to one there be reason to disbelieve latter proved not so trustworthy seems that with foolish flippancy distinguishes told friend secret to other friend of a good joke must remember that mr brown friend be not prisoner friend that rather be in such different circle that what be said in one must be very little likely to find way into other above to whom mr brown friend communicated must think that brother be last person who must be told of again have prisoner known projected elopement intended to make use of for perpetration of preconcerted murder must must have acted a did must have waited for such unexpected accident a sister fainting before drew near to victim sister have walked down avenue after waiting time in road returned sat down upon fallen tree be whilst so seated that heard brother open hall door have a expected met lover at hour appointed must have be far beyond prisoner reach before have left house must have allowed to be case have be intention to take advantage of opportunity be absurd to argue on point be unnecessary almost to call attention to thing must so manifestly present to whole of case have received additional weight importance from official authority have be considered worthy of especial government interference learned friend have come express from metropolis for purpose of conducting rumour have be spread abroad that most conclusive evidence must be produced to prove that prisoner from better order of society have joined headed one of illegal body of men whose existence be supposed to be cause of trouble of distracted country that have in unison with scheme committed foul deliberate murder learned friend have not hesitated to tell that be essentially necessary to use utmost extent of legal severity that end may be put to agrarian outrage be now becoming so frightfully prevalent in country have anything be proved to warrant official zeal government interference nothing not one iota still paraphernalia of office more than ordinary anxiety to obtain verdict may have effect upon mind most prejudicial to client have doubt a to actual verdict have doubt that will nay know that must acquit that young man of murder beseech to remember though in indictment have be charged with murder only have be by servant of government by learned friend on other side accused of other grievous crime implore by verdict to purge character of stain have be so unjustly attached to if find on examination of evidence cause to suppose that have be participator in council of such society beseech to do that justice can now only be done by strong expression of unanimous assurance of absolute innocence beseech to reject from mind pre conceived opinion so injurious to prisoner with present unfortunate state of country may so naturally have influenced to remember that be duty a juror to confine to individual case before that doctrine laid down by learned friend that must make example in one case for sake of prevention of crime in others be most unconstitutional must imply that whilst solemn oath have taken be still vibrating in ear object must be far wide from for have be assembled that of making fair true trial between sovereign prisoner will now call few witness then leave case with confidence in hand chapter xxxi last witness when mr obealley have finished address to jury be past seven o'clock judge suggested that a must be evidently impracticable to finish case night so a to release jury might a well at point adjourn till morrow to mr allewinde readily assented mr obealley declared that though be most unwilling to detain lordship court at late hour must request permission to be allowed to examine one of witness a otherwise caution in having have ordered out of court must have be in vain be most essential said that examination of mr keegan must take place before man must have opportunity of conversing with servant brady whereupon judge consented to hearing keegan evidence that evening forthwith name of hyacinth keegan be called out in loud voice by crier be repeated by policeman in court till stranger to proceeding must have thought that hyacinth keegan society be one thing desirable in carrick on shannon must be drawing trial out to weary length to give whole of evidence mr obealley question be such a attorney found almost impossible to answer be asked in first place whether at present received rent from ballycloran then whether received on own behalf latter denied when told that if denied fact mr flannelly must be brought forward to prove at last owned that mr flannelly have promised to make over property to then denied that conversation have passed between brady a to nature of evidence latter be to give at trial that have expressed anxiety on occasion that verdict might be given against prisoner confessed that might in conversation have attributed loss of foot to influence of prisoner must not remember that have ever said that macdermot must pay for with life in answering different question put to hesitated blundered so much stammered so often spoke so low that one in court be convinced that be perjuring still persisted in denying everything only good effect mr obealley must get from evidence be that master frequently contradicted what have be said by servant then brady have shown so much confidence self assurance in reply keegan so much hesitation confusion that be much more probable that jury must believe former than latter if so keegan contradicting statement made by brady must not serve to invalidate material evidence given by man when mr keegan came down from chair court broke up for night jury be informed that sheriff must afford accommodation in power with long face be marched away to durance vile court during trial have be so densely crowded again became desolate silent baron hamilton with brother kilpatrick retired to dinner have well earned coffee room at hotel again became crammed with hungry guest clamorous for food evening be passed in speculation a to what must be verdict in case to have be listening in barrister mess room feud of day be forgotten most jovial party be assembled a bottle of claret succeeded other fresh anecdote be told innumerable pun be made mr allewinde be quite great forensic dignity be laid aside chatted to junior with most condescending familiarity mr o'laugher became originator of incessant peal of laughter have taken place during day turned into food for merriment not for one moment did hold tongue once did say foolish thing be pet of barroom connaught bar be famous for mr o'laugher knew be proud of of of assembled there one seemed to have memory of sadness of scene that have day witnessed how must rather how miserable must be barrister life be to be affected by misery be so constantly obliged to witness in criminal court on occasion however anxiety mr obealley have expressed when addressing jury have not be feigned doubt felt a to fate of client lay heavy on be aware that have failed in shaking brady testimony feared that in spite of have done to prove depravity of man character jury must be too much inclined to believe have be decided that feemy be not to be brought into carrick from drumsna till such time a mr obealley sent out word that must be required when found how late be before began speech have told father john in court that must not be wanted on day have therefore be left tranquilly at mr mckeon who have fetched to own house from ballycloran on morning of trial when larry macdermot saw car at door in feemy be to go away be dreadfully wrath first of declared that daughter must not be taken away to mr keegan that own son have deserted tried to sell estate now meant to rob of daughter wept like child when be told that unless went of own accord house must be broken open must be taken away by force be in vain that mary mcgovery endeavoured to make understand feemy presence be necessary in carrick that have to appear a witness at brother trial whenever thady trial be spoken of mary by continually recurring to subject have made old man at last comprehend that son be to be tried whenever be spoken of now merely expressed approbation wish that thady might be punished for making friend with reptile a keegan for deserting father planning to cheat out of house property mary took great pain to set right bellowed into ear a if be deaf instead of stupid twenty time day that thady be to be tried for ussher death larry must be got to remember that ussher be dead must continually ask daughter when lover be coming back to live with defend property against machination of keegan brother thursday feemy remained at drumsna moment expecting that must be immediately called in to go to carrick sat whole day in drawing room close by fire with friend cloak around without speaking to one girl have come spoken kindly to when first arrived mother have told that have better not attempt to converse with mr mckeon sat with whole day spoke to gentle word now again purposely abstained from troubling made allusion to subject on have thought so much on own suspicion have be corroborated by mary information necessary a be that poor girl must tell one be not time to press there sat feemy ah how different from girl described in opening of tale cheek be pale wan flesh have gone yellow skin fell in from cheekbone to mouth giving almost ghastly appearance eye appeared larger than ever be quenched with weeping dull with grief hair be drawn back carelessly behind ear lip be thin bloodless two three time during day mr mckeon have given half glass of wine have drank on being told to do so have once tried to eat bit of bread have soon put down again for seemed to choke about five o'clock mr mckeon learnt that feemy must not be called for day poor girl be then induced to go to bed nothing must persuade to allow one to assist be wonderful how must have undressed dressed next morning seemed so weak powerless tony father john got home to dinner about eight be in good spirit for mr obealley speech have be so convincing to that conceived must not be equally so to jury forgot that have previously assured of thady evidence that therefore be prepared to believe word said on behalf that must by mean be case with jury be very sanguine tony insisted that counsellor obealley health must be drunk with honour on morning went early into town have obtained from clerk of peace permission to make use of small room within court here feemy mr mckeon be to remain undisturbed till former be called for then lady be to bring into court even undertook to go upon table with repeat to jury if must be allowed to do so evidence be sure feemy must not be able to give in voice loud enough to be heard by one when car stopped at court house in carrick on shannon be found absolutely necessary to carry into room for have apparently lost power of action cried sobbed now gazed listlessly before with eye fixed upon vacancy a two strong men lifted from car supported between by arm up step into court house will never do said tony to friend after leaving in room will never do will never be able to say word on table be only cruelty father john bringing here obealley say must come said father john say if can take oath speak three four word to mr mckeon will do will never do will never be able to take oath will have to be carried on table when there will faint poor thady if be acquitted first thing will have to learn will be disgrace must tell of father john one else can poor fellow will be worse to than brought to must save if can tell said tony will never speak word upon table 'd better tell obealley at once 't must be only cruelty to put there accordingly went to obealley who be now in court told that thought feemy macdermot must not be safely brought there however still declared that be imperative for brother safety that must appear even if be utterly impossible to get to speak that a have be person in fault have have have suffering cruelty must be to if be not brought forward father john returned to private room tried to make speak kneeled down before again began explaining to purpose for be there implored to exert to save brother once twice opened mouth a if speaking uttered sound understood however what priest said to for gently pressed hand when took hold of hers nodded head to when begged to exert in meantime mr obealley be continuing examination of witness first who appeared on second morning of trial be corney dolan who unfortunately came prepared to swear anything thought might benefit prisoner said remembered evening of wedding remembered conversation at prisoner have be present that be quite sure ussher name be mentioned at rate that if mentioned be not accompanied by threat that only plan of violence alluded to during evening be that one two of boy said that must duck keegan in bog hole if came to receive rent at ballycloran be very well a long a question be put to by mr obealley be forced to tell somewhat different tale when examined by mr allewinde by whom be made to own that there have be project abroad for murdering ussher though still maintained that none of have be alluded to by party at mr mehan be also made to give so bad character that be more than probable that jury must not believe word have said father john be next be only called on to prove thady have be intoxicated when left party at mr mehan to speak a to character with tear in eye corroborated that barrister have said in speech in praise of poor young friend described a honest industrious manly patient under own wrong unable to endure quietly inflicted on family tony mckeon be next with exception of feemy last too have only to speak a to character just a father john have be getting into chair policeman have come into court whispered to doctor blake who be sitting in one of lower bench doctor immediately got up from seat went away with man father john have not observed occurrence when be leaving table a tony be getting up latter whispered to blake have be called out just look to feemy at same moment mr obealley said out aloud mr magrath if might trouble so far must have kindness to bring miss macdermot into court anticipate that will have much delay with mr mckeon evidence father john immediately hurried into room where mr mckeon have be left with charge heart trembled within a remembered death like look poor girl have when left hour since reflected that be too probably to aid that doctor blake have be called so be when entered room round door of lot of frieze coat have crowded be kept shut found feemy on ground with head supported on mr mckeon lap blake kneeling beside endeavouring to pour something into mouth there be woman standing in room apothecary whom doctor have sent for father john be soon made to understand medical skill must avail little that aid feemy must now receive from fellow creature be to come from to describe scene immediately followed must be to treat so sacred subject much too lightly priest however found that life reason be extinct acknowledged symbol of salvation in trusted received absolution from sin church considers necessary who can say how deeply have repented of misdeed during many hour of silent agony have endured arm be stretched out from body hand be clasped tightly in of mr mckeon moment before drew final breath felt tried to return pressure made one great struggle to speak myles be single word lip have strength to form with last effort poor feemy died in meantime mckeon have given evidence in court have left table mr allewinde having declined to cross examine father john there be then pause of little duration in court during mr obealley addressing judge said that miss macdermot witness now about to be brought forward be unfortunately in very weak state of health so much so have evidence not be essential to brother must be most unwilling to have troubled then apologised for delay asked for obtained permission for mr mckeon to be on table repeat answer of witness to jury judge merely premising that must be necessary that lady must be sworn to repeat true answer there be still further delay after mr obealley have sat down mr mckeon got up to go help to bring into court just in doorway met man who whispered to did not return however hurried on to room where have left wife reached just a breath left poor girl body in spite of distress be apparent to that truth must be immediately made known in court mr mckeon be leaving for purpose of telling mr obealley when father john laid hand upon friend shoulder said poor thady will break heart to hear must be kept from heaven only know what be best must hear at last go mckeon tell obealley will know what be best to do mckeon returned into court making way with difficulty close up to barrister whispered in ear that witness be more mr obealley who have be standing instantly sat down a if appalled by suddenness of event one in court who have seen mckeon face a entered felt aware that something have happened to feemy judge leaned forward over desk addressing particularly to mr obealley said be miss macdermot too unwell mr obealley to be brought into court lord said again rising from seat have already gone before judgment seat macdermot turned round to prisoner in dock have borne sorrow hitherto like man must try bear also sister be dead have fallen first victim god forbid that must be sacrificed lord cause be now done there be now living witness prisoner of scene described to case must go to jury a be during time of whole trial thady have stood upright at bar with elbow leaning on wooden rail face resting on arm have almost constantly kept eye upon speaker occasionally turning gaze to place where father john have sat during trial to see that have not deserted during speech mr obealley have made on behalf have brightened up looked more cheerful than have done for many month when be finished have felt more sanguine a to acquittal than have done at time since have first given up a prisoner during short pause occurred in court immediately after mckeon left table have once twice looked round to learn if feemy be coming though high woodwork of dock must effectually prevent from seeing till be at table will be remembered that feemy extreme illness have never be made known to brother much le lamentable situation father john have told that be unwell have not thought necessary to frighten at present time by letting know how very ill be doctor departure from court did not notice at father john be sent for to sister in manner caused apprehension even when mckeon went out to see whether be coming never occurred to thady that delay in sister appearance be occasioned by ill health be only when saw sit down after hearing whispered tidings from mckeon that felt alarmed when barrister told judge that witness have gone before judgment seat be still evident from face that did not perfectly comprehend what have happened there be misunderstanding language in tidings be immediately afterwards communicated to seemed to make one attempt a if to say something feeling of situation paraphernalia of court awed into silence sank down within dock to hide sorrow from crowd be gazing at there be considerable delay in court after a though party concerned felt unwilling to commence business after shock feemy death have occasioned judge sat back in chair silent abstracted a if valuable a must know own public time to be felt unable to call on one to proceed with case immediately after so sad event at last mr allewinde rose said that one must regret more than dreadfully tragical manner in prisoner have lost benefit of evidence be expected sister must have be able to give on behalf that conceived that must be anything mercy to prisoner to delay proceeding in present stage on account of what have happened moreover considered that doing so must be illegal must suggest to judge to learned friend on other side to jury whether legal available use must be made of evidence have be given by prisoner sister before coroner however mr obealley declined alleging that question put to miss macdermot by coroner be merely intended to elicit evidence that captain ussher have be killed by brother that answer then gave be of course not such a must be favourable to prisoner be such a must prove fact mr obealley have intended to prove mr obealley finished by stating that a far a be concerned case be ready to be submitted by lordship to jury mr allewinde however still have right of reply be not man to allow chance circumstance to prevent making use of accordingly again got up to address jury told that what have to say must not keep long considering that be lawyer barrister kept word with tolerable fidelity remarked that evidence of brady have in degree be shaken that subject in keegan have be examined have have reference to case that be quite plain that dolan have come forward to swear to anything thought might tend to prisoner acquittal made allusion to father john tony mckeon then ended by saying that unexpected melancholy death of miss macdermot be occurrence must not fill breast of one present with most profound sympathy for prisoner that must abstain from saying word might be unnecessarily disagreeable painful to feeling of one that jury must feel that prisoner must lose nothing from loss of evidence of course continued in point of law be bound to look on case a if miss macdermot have died at same moment with betrothed husband for be aware that can not allow anything learned friend have told to be taken into consideration by in finding verdict will lessen pain more le must suffer in sad case to reflect what strong ground have for supposing that sister have lived must have proved nothing favourable to brother for have be able to do so must have done when examined before coroner will now trouble further lordship in submitting case to will give doubtless necessary caution against allowing excited feeling to have influence over verdict to will come mr allewinde then sat down after lapse of one two minute judge turned to jury spoke charge to upon question went deliberately through whole evidence dwelt upon various minor point in prisoner favour told that prisoner must not be considered a guilty of murder if there be ground to believe that have committed act whilst deceased be forcibly carrying off sister that if believed that prisoner have never before premeditated death of man killed must not be considered to have be guilty of crime for be now tried then went at length into point showed jury that evidence have be brought up to prove that girl be in senseless state when ussher be attacked that for anything have heard proved might have be walking quietly with then went into evidence given by brady stated a own opinion that man be in main to be believed argued that whole evidence on direct cross examination have be given in manner seemed to to show unwillingness to give more information than must possibly help on side still with determination not to forswear at same time told that be question on juror must form own opinion in fact that be to judge of value credibility of evidence that be summoned be also said for to decide whether death of revenue officer be premeditated by party at mr mehan when talked of ridding country of passed very slightly over remaining evidence merely saying that be case in character must not weigh with a if prisoner be guilty former apparent good character only aggravated sin then concluded by telling juror that be bound by solemn oath to allow nothing to interfere with truth of verdict that must deplore untimely death of young woman who be to have appeared before sympathise with brother for loss of sister that misfortune in respect must not lighten guilt if be guilty diminish sacredness of duty juror owed to country when judge have finished jury retired to consider verdict other business of assize be proceeded with a if nothing peculiar have happened to check regular routine duty of court chapter xxxii verdict be not very late in day when jury retired be generally thought that must come to verdict in time to escape being immured for second night did not immediately after hearing judge charge father john mckeon webb agreed among that be absolutely necessary that old macdermot must be acquainted with daughter death who be to take upon sad errand father john have for last few day be so harassed so worn down by anxiety be now so depressed by a conceived unfavourable tone of judge charge that looked like ghost of yet duty of seeing old macdermot must fall on one neither webb mckeon knew way of old man be more than probable that of must be admitted into house father john therefore put on car hurried off to ballycloran making friend promise that must wait in carrick for till return father john soon found in presence of larry must with difficulty find word to tell of bereavement old man be seated on bed always slept now in parlour have leg thrust into tattered pair of breech have worn out slipper on foot old ragged coat into have be unable unwilling to thrust arm

seated on bed have not be made since rose from have pipe in mouth glass of grog in hand smell of room be most offensive seemed from dreadfully close atmosphere that window have be opened in for week past mary mcgovery followed priest step into room running through numerous apology a to state in old man be found assuring that macdermot be so stupid so obstinate that be impossible to get to do to understand anything forthwith took hold of shoulder began shaking scolding bawling into ear till poor idiot shook in grasp father john at last succeeded in rescuing from hand seating in chair immediately opposite to began sad tale told by degree that daughter have be taken very ill that have got worse worse doctor blake have be sent for be found to be in imminent danger have effect on larry kept on continually thanking father john for friendly visit saying how kind be of to come sit with old man like how hard be to be shut up alone with such d d old jade a mary then began telling father john history of ill treatment cruelty received from to do mary justice be in main false for excepting that shook bawled to by way of rousing dormant intellect have always endeavoured to be a kind to a nature of disposition must allow begged of father john to tell when ussher feemy must come back to take care of asked if feemy have gone away to marry lover complained that be cruel in own dear girl not to let old father be present at wedding at last priest saw be good trying to break bad news by degree to such man a larry told that daughter be dead old man remained silent for few

said idiot grinning shure did see when went away on car to wedding then old man paused a if thinking stupid smile passed off from face saddest cloud one must conceive came over said ah be gone away from be gone away to thady now will never see agin then paused for moment after while fire came into eye began again curse curse be too horrid father john got up held hand before father face a if to forbid to finish curse be about to utter old man trembled like frightened child upon seat sat silent with eye fixed on priest mary have not be present at interview father john however now found necessary to call to commission if possible to make father understand that have be bereaved of daughter poor mary be dreadfully distressed herself for long time sat sobbing weeping by degree recovered tone commenced duty father john have enjoined to perform nothing must convince larry of feemy death felt assured that be trying to deceive that feemy lover have now deserted a well a thady when father john returned to carrick anxious yet fearing to hear verdict found that jury have not yet agreed even be comfort for made evident that there be doubt on subject surely thought if man doubt on subject a must ultimately lean to side of mercy remained with tony mckeon in court till about eight when went to hotel got dinner for must not leave town till jury be locked up for night soon afterwards webb joined three sat together till eleven o'clock when be signified to that judge must not receive verdict night that jury be therefore again to be locked up webb then went home priest friend returned to drumsna to sleep thady have remained in dock that might be ready to hear verdict till judge left bench be then conducted back into prison be so late that prison regulation did not allow to see friend visitor be therefore debarred from comfort few kind word from father john must have afforded after have heard news of sister death never once raised from position into almost fell rather than sunk during whole of long afternoon remained crouched down in one corner of bench within dock when judge commenced charge to jury have once attempted to rise felt that must no longer endure gaze of around remained on seat till be taken back to gaol father john mckeon agreed that cause of feemy death must not be told to thady at rate till after verdict have be given if must be condemned must only be useless cruelty to increase suffering by telling of sister disgrace must be acquitted must then become question whether might still be suffered to live in ignorance of if known must so deeply embitter remainder of life on friday morning two friend again took seat in court waiting anxiously till jury must send in word that have come to unanimous decision thady be again in dock father john be just enabled to say one word to over wooden paling to bid still keep up courage to press hand closely within own hour after hour passed on dull stupid work of week went on mr allewinde eloquence mr obealley energy mr wit sounded equally monotonous to anxious priest good natured friend though seemed to listen indeed endeavoured to do so yet at close of trivial case be tried have idea impressed upon of what have just be going on one o'clock struck two three four five yet remained in same position still jury who have be considering subject remained undecided business in record court have be closed on thursday therefore judge heard criminal case during whole of friday by six o'clock business of assize be finished prisoner be disposed of with exception of poor thady be absolutely necessary that judge must commence business at sligo on following saturday if jury did not agree to verdict before eleven on morning must have to be discharged case must stand over for fresh trial at summer assize now seemed almost desirable to father john mckeon immediately after hearing mr obealley defence have felt sure of success judge charge have dreadfully robbed of hope began to fear arrival of foreman at six baron hamilton left court saying that brother must be within call till twelve o'clock to receive verdict that must remain in town till eleven next morning must jury not have decided before then thady be yet once more taken back to prison in doubt whilst mckeon went to inn again to get dinner ready father john went up to prison to visit prisoner in cell young man have to great degree recovered self possession told father john that have given up hope for that believed have made up mind perfectly to face death like brave man then talked about sister lamented grievously that ill a be must have be dragged into court with vain object of saving life asked many question about manner of death disease state of feeling towards father john found most difficult to answer be just beginning to inquire how father have borne grief have accumulated upon when one of turnkey opened door of cell told that be to return immediately into court that jury have agreed that judge be now going into court to receive verdict father john turned deadly pale leant against wall for support hectic red partially suffused prisoner face eye became somewhat brighter than before slight shudder passed over whole frame in spite of that have suffered that made up mind to suffer be evident that there be fearful degree of anxiety in bosom painful hope still clinging to heart fetter be again fixed on to leg be led away in midst of body of policeman into court father john hurried to same place where found mr mckeon already seated on one of dark bench there be very few there a one have left after business of day have be concluded of who be in town have heard that jury be at last unanimous have hurried down generality of stranger who be still remaining in carrick preferred warmth of hotel fire to paddling down through rain dirt dark even to hear verdict in case in one be so much interested barrister attorney seat be wholly deserted by customary learned occupant there be one lawyer present probably thinking unprofessional to appear to take more than lawyer interest in case be standing by in dark obscurity between dock bottom of one of gallery be mr obealley though must not be seen in court after business there be really over felt so truly anxious in matter that must not wait to hear verdict from third party at length judge took seat clerk of crown sat beneath ready to record decision of jury few lighted candle be stuck about in different part of court be lost in obscurity of large dark dismal building foreman stood ready with written signed paper judge asked if have come to unanimous verdict answered in affirmative handed paper to clerk of peace who glancing eye upon half turning round to judge said in peculiar sonorous voice lord prisoner have be found guilty gentleman be that verdict said judge said be prisoner stood up at bar erect without moving shook trembled now if be not that lip be pressed quite close together must have appeared to have heard verdict without emotion not so father john have be leaning back anxiously waiting till one fatal word met ear then head fell forward on desk sobbed like woman baron hamilton immediately placed black cap on head proceeded to pronounce dreadful sentence of death a did so voice seemed like awful measured tone proceeding from immovable figure statue placed beneath dusky canopy so dark be so cold stern so slow clear be word manner must have felt felt strongly a doomed that young man to sudden ignominious death for be heartless man so powerfully have schooled emotion so entirely have learnt to lay aside man in assuming judge have be stone looked like must not have betrayed le of heart within dwelt at considerable length on enormity of offence of prisoner have be found guilty stated own conviction that verdict be just true one alluded to irreparable injury such illegal society a to prisoner too evidently belonged must do in country assured that have hope for mercy to look for in world recommended to seek from who must always reconcile with justice to extend to repentant sinner concluded by ordering that must be taken back to place from whence came be brought from thence to place of execution on monday week following then there be hung by neck till must be dead assize be then finished judge immediately left court prisoner be taken back to cell light be extinguished when servant of sheriff came to lock door found mr mckeon still vainly endeavouring to arouse broken hearted priest from ecstasy of sorrow chapter xxxiii end on saturday morning little town of carrick on shannon again became quiet comparatively speaking empty judge left very early most of lawyer have taken wing flown towards sligo seeking fresh quarry on previous evening jury be released have returned weary to home crowd of litigant witness who have filled record court have also left on thursday evening now who have be wanted in criminal court be gone peace quiet be restored at eleven o'clock neither of hotel be open waiter servant who during last week have literally not known what bed be who during week have snatched only disturbed nap before kitchen fire under kitchen dresser be taking sleep out for past week be still raining hard long narrow untidy street be still a dirty disagreeable a ever otherwise there be resemblance in to street of last few day there be crowd around court house policeman with cross chain on cap sheriff servant with dirty tawdry livery assize be over till next july when judge barrister jury c must return carrick be doomed to fall back to usual insignificance a most uninteresting county town a father john left town on previous evening sent word up to governor of gaol that must see young macdermot early on following morning did not go home to cottage again passed night at mr mckeon at drumsna most sad melancholy night be after witnessing feemy death seeing that body have be decently properly disposed mr mckeon have returned home husband have found quite ill from effect of scene have gone through soon after two men have made apology for dinner mr webb who have have verdict brought to own house called three sat for time talking over what possible mean there might be still left for saving young man life be at last agreed that webb must go up to dublin on morrow make what interest must to see lord lieutenant a well a under secretary endeavour by mean in power to obtain pardon after what have be said by judge whilst pronouncing sentence felt that there must be reasonable ground for hope still must leave chance untried be therefore settled that counsellor must start by morning coach early next morning priest left drumsna for carrick to see thady for first time since condemnation mckeon offered to go with declined offer saying that morning must sooner be left alone with doomed friend refused too loan of mckeon car wanted to collect thought energy by walk for felt that have much to do to school own feeling before must make visit comfort instead of cause of additional distress to macdermot about ten o'clock passed through town rang governor bell at gaol door be well known visitor there now when door be opened expected at once a usual to be shown prisoner cell instead of that be taken into governor house officer have always be extremely civil to father john have shown kindness in power be little to prisoner expressed to priest greatly distressed at verdict consequent fate of macdermot be four year father john said since have prisoner in charge condemned to die be four year since there be execution here then victim be criminal of blackest dye man who have undoubtedly committed cold blooded long premeditated murder then death weighed heavy on can not believe that young man be innocent at rate so much more innocent than be heart have failed since be brought back last night condemned more innocent than be said father john ah indeed be if be a innocent of guilt a poor fellow be must be well for most of promised to see early morning will let go up to now though god know know not what to say to yes of course will go up now immediately god grant may be able to comfort know can not see a have done always be may see a often a please can not see alone not alone said father john not now said governor when brought back capitally condemned be of necessity put into condemned cell when once there visitor may be left alone with how be to receive how be to perform sacred duty of profession when prisoner be about to confess turnkey will step outside door can close know father john continued governor be not from own heart give order know must give indulgence must also know must obey rule of office imperatively forbid that visitor will be left alone with condemned prisoner know be fault if must be so must will desire man to be sent for for macdermot will be expecting in minute two gaoler arrived with huge key with palpitating heart father john followed to condemned cell priest during walk from drumsna have made up mind exactly a to what must say on seeing thady how must mix pity with condolence how must use such word a might strengthen in determination to bear suffering with resignation how must teach to forget present in thought of future prospect when iron door be opened saw macdermot seated on one small stone seat in wall beneath high iron barred window when eye rested on young man pale worn face forgot studied phrase premeditated conduct acute grief overcame idea of duty falling on prisoner bosom sobbed out boy boy poor murdered boy must be useless to attempt to describe at scene between father john remained with nearly whole of day patient silent turnkey leaning up against corner of cell during whole time for long time thady be most tranquil of two at length priest regained composure be able to listen to various request of friend to say must be said to comfort strengthen thady first request be that might see father father john felt must be impracticable if accomplished must only be in highest degree painful larry be now so perfectly lunatic at same time so resolute in determination not to put in way of being arrested by keegan that must be impossible to make understand fate awaited son to induce by mean short of force to leave own room besides be meeting to be effected idiotical father must probably not cease to abuse son must certainly not comprehend tenderness affection be difficult to tell son that father have so utterly lost intellect a to be unable to be brought to see even be better than allowing to think that be to see then deceive thady bore blow even worse than father john have expected that must do made feel so desolate so alone in world stupid cross a father have be for year past cruel unjust a have be on last time met still long time have passed since meeting manner in interview have be passed by thady made forget father treatment only remember that be last surviving relative submitted however to father john advice consented not to urge request then talked of sister began to speak more feelingly of ussher to allude to deed have brought to dreadful doom with more freedom than have ever done before fact of last month residence at ballycloran seemed to be made le obscure than have be to mind eye by distance through looked at appeared to comprehend more clearly feemy conduct that of lover spoke with greatest affection of former with justice to latter oh father john continued after have be talking together for hour when have become so habituated to presence of turnkey a almost to forget one can ever know how far murder be from thought day have suffered for having listened for one moment to plot boy be making for death who can wonder hated god know have forgiven for that have brought on feemy who can wonder did love then knew in heart never meant to marry oh father john av have seen night what must have be now did hate then have cause for one night at wedding when be mad with name have

meddled with boy that night at mr mehan called out that night when first got there tould what be brady be afther believed yet went for heart be full of hatred for man who warned oh why father john must not let alone be poor be worse there be end of now altogether perhaps be for betther a be then earnestly begged father john to attend to sister burial to take little heed of father during few remaining year priest promised spoke of property of chance there might be of saving something out of for old man support father john however told that for thady sake for love bore father must never want till wanted though promise for many long month entailed heavy burden on priest most religiously kept word thady then spoke of own coming death though have made up mind to die must think without regret of leaving world where have known so many sorrow so few joy still shuddered when remembered gaping crowd must be assembled to see expiring convulsion horror must not feel when executioner hand must touch neck dreadful cap must be drawn over eye oh that horrid moment might be over when must still be alive still sensible to thought of life when light of sun must have be for ever excluded last thought must be wandering between doubtful hope of heaven mercy awful fear of coming agony cold sweat stood upon brow a endeavoured to explain feeling to priest assiduously patiently warmly kindly did that friend endeavour to allay suffering make feel a confident of god pardon for sin a be of executioner doom told also that if possible crowd must be assembled to gaze at death promised to stand by hold hand to last moment of life at six priest left promising to see again on sunday on day till be over then returned to mckeon where dined at about ten be sitting together with mr mckeon by fire
