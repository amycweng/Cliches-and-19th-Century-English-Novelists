accommodation in town for fourteen fifteen thousand stranger who flock to holy sepulchre at period of year many of sleep out in open air lying on low bench run along outside wall of house even on ground wrapped in thick hood cloak slumberer such a be easily disturbed be detained long at toilet shake like dog growl stretch then be ready for day rode out of town in long file first went groom boy forget proper syrian appellation used to call mucherry sound being in sort like name then followed horse with forage blanket next to friend smith in turkish saddle be behind joseph brought up rear

in maimed halt be healed whenever water moved what name be yet there at jerusalem be bandied to fro with a little reverence a be fanciful appellation given by guide to rock stone little lake in country overrun by tourist for who must still fain believelet stay at home said friend smith for who can not divide wheat from chaff let stay at home answered then rode out through st stephen gate having mountain of men of galilee directly before mount of olive little to right valley of jehoshaphat lying between of course know place now said smith answered that did know well be not better for when knew only in holy writ asked by jove said mountain stand where ever stood same valley be still green with morning dew water course be unchanged child of mahomet may build tawdry temple on threshing floor david bought that there might stand lord house man may undo what man did even though doer be solomon here have god handiwork own evidence at bottom of steep descent from city gate came to tomb of virgin by special agreement made with joseph left horse here for few moment in order that might descend into subterranean chapel under tomb in mass be at moment being said there be something awful in chapel when a at present moment be crowded with eastern worshipper from very altar up to top of dark step by descent be made must be remembered that eastern worshipper be not like churchgoer of london even of rome cologne be wild men of various nation racesmaronites from lebanon roumelians candiotes copt from upper egypt russian from crimea armenian abyssinian savour strongly of oriental life of oriental dirt be clad in skin hairy cloak with huge hood head be shaved face covered with short grisly fierce beard be silent mostly looking out of eye ferociously a though murder be in thought rapine never slouch cringe in body shuffle in gait dirty fierce looking uncouth repellent a be there be always about something of personal dignity be not compatible with englishman ordinary hat pantaloon a be about to descend preparing to make way through crowd smith took hold of arm will never do dear fellow said job will be tough enough for single file must never cut way two two im broad shouldered will go first so did gradually worked way into body of chapel how be that englishman can push anywhere men be fierce looking have murder rapine a have said almost in eye one must have supposed that be not lamb dove capable of being thrust here there without anger on part too be anxious to descend approach altar yet did win way through apparently man be angry with doubt after whether ferocious eye strong smell dirt be so efficacious in creating awe obedience in others a open brow trace of soap water know at leastthat dirty maronite must make very little progress if attempted to shove way unfairly through crowd of englishman at door of london theatre did shove unfairly did make progress till found in centre of dense crowd collected in body of chapel having got so far next object be to get out again place be dark mysterious full of strange odour darkness mystery strange odour soon lose charm when men have much work before joseph have made point of being allowed to attend mass before altar of virgin very few minute sufficed for prayer so again turned round pushed way back again smith still following in wake men who have let pas once let pas again without opposition show of anger to occasion be very holy be stretching out hand in direction with long taper in order that might obtain spark of sacred fire be burning on one of altar a made way out passed many who with dumb motion begged to assist in object did assist getting light for taper handing to fro using authority with seemed to be invested smith observed be much more courteous in way to woman than to men a did not forget to remind when be afterwards on road together remounting horse rode slowly up winding ascent of mount of olive turning round at brow of hill to look back over jerusalem sometimes think that of spot in world one must be spot most cherished in memory of christian be there that stood when wept over city so much do know though be ignorant ever will be so of site of cross of tomb then descended on eastern side of hill passing through town of lazarus sister turned face steadily towards mountain of moab hitherto have met no bedouin interrogated dragoman about more than once always told that did not signify must meet said before danger must arise a for danger said think more of than do of arab put hand on revolver a agreed to be here here ought to be dont carry revolver smith smith said that never have done so that must take charge of mine if liked to however demurred never part with pistol to one said rather drily explained that only intended to signify that if there be danger to be encountered must be glad to encounter fully believed shant have much fighting replied if there be tool will come readiest to hand of master if mean to remain here long must advise to get one oriental be people with whom appearance go long way a rule fear respect mean same thing with pistol hanging over loin be great trouble to look a though must bite many dog go through world well by merely showing teeth then companion began to talk of did not said mean to remain in syria very long either said have done with part of world for present will take next steamer from jaffa for alexandria will only have one night in jerusalem on return after remained silent for few moment then declared that also have be intention be almost ashamed to say so however because

that if such be not case must tell so a frankly will remain in cairo little time so beyond arrival in egypt can answer for nothing said that expected letter at alexandria must govern future movement thought seemed sad a said so imagined from manner that did not expect very happy tidings indeed have made up mind that be by mean free from care sorrow have not air of man who must say of that be totus teres atque rotundus have wish to inquire matter must have dropped have not addedi fear that will meet acquaintance in egypt whom will give pleasure to see then said if be must go to constantinople insteadindeed anywhere rather than fall among friend who be not friendly nearer friend be more one feel that sort of thing to way of thinking there be nothing on earth so pleasant a pleasant wife then what be there so damnable a one be unpleasant be married man inquired question be put in low tone of voice seemed to give to air of special interest made one almost feel that be asked with special view to one individual welfare now fact be that be married man with family be not much given to talk to stranger about domestic concern therefore though have particular object in view denied obligation in respect said have not come to promotion yet be too frequently on move to write down a paterfamilias then know nothing about pleasantness of spoke just now of unpleasantness thank god personal experience be to comeas also be presume be possible that have hampered with woman that be to meet at alexandria poor fellow thought unhappiness be not of kind said be not married be alone in world then certainly must not allow to be troubled by unpleasant acquaintance be now four hour since have left jerusalem have arrived at place at be proposed that must breakfast there be large well there shade afforded by rock under water sprung arab have constructed tank out of horse must drink so that place be ordinarily known a first stage out of jerusalem smith have said not word about saddle complained in way of discomfort so have in truth forgotten subject other matter have continually presented have never even asked how have fared now jumped from horse perceived at once that be unable to do so smiled faintly a eye caught mine knew that wanted assistance ah said that confounded turkish saddle have already galled skin see how be will have to doctor with little brandyexternally applied friend lent shoulder with assistance got down very gently slowly ate breakfast with good will bread cold fowl brandy water with hard boiled egg by way of final delicacy then began to bargain with joseph for loan of english saddle saw that smith must not get through journey with monstrous turkish affair that must go on without complaining till fainted came to other signal grief frenchman seeing plight in be be disposed to drive very hard bargain wanted forty shilling price of pair of live bedouin for accommodation declared that even then must make sacrifice only out of consideration to very well said im tolerably tough ill change with gentleman chance be that will not be in very liberal humour when reach jaffa with stiff limb sore skin have very good memory joseph ill take thirty shilling mr jones though will have to groan way like condemned devil struck bargain with at last for five twenty set to work to make necessary change on horse will be just same thing to said to smith find that be a much used to one a to other how much money be to pay asked oh nothing replied give few piastre when part with at jaffa know why must have felt thus inclined to pay money out of pocket for smitha man whom have only seen for first time on preceding evening whose temperament be so essentially different from own so did must have done almost anything in reason for comfort yet be melancholy fellow with good inward pluck a believed without outward show of dash hardihood confess love to see pray tell ill pay for said well make that right answered then remountednot without difficulty on part must have let rub in brandy said cant conceive how efficaciously must have done made answer at noon met caravan of pilgrim coming up from jordan there might be three four hundred number seemed to be treble that from loose straggling line in journeyed be very singular sight a moved slowly along narrow path through sand coming out of defile among hill be perhaps quarter of mile in front of passing a stood still by wayside then winding again out of sight on track over have come rode on camelsa whole family in many case being perched on same animal observed very old man very old woman slung in pannier over camel backnot such pannier a might be befitting such purpose square basket so that head heel of of old couple hung out of rear front surely journey will be death said to joseph yes will replied quite coolly what matter how soon die now that have bathed in jordan very many rode on donkey two generally on donkey others who have command of money on horse greater number walked toiling painfully from jerusalem to jericho on first day sleeping there in tent going to bathe on second day then returning from jericho to jerusalem on third pilgrimage be made throughout in accordance with fixed rule there be tariff for tent accommodation at jerichoso much per head per night including use of hot water standing there close by wayside must see not only garment face of strange people must watch gesture form opinion of what be going on within thought be much quietertamer a werethan englishman must be under such circumstance who be carried seemed to sit on beast in passive tranquillity enjoying suffering anything object have be to wash in jordanto do once in livesand have washed in jordan benefit expected be not to be immediately spiritual earnest prayerfulness be considered necessary after ceremony to member of greek christian church have be handed down from father to son washing in jordan once during life be efficacious towards salvation therefore journey have be made at terrible cost terrible risk for people have come from afar be from habit little capable of long journey many die under toil matter not if die before have reached jordan few there be undoubtedly more ecstatic in great deed of religion one man especially noticed on day have bound to make pilgrimage from jerusalem to river with one foot bare be of better class be even nobly dressed a though be part of vow to show to men that did deed wealthy great though be be fine man perhaps thirty year of age with well grown beard descending on breast at girdle carried brace of pistol never in life have seen bodily pain so plainly written in man face sweat be falling from brow eye be strained bloodshot with agony have stick vow presume debarring from such assistance limped along putting to ground heel of unprotected foot must see be mass of blood sore broken skin irish girl must walk from jerusalem to jericho without shoe be not penny worse for poor fellow clearly suffered so much that be almost inclined to think that in performance of penance have done something to aggravate pain around paid attention to dragoman seemed to think nothing of affair fool of greek understand christian religion said being latin roman catholic at tail of line encountered two bedouin who be in charge of caravan joseph at once addressed men be mounted one on very sorry looking jade other on good stout arab barb have gun slung behind back coloured handkerchief on head wore striped bernouse parley went on for about ten minute during procession of pilgrim wound out of sight ended in being accompanied by two arab who thus left greater charge to take care of back to city understood afterwards that have endeavoured to persuade joseph that might just a well go on alone merely satisfying demand of tariff have pointed out be particular man that under such circumstance final settlement might be doubtful so turned accompanied a matter of fact must have be a well without sun be beginning to fall in heaven when reached actual margin of dead sea have seen glitter of still water for long time previously shining under sun a though be not real have often heard of have seen how effect of light shade together will produce so vivid appearance of water where there be water a to deceive most experienced reverse be case here there be lake there have be before eye for last two hour yet looked then now a though be image of lake not real water have long since made up mind to bathe in feeling well convinced that must do so without harm to myself have be endeavouring to persuade smith to accompany positively refused must bathe said in dead sea in river jordan did not like bathing preferred to do washing in own room of course have nothing further to say begged that under circumstance must take charge of purse pistol while be in water agreed to do even in be strange almost uncivil be to bathe from farthest point of little island into there be rough causeway from land made of stone broken piece of wood exhorted to go with thither insisted on remaining with horse on mainland at little distance from island did not feel inclined to go down to water edge said confess at moment almost suspected that be going to play foul hesitated saw in instant what be passing through mind have better take pistol money with will be quite safe on clothes to have kept thing now must have shown suspicion too plainly a must not bring to do gave up have sometimes thought that be fool to do so went away by to end of island then did bathe be impossible to conceive anything more desolate than appearance of place land shelf very gradually away to water whole margin to breadth of twenty thirty foot be strewn with dbris of rush bit of timber old white withered reed whence bit of timber have come seems difficult to say appearance be a though water have receded left there have heard said that there be vegetation near dead sea such be not case for rush do grow on bank found difficult enough to get into water for ground shelf down very slowly be rough with stone large piece of half rotten wood moreover when be in nearly up to hip water knocked down indeed did so when have gone a far a knee recovered by perseverance did proceed somewhat farther must not be imagined that knocking down be effected by movement of water there be such movement everything be perfectly still fluid seems hardly to be displaced by entrance of body effect be that one foot be tripped up that one fall prostrate on to surface water be so strong buoyant that when above few foot in depth have to be encountered strength weight of bather be not sufficient to keep down foot leg then essayed to swim must not do in ordinary way a be unable to keep enough of body below surface so that head face seemed to be propelled down upon turned round floated glare of sun be so powerful must not remain long in position however have bathed in dead sea be so far satisfied anything more abominable to palate than water if be water never have inside mouth expected to be extremely salt doubt if be analysed such must be result there be flavour in kill salt attempt can be made at describing taste may be imagined that did not drink heartily merely taking up drop two with tongue from palm of hand seemed to a though have be drenched with even brandy must not relieve from then whole body be in mess felt a though have be rubbed with pitch looking at limb saw sign on of fluid seemed to dry from a usually do from other water still feeling remained however be to ride from hence to spot on bank of jordan must reach in hour at must wash so clothed prepared for departure seated in position in island be unable to see what be going on among remainder of party therefore must not tell whether pistol money be safe dressed therefore rather hurriedly on getting again to shore found that mr john smith have not levanted be seated on horse at distance from joseph arab have appearance of being in league with doubt worthy guide certainly have suspected ruse now be angry with have done so yet in london one must not trust one money to stranger whom one have met twenty four hour since in coffee room why then do with stranger whom one chanced to meet in desert thanks said a handed belonging wish must have induced to come in also dead sea be now at elbow therefore think nothing of in ten fifteen year time must be glad to be able to tell child that have bathed in will never have child to care for such tidings replied river jordan for mile above point at join dead sea run through very steep banksbanks be almost precipitousand be a be guarded by thick tree bush grow upon side be so much case that one may ride a did for considerable distance along margin not be able even to approach water have fancy for bathing in spot of own selection instead of going to open shore frequented by pilgrim be baffled in when did force way down to river side found that water ran so rapidly that bush bough of tree grew so far over into stream a to make impossible for to bathe must not have got in without clothes having got in must not have got out again be therefore obliged to put up with open muddy shore to bather descend at may presume that joshua passed when came over a one of twelve spy to spy out land even here must not go full into stream a must fain have done lest must be carried down so have assisted to whiten shore of dead sea with bone a to getting over to moabitish side of river be plainly impossible indeed seemed to be prevailing opinion that passage of river be not practicable without going up a far a samaria yet know that there thereabouts israelite did cross jumped from horse moment got to place once more gave purse pistol to friend be going to bathe again said certainly said dont suppose must come to jordan not wash there even if be not foul with foulness of dead sea youll kill in present state of heat said remonstrating just a one mother wife might do even have be mother wife must not have attended to such remonstrance then before have done looking at with big eye of coat waistcoat cravat be on ground be at work at brace whereupon turned from slowly strolled away into wood on occasion have base fear about money then did bathevery uncomfortably shore be muddy with foot of pilgrim river so rapid that hardly dared to get beyond mud did manage to take plunge in head foremost be forced to wade out through dirt slush so that found difficult to make foot leg clean enough for shoe stocking then moreover fly plagued most unmercifully must have thought that filthy flavour from dead sea must have saved from nuisance mosquito thereabouts be probably used to finding process of bathing to be so difficult inquired a to practice of pilgrim found that with bathing in jordan have come to be much same a baptism have with doe not mean immersion doubt do take off shoe stocking strip go bodily into water a soon a be dressed found that smith be again at side with purse pistol then went up little above wood sat down together on long sandy grass be now quite evening so that short syrian twilight have commenced sun be no longer hot in heaven must be night a rode on to tent at jericho there be difficulty a to way therefore did not hurry horse who be feeding on grass sat down together on spot from must see streamclose together so that when stretched out in weariness a did before started head rested on leg ah one doe not take such liberty with new friend in england be place led one on to special thought mountain of moab be before very plain in outline moab be wash pot over edom will cast out shoe there be before very visible to eye began naturally to ask question of other why be moab wash pot edom thus cursed with indignity why have right bank of river be selected for such great purpose whereas left be thus condemned be there at time special fertility in land of promise have since departed from be told of bunch of grape took two men to carry now there be not vine in whole country side now day sandy plain round jericho be a dry arid a be of valley of moab jordan be running beneath feetthe jordan in leprous king have washed though bright river of own damascus be so much nearer to hand be humble stream to be sent spot probably be higher up above sea of galilee where river be narrow also have come down to river perhaps to very spot on shore submitted to watersas to whom perhaps will be better must not speak much in light story dead sea be on right still glittering in distance behind lay plain of jericho wretched collection of hut still bear name of ancient city beyond still seemingly within easy distance of be mountain of wilderness wilderness in truth spot be one did lead to many thought talked of thing a to many of found that friend be much more free in doubt questioning than then word came back to ourselves natural centre of men thought word from what say said gather that have have enough of land quite enough said why seek such spot a if only dispel association veneration of one childhood with such association veneration be riveted stronger by seeing place putting hand upon spot speak of fictitious marble slab up there here among sandhills by river at mount of olive over passed do believe paused moment then replied to be nothingabsolutely nothing then do not know that thought be formed belief modelled not on outward sign intrinsic evidence of thingsas must be case be always rationalbut by inner working of mind at present turn of life can believe in nothing be gracious ah mean that be unhappy have come to grief in of doings belonging therefore find that thing be bitter to taste have have palate out of order too proper appreciation of flavour have come back to bahhow be that dead sea water dead sea water be noisome said have be drinking of by long draught long draught answered thinking to console draught have not be long can have be swallowed in year disease may be acute can not yet have become chronic man always think at moment of misfortune that special misery will last lifetime god be too good for know what ail day twelvemonth will see again a sound a roach then sat silent for while during be puffing at cigar smith among accomplishment did not reckon that of smokingwhich be grief to for man enjoys tobacco doubly when be enjoying with know what ail said at last therefore can not judge perhaps not dear fellow experience tell that early wound be generally capable of cure therefore surmise that yours may be so heart at time of life be not worn out have strength soundness left wherewith to throw off malady hope may be so with god know mean to say that there be none more to be pitied than be at present moment be notnot light

rough with heat sand be soft cool almost a woman thoroughly hate effeminate man in spite of certain womanly softness about fellow must not hate yes continued though somewhat unused to melting mood also sometimes give forth medicinal gum dont want to ask question a rule hate to be told secret if can be of service to in matter will do best dont say with reference to present moment think of before part looked round at saw that be in tear know that will think that be weak fool said pressing handkerchief to eye by mean there be moment in man life when becomes to weep like woman older grows more seldom moment come to a far a can see of men never cry at disgrace be left for woman to do that answered oh woman woman cry for everything for nothing be sharpest arrow have in quiverthe best card in

be good for to have woman by that may work for thus have exercise for limb faculty be very fond of woman always like best who be most helpless be silent again for while be during time found lying with head in lap have slept must have be for few minute when woke found hand upon brow a started up said that fly have be annoying that have not chosen to waken a seemed weary have be that double bathing said apologetically for always feel ashamed when be detected sleeping in day in hot weather water doe make one drowsy by jove getting dark have better have horse stay moment said speaking very softly laying hand upon arm will not detain minute there be hurry in life said promised just now must assist if be in power will before part at alexandria will endeavour to tell story of trouble then if can

contradiction sir william have given be nothing compared with reproach conveyed in miss weston countenance looked at a though anger be now turned against yet methought there be more of sorrow than of
