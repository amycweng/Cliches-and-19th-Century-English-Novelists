specially hard upon poor crawley man who have not be without good nature in dealing have heard story of dean good will such like have loudly expressed opinion that perpetual curate of hogglestock must show higher pride in allowing to be indebted to rich brother clergyman than in remaining under thrall to butcher thus rumour have grown up then butcher have written repeated letter to bishop to bishop proudie of barchester who have at first caused chaplain to answer have told mr crawley somewhat roundly what be opinion of clergyman who eat meat did not pay for nothing that bishop must say do

inquiry be made mr crawley stated that cheque have be paid to by mr soames on behalf of rentcharge due to by lord lufton error of statement be at once made manifest there be cheque signed by mr soames for exact amount twenty pound four shilling a declared have never in life paid money on behalf of lord lufton by cheque drawn by lordship cheque given by lord lufton have be lost have be private matter between lordship have simply wanted change in pocket agent have given to mr crawley be speedily shown to be altogether wrong in statement made to account for possession of cheque then became very moody must say nothing further wife who have known nothing of first statement when made came forward declared that believed cheque for twenty pound to be part of present given by dean arabin to husband in april last there have be said great heartburning about gift have hardly dared to speak to husband on subject execution have be threatened in house by grobury baker of dean have heard then there have be scene at deanery between husband dean mr arabin a to have subsequently heard much from mr arabin mr arabin have told that money have be given at last taken indeed so much have be very apparent a bill have be paid to amount of at least fifty pound when threat made by butcher have reached husband ear effect upon have be very grievous be story told by mr crawley to mr walker lawyer when be pushing inquiry poor woman at rate told that knew husband have told one morning when butcher threat be weighing heavily on mind speaking to in such humour that found impossible to cross question that have still money left though be money have hoped that must not be driven to use have given four five pound note have told to go to silverbridge satisfy man who be so eager for money have done so have felt no doubt that money so forthcoming have be given by dean be story a told by mr crawley how must explain husband statement a to cheque have be shown to be altogether false passed between mr walker mr crawley lawyer be very gentle with in first stage of inquiry have simply desired to learn truth place clergyman above suspicion latterly being bound a be to follow matter up officially must not have seen mr crawley have be able to escape lady importunity mr walker have said at last know husband one know be hard to have to tell of trouble if can lessen trust will do so said lawyer one think can lessen in world said lady truth be sir that husband often know not what say when declared that money have be paid to by mr soames most certainly thought so there be time when in misery know not what say when forgets everything up to period mr walker have not suspected mr crawley of anything dishonest did suspect a yet poor man have probably received money from dean have told lie about not choosing to own that have taken money from rich friend thinking that there must be further inquiry have be very foolish must be end of mr soames be by mean so good natured in belief how must pocket book have got into dean arabin hand said mr soames almost triumphantly then felt sure at time have left at crawley house mr walker wrote letter to dean who at moment be in florence on way to rome from whence be going on to holy land there came back letter from mr arabin saying that on th of march have given to mr crawley sum of fifty pound that payment have be made with five bank of england note of ten pound have be handed by to friend in library at deanery letter be very short may perhaps be described a having be almost curt mr walker in anxiety to do best must for mr crawley have simply asked question a to nature of transaction between two gentleman saying that doubt dean answer must clear up little mystery existed at present respecting cheque for twenty pound dean in answer simply stated fact a have be given above wrote to mr crawley begging to know what be in truth new difficulty offering assistance in power explained circumstance of money a remembered sum advanced have certainly consisted of fifty pound there have certainly be five bank of england note have put note into envelope have not closed have addressed to mr crawley have placed envelope in

dean expressed hope that mr crawley must apply to if there be trouble letter to mr walker be conclusive a to dean money mr crawley have not received lord lufton cheque from dean then whence have received poor wife be left by lawyer to obtain further information from husband ah who can tell how terrible be scene between poor pair of wretch a wife endeavoured to learn truth from miserable half maddened husband that husband have be honest throughout have not shadow of doubt did not doubt that to at least endeavoured to tell truth a far a poor racked imperfect memory must allow to remember what be true what be not true upshot of be that husband declared that still believed that money have come to from dean have kept by not wishing to use if must help have forgotten so said at time having understood from arabin that be to have fifty pound having received more if have not come to from dean then have be sent to by prince of evil for utter undoing there be time in seemed to think that such have be manner in fatal cheque have reached in that said be terribly confused contradictory unintelligible speaking almost a madman might speak ending always by declaring that cruelty of world have be too much for that water be meeting over head praying for god mercy to remove from world need hardly be said that poor wife in day have burden on shoulder be more than enough to crush woman at last acknowledged to mr walker that must not account for twenty pound must write again to dean about hardly hoped for further assistance there dean answer be very plain said mr walker say that gave mr crawley five ten pound note five note have traced to mr crawley hand then mr crawley must say nothing further beyond making protestation of husband innocence chapter ii by heaven have

way having once given way found that dr thorne mr thorne emily dunstable chaldicote house together be very charming major have be once there with have made very pleasant there have certainly be little passage of incipient love between miss dunstable a to mr thorne who managed everything seemed to be well pleased have be after first mention made by mr grantly to son of emily dunstable name before have heard faintest whisper of fancy for grace crawley have therefore be justified in hoping almost in expecting that emily dunstable must be daughter in law be therefore more aggrieved when terrible crawley peril first opened before eye chapter iii archdeacon threat dinner party at rectory comprised none grantly family marchioness have written to say that preferred to have so father have suggested that thornes of ullathorne very old friend might be asked gresham from boxall hill have even promised to endeavour to get old lady lufton over to rectory lady lufton having in former year be griselda warm friend lady hartletop have preferred to see dear father mother in privacy brother henry must be glad to meet hoped to make arrangement with for short visit to hartlebury husband place in shropshire a to latter hint may however be at once said that nothing further be spoken after crawley alliance have be suggested there have be very sore point mooted by daughter in request made by to father that might not be called upon to meet grandfather mother father mr harding clergyman of barchester who be now stricken in year papa must not have come said mr grantly think do think then stopped father have odd way sometimes dear know how fond be of having here doe not signify said mr grantly let say anything more about of course can not have everything be told child doe duty in sphere of life suppose ought to be contented then mr grantly went up to own room there cried nothing be said to major on unpleasant subject of crawleys before dinner met sister in drawing room be allowed to kiss noble cheek hope edith be well henry said sister quite well little dumbello be same hope thank yes quite well then there seemed to be nothing more to be said between two major never made inquiry after august family must allow to appear that be conscious of being shone upon by wife of marquis adulation griselda received of kind came from father therefore unconsciously have learned to think that father be better bred than other member of family more fitted by nature to move in sacred circle to have be exalted need not dwell upon dinner be dull affair mr grantly strove to carry on family party exactly a must have be carried on have daughter married son of neighbouring squire be conscious of struggle fact of there being struggle produced failure rector servant treated daughter of house with special awe marchioness moved spoke ate drank with cold magnificence think have become second nature with be not on account le oppressive even archdeacon who enjoyed something in be so disagreeable to wife felt relief when be left alone after dinner with son felt relieved a son got up to open door for mother sister be aware at same time that have before most difficult possibly most disastrous task dear son henry be not man to be talked smoothly out of into propriety have will of own having hitherto be successful man who in youth have fallen into few youthful trouble who have never justified father in using stern parental authority be not now inclined to bend neck henry said archdeacon what be drinking be port be not just what must be will send for bottle will do for sir will only take glass will drink two three glass of claret young fellow have become so desperately temperate take wine at dinner sir by by how well griselda be looking yes be be always easy for woman to look well when be rich how must grace crawley look then who be poor a poverty who must remain poor if son be fool enough to marry be train of thought ran through archdeacon mind think much of rich said be always well that gentleman wife gentleman daughter must have sufficiency to maintain position in life may say same sir of everybody wife everybody daughter know what mean henry be not quite sure that do sir perhaps have better speak out at once rumour have reached mother believe for moment nevertheless make unhappy even a report say that there be young woman living in silverbridge to whom be becoming attached be there reason why must not become attached to young woman in silverbridge though hope young woman to whom may become attached will be worthy at rate of being called young lady hope so henry hope so do hope so so much will promise sir will promise nothing more archdeacon looked across into son face heart sank within son voice son eye seemed to tell two thing seemed to tell firstly that rumour about grace crawley be true secondly that major be resolved not to be talked out of folly be not engaged to one be said archdeacon son did not at first make answer then father repeated question considering mutual position henry think ought to tell if be engaged be not engaged have become so must have taken first opportunity of telling mother thank god now dear boy can speak out more plainly young woman whose name have heard be daughter to mr crawley who be perpetual curate at hogglestock knew that there must be nothing in there be something in sir what be there in keep in suspense henry what be mean be rather hard to be cross questioned in way on subject when express a thankful that there be nothing in rumour be forced to stop a otherwise be possible that hereafter may say have deceived mean to marry certainly mean to pledge not to do so do mean to tell henry that be in love with miss crawley then there be pause during archdeacon sat looking for answer major said never word be to suppose that intend to lower by marrying young woman who can not possibly have enjoyed of advantage of lady education say nothing of imprudence of thing nothing of own want of fortune nothing of having to maintain whole family steeped in poverty nothing of debt character of father upon whom a understand at moment there rest very grave suspicion of of of what be afraid must call downright theft downright theft certainly if be guilty say nothing of looking at young woman be simply best educated girl whom have ever be lot to meet henry have right to expect that will be honest with be honest with do mean to ask girl to marry think that have right to ask that question sir have right at rate to tell that if so far disgrace will consider bound to withdraw from sanction must be conveyed by continued assistance do intend to understand that will stop income certainly must then sir think must behave to most cruelly advised to give up profession not in order that might marry grace crawley claim privilege of man of age to do a please in such matter a marriage miss crawley be lady father be clergyman a be mine father oldest friend be uncle there be nothing on earth against except poverty think ever heard of such cruelty on father part very well henry have endeavoured to do duty by sir always by mother can treat in way if please will not have effect on conduct can stop allowance to morrow if like have not a yet made up mind to make offer to miss crawley will now do so to morrow morning be very bad indeed archdeacon be extremely unhappy be by mean at heart cruel man loved child dearly if disagreeable marriage be to take place must doubtless do exactly a wife have predicted must not stop son income for single quarter though went on telling that must stop knew in own heart that such severity be beyond power be generous man in money matter having dislike for poverty be not generous for own sake must not have endured to see son of in want be terribly anxious to exercise power use of threat might give henry said be treating badly very badly anxiety have always be for welfare of child do think that miss crawley must be fitting sister in law for dear girl upstairs certainly do for other dear girl in world excepting that griselda who be not clever must hardly be able to appreciate miss crawley who be clever griselda not clever good heaven then there be pause a major said nothing father continued entreaty pray pray think of what wish be mother be not committed a yet pray think of while there be time must rather double income if saw marry one that must name here have enough a be if may only be allowed to know that will not be capriciously withdrawn archdeacon filled glass unconsciously sipped wine while thought what further might say perhaps might be better that must say nothing further at present moment major however be indiscreet pushed question may understand sir that threat be withdrawn that income be secure what if marry girl yes sir will income be continued to if marry miss crawley will not then father got up hastily pushed decanter back angrily from hand without saying word walked away into drawing room that evening at rectory be very gloomy archdeacon now again said word two to daughter daughter answered in monosyllable major sat apart moodily spoke to one mr grantly understanding well what have passed knew that nothing must be done at present moment to restore family comfort so sat by fire knitted exactly at ten went to bed dear henry said mother to son next morning think much of of child of before take great step in life will mother said then went out put on wrapper got into dog cart drove off to silverbridge have not spoken to father since be in dining room on previous

picked up a jane have said have occurred also to jane mother mr soames be confident that have dropped pocket book at parsonage mr crawley have always disliked mr soames thinking to be hard cruel vulgar must not have hesitated to believe guilty of falsehood even of direct dishonesty if by so believing must in own mind have found mean of reconciling husband possession of cheque with absolute truth on part must not do so even though soames have with devilish premeditated malice slipped cheque into husband pocket having done so must not account for husband having used cheque when found there be driven to make excuse for valid a might be with must not be valid with others have said that mr soames have paid cheque to be clearly mistake have said that cheque have be given to by dean be clearly mistake knew thought knew that being such a be might make such blunder a yet be true believed that such statement might be blunder not falsehood so convinced be that husband mind must not act at time a do mind of other men having such conviction be driven to believe also almost anything might be possible soames may have be right might have dropped not book cheque have difficulty in presuming soames to be wrong in detail if by so supposing must make exculpation of husband easier to herself if villany on part of soames be needful to theory soames must become to villain at once of blackest dye might not be possible that cheque having thus fallen into husband hand have come after while to think that have be sent to by friend dean if be so must be possible to make others so believe that there be mistake must be easily explained be husband mind lucid at point must not explain because of darkness of mind be thoroughly convinced be to put forward defence on husband part must in doing so be driven to say that be lunatic that be incapable of managing affair of family seemed to that must be compelled to have proved to be either thief madman yet knew that be that be not

what might remember what might forget how must be possible to explain to judge jury so that might say that be dishonest yet that be mad perhaps picked up have forgotten daughter said to perhaps be so might not a yet admit a much even to child be mystery dear a yet with god aid will be unravelled of one thing at least may be sure that papa have not wilfully done anything wrong of course be sure of mamma mr crawley have many trouble during next four five day of worst perhaps have reference to service of sunday intervened between day of visit to silverbridge sitting of magistrate on saturday be necessary that must prepare sermon of preached two on sunday though congregation consisted only of farmer brickmakers agricultural labourer who must willingly have dispensed with second mr crawley

dean when dean have shown that also be untrue mr soames confident a be that have dropped pocket book at mr crawley house must not continue investigation have done so with a much silence a nature of work admitted by day of magistrate meeting at silverbridge subject have become common through county men mind be very much divided hogglestock believed parson to be innocent then hogglestock believed to be mad at tradesman with whom have dealt to whom have owed still owed money declared to be innocent knew something of man personally must not believe to be thief lady in silverbridge too be sure of innocence be to impossible that man must have stolen twenty pound dear said eldest miss prettyman to poor grace crawley in england where law be good gentleman be ever made out to be guilty when be innocent papa of course be innocent therefore must not trouble will break papa heart grace have said did trouble herself gentleman in silverbridge be made of sterner stuff believed man to be guilty clergyman gentleman though be mr walker who among light in silverbridge be leading light must not speak word upon subject to anybody then everybody who be anybody knew that mr walker be convinced of

shook head people did not think much of mr winthrop excepting certain unmarried lady for mr winthrop be bachelor have plenty of money people did not think much of mr winthrop still on subject might know something when shook head manifestly intended to indicate guilt dr tempest rector of silverbridge did not hesitate to declare belief in guilt of incumbent of hogglestock man reverence clergyman a clergyman so slightly a brother clergyman to dr tempest appeared to be neither very strange very terrible that mr crawley must have stolen twenty pound what be man to do said when see child starving

framley hall lord lufton seat in county of barset be thoroughly convinced of mr crawley innocence elder lady have lived much among clergyman must hardly think by mean have be brought to believe in guilt of man who have taken upon order of church of england have also known mr crawley personally for year be one of who must not admit to herself that one be vile who have be near to herself believed intensely in wickedness of outside world of world be far away from herself of never saw anything who be near to who have even become dear to who even have be respected by be made a be saint in imagination be brought into inner circle must hardly be expelled be old woman who thought evil of did not know good of whom did know a did know mr crawley be quite sure have not stolen mr soames twenty pound did know mr soames also thus there be mystery for unravelling of be very anxious young lady lufton be equally sure perhaps with better reason for such certainty have in truth known more of mr crawley personally than have one in county unless be dean younger lady lufton present lord lufton wife have sojourned at one time in mr crawley house amidst crawley poverty living a lived nursing mr crawley through illness have well nigh be fatal to younger lady lufton believed in mr crawley a mr crawley also believed in be quite impossible dear old woman said to daughter in law quite impossible lady dowager be always called lady by own daughter by son wife except in presence of child when be addressed a grandmamma think how well knew be use talking of evidence evidence must make

be together after lady have left there be much le of certainty expressed by jove said lord lufton know what to think of wish with heart that soames have said nothing about that cheque have passed without remark be impossible when banker sent to soames be obliged to take matter up of course be be sorry that be so for life of ca conceive how cheque got into crawley hand imagine that have be lying in house that crawley have come to think that be own dear mark said lord lufton excuse if say that be nonsense what do do when poor man have come to think that man property be own send to prison

other sex at barchester cathedral city of county in crawleys lived opinion be violently against mr crawley in city mr proudie wife of bishop be leader of opinion in general be very strong in belief of man guilt have known much of clergyman life a behoved bishop wife to do have none of mingled weakness ignorance taught so many lady in barsetshire to suppose that ordained clergyman must not become thief hated old lady lufton with heart old lady lufton hated a warmly mr proudie must say frequently that lady lufton be conceited old idiot lady lufton must declare a frequently that mr proudie be vulgar virago be known at palace in barchester that kindness have be shown to crawleys by family at framley hall alone must have be sufficient to make mr proudie believe that mr crawley must have be guilty of crime a mr proudie believed so did bishop believe be terrible disgrace to diocese said bishop shaking head patting apron a sat by study fire fiddlestick said mr proudie dear beneficed clergyman must get rid of be must be firm whether be acquitted convicted if be acquitted can not get rid of dear yes can if be firm must be firm be not true that have be disgracefully involved in debt ever since have be there that have be pestered by letter from unfortunate tradesman who can not get money from be true dear certainly be kind of thing to go on can not come to palace a clergyman must do because have got clothes to come in saw once about lane never set eye on object in life must not believe that man be clergyman till john told be disgrace to diocese must be got rid of feel sure of guilt hope will be convicted one be bound to hope that guilty man must be convicted if escape conviction must sequestrate living because of debt income be enough to get excellent curate must just do for thumble to of bishop made further reply simply nodded head patted apron knew that must not do exactly what wife required of if must so turn out that poor crawley be found to be guilty then matter must be comparatively easy must be example to that must look to own step dear said bishop be very well said mr proudie have become duty mine too to look to step of other people that duty must do of course dear of course be tone in question of mr crawley alleged guilt be discussed at palace have already heard what be said on subject at house of archdeacon grantly a day passed by a other tidings came in confirmatory of have before reached archdeacon felt unable not to believe in man guilt fear entertained a to son intended marriage with grace crawley tended to increase strength of belief dr grantly have be very successful man in world on ordinary occasion have be able to show that bold front with success endows man still have moment of weakness feared greatly lest anything of misfortune must touch mar comely roundness of prosperity be very wealthy wife of bosom have be to that wife must be reputation in clerical world stood very high have lived life on term of equality with best of gentry around only daughter have made splendid marriage two son have hitherto done well in world not only a regarded happiness a to marriage also a to social standing how great must be fall if son must at last marry daughter of convicted thief how must proudies rejoice over proudies who have be crushed to ground by success of hartletop alliance how must low church curate who swarmed in barsetshire gather together scream in delight over dismay why must say that be guilty said mr grantly hardly matter a far a be concerned whether find guilty not said archdeacon if henry marries that girl heart will be broken perhaps to one except to crawleys have matter caused so much terrible anxiety a to archdeacon son have told father that have made offer of marriage to grace crawley have told truth there be perhaps few men who make such offer in direct term without having already said done that make such offer simply necessary a final closing of accepted bargain be so at rate between major grantly miss crawley major grantly acknowledged to that be so acknowledged also to that a regarded grace have wish to go back from implied intention nothing that father mother might say must shake in must be duty to bind to family of convicted thief must be right that must disgrace father mother sister one child by such connection have man heart poverty of crawleys caused solicitude shrank from contamination of prison chapter vi grace crawley have already be said that grace crawley be at time living with two miss prettymans who kept girl school at silverbridge two more benignant lady than miss prettymans never presided over such establishment younger be fat fresh fair seemed to be always running over with milk of human kindness other be very thin very small somewhat afflicted with bad health be weak too in eye subject to racking headache so that be considered generally that be unable to take much active part in education of pupil be considered a generally that did thinking that knew more than other woman in barsetshire that prettyman scheme for education emanated from mind be said too by who knew best that sister good nature be a nothing to hers that be most charitable most loving most conscientious of schoolmistress be miss annabella prettyman elder perhaps may be inferred that portion of great character for virtue may have be due to fact that nobody ever saw out of own house must not even go to church because open air brought on neuralgia be therefore perhaps taken to be magnificent partly because be unknown miss anne prettyman younger went about frequently to tea party must go indeed to party to might be invited be known to have pleasant taste for pound cake sweet meat being seen so much in outer world became common character did not stand so high a did that of sister people be ill natured enough to say that wanted to marry mr winthrop of what maiden lady go out into world be not such story told such story in silverbridge be told with special reference to mr winthrop miss crawley at present lived with miss prettymans assisted in school arrangement have be going on for last twelve month since time in grace must have left school in natural course of thing there have be no bargain made intention that grace must stay have be invited to fill place of absent superintendent first for one month then for then for two more month when assistant came back miss prettymans thought there be reason why grace must be asked to remain little longer took great care to let fashionable world of silverbridge know that grace crawley be visitor with not teacher pay salary anything of kind said miss anne prettyman statement however be by mean true for during four month regular stipend have be paid to twice since then miss annabella prettyman who managed money matter have called grace into little room have made little speech have put little bit of paper into hand know ought not to take grace have said to friend anne if be not here there must be one in place nonsense dear anne prettyman have said be greatest comfort to in world must make nice know for sake gentleman like then grace have be very angry have sworn that must give money back again nevertheless think did make herself a nice a knew how to do from may be seen that miss prettymans have hitherto quite approved of major grantly attention when terrible affair came on about cheque have be lost found traced to mr crawley hand miss anne prettyman said nothing further to grace crawley about major grantly be not that thought that mr crawley be guilty knew enough of world to be aware that suspicion of such guilt might compel such man a major grantly to change mind if have only popped anne said to sister must have be right must never have gone back from word dear said annabella wish must not talk about popping be terrible word must to one except said anne there have come to silverbridge few month since on visit to mr walker young lady from allington in neighbouring county between whom grace crawley there have grown up from circumstance warm friendship grace have cousin in clerk high up well to do in public office nephew of mother cousin be for year have be violently smitten in

business be done fortune in life of girl be said to have be there made marred a when for instance miss crimpton have be advised to stay at home with uncle in england instead of going out with sister to india of sister be married within three month of landing at way in gave counsel on such occasion be very efficacious one knew better than miss prettyman that cock can crow most effectively in own farmyard therefore crowing intended to be effective be done by within shrine of own peculiar room well dear what be said to grace sit in arm chair dear can then talk comfortably teacher when be closeted with miss prettyman be always asked to sit in arm chair whereas small straight backed uneasy chair be kept for use of young lady there be too stool of repentance out against wall very uncomfortable indeed for young lady who have not behaved so prettily a young lady generally do grace seated then began speech very quickly miss prettyman said have made up mind will go home if please why must go home grace did not tell that must have home here miss prettyman have weak eye be very small have never possessed claim to be called good looking assumed nothing of majestical awe from adornment studied amplification of outward woman by mean of impressive trapping possessor of unobservant eye might have called mean looking little old woman certainly there must have be nothing awful in to one who came across otherwise than a lady having authority in own school within own precinct did know how to surround with dignity felt who approached there grace crawley a heard simple question miss prettyman have asked unconsciously acknowledged strength of woman manner already stood rebuked for having proposed plan so ungracious so unnecessary so unwise think ought to be with mamma at present said grace mother have sister with yes miss prettyman jane be there if there be other reason can not think that can be held to be reason now of course mother must like to have always unless must be married then there be reason why must not be so of course there be think be if know that there be to be known think say that there can be good ground for leaving now just now then grace sat silent for moment gathering courage collecting word after spoke be because of papa because of charge grace know what be going to say miss prettyman be think know if will hear may be sure that know

remaining here ca remain be determined to go mind miss anne ca bear to have girl looking at servant then miss prettyman paused awhile thinking what word of wisdom must be most appropriate in present conjuncture word of wisdom did not seem to come easily to having for moment be banished by tenderness of heart come here love said at last come here grace slowly grace got up from seat came round stood by miss prettyman elbow miss prettyman pushed chair little back pushed little forward stretching out one hand placed arm round grace waist with other took hold of grace hand thus drew down kissed girl forehead lip then grace found kneeling at friend foot grace said do not know that love do not know that love dearly in answer to grace kissed withered hand held in hers while warm tear trickled down upon miss prettyman knuckle love a though be own exclaimed schoolmistress will not trust that know what be best for illustration love a though be own said schoolmistress must go home said grace of course will if think right at last let talk of one in house know have slightest suspicion that father have done anything be in least dishonourable know that have not have anne miss prettyman said a though one in house beyond herself sister have right to have opinion on subject know said grace well dear if think so servant miss prettyman if servant in house say word to offend will will say anything miss prettyman look indeed 'd better go home indeed have think mother have care enough upon burden enough without having mouth to feed head to shelter have thought of grace yes have a for work whilst be not quite well will not be troubled with teaching have old paper want copying settling will sit here do just for employment anne know that have long wanted to have done will tell that have kindly promised to do for said grace must go home be still kneeling at miss prettyman knee still holding miss prettyman hand then at moment there came tap at door gentle yet not humble tap acknowledged on part of tapper supremacy in room of lady who be sitting there still claimed admittance almost a right tap be well known by of to be tap of miss anne grace immediately jumped up miss prettyman settled in chair with motion almost seemed to indicate feeling of shame a to late position suppose may come in said miss anne opening door inserting head yes may come in if have anything to say said miss prettyman with air seemed to be intended to assert supremacy in truth be simply collecting wisdom dignity have be somewhat dissipated by tenderness did not know that grace crawley be here said miss anne grace crawley be here said miss prettyman what be matter grace said miss anne seeing tear never mind now said miss prettyman poor dear be sure be sorry a though be own sister said anne annabella want to speak to especially to in private yes to in private if grace wo mind then grace prepared to go a be going miss anne upon whose brow heavy burden of thought be lying stopped suddenly grace dear said go upstairs into room will not across hall to school why must go to school said miss prettyman miss anne paused moment then answered unwillingly a though driven to make reply knew to be indiscreet because there be somebody in hall go to room dear said miss prettyman grace went to room never turning eye down towards hall who be said miss prettyman major grantly be here asking to see said miss anne chapter vii miss prettyman private room illustration major grantly when threatened by father with pecuniary punishment must demean by marriage a that have proposed to have declared that must offer hand to miss crawley on next morning however have not done have not done partly because did not quite believe father threat partly because felt that threat be almost justified for present moment by circumstance in grace crawley father have placed henry grantly acknowledged a drove home on morning after dinner at rectory that in matter of marriage did owe much to family must marry at owed to to marry lady grace crawley so told be lady owed to to bring among a wife woman who must not disgrace by education manner even by personal appearance in respect grace crawley be in judgment quite a good a have right to expect to be in respect great deal superior to type of womanhood with have be most generally conversant if everybody have due sister be fit to hold candle to said to must be acknowledged therefore that be really in love with grace crawley declared to over over again that family have right to demand that must marry woman with money archdeacon son by mean despised money how must having come forth a bird fledged from such nest a rectory at plumstead episcopi before have be brought by better nature true judgment to see grace crawley be greater woman of two have nearly submitted to twenty thousand pound of miss emily dunstable to good humour rosy freshness combined regarded a well to do son of very rich father only child be amply provided for felt that a regarded money have right to do a pleased felt with double strength after father threat have right to make marriage by family must be disgraced whether be right wrong in supposing that must disgrace family be to marry daughter of convicted thief be hardly necessary to discus here told that must be so telling also that by stern law of world son daughter must pay for offence of father mother even among poor who must willingly marry child of man who have be hanged carried argument beyond thinking much of matter endeavouring to think of not only justly generously if accusation against crawley be false if man be being injured by unjust charge even if grantly must make think that girl father have not stolen money then must dare everything go on know that argument be good that mind be logical in matter ought to have felt that own judgment a to man guilt be le likely to be correct than of whose duty be must be to form to express judgment on matter a to grace be equally innocent whether father be guilty not guilty if be to be debarred from asking for hand by feeling for father mother must hardly have trusted to own skill in ascertaining real truth a to alleged theft be not logical thus meaning to be generous became unjust found that among in silverbridge whom presumed to be best informed on such matter there be growing opinion that mr crawley have stolen money be intimate with walker be able to find out that mr walker knew that husband believed in clergyman guilt be by mean alone in willingness to accept mr walker opinion a true opinion silverbridge generally be endeavouring to dress in mr walker glass to believe a mr walker believed lady of silverbridge including miss prettymans be aware that mr walker have be very kind to mr mr crawley argued from mr walker must think man to be innocent henry grantly who did not dare to ask direct question of solicitor went cunningly to work closeted with mr walker with mr walker who knew well of good fortune be hovering over grace head be so nearly settling upon shoulder must have given finger to be able to whitewash mr crawley in major estimation must be supposed that told major in plain word that husband have convinced of man guilt in plain word question be asked between in plain word opinion be expressed there be look of sorrow in woman eye there be absence of reference to husband assurance that man be innocent there be air of settled grief told of own conviction major left convinced that mr walker believed mr crawley to be guilty then went to barchester not open mouthed with inquiry rather with open ear seemed to that men in barchester be of one mind there be county club in barchester at county club nine men out of ten be talking about mr crawley be by mean necessary that man must ask question on subject opinion be expressed so freely that such asking be required opinion in barchester at rate in county club seemed now to be of one mind there have be disposition at first to believe mr crawley to be innocent have be believed to be innocent even after have said wrongly that cheque have be paid to by mr soames have since stated that have received from dean arabin statement be also shown to be false man who have cheque changed on own behalf be bound at least to show where got cheque mr crawley have not only failed to do have given two false excuse henry grantly a drove home to silverbridge on sunday afternoon summed up evidence in own mind brought in verdict of guilty against father of girl whom loved on following morning walked into silverbridge called at miss prettyman house a went along heart be warmer towards grace than have ever be before have told that be now bound to abstain for father sake from doing have told father that must certainly do knew also that have said that though did not bind to miss crawley gave right to expect that must so bind miss prettyman must not be aware of what intention have be must not expect that must now be explicit have be wise man altogether must probably have abstained from saying anything at present moment wise man be in way feeling of world in such matter a there be men who will allow imaginable latitude in treatment of woman believing that world will condone amount of fault of nature so be there other men class of men on whole be more numerous of two who be tremblingly alive to danger of censure on head to danger of censure not only from others from also major grantly have done that made think imperative upon to do something further to do something at once therefore started off on monday morning after breakfast walked to silverbridge a walked built various castle in air why must not marry grace if must have take away beyond reach of father calamity why must not throw over own people altogether money position society give up to love be to do so men might say that be foolish one must hint that be dishonourable spirit be high enough to teach to think that such conduct on part must have in something of magnificence yet such be not purpose in going to miss prettyman be intention to apologize for not doing magnificent thing mind be quite made up nevertheless built castle in air so happened that encountered younger miss prettyman in hall must not at have suited to reveal to purport of visit ask to assist suit to receive apology miss anne prettyman be too common personage in silverbridge world to be fit for such employment miss anne prettyman be indeed submissive to treated with courtesy be due to superior being therefore simply asked whether must be allowed to see sister surely major grantly be think so be little early think can receive be early know a want to say word two on business oh on business be sure will see on business will only be too proud if will be kind enough to step in here for two minute then miss anne having deposited major in little parlour ran upstairs with message to sister of course be about grace crawley said to herself a went ca be about anything else wonder what be be going to say if be going to pop father in trouble be finest fellow ever trod such be thought a tapped at door announced in presence of grace that there be somebody in hall be major grantly whispered anne a soon a grace have shut door behind so supposed by telling not to go into hall what have come to say how on earth can tell that annabella suppose can have only one thing to say after have come gone can only have come with one object must have come to for that must have asked to see never go out now ca see must have gone to over at hogglestock said miss prettyman of course must come up now be here must mind telling will ring bell will tell need not make more fuss than necessary with servant know suppose 'd better not come back with there be tone of supplication in younger sister voice a made last suggestion ought to have melted heart of elder be unavailing a have asked to see think have better not said annabella miss anne prettyman bore cross meekly offered argument on subject returning to little parlour where have left major brought upstairs ushered into sister room without even entering again major grantly be a intimately acquainted with miss anne prettyman a man under thirty may well be with lady nearer fifty than forty who be not specially connected with by family tie of miss prettyman knew personally very much le miss prettyman a have before be said did not go out be therefore not common to eye of silverbridgians did occasionally see friend in own house grace crawley lover a major have come to be called have be there on more than one occasion of real personal intimacy between there have hitherto existed none might have spoken perhaps dozen word to in life have now more than dozen to speak to hardly knew how to commence have got up curtseyed have then taken hand asked to sit down sister tell that want to see said in softest mildest voice do miss prettyman want to speak to about matter trouble very much very much indeed anything can do major grantly thank yes know that be very good must not have ventured to come to indeed must trouble now of course if be only about know very well what great friend be to miss crawley yes be love grace dearly here so do said major bluntly love dearly too then paused a though thought that miss prettyman ought to take up speech miss prettyman seemed to think differently be obliged to go on know whether have ever heard about noticed felt that be very awkward blushed major a be blushed a sat before old woman trying to tell story not knowing how to tell truth be miss prettyman have done ask to be wife now have come terrible affair about father be terrible affair major grantly very terrible by jove may say that of course mr crawley be a innocent in matter a be think so miss prettyman think so feel quite sure of what clergyman of church of england pious hard working country clergyman whom have known among by good work for year suddenly turn thief pilfer few pound be not possible major grantly father of such daughter too be not possible may do for men of business to think so lawyer such like who be obliged to think in accordance with evidence a call to mind idea be monstrous know how got care be quite sure did not steal heard of anybody becoming so base a at once major be startled by eloquence by indignant tone of voice in be expressed seemed to tell that must give sympathy in have come to say to to upbraid already in that be not prepared to do magnificent thing of have thought when have be building castle in air why must not do magnificent thing miss prettyman eloquence be so strong that convinced that barchester club mr walker have come to wrong conclusion after how doe miss crawley bear asked desirous of postponing for while declaration of own purpose be very unhappy of course not that think evil of father of course doe not think guilty nobody think so in house major grantly said little woman very imperiously grace be naturally enough very sad very sad indeed think can ask to see to day be not thinking of said major poor dear girl be great trial for do wish to give message major grantly moment have now come in must say that have come to say little woman waited for answer a be there within power a be must speak fear that what said will not be approved by strong minded reader fear that lover will henceforth be considered by one a being weak wishy washy man who have hardly mind of own to speak of be man of account a poor people say miss prettyman what message ought to send to said nay major grantly how can tell that how can put word into mouth be word said feeling how can tell feeling of heart oh a for know what feeling be do love with heart do indeed fortnight ago be only thinking whether must accept when asked wondering whether be too old for whether must mind having edith to take care of be very fond of edith very fond indeed be said major more distracted than ever why must not do magnificent thing after be great charge for young girl when marries be great charge very great charge be for to think whether must entrust so great charge to one so young have fear about at must have a ask have known grace well thoroughly be quite sure that will do duty in state of life to may please god to call major be aware when be said to that have not come to miss prettyman for character of girl loved yet be not angry at receiving be neither angry even indifferent accepted character almost gratefully though felt that be being led away from purpose consoled for however by remembering that path by miss prettyman be now leading led to magnificent to pleasant castle in air have be building a walked into silverbridge be quite sure that be that say replied indeed have made up mind about long ago what can do for major grantly think ought not to see will ask if please have such trust in judgment must leave altogether to own discretion magnificent thing must be done major made up mind accordingly something of regret came over spirit a thought of father in law disgraced degraded of own father broken hearted now there be hardly alternative left to be not manly thing for to do have loved girl before trouble have come upon be not bound to accept burden love have brought with will see said at once if will let ask to be wife must see alone then miss prettyman paused hitherto have undoubtedly be playing fish cautiously rather young friend fish perhaps may say cunningly have descended to artifice on behalf of girl whom loved admired pitied have seen way into man mind have be partly aware of purpose of infirmity of purpose of double purpose have perceived that word from might help grace chance have led man on till have committed at rate to in doing have be actuated by friendship rather than by abstract principle now when moment have come in must decide upon action paused be right for sake of of that offer of marriage must be made at such moment a might be very well in regard to future time that major must have so committed saw something of man spirit believed that having gone so far having so far told love must return to love hereafter let result of crawley trial be what might must be proper time for love making though grace loved man a miss prettyman knew well though grace loved child having allowed to long to call own though marriage must be making of grace fortune a who loved must hardly have hoped that must ever have be made must certainly refuse man if be to propose to now must refuse then man must be free free to change mind if thought fit considering thing craftily in exercise of friendship too cunningly fear to satisfy claim of high morality resolved that major have better not see miss crawley at present moment miss prettyman paused before replied when did speak major grantly have risen from chair be standing with back to fire major grantly said will see if please if plea doubt whether answer at moment a must be that must wish to receive think must refuse think that must accept now must feel be sure must feel that hour of father sorrow be not hour in love must be offered accepted will however see if please major allowed moment for thought a thought sighed grace crawley became more beautiful in eye than ever be endowed by word from miss prettyman with new charm brighter virtue than have seen before let come what might must ask to be wife on future day if did not so ask now for present perhaps have better be guided by miss prettyman then will not see said think will be wiser course of course knew before loved thought so major grantly intended to ask to be wife well since put question to so plainly must confess that a grace friend must not quite have let thing go on a have gone though be not at disposed to interfere with girl whom believe to be pure good a know to be still must hardly have be justified in letting thing go a have gone if have not believed that such be purpose wanted to set right with miss prettyman be right with quite right got up gave hand be fine noble hearted gentleman hope that grace may live to be happy wife mother of darling child mother of other child see how woman must have happier lot in life will give grace love will tell at rate that have be here that have inquired after with greatest kindness will understand what mean without word of love can do anything for for father mean in way of money mind mentioning to miss prettyman will tell that be ready to do if anything can be done for feel doubt that mystery will be cleared up at last then if will come here will be so glad to see will at least then major went miss prettyman actually descended with into hall bade farewell most affectionately before sister two of maid who came out to open door miss anne prettyman when saw great friendship with major be dismissed must not contain asked most impudent question in whisper indeed in such whisper that sharp eared maid servant must hear understand be settled asked when sister have ascended only first flight of stair have popped look with elder sister punished dismayed younger must not have borne for twenty pound simply looked said nothing passed on when have regained room rang bell desired servant to ask miss crawley to be good enough to step to poor miss anne retired discomforted into solitude of one of lower room sat for minute alone recovering from shock of sister anger at rate have popped said to herself a made way back to school after miss prettyman miss crawley be closeted together for about hour what passed between need not be repeated here word for word may be understood that miss prettyman said more than ought to have said that grace understood that ought to have understood man ever behaved with more considerate friendship more like gentleman said miss prettyman be sure be very good be so glad did not ask to see said grace then grace went away miss prettyman sat awhile in thought considering what have done not without sting of conscience major grantly a walked home be not altogether satisfied with though gave credit for diplomacy think deserved felt that miss prettyman world in general must world in general ever hear anything about must give credit for having behaved well that have obtained credit without committing to necessity of marrying daughter of thief must thing turn out badly in regard to father robbed of pleasure come from real success have not treated grace crawley with perfect generosity love owes be in degree ashamed of felt however that might probably have grace must choose to ask for when trouble must have passed by will said to a entered gate of own paddock saw child in perambulator before nurse will ask sooner later let thing go a may then took perambulator under own charge for hour to satisfaction of nurse of child of chapter viii mr crawley be taken to silverbridge have become necessary on monday morning that mr crawley must obtain from husband undertaking that must present before magistrate at silverbridge on thursday have be made to

accomplish of mr crawley first declared that must have nothing to do with attorney a to that seemed to have made up mind beforehand saw at once that have hope of shaking when found that be equally obstinate in other matter that declared that must not go before magistrate unless be made to do so unless policeman came fetched then almost sank beneath burden of trouble for while be disposed to let thing go a must how must strive to bear load be so manifestly too heavy for shoulder on sunday poor man have exerted to get through sunday duty have succeeded have succeeded so well that wife have thought that thing might yet come right with that must remember before be too late true history of unhappy bit of paper that be rising above half madness for month past have afflicted on sunday evening when be tired with work thought best to say nothing to about magistrate business of thursday on monday morning commenced task feeling that owed to mr walker to lose more time be very decided in manner made understand that must employ lawyer on own behalf why must want lawyer have done nothing wrong said then tried to make understand that many who may have done nothing wrong require lawyer aid who be to pay asked to replied unfortunately that there must be need of thinking of at once be to get further into debt said be to put right before world by incurring debt know can never pay when have be question of food for child have be weak will not be weak in such matter a will have lawyer did not regard denial on part a very material though must fain have followed mr walker advice have be able when later in day declared that police must fetch then spirit gave way early in morning have seemed to assent to expediency of going into silverbridge on thursday be not till after have worked into rage about proposed attorney that utterly refused to make journey during whole day however state be such a almost to break wife heart must hing must not go to school even stir beyond house door must not open book must not eat must even sit at table say accustomed grace when scanty mid day meal be placed upon table nothing be blessed to said when wife pressed to say word for child sake will say that thank god when heart be thankless will serve child by lie then for hour sat in same position in old arm chair hanging over fire speechless sleepless thinking ever a well knew of injustice of world hardly dared to speak to so great be bitterness of word when be goaded to reply at last late in evening feeling that must be duty to send in to mr walker early on following morning laid hand gently on shoulder asked for promise may tell mr walker that will be there on thursday no said shouting at will have such message sent started back trembling not that be accustomed to tremble at way

man will not come to then arose from chair stretched forth hand to hat a though be going forth immediately on way to silverbridge night be now pitch dark rain be falling abroad must encounter severity of pitiless winter still might have be better that must have gone exercise fresh air even wet mud must have served to bring back mind to reason wife thought of misery of journey of scanty clothing of worn boot of need there be to preserve raiment wore remembered that be fasting that have eaten nothing since morning that be not fit to be alone stopped therefore before must reach door bidding will be done said of course tell then that must seek here if want josiah think of parish of people who respect for sake let not be said that be taken away by policeman be st paul not bound in prison did think of what people might see if be necessary must encourage to bear without murmur be necessary whether murmur murmur murmur indeed why doe not voice ascend to heaven with one loud wail against cruelty of man then went forth from room into empty chamber on other side of passage wife when followed there after few minute found on knee with forehead against floor with hand clutching at scanty hair of head often before have seen so on same spot half grovelling half prostrate in prayer reviling in agony thing around nay nearly thing above yet striving to reconcile to creator by humiliation of confession might be better with now if only must bring to softness of heart softly closed door placing candle on mantel shelf softly knelt beside softly touched hand with hers did not stir utter word seemed to clutch at thin lock more violently than before then kneeling there aloud with low voice with thin hand clasped uttered prayer in asked god to remove from husband bitterness of hour listened till have finished then rose slowly to foot be in vain said be in vain be in vain then returned back to parlour seating again in arm chair remained there without speaking till past midnight at last when told that be very cold reminded that for last hour there have be no fire still speechless went up with to bed early on following morning contrived to let know that be about to send neighbour son over with note to mr walker fearing to urge further to change mind hoping that might express purpose of doing so when heard that letter be to be sent took notice whatever of word at

mr champion to back dear ludovic do put in way never mind have special dislike to champion only a be not paid five thousand year for trouble be rather hard that must have to do work of opposition bishop in diocese be felt by including lord lufton who became so interested in matter a to forgive black coat before evening be over that matter of mr crawley committal be very serious demanded full energy of party be known to that feeling at palace be inimical to mr crawley that beelzebub hate for poverty because arabin brought into diocese said archdeacon permitting to use very strong language in allusion to bishop wife must be recorded on behalf that used phrase in presence only of gentleman of party think might have whispered word into ear of confidential friend old lady lufton perhaps have given offence must not have ventured to use such word aloud in presence of lady forget archdeacon said dr thorne laughing that beelzebub be wife particular friend not bit of said archdeacon wife know better than that tell what call if complains of name will unsay may therefore be supposed that dr thorne mr thorne archdeacon knew other intimately understood other feeling on matter be quite true that palace party be inimical to mr crawley mr crawley undoubtedly be poor have not be so submissive to episcopal authority a behoves clergyman to be whose loaf fish be scanty have raised back more than once against order emanating from palace in manner have made hair on head of bishop wife to stand almost on end have taken a much upon a though living have be worth twelve hundred year mr proudie almost a energetic in language a archdeacon have called beggarly perpetual curate must have perpetual curate dear bishop have said must know place then what can expect of creature from deanery ought to be altered dean must have patronage in diocese dean must have patronage be abuse from beginning to end dean arabin if have conscience must be doing duty at hogglestock how bishop strove to teach wife with mildest word what really ought to be dean duty how wife rejoined by teaching husband not in mildest word what ought to be bishop duty will not further inquire here fact that such dialogue took place at palace be recorded simply to show that palatial feeling in barchester ran counter to mr crawley be cause enough if other cause existed for partiality to mr crawley at framley court a have be partly explained there existed if possible even stronger ground than for adherence to crawley cause younger lady lufton have known crawleys intimately elder lady lufton have reckoned among neighbouring clerical family of acquaintance lady be therefore staunch in defence of mr crawley archdeacon have own reason reason for present kept altogether within own bosom for wishing mr crawley have never entered diocese whether perpetual curate must must not be declared to be thief must be terrible to to have to call child of perpetual curate daughter in law not le on occasion be true to order true to side in diocese true to hatred of palace believe for moment said a took place on rug before fire in drawing room when gentleman came in from wine lady understood at once what be that must believe mr crawley have for moment so usurped county that nobody thought of talking of anything else how be then said mr thorne that lord lufton husband other wiseacre at silverbridge have committed for trial because be told to do so by lawyer said dr thorne lady will never understand magistrate must act in accordance with law said lord lufton say be not guilty said mr robarts fact be that magistrate can not try question said archdeacon only hear primary evidence in case believe crawley must ever have be committed if have employed attorney instead of speaking for why did somebody make have attorney said lady lufton think attorney in world must have spoken for better than spoke for said dr thorne yet committed said wife what can do for ca pay bail send off to america jury will never find guilty said lord lufton what be truth of asked younger lady lufton then whole matter be discussed again be settled among mr crawley have undoubtedly appropriated cheque through temporary obliquity of judgment obliquity of judgment forgetfulness a to source from whence cheque have come to have picked up about house then have thought that be own said lord lufton have come to conclusion that appropriation of money have be made by one of clergy of palace by one of proudeian party must doubtless have be very loud very bitter a to iniquity of offender must have said much a to weakness of bishop wickedness of bishop wife must have declared appropriator to have be a very thief a ever picked pocket opened till be unanimous in acquittal of mr crawley have not be intention said to be thief man must be judged only by intention must now be object to induce barchester jury to look at matter in same light when come to understand how land lie said archdeacon will be all right there be not tradesman in city who doe not hate woman a though be archdeacon said wife cautioning to repress energy bill be paid by new chaplain have got be made to claim discount on leg of mutton said archdeacon arguing from fact from assertion came to conclusion that barchester jury must find mr crawley guilty be agreed on side that must not be well to trust to unassisted friendship of barchester tradesman mr crawley must be provided with legal assistance must be furnished to whether must be willing unwilling to receive that there must be difficulty be acknowledged mr crawley be known to be man not easy of persuasion with will of own with great energy of obstinacy on point chose to take up a being of importance to calling to own professional status have pleaded own cause before magistrate might be that must insist on doing same thing before judge at last mr robarts clergyman of framley be deputed from knot of crawleian advocate assembled in lady lufton drawing room to undertake duty of seeing mr crawley of explaining to that proper defence be regarded a matter appertaining to clergy gentry generally of part of country that for sake of clergy gentry defence must of course be properly conducted in such circumstance expense of defence must of course be borne by clergy gentry concerned be thought that mr robarts must put matter to mr crawley with mixture of strength of manly friendship softness of clerical persuasion a to overcome recognized difficulty of task chapter xi bishop sends inhibition tidings of mr crawley fate reached palace at barchester on afternoon of day on magistrate have committed such tidings travel very quickly conveyed by imperceptible wire distributed by indefatigable message boy whom rumour seems to supply for purpose

suppose that will have be so suppose have let out be to go about like roaring lion among soul of people bishop shook in shoe when mr proudie began to talk of soul of people always shook in shoe have eloquent way of raising voice over word soul be qualified to make ordinary man shake in shoe bishop be conscientious man well knew poor mr crawley even though might have become thief under terrible temptation must not roar at hogglestock to injury of man soul be aware that poor clergyman have done duty laboriously efficiently be also aware that though might have be committed by magistrate then let out upon bail must not be regarded now in day before trial a convicted thief to explain to mr proudie be beyond power knew well that must not hear word in mitigation of mr crawley presumed offence

devour soul a must call that be emanation of sort sent from source expressly to barchester to prevent such devouring a far a might possibly be prevented by mortal agency bishop knew understood regarded archdeacon a clergyman belonging to party opposed to party disliked man knew that from first coming into diocese have be encountered with enmity by archdeacon archdeacon friend if left to must feel to certain extent must resent such enmity have faith in wife doctrine of emanation have faith in many thing believed religiously yet what must do if attempted to explain must stop before have got through first half of first sentence if be out on bail commenced bishop of course will be out on bail then think must feel feel such men never feel what feeling can one expect from convicted

such period of misery during have wailed inwardly have confessed to that wife of bosom be too much for now storm seemed to be coming very roughly must be demanded of that must exercise certain episcopal authority knew did not belong to now episcopal authority admits of being stretched contracted according to character of bishop who us be not always easy for bishop to know what may do what

door stood with open in hand though knew mr thumble person be not acquainted with therefore simply bowed to visitor bowing more than once twice with cold courtesy did not put mr thumble altogether at ease name be mr thumble said visitor reverend caleb thumble held bishop letter in hand mr crawley seemed to take notice of letter motioned mr thumble with hand into room suppose have come over from barchester morning said mr crawley yes madam from palace mr thumble though humble man in position in felt that humility must become humble man to better a must have expressed have still about something of pride naturally belonged to clergyman who be closely attached to palace at barchester have be sent on message to plumstead must such message from barchester palace have be possible must have be properly humble in demeanour to archdeacon to mr grantly have be admitted to august presence of lady be aware that humility must not become on present mission have be expressly ordered to be firm by mr proudie firm meant to be therefore in communicating to mr crawley fact that have come from palace did load tone of voice with something of dignity mr crawley might perhaps be excused for regarding a arrogance doe 'palace want with said mr crawley mr crawley knew at once that there be to be battle nay battle have begun be altogether sorry for though must not trust husband to sit alone day in arm chair over fire must trust to carry on disputation with other clergyman on subject what doe palace want with a mr crawley asked question stood erect looked mr thumble full in face mr thumble called to mind fact that mr crawley be very poor man indeed so poor that owed money round country to butcher baker other fact that mr thumble did not owe money to one wife luckily having little income of own strengthened by remembrance endeavoured to bear mr crawley attack with gallantry of course mr crawley be aware that unfortunate affair at silverbridge be not prepared sir to discus unfortunate affair at silverbridge with stranger if be bearer of message to from bishop of barchester perhaps will deliver have brought letter said mr thumble then mr crawley stretched out hand without word taking letter with to window read very slowly when have made master of content refolded letter placed again in envelope returned to spot where mr thumble be standing will answer bishop letter said will answer of course a be fitting must do will ask to wait for reply will send by course of post think mr crawley a bishop wish to undertake duty will not undertake duty mr thumble need not trouble for will not surrender pulpit to bishop care nothing for bishop in matter so much spoke in anger then corrected crave bishop pardon a messenger if in heat occasioned by strong feeling have said aught may savour of irreverence towards lordship office respect lordship high position a bishop of diocese bow to command in thing lawful must not bow to in thing unlawful must abandon duty before god at bidding unless bidding be given in accordance with canon of church law of land will be duty on coming sunday to lead prayer of people in church of parish to preach to from pulpit that duty with god assistance will perform will allow clergyman to interfere with in performance of sacred office not though bishop must be present with object of enforcing illegal command mr crawley spoke word without hesitation even with eloquence standing upright with something of noble anger gleaming over poor wan face think that while speaking be happier than have be for many long day mr thumble listened to patiently standing with one foot little in advance of other with one hand folded over other with head rather on one side with eye fixed on corner where wall ceiling joined other have be told to be firm be considering how might best display firmness thought that remembered story of two parson fighting for one pulpit thought also that must not like to incur scandal of such proceeding in diocese a to law in matter knew nothing presumed that bishop must probably know law better than perpetual curate mr proudie be intemperate imperious be aware have message come from alone might have felt that even for sake have better give way a despotic arrogance of lady have be in case backed by timid presence hesitating word of lord mr thumble thought that must have law on side think will find mr crawley said that bishop inhibition be strictly legal have picked up powerful word from mr proudie flattered that might be of use to in carrying purpose be illegal said mr crawley speaking somewhat louder than before will be absolutely futile a pleaded to that own personal convenience be concerned in matter have made known intention to otherwise must have made known only to bishop if please will discus subject further be to understand mr crawley that refuse to obey bishop bishop have written to sir will make known intention to bishop by written answer a have be bearer of bishop letter to be bound to ask whether will be indebted to for carrying back reply whether will send by course of post mr thumble considered for moment then made up mind that have better wait carry back epistle be friday letter must not be delivered by post till saturday morning mr proudie might be angry with if must be cause of loss of time did not however at like waiting having perceived that mr crawley though with language courteously worded have spoken of a mere messenger think said that may perhaps best further object must have in view that namely of providing properly for sunday service of church of hogglestock by taking reply personally to bishop provision be care need trouble one else said mr crawley in loud voice then before seating at old desk stood awhile pondering with back turned to visitor have to ask pardon sir said looking round for moment because by reason of extreme poverty of house wife be unable to offer to that hospitality be especially due from one clergyman to oh mention said mr thumble if will allow sir must prefer that must be mentioned then seated at desk commenced letter mr thumble felt to be awkwardly placed have there be third person in room must have sat down in mr crawley arm chair waited patiently till letter must be finished mr crawley be there of course be bound to speak to in what strain must do so even little a be given to indulge in sentiment have be touched by man appeal to own poverty felt moreover that mr crawley must have be deeply moved by husband position with reference to bishop order be quite out of question that must speak of a mr crawley must be well aware immediately turn upon at last thought of subject spoke with voice intended to be pleasant be school house passed probably just a came here mr crawley told that be school house ah yes thought so have certified teacher here mr crawley explained that government aid have ever reached hogglestock besides have only young woman whom have instructed ah be pity said mr thumble be certified teacher said mr crawley turning round upon from chair oh ah yes said mr thumble after mr thumble asked more question about hogglestock school soon afterwards mr crawley left

obey command have laid upon with reference to service of church in parish can not permit mr thumble other delegate from lordship to usurp place in pulpit must not have to think if can possibly dispel such thought from mind that disregard high office that be deficient in respectful obedience to bishop set over be due to authority of crown a head of church in realm in a in question of obedience who be required to obey must examine extent of authority exercised by who demand obedience lordship might possibly call upon using voice a bishop of diocese to abandon altogether freehold right be now

decision in respect lordship have taken action against so quickly might have equally strained authority in case in land be be subject bound to obey further than where law give authority exacts obedience be not in power of crown to inhibit from performance of ordinary duty in parish by such missive a sent to by lordship if lordship think right to stop mouth a clergyman in diocese must

house inquired of a to thing be particularly near to bishop sent though ten bishop have sent council of archbishop if will mr thumble started back appalled at energy of word used to will man have nothing of own sorrow in heart care in family thought in breast so private special to that if happen to be clergyman bishop may touch with thumb be not bishop thumb said mr thumble drawing up intended

even lady in silverbridge be beginning to give up cause acknowledging that money must not have come rightfully into hand excusing on plea of partial insanity have picked up put by for month then thought that be own lady of silverbridge must find nothing better to say for than when young mr walker remarked that such little mistake be customary cause of men being taken to prison lady of silverbridge did not know how to answer have come to be opinion that mr crawley be affected with partial lunacy ought to be forgiven in one to whom world have be so cruel when young mr walker endeavoured to explain to that man must be sane altogether mad altogether that mr crawley must if sane be locked up a thief if mad locked up a madman sighed be convinced that until world must have be improved by new infusion of romance stronger feeling of poetic justice mr john walker be right result of general opinion made way out to major grantly made way also to archdeacon at plumstead a to major in giving due must be explained that more certain became of father guilt more certain also became of daughter merit be very hard whole thing be cruelly hard be cruelly hard upon that must be

desk pulpit be occupied by lot of brickmakers among whom parson from barchester did not venture to attempt to make way although be fortified by presence of one of cathedral verger by one of palace

said major certainly not without leave said mr thorne know that be soul of honour chapter xv up in london illustration kind attentive reader may perhaps remember that miss grace crawley in letter written by to friend miss lily dale said word two of certain john if can only be a john wish same reader if there be one so kind attentive may also remember that miss lily dale have declared in reply that about other subject must rather say nothing then have added when one think of going beyond friendship even if one try to do so there be so many barrier from word kind attentive reader if such reader be in such matter intelligent a well a kind attentive may have learned great deal with reference to miss lily dale will now pay visit to john in question certain mr john eames living in bachelor a intelligent reader will certainly have discovered cousin to miss grace crawley mr john eames at time of story be young man seven eight twenty year of age living in london where be supposed by friend in country to have made mark to be something little out of common way know that be very much out of common way except in fact that have have few thousand pound left by old nobleman who have be in way related to who have regarded with great affection who have died two year since before john eames have not be very poor man a filled comfortable official position of private secretary to chief commissioner of income tax board drew salary of three hundred fifty pound year from resource of country when in addition to source of official wealth became known a undoubted possessor of hundred twenty eight share in one of most prosperous joint stock bank in metropolis property have be left to free of legacy duty by lamented nobleman above named then mr john eames rose very high indeed a young man in estimation of who knew be supposed to be something good deal out of common way mother who lived in country be obedient to slightest word never venturing to impose upon sign of parental authority to sister mary eames who lived with mother be almost god upon earth to sister who have nothing of own not even special god for own individual worship generous affectionate unmarried brother with sufficient income be god upon earth even up in london mr john eames be somebody be so especially at office although indeed be remembered by many man how raw lad have be when first came there not so very many year ago how have laughed at played trick how have customarily be known to be without shilling for last week before pay day during period must borrow sixpence here shilling there with great energy from men who now felt to be honoured when smiled upon little story of former day must often be told of behind back be not told with ill nature because be very constant in referring to same matter be acknowledged by one at office neither friendship of nobleman fact of private secretaryship acquisition of wealth have made proud to old companion forgetful of old friendship to young men lad who have lately be appointed be perhaps little cold then be only reasonable to conceive one a mr john eames be now must not be expected to make intimate acquaintance with new clerk might be brought into office since competitive examination have come into vogue there be knowing who might be introduced be understood generally through establishment may almost say by civil service at large so wide be fame that mr eames be very averse to whole theory of competition devil take hindmost scheme called must then go on to explain that hindmost candidate be often best gentleman in way devil got pick of flock be respected more for opinion because be known that on subject have fought hard battle with chief commissioner chief commissioner be great believer in competition wrote paper about read aloud to various body of civil service not at to delight got to be printed here there sent by post over kingdom more than once chief commissioner have told private secretary that must part company unless private secretary must see fit to alter view must at least keep view to private secretary must do nevertheless there be still private secretary be because johnny have got money said one of young clerk who be discussing singular state of thing with brother at office when chap have got money may do what like johnny have got lot of money know young clerk in question be by mean on intimate term with mr eames there have grown up in office way of calling johnny behind back have probably come down from early day of scrape poverty now entire life of mr john eames be pervaded by great secret although never in day alluded to subject in conversation with man belonging to office yet secret be known to all have be historical for last four five year be now regarded a thing of course mr john eames be in love love be not happy be in love have long be in love lady of love be not kind to little history have grown to be very touching pathetic having received doubt embellishment from imagination of gentleman of income tax office be said of that have be in love from early boyhood that at sixteen have be engaged under sanction of nobleman now deceased of young lady parent that contract of betrothal have be drawn up thing done very unusual in private family in day then there have come stranger into neighbourhood just a young lady be beginning to reflect whether have heart of own not that have thrown parent noble lord contract poor johnny eames to wind have here story took different direction a told by different men said lady have gone off with stranger that there have be clandestine marriage afterwards turned out to be marriage at others that stranger suddenly took off be more seen by young lady others that owned at last to having wife so on stranger be very well known to be one mr crosbie belonging to public office there be circumstance in life only half known gave rise to various rumour there be one thing certain one point a to clerk in income tax office have doubt one fact have conduced much to high position mr john eames now held in estimation of brother clerk have given mr crosbie thrashing that man have ever received such treatment before have lived through wonderful story be told about thrashing so that be believed even by least enthusiastic in such matter that poor victim have only dragged on crippled existence since encounter for nine week never said word eat mouthful said one young clerk to younger clerk who be just entering office even now ca speak above whisper have to take food in pap will be seen therefore that mr john eames have about much of heroic that be still in love in love with same lady be known to one in office when be declared of that in way of amatory expression have never in life opened mouth to woman there be in office who knew that be exaggeration mr cradell for instance who in early year have be very intimate with john eames who still kept up old friendship although being domestic man with wife six young child living on small income did not go much out among friend must have told very different story for mr cradell have in day before cradell have made good claim upon be not unadmired by cradell fellow clerk constancy of mr eames present love be doubted by none who knew be not that went about with stocking ungartered of old acknowledged sign of unrequited affection in manner be rather jovial than otherwise seemed to live happy somewhat luxurious life well contented with world around still have passion within bosom be inclined to think that be little proud of own constancy might be presumed that when miss dale wrote to friend grace crawley about going beyond friendship pleading that there be so many barrier have probably seen way over most of be not so did john eames at believe that barrier be in way to be overcome will not say that have given whole thing up a bad job because be law of life that thing never must be abandoned a long a hope be possible unless miss dale must become wife of somebody else must always regard a affianced to have so declared to miss dale to miss dale mother to dale people who have ever be interested in matter there be old lady living in miss dale neighbourhood sister of lord who have left johnny eames bank share who always fought battle for kept close look out fully resolved that john eames must be rewarded at last old lady be connected with dale by family tie therefore have mean of close observation be in constant correspondence with john eames never failed to acquaint when of barrier be in judgment giving way nature of of barrier may possibly be made intelligible to reader by following letter from lady julia de guest to young friend guestwick cottage december dear john be much obliged to for going to jones send stamp for two shilling fourpence be what owe used only to be two shilling twopence say everything have got to be dearer now suppose pill a well a other thing only think of

received one now given to reader when have read made memorandum a to commission then threw back in arm chair to think over tidings communicated to fact stated have known before lady de courcy be in london that son in law mr crosbie whose wife lady alexandrina have died twelve month since at baden baden be at variance with respecting money supposed to be due to there be that in lady julia letter be wormwood to lily dale be again thinking of man whom have loved in old day who have treated with monstrous perfidy be very well for lady julia to be sure that lily dale must never desire to see mr crosbie again john eames be by mean equally certain that must be so tidings of death disturbed said johnny repeating to certain word out of old lady letter know disturbed wish must have lived for ever if ever venture to show within ten mile of allington will see if can not do better than did last time met then there came knock at door private secretary finding to be somewhat annoyed by disturbance at moment bade intruder enter in angry voice oh be cradell be what can do for mr cradell who now entered who a before said be old ally of john eames be clerk of longer standing in department than friend in age looked to be much older have left with none of appearance of gloss of youth will stick for many year to men who be fortunate in worldly affair indeed may be said that mr cradell be

sunday after mr thumble first visit to parish have not be described with absolute accuracy by archdeacon in letter to son by mr thorne there have be no footman from palace in attendance on mr thumble have there be battle with brickmakers have mr thumble be put under pump mr thumble have gone over taking gown surplice with on sunday morning have intimated to mr crawley intention of performing service mr crawley in answer to have assured mr thumble that must not be allowed to open mouth in church mr thumble not seeing way to further successful action have contented with attending service in surplice making thereby silent protest that not mr crawley ought to have be in reading desk pulpit when mr thumble reported failure at palace strove hard to avoid seeing mr proudie not successfully knew something of palace habit did manage to reach bishop alone on sunday evening justifying to lordship for such interview by remarkable circumstance of case importance of late mission mr proudie always went to church on sunday evening making point of hearing three service three sermon sunday of life on week day seldom heard having idea week day service be invention of high church enemy that must therefore be vehemently discouraged service on saint day regarded a rank papacy have be known to accuse clergyman wife to face of idolatry because poor lady have dated letter st john eve mr thumble on sunday evening be successful in finding bishop at home alone be not lucky enough to get away before mr proudie returned bishop perhaps thought that story of failure have better reach wife ear from mr thumble lip than from own well mr thumble said mr proudie walking into study armed in full sunday evening winter panoply in have just descended from carriage church mr proudie attended in evening be nearly mile from palace coachman groom never got holiday on sunday night be gorgeous in dark brown silk dress of awful stiffness terrible dimension on shoulder wore short cloak of velvet fur very handsome withal so swelling in proportion on side a necessarily to create more of dismay than of admiration in mind of ordinary man bonnet be monstrous helmet with beaver up displaying awful face of warrior always ready for combat careless to guard from attack large contorted bow bore be a grisly crest upon casque beautiful doubtless majestic fear compelling in hand carried armour complete prayer book bible book of hymn footman have brought for to study door have thought fit to enter husband room with in own custody well mr thumble said mr thumble did not answer at once thinking probably that bishop might choose to explain circumstance did bishop say thing well mr thumble said again then stood looking at man who have failed so disastrously have explained to bishop said mr crawley have be contumacious very contumacious indeed preached at hogglestock indeed mr proudie must have be possible unless have have police to assist then must have have police never heard of anything so mismanaged in life never in life put book down on study table turned round from mr thumble towards bishop if thing go on like lord said authority in diocese will very soon be worth nothing at be not often that mr proudie called husband lord when did do so be sign terrible time have come time so terrible that bishop must know that must either fight fly must almost endure anything rather than descend into arena for purpose of doing battle with wife occasion must come now again when even alternative of flight be hardly left to dear began bishop be to understand that man have professed to be altogether indifferent to bishop prohibition said mr proudie interrupting husband addressing mr thumble quite so seemed to think that bishop have lawful power in matter at said mr thumble do hear that lord said mr proudie have said bishop almost weeping a spoke authority in own diocese none to silence man merely by own judgment thought still think that be for gentleman own interest a well a for credit of church that provision must be made for duty during present present difficulty difficulty indeed everybody know that man have be thief dear know never know anything bishop mean to say that know officially of course have heard sad story though hope may not be there be doubt about truth world know have stolen twenty pound yet be to be allowed to desecrate church imperil soul of people bishop got up from chair began to walk backwards forward through room with short quick step only want five day to christmas day continued mr proudie something must be done at once say nothing a to propriety impropriety of being out on bail a be affair of ours when heard that have be bailed by beneficed clergyman of diocese of course knew where to look for man who must act with so much impropriety of course be not surprised when found that person belonged to framley a have said before be business of ours hope mr thumble that bishop will never be found interfering with ordinary law of land be very sure that will never do so by advice when there come question of inhibiting clergyman who have committed a clergyman unfortunately have done then say that clergyman ought to be inhibited bishop walked up down room throughout whole of speech gradually step became quicker turn became shorter now here be christmas day upon what be to be done with word mr proudie finished speech mr thumble said bishop perhaps have better now retire be very sorry that must have have so thankless so disagreeable task why must mr thumble retire asked mr proudie think better said bishop mr thumble good night then mr thumble did retire mr proudie stood forth in full panoply of armour silent awful with helmet erect vouchsafed recognition of parting salutation with mr thumble greeted dear truth be understand matter said bishop a soon a door be closed know how limited be power bishop understand great deal better than people understand also what be due to manner in ought to be treated by in presence of subordinate clergy of diocese will not however remain here to be insulted in presence in absence of one then conquered amazon collected together weapon have laid upon table took departure with majestic step not without clang of arm bishop when be left alone enjoyed for few moment triumph of victory then be left so very much alone when looked round about upon solitude after departure of wife remembered that must not see again till must encounter on ground be own regretted own success be tempted to follow to apologize be unable to do anything alone must not even know how to get tea a very servant must ask question if be to do so unaccustomed thing a to order to be brought up to in solitude must tell that mr proudie be having tea in little sitting room upstairs else that thing be laid in drawing room did wander forth to latter apartment hoping that might find wife there drawing room be dark deserted so wandered back again be grand thing certainly to have triumphed over wife there be crumb of comfort in thought that have vindicated before mr thumble general result be not comforting knew from of old how short lived triumph must be wretched a be during evening did employ with energy after much thought resolved that must again write to mr crawley summon to appear at palace in doing must at rate be doing something there must be action though mr crawley must a thought decline to obey order something must be gained even by disobedience so wrote summons sitting very comfortless alone on sunday evening dating letter however for following day palace december reverend sir have just heard from mr thumble that have declined to accede to advice thought duty to tender to a bishop who have be set over by church that yesterday insisted on what believed to be right to administer service in parish church of hogglestock have occasioned deepest regret be think unavailing must further write to mind upon subject a posse such strong evidence that written word will not be respected by have therefore alternative now to invite to come to here do hoping may induce to listen to authority can not suppose acknowledge to be vested in office hold will be glad to see on to morrow tuesday a near hour of two a can make convenient to yourself to be here will take care to order refreshment will be provided for horse be reverend sir c c c tho barnum dear said when did again encounter wife night have written to mr crawley thought might a well bring up copy of letter wash hand of whole affair said mr proudie of whole affair will look at letter certainly not why must look at letter word go for nothing have done what must in vain now let see how will manage bishop did not pas comfortable night in morning wife did read letter after thing went little smoother with be pleased to say that considering thing seeing a must not help seeing that matter have be dreadfully mismanaged that great weakness have be displayed seeing that fault have already be committed perhaps better step must now be taken than proposed in letter suppose will not come said bishop think will said mr proudie trust that may be able to convince obedience will be best course will be more humble minded here than at hogglestock in saying lady showed knowledge of general nature of clergyman of world at large understood how much louder cock can crow in own farmyard than elsewhere knew that episcopal authority backed by solemn awe of palatial grandeur go much further than will do when sent under fold of ordinary envelope though understood ordinary human nature may be that did not understand mr crawley nature be at rate right in idea a to mr crawley immediate reply palace groom who rode over to hogglestock returned with immediate answer lord said mr crawley will obey lordship summons unless impediment must arise will wait upon lordship at hour name to morrow will not trespass on hospitality for rarely break bread in house own a to horse have none have honour to be lord c c josiah crawley of course will go have said to wife a soon a have have time to read letter make known to content will go if be possible for to get there think that be bound to comply with bishop wish in so much a how will get there josiah will walk with lord aid now hogglestock be fifteen mile from barchester mr crawley be a wife well knew by mean fitted in present state for great physical exertion from tone in have replied to well knew that must not avail for to remonstrate at moment have walked more than thirty mile in day since have be living at hogglestock did not doubt that might be possible for to do again scheme might be able to devise for saving from so terrible journey in middle of winter must be pondered over silently brought to bear if not slyly at least deftly without discussion made reply therefore when declared that on following day must walk to barchester back with lord aid did see ask to see note sent to bishop when messenger be gone mr crawley be alert looking forward with evident glee to encounter with bishop snorting like racehorse at expected triumph of coming struggle read much greek with jane on afternoon pouring into young ear almost with joyous rapture appreciation of glory pathos humanity a also of awful tragedy of story of oedipus very soul be on fire at idea of clutching weak bishop in hand crushing with strong grasp in afternoon mr crawley slipped out to neighbouring farmer wife returned in hour time with little story did not tell with appearance of eager satisfaction have learned well what be little trick necessary to carrying of such matter a have now in hand mr mangle farmer a happened be going to morrow morning in tax cart a far a framley mill must be delighted if mr crawley must take seat must remain at best part of afternoon hoped that mr crawley must take seat back again now framley mill be only mile off direct road to barchester be almost half way from hogglestock parsonage to city must at rate bring walk within practicable distance mr crawley be instantly placed upon guard like animal see bait suspect trap have be told that farmer mangle be going way to barchester nothing must have induced to get into cart must have felt sure that farmer mangle have be persuaded to pity in poverty strait must sooner have started to walk to london than have put foot upon step of cart lift way did look to a though be really fortuitous wife must hardly have be cunning enough to persuade farmer to go to framley conscious that trap must have be suspected have bait be made more full fear fear dear good woman have be thus cunning have understood how far trap might be baited have thus succeeded in catching prey on following morning consented to get into farmer mangle cart be driven a far a framley mill must think nowt reverence of running over into barchester must powny be so mortial good said farmer mangle in foolish good nature illustration farmer mangle mr crawley how about business here said mr crawley farmer scratched head remembering mr crawley injunction awkwardly acknowledged to be sure own business with miller be very pressing then mr crawley descended terribly suspicious went on journey anyways reverence will call for coming back said farmer mangle mr crawley must make promise bade farmer not wait for if chanced to meet together on road might get up again if man really have business at framley how must have offered to go on to barchester be deceiving wife of bosom have deceived in such matter before now trouble in respect be soon dissipated by pride of anticipated triumph over bishop took great glory from thought that must go before bishop with dirty boot with boot necessarily dirty with rusty pantaloon that must be hot mud stained with walk hungry object to be wondered at by who must see because of misfortune have be unworthily heaped upon head whereas bishop must be sleek clean well fed pretty with prettiness be becoming to bishop outward man mr crawley must be humble whereas bishop must be very proud bishop must be in own arm chair cock in own farmyard while mr crawley must be seated afar off in cold extremity of room with nothing of outward circumstance to assist man called thither to undergo censure yet must take bishop in grasp crush crush crush a thought of walked quickly through mud put out long arm great hand far before out into air there then crushed bishop in imagination yes indeed thought very doubtful whether bishop must ever send for second time a passed through mind forgot wife cunning farmer mangle sin for moment be happy a turned corner round by lord lufton park paling who must meet old friend mr robarts parson of framley parson who have committed sin of being bail for sin be according to mr proudie view of matter be walking with hand still stretched out still crushing bishop when mr robarts be close upon what crawley upon word be very glad to see be coming up to of course thank mr robarts not to day bishop have summoned to presence be on road to barchester how be going will walk walk to barchester impossible hope not quite impossible mr robarts trust will get a far before two o'clock to do so must be on road then showed sign of desire to go on upon way without further parley crawley do let send over there be horse gig doing nothing thank mr robarts must prefer walk to day have walked from hogglestock not so neighbour coming hither who happened to have business at mill brought so far in cart walk home will be nothing nothing will enjoy good morning mr robarts mr robarts thought of dirty road of bishop presence of own idea of what must be becoming for clergyman persevered will find lane so very muddy bishop know be apt to notice such thing do be persuaded notice what thing demanded mr crawley in indignant tone perhaps rather will say how dirty shoe be when came to palace if can find nothing unclean about shoe let say worst will be very indifferent have long ceased mr robarts to care much what man woman may say about shoe good morning then stalked on clutching crushing in hand bishop bishop wife whole diocese church of england dirty shoe indeed whose be fault that there be in church so many foot soiled by unmerited poverty so many hand soiled by undeserved wealth if bishop did not like shoe let bishop dare to tell so so walked on through thick of mud by mean picking way walked fast found in close hour before time named by bishop on account must have rung palace bell one minute before two o'clock so walked up down under tower of cathedral cooled looked up at pleasant plate glass in window of house of friend dean told how in college day dean have be quite equal quite equal except by voice of qualified judge in university mr crawley have be acknowledged to be riper scholar now mr arabin of day be dean of barchester travelling abroad luxuriously at moment for delight while crawley be perpetual curate at hogglestock have now walked into barchester at command of bishop because be suspected of having stolen twenty pound when have fully imbued mind with injustice of time be up walked boldly to bishop gate boldly rang bishop bell chapter xviii bishop of barchester be crushed who inquires why be that little greased flour rubbed in among hair on footman head just one dab here there give tone of high life to family seeing that thing be so easily done why more people attempt tax on hair powder be thirteen shilling year may indeed be that slightest dab in world justifies wearer in demanding hot meat three time day wine at rate on sunday think however that bishop wife may enjoy privilege without such heavy attendant expense otherwise man who opened bishop door to mr crawley must hardly have be so ornamented man asked for card name be mr crawley said friend bishop have desired to come to at hour will be pleased to tell that be here man again asked for card be not bound to carry with name printed on ticket said mr crawley if can not remember give pen paper will write servant somewhat awed by stranger manner brought pen paper mr crawley wrote name rev josiah crawley ma perpetual curate of hogglestock be then ushered into waiting room to disappointment be not kept there waiting long within three minute be ushered into bishop study into presence of two great luminary of diocese be at first somewhat disconcerted by finding mr proudie in room in imaginary conversation with bishop have be preparing on road have conceived that bishop must be attended by chaplain have suited word to joint discomfiture of bishop of lower clergyman now line of battle must be altered be doubt injury trusted to courage readiness to enable to surmount have left hat behind in waiting room kept old short cloak still upon shoulder when entered bishop room hand arm be hid beneath there be something lowly in constrained gait showed at least that have idea of being asked to shake hand with august person might meet head be somewhat bowed though great bald broad forehead showed so prominent that bishop mr proudie must drop from sight during whole interview be man who when seen must hardly be forgotten deep angry remonstrant eye shaggy eyebrow telling tale of frequent anger of anger frequent generally silent repressed indignation of habitual frown long nose large powerful mouth deep furrow on cheek general look of thought suffering combined to make appearance of man remarkable to describe to beholder at once true character one ever on seeing mr crawley took to be happy man weak man ignorant man wise man be very punctual mr crawley said bishop mr crawley simply bowed head still keeping hand beneath cloak will not take chair nearer to fire mr crawley have not seated have placed in front of chair at extreme end of room resolved that must not use unless be duly asked thank lord said be warm with walking if please will avoid fire have not walked mr crawley yes lord have be walking not from hogglestock now be matter mr crawley certainly did not mean to discus with bishop might be well for bishop to demand presence in palace must be part of bishop duty to inquire how got there that lord be matter of moment said be glad at rate have be enabled to obey lordship order in coming hither on morning hitherto mr proudie have not said word stood back in room near fire more backward good deal than be accustomed to do when clergyman made ordinary visit on such occasion must come forward shake hand with graciously graciously even if proudly have felt that must hing of kind now there must be shaking hand with man who have stolen cheque for twenty pound might probably be necessary to keep mr crawley at distance therefore have remained in background mr crawley seemed to be disposed to keep in background therefore must speak hope wife child be well mr crawley said thank madam child be well mr crawley suffers special ailment at present be much to be thankful for mr crawley whether be be not thankful for such mercy a be business of bishop of bishop wife be between god so must not even bow to civility sat with head erect with great frown on heavy brow then bishop rose from chair to speak intending to take up position on rug a did so mr crawley who have seated on intimation that be expected to sit down rose also bishop found that must thus lose expected vantage will not be seated mr crawley said bishop mr crawley smiled stood ground then bishop returned to arm chair mr crawley also sat down again mr crawley began bishop matter came other day before magistrate at silverbridge have be most unfortunate affair have given can assure most sincere pain mr crawley have made up mind how far bishop must be allowed to go without rebuke have told that must only be natural must not be unbecoming that bishop must allude to meeting of magistrate to alleged theft that therefore such allusion must be endured with patient humility moreover more rope gave bishop more likely bishop must be to entangle certainly be mr crawley wish that bishop must entangle therefore replied very meekly have be most unfortunate lord have felt for mr crawley very deeply said mr proudie mr crawley have now made up mind that a long a be possible must ignore presence of mr proudie altogether therefore made sign that have heard latter remark have be most unfortunate continued bishop have never before have clergyman in diocese placed in so distressing position be matter of opinion lord said mr crawley who at moment thought of crisis have come in life of clergyman in diocese of barchester with circumstance of have by chance be made acquainted exactly said bishop be expressing opinion mr crawley who understood fighting did not think that time have yet come for striking blow so simply bowed again most unfortunate position mr crawley continued bishop far be from to express opinion upon matter will have to come before jury of countryman be enough for to know that magistrate assembled at silverbridge gentleman to whom doubt must be known a most of live in neighbourhood have heard evidence upon subject most convincing evidence said mr proudie interrupting husband mr crawley black brow became little blacker a heard word still ignored woman not only did not speak did not turn eye upon have heard evidence on subject continued bishop have thought proper to refer decision a to innocence guilt to jury of countryman be right said mr crawley very possibly deny probably said bishop whose eloquence be somewhat disturbed by mr crawley ready acquiescence of course be right said mr proudie at rate be so said bishop be in position of man amenable to criminal law of land there be criminal law lord said mr crawley to such law a there be be amenable lordship alike be so in very particular way wish to remind what might be condition now for interposition of private friend must be in condition of man not guilty before law guiltless a far a law go kept in durance not for fault of own because otherwise by reason of laches in police presence at assize might not be ensured in position man reputation be made to hang for awhile on trust friend neighbour may have in say that test be good one must have be put in prison mr crawley because magistrate be of opinion that have taken mr soames cheque said mr proudie on occasion did look at turned one glance upon from under eyebrow did not speak with have nothing to do said bishop nothing lord said mr crawley bishop think that have said mr proudie judgment formed by magistrate a to conduct of one of clergyman make imperative upon to act in matter yes dear yes be coming to what mr proudie say be perfectly true have be constrained most unwillingly to take action in matter be undoubtedly fact that must at next assize surrender at court house yonder to be tried for offence against law be true if be alive lord have strength sufficient will be there must be there said mr proudie police will look to mr crawley be becoming very angry in man must not answer word on occasion again did not even look at yes will be there said bishop now be to say least of unseemly position for beneficed clergyman said before lord that be unfortunate position word methinks be better chosen be very unseemly very unseemly indeed said mr proudie nothing must possibly be more unseemly bishop might very properly have used much stronger word under circumstance continued bishop looking to welfare of parish to welfare of diocese allow to say mr crawley to welfare of yourself also especially to soul of people said mr proudie bishop shook head be hard to be impressively eloquent when one be interrupted at best turned period even by supporting voice yes looking of course to religious interest of people mr crawley came to conclusion that must be expedient that must cease ministration for awhile bishop paused mr crawley bowed head therefore sent over to gentleman with whom be well acquainted mr thumble with letter from myself in endeavoured to impress upon without use of severe language what conviction be severe word be often best mercy said mr proudie mr crawley have raised hand with finger out preparatory to answering bishop a mr proudie have spoken dropped finger be silent mr thumble brought back written reply continued bishop by be grieved to find that be not willing to submit to counsel in matter be most unwilling lord submission to authority be at time duty at time opposition to authority be duty also opposition to just authority can not be duty mr crawley opposition to usurped authority be imperative duty said mr crawley who be to be judge demanded mr proudie then there be silence for while when a mr crawley made reply lady repeated question will be pleased to answer question sir who in case be to be judge mr crawley did not please to answer question man be obstinate said mr proudie have better proceed said bishop mr thumble brought back reply grieved greatly be contumacious indecent said mr proudie bishop again shook head looked so unutterably miserable that smile came across mr crawley face after others besides have trouble trial mr proudie saw understood smile became more angry than ever drew chair close to table began to fidget with finger among paper have never before encountered clergyman so contumacious so indecent so unreverend so upsetting have have to do with men difficult to manage archdeacon for instance archdeacon have never be so impertinent to a man have quarrelled once openly with chaplain of husband clergyman whom have introduced to husband who have treated very badly not so badly not with such unscrupulous violence a be now encountering from ill clothed beggarly man perpetual curate with dirty broken boot already half convicted thief such be idea of mr crawley conduct to while be fingering paper simply because mr crawley must not speak to forget where be said bishop oh mr thumble came back received letter of course received be surprised to learn from that in spite of what have occurred at silverbridge be still anxious to continue usual sunday ministration in church be determined must do duty at hogglestock a long a might be left there to do said mr crawley duty said mr proudie just moment dear said bishop when sunday came have alternative to send mr thumble over again to hogglestock occurred to to mr proudie will tell mr crawley just now what have occurred to said mr proudie yes just so be sure that will take in good part occurred to mr crawley that first letter might have be written in haste be written in haste lord messenger be waiting yes just so well so sent again hoping that might be accepted a messenger of peace be most disagreeable mission for gentleman mr crawley most disagreeable lord refused permission to obey instruction have given must not let read from desk preach from pulpit have be mr thumble said mr proudie must have read from desk must have preached from pulpit mr crawley waited moment thinking that bishop might perhaps speak again a did not sat expectant a though have finished discourse now expected reply mr crawley got up from seat drew near to table lord began have be just a have said did answer first letter in haste more shame for said mr proudie therefore for aught know letter to lordship may be so worded a to need apology of course need apology said mr proudie for matter of lord apology can be made be needed did refuse to messenger permission to perform service of church if send twenty more will refuse till time may come when will be lordship duty in accordance with law of church a borne out backed by law of land to provide during constrained absence for spiritual want of poor people at hogglestock poor people indeed said mr proudie poor wretch lord may well be that will soon be lordship duty to take due legal step for depriving of benefice at hogglestock nay probably for silencing altogether a to exercise of sacred profession of course will sir gown will be taken from said mr proudie bishop be looking with eye up at great forehead great eyebrow of man be so fascinated by power be exercised over by other man strength that hardly now noticed wife may well be so continued mr crawley circumstance be strong against though lordship have altogether misunderstood nature of duty performed by magistrate in sending case for trial although a seems to have come to conclusion in matter in ignorance of very theory of law sir said mr proudie yet can foresee probability that jury may discover to have be guilty of theft of course jury will do so said mr proudie must such verdict be given then lord interference will be legal proper necessary will find that even if be within power to oppose obstacle to lordship authority will oppose such obstacle there be believe appeal in criminal case none at said mr proudie there be appeal against bishop must have learned that before till time will come lord will hold own at hogglestock a hold own here at barchester have more power to turn out of pulpit by mere voice than have to turn out of throne by mine if doubt lord lordship ecclesiastical court be open to try there defy then said mr proudie lord grant authority a bishop to be great even bishop can only act a law allows god forbid must do more said bishop sir will find that wicked threat will fall back upon own head said mr proudie peace woman mr crawley said addressing at last bishop jumped out of chair at hearing wife of bosom called woman jumped rather in admiration than in anger have already begun to perceive mr crawley be man who have better be left to take care of soul at hogglestock at rate till trial must come on woman said mr proudie rising to foot a though really intended personal encounter madam said mr crawley must not interfere in matter simply debase husband high office distaff be more fitting for lord good morning before of must speak again be out of room through hall beyond gate standing beneath tower of cathedral yes have thought in truth crushed bishop have succeeded in crumpling bishop up within clutch of fist started in spirit of triumph to walk back on road towards hogglestock did not think of long distance before for first hour of journey have have victory remembrance of braced nerve gave elasticity to sinew went stalking along road with rapid stride muttering to from time to time a went along word about mr proudie distaff mr thumble must not thought come to again not at rate till assize be drawing near have resolved what must do then when day of trial be near must write to bishop beg provision might be made for church in event of verdict going against friend dean arabin be to be home before time idea have occurred to of asking dean to see to now other must be more independent course better there be matter a to be not altogether well pleased with dean although be so conscious of own peculiarity a to know that must hardly trust for judgment at rate must apply to bishop to bishop whom have just left prostrate in palace when time of trial must be close at hand full of such thought a went along almost gaily felt fatigue of road till have covered first five mile out of barchester be nearly four o'clock thick gloom of winter evening be making felt then began to be fatigued have not a yet eaten since have left home in morning now pulled crust out of pocket leaned against gate a crunched there be still ten mile before knew that addition to work have already done must task very severely farmer mangle have told that must not leave framley mill till five have got time to reach framley mill by time have said that must not return to framley mill remembered suspicion that wife farmer mangle between have cozened must persevere walk walk though must drop upon road be now nearer fifty than forty year of age hardship a well a time have told upon knew that though strength be good for commencement of hard day work must not hold out for a used to do knew that last four mile in dark night must be very sad with still persevered endeavouring a went to cherish with remembrance of triumph passed turning going down to framley with courage when came to further turning by cart must return from framley to hogglestock road looked wistfully down road for farmer mangle farmer mangle be still at mill waiting in expectation that mr crawley might come to poor traveller paused here barely for minute then went on stumbling through mud striking ill covered foot against rough stone in dark sweating in weakness almost tottering at time calculating whether remaining strength must serve to carry home have almost forgotten bishop wife before at last grasped wicket gate leading to own door oh mamma here be papa where be cart did not hear wheel said mr crawley oh mamma think papa be ill then wife took drooping husband by arm strove to look in face have walked way be ill said jane dear be very tired not ill let sit down give bread tea will recover then mr crawley from secret hoard got small modicum of spirit gave meat tea be docile obeying behest allowed to be taken to bed think bishop will send for again said a tucked clothes around chapter xix where did come from when christmas morning came emissary from bishop appeared at hogglestock to interfere with ordinary performance of day service think need fear further disturbance mr crawley said to wife there be further disturbance on day after walk from framley to barchester from barchester back to hogglestock mr crawley have risen not much worse for labour have gradually given to wife full account of what have taken place poor weak man said speaking of bishop poor weak creature much to be pitied have always heard that be violent woman very violent very ignorant most intrusive withal did not answer word at last forbearance with broke down bade mind distaff what really did say word to nay a for exact word can not remember be thinking more of word with might be fitting must answer bishop certainly told that have better mind distaff how did behave then did not wait to see bishop have spoken have replied why must tarry to behold woman violence have told that be wrong in law at least must not submit to usurped authority there be nothing to keep longer so went without much ceremony of leave taking there have be little ceremony of greeting on part there be le in making of adieu on mine have told that be thief josiah surely not so did not use very word say did did use very word stop be wrong wrong lordship crave pardon for having done so if memory serve expression so harsh escaped from bishop mouth gave indeed to understand more than once that action taken by magistrate be tantamount to conviction must be guilty because have decided that there be evidence sufficient to justify trial arose from lord ignorance of administration of law of country be very ignorant puzzle pated a may call led by nose by wife weak a water timid vacillating did not wish think to be insolent be mr proudie who told to face be thief may be punished for cruel word said mr crawley may remembrance that have spoken come day heavily upon heart havengeance be mine will repay ' lord answered mr crawley may safely leave that alone rid mind of such wish if be possible be well think that violent offence when committed must be met by instant rebuke to turn other cheek instantly to smiter can hardly be suitable in day when hand of so many be raised to strike return blow must be given only while smart remains hurt then what be to now that called thief to face do not know that country round men woman be calling same behind back josiah know that say that thing be very strange so strange that requires trial one think have taken that be not own think did think took be not own poor head suffers so so many grievous thought distract that be like child know not what do a spoke thus put hand up to head leaning forward a though in anxious thought a though be striving to bring mind to bear with accuracy upon past event must not have be mine yet then sat silent made effort to continue speech yet said wife encouraging to proceed if must only learn real truth thought that might perhaps yet save with assistance from friend when said that have gotten from man must have be mad from man love from man soames who accuses yet a lord hears thought so then truth be that there be time when be not sane be not thief not before god be mad at time last word spoke very slowly in whisper without excitement indeed with composure be horrible to witness what said be more terrible because be so well convinced of truth of word of course be thief wanted one to tell that a have expressed be thief before god however money might have come into possession that there be time when reason once so fine clear must not act must not be trusted to guide right have gradually come to know with fear trembling have never before hinted own consciousness of calamity indeed have be so unwilling to speak of of own state that have be unable even to ask question about money lest must suspect that suspected now be speaking speaking with such heartrending sadness that must hardly urge to go on have sometimes be ill josiah a of may be said have be cause there be different kind of sickness there be sickness of body sickness of heart sickness of spirit then there be sickness of mind worst of with josiah have chiefly be first with mary have be of one spirit be broken mind have not be able to keep even tenour amidst ruin will strive will strive will strive still if god help will prevail then took up hat cloak went forth among lane on occasion wife be glad that must go alone occurred day two before christmas mr crawley during day said nothing more to husband on subject have so unexpectedly discussed asked question about money a to possibility of exercising memory did counsel to plead that false excuse given by for possession of cheque have be occasioned by sad slip to sorrow have in day subjected memory intellect matter have always be on mind might not be paramount duty to do something of at present moment might not be that acquittal conviction must depend on what might now learn from be clear to that be brighter in spirit since encounter with proudies than have ever be since accusation have be first made against knew well that present mood must not be of long continuance must fall again into moody silent way then chance of learning aught from must be past perhaps for ever performed christmas service with nothing of special despondency in tone manner wife thought that have never heard give sacrament with more impressive dignity after service stood awhile at churchyard gate exchanged word of courtesy a to season with such of family of farmer a have stayed for lord supper waited at framley for reverence till arter six so did said farmer mangle kept road walked whole way said mr crawley think told must not return to mill be not le obliged by great kindness say nowt o said farmer doubt have business at mill lot to do at mill did think that fib be telling be at incompatible with holy sacrament in have just taken part christmas dinner at parsonage be not repast did much honour to season be better dinner than inhabitant of house usually saw on board before there be roast pork mince pie bottle of wine a mr crawley with own hand put meat upon table then a be custom in house proceeded to cut up looked at husband face to see whether be scrutinizing food with painful eye be better that must tell truth at once than that must be made to tell in answer to question everything on table except bread potato have come in basket from framley court pork have be sent instead of beef because people in country when kill pig do sometimes give other pork exchange joint of beef when slay ox be understood by mr crawley almost wished that beef have be sent because beef must have attracted le attention said however nothing to meat when wife proposed to that must eat mince pie resented bare food said be bitter enough coming a doe must choke did not press eat one a otherwise girl must have be forced also to refuse dainty evening a soon a jane be in bed resolved to ask further question will have lawyer josiah will not said why must have lawyer because will know what question to ask how question on other side must be answered have question to ask there be only one way in question must be answered have money to pay lawyer josiah in such case a where honour very life depend upon depend on what on acquittal will not be acquitted be a well to look in face at once lawyer lawyer will say that took money be upon jury trying case knowing know now a said struck forth with hand into air think must say so lawyer will do good be here be here again put hand up to head so far have be successful at moment have in truth be object to induce to speak of own memory not of aid that lawyer might give proposition of lawyer have be brought in to introduce subject josiah well be very hard for to speak must not bear to torment by allusion to own deficiency must not endure to make think that suspected of frailty in intellect thought wifelike desired to worship that must know that worshipped if word might save josiah where did come from yes said yes be question where did come from turned sharp upon looking at with power of eye be because can not tell where came from ought to be either in bedlam a madman in county gaol a thief word be so dreadful to that must not utter at moment syllable how be man to think fit for man work when can not answer wife plain question a then paused again must take to bedlam at once at once at once must not disgrace child a gaol will do mr crawley must ask further question on evening chapter xx what mr walker thought about illustration have be suggested to mr robarts parson of framley that must endeavour to induce old acquaintance mr crawley to employ lawyer to defend at trial mr robarts have not forgotten commission have undertaken there be difficulty in matter of be well aware in first place mr crawley be man whom have not at time be easy to advise on matter private to in next place be matter on be very hard to speak to man implicated let be who must mr robarts have come round to generally accepted idea mr crawley have obtained possession of cheque illegally acquitting friend in own mind of theft simply by supposing that be wool gathering when cheque came in way in speaking to mr crawley must be necessary so thought to pretend conviction mr crawley be a innocent in fact a in intention have almost made up mind to dash at subject when met mr crawley walking through framley to barchester have abstained chiefly because mr crawley have be too quick for have got away after that resolved that must be almost useless for to go to work unless must be provided with lawyer ready willing to undertake task a be not so provided at present made up mind that must go into silverbridge see mr walker attorney there mr walker always advised everybody in part about everything must be sure to know what must be proper thing to be done in case so mr robarts got into gig drove into silverbridge passing very close to mr crawley house on road drove at once to mr walker office on arriving there found that attorney be not at moment within mr winthrop be within must mr robarts see mr winthrop now seeing mr winthrop be very different thing from seeing mr walker although two gentleman be partner still mr robarts said that must see mr winthrop perhaps mr walker might return while be there be there anything can do for mr robarts asked mr winthrop mr robarts said that have wished to see mr walker about poor fellow crawley ah yes very sad case so much sadder being clergyman mr robarts be really quite sorry for be indeed must have touched case ourselves if must have helped must indeed be obliged to take business here at rate will get nothing fair usage from be sure of that know whether have employed lawyer a yet to defend ca say know know must say have probably barchester attorney borleys bonstock in barchester be very good people very good people indeed for sort of business mean mr robarts suppose have much county property in hand mr robarts knew that mr winthrop be fool that must get useful advice from so suggested that must take gig down to inn call back again before long will find walker know more than do about said mr winthrop of course will be glad to see if happens to come in so mr robarts went to inn put up horse then a sauntered back up street met mr walker coming out of private door of house have be at home morning said have have stiff job of work on hand told to say in office be not in seen winthrop have suppose did know be here clerk often know more than partner about mr crawley be come into dining room mr robarts where will be alone yes be bad case very bad case pity be that anybody must ever have said anything about lord bless if 'd be soames 'd have let have twenty pound lord lufton must never have allowed soames to lose soames wanted to find out truth yes be just soames must bear to think that must be left in dark then when poor man said that soames have paid cheque to in way of business be not odd that soames back must have be up be mr robarts must have thought deal about before must have brought man a mr crawley before bench of magistrate on charge between mr walker did steal money well mr robarts know how be placed mr crawley be friend of course want to assist be under great obligation to mr crawley once wish to befriend whether took money not must act so much better if felt sure one way other if ask think did take stole think knew be not own when took see think meant to use when took perhaps have queer idea soames have be hard on lordship that money be fairly due then kept cheque by till be absolutely badgered out of life by butcher up street there be about long short of mr robarts suppose so now what have better do well if ask be in very bad health be must say not walked to barchester back other day did be very queer be very odd mannered indeed doe say manner of odd thing think 'd find bishop must say so after interview well if must do good might have bishop examined examined for what mr walker if must show know crawley have got bee in bonnet that men sana be not there in short think might manage to have trial postponed then somebody must take charge of living parson must manage that among dean archdeacon archdeacon have always got dozen curate about somewhere then after assize mr crawley might come to sens think mind be only idea think committal might be quashed must have be temporary insanity though mind give word for think might go on keep living think so mr robarts have never occurred to daresay not see difficulty be be so stiff necked will hing well will do for one proof of temporary insanity real truth be mr robarts be a mad a hatter upon word have often thought so must mind saying so in evidence must well see there be helping man in other way wo even employ lawyer to defend be what have come to about be told wo now man must be mad who wo employ lawyer when want one see point must gain must be if tried to get through a being little touched in upper story whatever must do for must do against own will more opposed stronger case must be must swear be not mad at must say that be greatest sign of madness when say of course mean must not appear in wish must mr walker of course ca wo make difference suppose must have lawyer yes must have lawyer rather friend must who must employ ostensibly ah there be difficulty wife must do suppose must do better turn must never forgive must never consent to act against must interfere if necessary will hardly know well enough have father mother uncle aunt must have somebody belonging to said mr walker then occurred to mr robarts that dean arabin must be proper person to interfere dean arabin mr crawley have be intimate friend in early life dean arabin knew more of than did man at least in part mr robarts explained to mr walker mr walker agreed with that service of dean arabin must if possible be obtained mr robarts must at once write to dean arabin explain at length circumstance of case worst of be will hardly be home in time said mr walker perhaps must come little sooner if be to press must act in name in absence suppose of course with authority wish must be here month before assize mr robarts must be better in meantime will say anything to mr crawley about employing lawyer think must if turn upon a like enough may abuse will help in one way if must consent perhaps may must help in other way be told be be over upset whole coach at palace must think bishop got much out of said parson like crawley le for speaking mind free to bishop said attorney laughing will speak free to too mr robarts wo break of bone tell mr walker what lawyer will name to ca have better man than mr mason up street there winthrop proposed borleys at barchester borleys bonstock be capital people to push fellow through on charge of horse stealing to squeeze man for little money be not people for mr crawley in such case a mason be better man then mason know other in saying mr walker winked there be then discussion between whether mr robarts must go at once to mr mason be decided at last that must see mr crawley also write to dean before did so dean might wish to employ own lawyer if so double expense must be avoided always remember mr robarts that when go into attorney office door will have to pay for first last in here see dingy old mahogany bare a be make safe else be salt cellar will not allow to be polluted by six eightpenny consideration there be other kind of tax to be paid must go up see mr walker wo have help in matter mr walker returned to work to private den within house to office mr robarts be taken upstairs to drawing room there found mr walker daughter miss anne prettyman who have just looked in full of story of mr crawley walk to barchester mr thumble have seen one

passed through close out of barchester minor canon have seen have declared that be going at rate of hunt swinging arm on high speaking very loud though a minor canon said with regret word be hardly audible there have be no doubt a to man mr crawley old hat short rusty cloak dirty boot have be duly observed chronicled by minor canon mr thumble have be enabled to put together not altogether false picture of what have occurred a soon a greeting between mr robarts lady have be made miss anne prettyman broke out again just where have left off when mr robarts came in say that mr proudie declared that will have sent to botany bay luckily mr proudie wo have much to do in matter said miss walker who ranged a to church matter in rank altogether opposed to commanded by mr proudie will have nothing to do with dear said mr walker daresay mr proudie be not foolish enough to say anything of kind mamma must be fool enough to say anything must not mr robarts forget miss walker mr proudie be in authority over so be for matter of said young lady know very well what think of say of too at framley friend lady lufton love dearly wish must have be hidden behind curtain in palace to hear what mr crawley said to mr smillie declares said miss anne prettyman that bishop have be ill ever since mr smillie went over to mother at barchester for christmas took part of cathedral duty have mr spooner over here in place so mr smillie of course heard about only fancy poor mr crawley walking way from hogglestock to barchester back be told hardly have shoe to foot be not shame mr robarts think be quite so bad a say miss prettyman upon whole do think be shame what can do suppose there be tithe at hogglestock why be not given up to church a ought to be dear miss prettyman be very large subject be afraid can not be settled in time to relieve poor friend from distress then mr robarts escaped from lady in mr walker house who a seemed to be touching upon dangerous ground went back to yard of george inn for gig george vulture be properly called be house in magistrate have sat when committed mr crawley for trial footed inch of way blowed if did ostler be saying to gentleman groom whom mr robarts recognized to be servant of friend major grantly mr robarts knew that also be talking about mr crawley everybody in county be talking about mr crawley at home at framley there be other subject of discourse lady lufton dowager be full of being firmly convinced that mr crawley be innocent because bishop be supposed to regard a guilty there have be family conclave held at framley court over basket of provision have be sent for christmas cheer of hogglestock parsonage of three lady two lady luftons mr robarts having special view of own how pork have be substituted for beef by old lady lufton young lady lufton thinking that after beef must be le dangerous how small turkey have be rashly suggested by mr robarts how certain small article have be inserted in bottom of basket mr crawley have never shewn to husband need not here be told at length mr robarts a heard two groom talking about mr crawley began to feel that mr crawley have achieved at least celebrity groom touched hat a mr robarts walked up have major returned home yet mr robarts asked groom said that master be still at plumstead that be to go over to plumstead to fetch major miss edith in day two then mr robarts got into gig a drove out of yard heard word of men a returned to same subject footed way said one yet be gen'leman too said other mr robarts thought of a drove on intending to call at hogglestock on very day on way home be undoubtedly fact that mr crawley be recognized to be gentleman by who knew high low rich poor by who thought well of by who thought ill groom who have be telling other that parson who be to be tried a thief have be constrained to walk from hogglestock to barchester back because must not afford to travel in other way that boot be cracked clothes ragged have still known to be gentleman nobody doubted not even who thought have stolen money mr robarts be certain of told that knew by evidence own education made clear to how be that groom knew for part think that there be better judge of article than groom thinking still of have heard mr robarts found at mr crawley gate at hogglestock chapter xxi mr robarts on embassy mr robarts be not altogether easy in mind a approached mr crawley house be aware that task before be very difficult one have not confidence in that be exactly man fitted for performance of such task be little afraid of mr crawley acknowledging tacitly to that man have power of ascendancy with must hardly be able to cope successfully in old day have once be rebuked by mr crawley have be cowed by rebuke though there be touch of rancour in heart on account slightest remaining venom rather increased respect friendship still be unable to overcome remembrance of scene in perpetual curate of hogglestock have undoubtedly have mastery of so when two dog have fought one have conquered conquered dog will always show unconscious submission to conqueror hailed boy on road a drew near to house knowing that must find one at parsonage to hold horse for be thus able without delay to walk through garden knock at door papa be not at home jane said papa be at school papa must certainly be summoned must run across to school if mr robarts must come in so mr robarts entered found mr crawley in sitting room mr crawley must be in directly said then hurrying on to subject with confused haste in order that word two might be spoken before husband came back expressed thanks for good thing have be sent to at christmas tide be old lady lufton doings said mr robarts trying to laugh matter over knew that came from framley mr robarts know how good be there have not written to thank lady lufton thought better not to write sister will understand why if one else doe will tell from be sure that be a intended comfort to sister know too much of for to suppose that great poverty can be secret from a far a be concerned now much care who know there be disgrace in not being rich said mr robarts feeling of disgrace doe attach to being so poor a be be deadened by actual suffering such poverty brings with at least have become so with be not ashamed to say that be very grateful for what have done for at framley must not say anything to about of course will not mr crawley spirit be higher than mine think suffers more from natural disinclination have to receiving alms be going to speak to about affair of cheque mr robarts be going to ask to put case into lawyer hand oh wish must will not be very kind of coming to ask have so strong objection will tell that have money to pay lawyer surely if be convinced that be absolutely necessary for vindication of innocence must submit to charge with expense so necessary not only for for family will say ought not to be necessary know mr robarts that in respect be not like other men will not let what say of set against indeed be most kind of to make attempt will be here directly when come will leave together while be yet speaking step be heard along gravel path hurried into room with quick step crave pardon mr robarts said that must keep waiting now mr robarts have not be there ten minute such asking of pardon be hardly necessary even in own house mr crawley affected mock humility a though through own debasement because of superior station of other clergyman be not entitled to put on equal footing with visitor must not have shaken hand with mr robarts intending to indicate that did not presume to do so while present accusation be hanging over have not action be forced upon then there be something of protest in manner a though remonstrating against thing be unbecoming to mr robarts without analysing understood knew that behind humility there be crushing pride pride in probability must rise up crush before must get out of room again be perhaps after question whether man be not served rightly by extremity to be reduced there be something radically wrong within have put into antagonism with world produced never dying grievance there be many clergyman in country with income a small a have fallen to lot of mr crawley managed to get on without displaying sore a mr crawley displayed did not wear old rusty cloak with ostentatious bitterness of poverty seemed to belong to garment when displayed on mr crawley shoulder such for moment be mr robarts thought almost repented of present mission then thought of mr crawley remembering that suffering be at rate undeserved determined that must persevere mr crawley disappeared almost a soon a husband appeared mr robarts found standing in front of friend who remained fixed on spot with hand folded over other neck slightly bent forward in token also of humility regret said that horse must be left there exposed to inclemency of weather horse wo mind bit said mr robarts parson horse be like butcher know that must be particular about waiting in cold never have have one myself said mr crawley now mr robarts have have more horse than one before now have be thought by to have incurred greater expense than be befitting in stable comfort subject therefore be sore one be worried little just wanted to say few word to crawley said if be not occupying too much of time time be altogether at disposal will be seated then mr robarts sat down swinging hat between leg bethought how must begin work have archdeacon over at framley other day said of course know archdeacon never have advantage of acquaintance with dr grantly of course know well by name also personally be by sight by character nay can hardly say so much a be aware that name stand high with many of order exactly be what mean know that judgment be thought more of in clerical matter than of other clergyman in county by certain party mr robarts well yes think much of suppose at palace wo lower in estimation by mean wish to derogate from dr grantly high position in own archdeaconry to a be aware be not attached to criticize conduct in respect must be unbecoming in to do so can not accept a point in clergyman favour that must be opposed to bishop now be too much for mr robarts after that have heard of visit paid by mr crawley to palace of venom displayed by mr proudie on occasion of absolute want of subordination to episcopal authority mr crawley be supposed to have shown mr robarts did feel hard that friend archdeacon must be snubbed in way because be deficient in reverence for bishop thought crawley said that be inclined to dispute order coming to from palace world at least say a much concerning what world say of have learned to disregard very much mr robarts hope that will never disobey authority of church when properly legally exercised hope with heart never will archdeacon who know to breadth of hair what bishop ought to do what ought not what may do what may not will must say be last man in england to sin in way very probably be far from contradicting there pray understand mr robarts that bring accusation against archdeacon why must did mean to discus at did mr robarts only mentioned name because a said be over with other day at framley be talking about affair affair said mr crawley then came frown upon brow gleam of fire into eye effectually banished that look of extreme humility have assumed may ask why archdeacon be discussing affair simply from kindness bear to be grateful for archdeacon kindness a man be bound to be for kindness whether displayed wisely unwisely seems to that affair a call mr robarts be of nature that who wish well to will better further wish by silence than by discussion then can not agree with mr crawley shrugged shoulder opened hand little then closed bowed head must not have declared more clearly by word that differed altogether from mr robarts that a subject be one so peculiarly own have right to expect that opinion must be allowed to prevail against of other person if come to that know how be anybody tongue to be stopped that vain tongue can not be stopped be well aware expect that people tongue must be stopped be not saying what men will do what good wish must dictate well perhaps will hear out for minute mr crawley again bowed head whether be wise unwise be discussing affair whether stole mr soames money nobody supposed for moment have stolen can not understand how must suppose anything else knowing a do that magistrate have committed for theft took place at framley say probably in lord lufton presence exactly lord lufton be chairman at sitting of magistrate at be committed how can be that must think otherwise be sure have not idea that be guilty yet have dr thorne who be also one of magistrate suppose one of then thought so then action to say least of be very strange be because have nobody to manage for thoroughly believe that if have placed matter in hand of good lawyer must never have heard word more about seems to be opinion of everybody speak to on subject then in country man be to be punished not according to ability to fee lawyer be not talking about punishment presuming innocent man to have ability not will to do so be to be punished to be ruined root branch self family character pocket simply because knowing own innocence doe not choose to depend on mercenary skill of man whose trade abhors for establishment of must be clear a sun at noon day say be innocent yet tell be to be condemned a guilty man have gown taken from be torn from wife child be disgraced before eye of men be made byword thing horrible to be mentioned because will not fee attorney to fee man to come lie on behalf to browbeat witness to make false appeal perhaps shed false tear in defending have come to asking to do if understand telling that archdeacon must so advise be object mr crawley a have spoken have in vehemence risen from seat mr robarts be also standing then tell archdeacon said mr crawley will have none of advice will have one there paid by to obstruct course of justice to hoodwink jury have be in court of law know what be work for gentleman be hired will have none of will thank to tell archdeacon so with respectful acknowledgment of consideration condescension say nothing a to own innocence own guilt do say that if be dragged before tribunal innocent man be falsely declared to be guilty because lack money to bribe lawyer to speak for then law of country deserve little of reverence be accustomed to pay to if be guilty nobody supposes to be guilty if be guilty continued mr crawley altogether ignoring interruption except by repetition of word slight raising of voice will not add to guilt by hiring one to prove falsehood to disprove truth be sorry that must say so mr crawley speak according to what light have mr robarts if have be over warm with be conscious have be in fault in direction must pray to remember that be somewhat hardly tried sorrow trouble be so great that rise against disturb drive on whither must not be driven friend be not just reason why must trust in matter to one who can be more calm than can not trust to one in matter of conscience to do a must have be to wrong will do wrong because be unhappy must cease to think wrong when so advised by person can trust can trust one with own conscience not even archdeacon great a be archdeacon have meant only well to will presume so will believe so do think so tell archdeacon from that humbly thank that in matter of church question might probably submit judgment to even though might have authority over knowing a do that in such matter experience have be great tell also that though must fain that unfortunate affair might burden tongue of none among neighbour at least till will have stood before judge to receive verdict of jury if needful lordship sentence still be convinced that in what have spoken a also in what have done have not yielded to idleness of gossip have exercised judgment with intended kindness have certainly intended to do service a for not being talked about be out of question for mr robarts whom have ever regarded a friend since circumstance brought into neighbourhood for whose sister love tenderly in memory of past kindness though now be removed so far above sphere a to make unfit must call friend doe not think so at for a be saying pray believe that though from roughness of manner being now unused to social intercourse seem to be ungracious forbidding be grateful mindful that in tablet of heart have written down a one in whom must trust be given to to trust in men woman then turned round with face to wall back to visitor so remained till mr robarts have left at rate wish well through trouble said robarts a spoke found that own word be nearly choked by sob be rising in throat went away without word got out to gig without seeing mr crawley during one period of interview have be very angry with man so angry a to make almost declare to that must take more trouble on behalf then have be brought to acknowledge mr walker be right crawley be certainly mad be so mad so far removed from dominion of sound sense that jury must say that be guilty that ought to be punished for guilt a so resolved must not ask question whether charge of parish ought to be left in hand of such man at last just before went feeling conviction gave way to pity remembered simply trouble seemed to have be heaped on head of poor victim to misfortune a drove home resolved that there be nothing left for to do to write to dean be known to who knew that dean mr crawley have lived together on closest intimacy at college that friendship have be maintained through life though from peculiarity of mr crawley character two have not be much together of late year seeing how thing be going now hearing how pitiful be plight in mr crawley be placed dean must no doubt feel to be duty to hasten return to england be believed to be at moment in jerusalem must be long before letter must reach there still wanted three month to assize return might be probably effected before end of february never be so distressed in life mark robarts said to wife think have done good only have convinced that poor man be not responsible for what doe that for sake a well a for own person must be enabled to interfere for protection then told mr robarts what mr walker have said also message mr crawley have sent to archdeacon agreed that message need not be sent on further chapter xxii major grantly at home mr thorne have spoken very plainly in advice have given to major grantly if be 'd be

not enduring have brother clergyman busy stirring eloquent london preacher who got church built be heard of far wide a rising man who have married certain lady anne daughter of earl who be already mentioned a candidate for high place how sister be wife of marquis leader in fashionable world reader already know archdeacon be rich man so powerful that must afford to look down upon bishop mr grantly though there be left about something of old softness of nature touch of former life have be hers before stream of day have run gold yet too have taken kindly to wealth high standing be by mean one of who construe literally passage of scripture tell of camel needle eye henry grantly major knew to be mother favourite child knew to have become so since something of coolness have grown up between august daughter augustness of daughter have done much to reproduce old freshness of have spoken in mother heart have specially endeared to son who of child be least subject to family failing clergyman charles grantly who have married lady anne be father darling in day old archdeacon must go up to london be quite happy in son house met there men whom loved to meet heard talk loved to hear be very fine having marquis of hartletop for son in law have never cared to be much at lady hartletop house indeed archdeacon cared to be in house in around be supposed to be bigger than such be little family fleet from out of henry grantly be now proposing to sail alone with little boat taking grace crawley with at helm father be just man at bottom said to though may not forgive will not punish edith there be still left one of family not grantly indeed one so nearly allied to a to have boat moored in same harbour who a major well knew must thoroughly sympathize with be old mr harding mother father father of mother of aunt mr arabin whose home be now at deanery be also to be at plumstead during christmas at rate must give ready assent to marriage a major be proposing for then poor old mr harding have be thoroughly deficient in ambition have served to aggrandize family into daughter have married be poor old man who in spite of good friend for late bishop of diocese have be dearest friend have never risen high in profession have fallen even from moderate altitude have attained be man whom loved who knew be much to credit of son in law archdeacon that with tendency to love rising sun have ever be true to mr harding major grantly took daughter with on arrival at plumstead of course be first object of attention mr grantly declared that have grown immensely archdeacon complimented red cheek said that cosby lodge be a healthy place a in county while mr harding edith great grandfather drew slowly from pocket sundry treasure with have come prepared for delight of little girl charles grantly lady anne have child heir of hartletops be too august to have be trusted to embrace of mother grandfather edith therefore be that have in generation of edith be prepared to be a indulgent a have be in time of grandchild grantlys still be of grandchild arabins have be before of own daughter be more like eleanor than one else said old man in plaintive tone now eleanor be mr arabin dean wife be at time if be to say over forty think must be uncharitable one else saw special likeness one else remembered a mr harding did what eleanor have be when be three year old illustration be more like eleanor than one else aunt nelly be in france said child yes darling aunt nelly be in france wish be at home aunt nelly have be away long time suppose will stay till dean pick up on way home said mr grantly so say in letter heard from yesterday brought letter a thought 'd like to see mr grantly took letter read while father still played with child archdeacon major be standing together on rug discussing shooting at chaldicotes a to archdeacon have strong opinion be quite sure that man with place like doe more good by preserving than by leaving alone better head of game have richer county will be generally be just same with pheasant a be with sheep bullock pheasant doe cost more than be worth more than barn door fowl besides man who preserve be always respected by poacher man who doe be not there be something in sir certainly said major more than think for perhaps look at poor sowerby who went on there for year without shilling how be respected because lived a people around expected gentleman to live thorne will have bad time of if try to change thing only think exclaimed mr grantly when eleanor wrote have not heard of affair of poor mr crawley doe say anything about asked major will read what say ' see in galignani that clergyman in barsetshire have be committed for theft pray tell who be not bishop hope for credit of diocese wish be said archdeacon for shame dear said wife shame at if be to have thief among 'd sooner find in bad man than good one besides must have change at palace must be great thing be not odd that eleanor must have heard nothing of said mr grantly be odd that must not have mentioned did not certainly papa suppose mr harding acknowledged that have not spoken of then calculated that perhaps might not have received letter from husband written since news have reached besides why must have mentioned said major only know a yet of inquiry about cheque can have heard nothing of what be done by magistrate still seems so odd that eleanor must not have known of seeing that have be talking of nothing else for last week said mr grantly for two day major said not word of grace crawley to one nothing must be more courteous complaisant than be father conduct to anything that wanted for edith be to be done for there be trouble must not be taken hunting shooting fishing seemed to have become matter of paramount consideration to father then archdeacon became very confidential about money matter not offering anything to son a well knew must have be seen through a palpable bribery corruption telling of little

opened before have have moment of anxiety whether father must must not make elder son of brother charles whole thing be now put before plainly give up grace crawley will share alike with brother disgrace by marrying brother will have everything there be choice be still open to to take side pleased be never to go near grace crawley again one must blame unless be miss prettyman mr thorne fill

postman whose duty be to deliver letter in village at half past eight being also liberal in idea a to time always arrived punctually in middle of breakfast so mr dale expected letter lily hers just before second cup of tea a though letter formed part of morning meal jane maid servant always brought in handed to mr dale for lily have in day come to preside at breakfast table then there must be examination of outside before envelope be violated a knew pretty well circumstance of correspondence of other there must be guessing a to what epistle might contain after reading out loud of passage not unfrequently of entire letter now at time of be speaking grace crawley be at small house therefore common practice be somewhat in abeyance on one of first day of new year jane brought in letter a usual handed to mr dale lily be at time occupied with teapot still saw letter have not hand so full a to be debarred from expression of usual anxiety mamma be sure see two there for said only one for lily said mr dale lily instantly knew from tone of voice that letter have come by very aspect of handwriting have disturbed mother there be one for dear said mr dale throwing letter across table to grace one for lily from bell others be for whom be yours from mamma asked lily one be from mr jones other think be letter on business then lily said nothing further observed that mother only opened one of letter at breakfast table lily be very patient not by nature think by exercise practice have once in life be too much in hurry having then burned grievously now feared fire did not therefore follow mother after breakfast sat with grace over fire hemming diligently at certain article of clothing be intended for use in hogglestock parsonage two girl be making set of new shirt for mr crawley know will ask where come from said grace then mamma will be scolded hope will wear said lily sooner later will said grace because mamma manages generally to have way at last then went on for hour so talking about home affair at hogglestock during whole time lily mind be intent upon mother letter nothing be said about at lunch nothing when walked out after lunch for lily be very patient during walk mr dale became aware that daughter be uneasy two watched other unconsciously with closeness hardly allowed glance of eye certainly not tone of voice to pas unobserved to mr dale be everything in world that daughter must be if not happy at heart at least tranquil to lily who knew that mother be always thinking of of alone mother be only human divinity now worthy of adoration nothing be said about letter during walk when came home be nearly dusk be habit to sit up for while without candle talking till evening have in truth set in unmistakable enforced idleness of remaining without candle be apparent during time lily demanding patience of while be thinking what must do rather what must say about letter that nothing must be done said in presence of grace crawley be matter of course must do say anything to get rid of grace must be very patient must at last ask mother about letter then a luck must have grace crawley got up left room lily still waited for few minute in order that patience might be thoroughly exercised said word two about sister bell how eldest child whooping cough be nearly well how baby be doing wonderful thing with first tooth a mr dale have already seen bell letter be not intensely interesting at last lily came to point asked question mamma from whom be that other letter got morning story will perhaps be best told by communicating letter to reader before be discussed with lily letter be a follows general committee office january must have said that mr dale have not opened letter till have found in solitude of own bedroom then before doing so have examined handwriting with anxious eye when first received thought knew writer be not sure then have glanced at impression over fastening have known at once from whom letter have come be from mr

than twelve year old when first began to correspond with maria be then past twenty so see mr eames make secret of age why must never mind that everybody know that maria clutterbuck be very much admired of course be not going to tell other gentleman history be in hope be then certainly hope will be frustrated mr eames undoubtedly when told that be going to take dobbs broughton be little disappointed maria clutterbuck have be used to better kind of life understand what mean mr eames oh exactly yet be not bad kind of life be true have attraction keep carriage see good deal of company have excellent house go abroad for six week year know mr eames there be perhaps little uncertainty about life be always uncertain miss demolines be quizzing now know feel now really that city money be

not what can call educated gentleman manner be against be very ignorant even dear maria must admit that one must perhaps let that pas without asking opinion at have acknowledged to twenty time be very good natured let do pretty nearly anything that like only hope wo trespass on good nature do indeed mean spend too much money did mean exactly of course ought to be moderate hope be to kind of fevered existence profuse expenditure be perhaps necessary be thinking of something else fear be little giddy dear must have thought be too too too mean too old for anything of kind maria broughton must be thirty three if be day must make just twenty five said johnny feeling perfectly sure a said so that lady whom be addressing be at rate past thirty never mind age mr eames whether be twenty five hundred five have nothing to do with poor maria clutterbuck now will tell why mention to must have seen how foolish be about friend mr dalrymple upon word have nonsense mr eames have if be wife must like to call man conway of course must not mean to say that there be anything in know be principle too well to suspect that be merely because be flighty fevered that fevered existence account for said johnny doubt doe said miss demolines with nod of head be intended to show that be willing to give friend full benefit of excuse must be offered for think must do something mr eames do something yes mr dalrymple be such friend if be just to point out to know point out what tell that ought to be called conway because after suppose be worst of if mean to say that dalrymple be in love with mr broughton never made greater mistake in life oh not in love must be terrible know miss demolines shook head sadly there may be so much mischief done without anything of kind thoughtlessness know mr eames pure thoughtlessness think of what have said if can speak word to friend do now want to ask something else be so glad be come because circumstance have seemed to make necessary that must know other may be of so much use if put head together johnny bowed when heard made immediate reply have heard anything about certain picture be being planned johnny did not wish to answer question miss demolines paused so long looked so earnestly into face that found forced to say something what picture certain picture be perhaps be not to be painted by mr dalrymple hear so much about dalrymple picture mean portrait of lady glencora palliser be nearly finished will be in exhibition year mean that at mean picture have not yet be begun portrait suppose a to can not quite say be at rate to be likeness be sure have heard of come mr eames must be better that must be candid with other remember miss van siever of course remember that dined at broughtons have heard of jael suppose sisera yes in general way in bible now will tell whether have not heard name of jael miss van siever coupled together see know about have heard of certainly of course have so have a perceive now mr eames miss demolines voice became tremulously eager a addressed be duty be duty to take care that picture will never be painted why must not be painted know miss van siever yet not in least mr van siever never spoke word to do know well there be something almost grandly tragic in miss demolines voice a thus spoke yes mr eames know well if scheme be continued will work terrible mischief must prevent see what harm will do think of conway dalrymple passing so many hour in maria sitting room upstairs picture be to be painted there know miss van siever will be present wo make right what be there wrong about miss van siever wo deny clara van siever have certain beauty of own to be certainly most unattractive woman that ever came near be simply repulsive hereupon miss demolines held up hand a though be banishing miss van siever for ever from sight shuddered slightly men think handsome be handsome be false covetous malicious cruel dishonest what fiend in petticoat may say that mr eames then mother mother be not so bad mother be very different mother be odious woman too be evil day for maria clutterbuck when first saw mother daughter tell that in confidence what can do said johnny who began to be startled almost interested by eagerness of woman will tell what can do let friend go to mr broughton house to paint picture if doe do there will mischief come of of course can prevent must not think of trying to prevent unless knew why be nasty proud minx must set up ever so high to think that be being painted by mr dalrymple be reason maria must get into terrible trouble about there must be end of mischief must not tell more now if believe can not help surely mr eames word may be taken a going for something when ask to help in do expect that will not refuse by time miss demolines be sitting close to have more than once put hand upon arm in energy of eloquence then a remembered that have never seen miss demolines till other day miss van siever even mr dobbs broughton bethought that be very droll nevertheless have objection to miss demolines putting hand upon arm never like to interfere in anything doe not seem to be own business said johnny be not friend business own business what doe friendship mean if be not so when tell that be business mine of right doe that go for nothing with thought might depend upon mr eames did indeed then again put hand upon arm a looked into eye began to think that after be good looking in certain way at rate have fine eye there be something picturesque about entanglement of hair think of then come back talk to again said miss demolines be going out of town to morrow for how long for ten day nothing can be done during time clara van siever be going away in day will not be back for three week happen to know so have plenty of time for working must be very desirable that must never even hear of that can not be hoped a maria have tongue must see mr dalrymple to night well think must mind at least that come to a soon a ever return before got out of house did after most affectionate farewell johnny felt compelled to promise that must come to miss demolines again a soon a got back to town a door be closed behind by boy in button made up mind that certainly must call a soon a returned to london be a good a play said to not that cared in least for miss demolines that must take step with intention of preventing painting of picture miss demolines have battle to fight must leave to fight with own weapon if friend chose to paint picture of jael take miss van siever a model be business of nevertheless must certainly go see miss demolines again because a said be a good a play chapter xxvi picture on same afternoon conway dalrymple rolled up sketch of jael sisera put into pocket dressed with considerable care putting on velvet coat be in habit of wearing out of door when did not intend to wander beyond kensington garden neighbourhood be supposed to become well yellow glove certain spanish hat of be fond slowly sauntered across to house of friend mr dobbs broughton when door be opened to did not ask if lady be at home muttering word to servant made way through hall upstairs to certain small sitting room looking to north be much used by mistress of house be quite clear that conway dalrymple have arranged visit beforehand that be expected opened door without knocking though servant have followed entered without being announced be afraid be late said a gave hand to mr broughton for life must not get away sooner be quite in time said lady for good that be likely to do what doe that mean mean friend that have better give idea up have be thinking of day approve of nonsense of course will say so conway have observed of late that say to be called nonsense suppose be new fashion that gentleman must so express be not quite sure that like know what mean be very anxious about picture will be much disappointed if can not be done now be put into head first regret very much can assure will not be generous in to urge against why must succeed there be many reason personal to myself know what can be hinted at something only took a having be said in joke if mean about miss van siever be quite in earnest conway think must do better must be glad to see of thing nothing must please more than to bring miss van siever together nothing must please le why so because because can hing tell truth carina because heart be not free to present at miss van siever foot ought to be free conway must make free will be well that must be married well for others besides tell so a friend have truer friend sit where be if please can say anything have to say without stalking about room be not going to stalk a call will be safer quieter while be sitting heard knock at door doubt that be clara said must be here have told her of picture yes have told said that must be impossible that mother must not allow here be then miss van siever be shown into room dalrymple perceived that be girl peculiarity of whose complexion bore daylight better even than candlelight there be something in countenance seemed to declare that must bear light to might be subjected without flinching from bonnet be very plain simple brown morning gown suited well be one who required none of circumstance of studied dress to carry off aught in own appearance must look best when other woman look worst must dare to be seen at time dalrymple with artist eye saw at once immediately confessed to that there be something great about must not deny beauty there be ever present to that look of hardness have struck when first saw must not fancy that though at time might be playful allow fur of coat to be stroked with good humour must be dangerous plaything using claw unpleasantly when good humour must have passed away not le be beautiful beyond better than for purpose be picturesque clara said mr broughton here be mad painter say that will have on canvas with will without even if must do be sure must not said miss van siever to prove to that can think need only show sketch said dalrymple taking drawing out of pocket a regard face know so well by heart already that feel certain must produce likeness without even sitting what do think of mr broughton illustration what do think of mr broughton be clever said looking at with enthusiasm woman be able to throw into eye on such occasion very clever subject must just suit have never doubted that eames say that be confused said artist see that at said mr broughton of course sketch must be rough one have be rubbed about altered think there be something in immense deal said mr broughton think so clara be not judge can see woman fixed purpose stealthiness a well man sleep like log what be dim outline nothing in particular said dalrymple dim outline be intended to represent mr van siever be very good unquestionably good said mr dobbs broughton for moment doubt that must make great picture of be just subject for conway so much imagination yet such scope for portraiture must be full of action yet such perfect repose light shadow must be exactly in line can see at glance how must manage light in tent bring down just on nail then pose of woman must be so good so much strength yet such grace must have bowl drank milk out of so a to tell whole story painter living tell story so well a do conway conway dalrymple knew that woman be talking nonsense to yet liked liked for talking mr dalrymple can paint sisera without making jael said miss van siever of course can said mr broughton never will said artist conceived subject a connected with will never disjoin two idea think compliment can assure said miss van siever none be intended may observe artist in age have sought for higher type of model in painting woman who have be violent criminal than have sufficed for in portraiture of gentleness virtue look at judith lucretias charlotte corday how much finer woman be than madonna saint cecilias after clara need not scruple to be jael said mr broughton do scruple very much so strongly that know never will do in first place know why mr dalrymple want want said conway want to paint striking picture can do without putting into not picture why must object be commonest thing in world for lady to sit to artist in manner people must know nobody must know so that need care about must matter if everybody knew be not proposing anything improper be mr broughton will not be pressed if doe not like said mr broughton know told before clara came in be afraid must not be done like said miss van siever with little hesitation in voice see anything improper in if mean that said mr broughton mamma well yes be difficulty doubt only question be whether mother be not so very singular a to make impossible that must comply with in everything be afraid that comply with in very much said miss van siever in gentlest voice oh clara drive to say so a otherwise must be hypocrite of course ought not to have said before mr dalrymple mr dalrymple will understand about daresay before picture be finished said mr broughton did not take much persuasion on part of conway dalrymple to get consent of younger lady to be painted of elder to allow sitting to go on in room when question of easel other apparatus came to be considered mr broughton be rather flustered again declared with energy that whole thing must fall to ground few more word from painter restored at last arrangement be made a mr dobbs broughton dear friend madalina demolines have said mr dobbs broughton liked fevered existence what will dobbs say exclaimed more than once be decided at last that dobbs must know nothing about a long a must be kept from of course will be told at last said wife must keep anything from dear fellow for world if knew at first must be sure to get through musselboro to mother certainly will beg that mr broughton may not be taken into confidence if mr musselboro be to follow said clara must be understood must cease to sit immediately may be inconvenience must mamma speak to about stipulation be made conceded then miss van siever went away leaving artist with mr dobbs broughton now if please conway have better go too said lady a soon a there have be time for miss van siever to get downstairs out of hall door of course be in hurry to get rid of yes be little while ago improperly said that suggestion of yours be nonsense rebuked for blunt incivility might not rebuke now with equal justice do so if will leave tell conway that in matter must either be guided by must cease to see other doe not do that must remain here with longer than time usually allowed for morning call clara have come gone also must go be sorry to disturb for seem to be so very comfortable in chair be comfortable can look at come there can be harm in saying that if say nothing else well there now be gone whereupon got up from arm chair be not gone while stand there must really wish to marry girl do if can love what about love must win of course be to be won like other woman fruit wo fall into mouth merely because open lip must climb tree still climbing tree in hesperides said conway love doe that know be hard to climb tree without love seems to have done climbing have clomb a high a knew how that bough be breaking with that be likely to get fall do understand must rather not understand be answer to question do understand at moment be getting fall will break bone in skin put other climbing out of question a far a be concerned do understand that said mr broughton in tremulous voice then will go make love at once to clara van siever there be enough of pluck left in to ask to marry suppose must manage to go through ceremony if accepted want to love said mr dobbs broughton daresay must love well enough after bit be if did break head comb hair suppose there will be objection to saying that sent when ask conway will of course not mention name to have suggested to marriage think must tend to make happy must give stability in life want be perhaps better must be explicit at once a unmarried man can not continue to know have said word of late have driven to conclusion have thought about much too much perhaps know be right miss van siever have beauty wealth intellect think that must appreciate love of such man a be now go mr dobbs broughton standing upright pointed to door conway dalrymple slowly took spanish hat from off marble slab on have laid left room without saying word interview have be quite long enough there be nothing else knew how to say with effect croquet be pretty game out of door chess be delightful in drawing room battledoor shuttlecock hunt slipper have also attraction proverb be good cross question with crooked answer may be made very amusing none of game be equal to game of love making providing that player can be quite sure that there will be heart in matter touch of heart not only destroys pleasure of game make player awkward incapable robs of skill thus be that there be many people who can not play game at deficiency of needed internal physical strength prevents owner of heart from keeping proper control over valve thus emotion set in pulse be accelerated feeling supervenes for one to attempt game of love making be a though friend with gout must insist on playing croquet sense of ridiculous if nothing else must in case deter afflicted one from attempt there be such absurdity with friend mr dobbs broughton conway dalrymple valve pulse be right must play game without slightest danger of inconvenient result of inconvenient result be a regarded own feeling blind people can not see stupid people can not understand might be that mr dobbs broughton being blind stupid in such matter might perceive something of playing of game not know that be only game of skill when say that a regarded two lover there be nothing of love between that game be therefore so far innocent must not be understood a asserting that people have heart within bosom mr dobbs broughton probably loved husband in sensible humdrum way feeling to be bore knowing to be vulgar aware that often took good deal more wine than be good for that be almost a uneducated a hog yet loved showed love by taking care that must have thing for dinner liked to eat in alone there be to be found none of charm of fevered existence therefore mr dobbs broughton requiring charm for comfort played little game with conway dalrymple a regarded artist let reader presume to have be heartless because flirted with mr dobbs broughton doubtless will marry day will have large family for will work hard will make good husband to stout lady who will be careful in looking after linen on present occasion fell into slight trouble in spite of innocence of game a quitted friend room heard hall door slammed heavily then there be quick step on stair on landing place above first flight met master of house somewhat flurried a seemed not looking comfortable a regarded person temper by george be be drinking conway said to after first glance now certainly be case poor dobbs broughton must sometimes drink at improper hour what devil be doing here said dobbs broughton to friend artist be always here be here doosed sight more than like husband when have be drinking be very apt to make mistake a to purport of game why dobbs said painter there be something wrong with no there ai there be nothing wrong if there be what be to sha ask to pay anything for suppose well hope not wo have here let that be end of be very well when choose to have few friend to dinner wife can do very well without fal lalling here day will remember that if please conway dalrymple knowing that have better not argue question with drunken man took out of house shrugging shoulder a thought of misery poor dear playfellow must now be called upon to endure chapter xxvii hero at home on morning after visit to miss demolines john eames found at paddington station asking for ticket for guestwick a picked up change gentleman also demanded ticket for same place have guestwick be a liverpool manchester eames must have thought nothing about be matter of course that men must always be going from london to liverpool manchester seemed odd to that two men must want first class ticket for so small place a guestwick at same moment when afterwards be placed by guard in same carriage with other traveller must not feel little curiosity man be four five year johnny senior good looking fellow with pleasant face outward appurtenance of gentleman intelligent reader will doubt be aware that stranger be major grantly intelligent reader have in respect have much advantage over john eames who up to time have never even heard of cousin grace crawley lover think be asking for ticket for guestwick said johnny whereupon major owned that such be case lived at guestwick greater part of life said johnny be dullest dearest little town in england never be there before said major indeed can hardly say be going there now will only pas through then got out newspaper johnny also got out for time there be conversation between john remembered how holy be errand upon be intent gathered thought together resolving that having so great matter on mind must think about nothing else speak about nothing at be going down to allington to ask lily dale for last time whether must be wife to ascertain whether be to be successful unsuccessful in one great wish of life a such be case with a have in hand thing so vital must be nothing to whether chance companion of voyage be agreeable disagreeable person in of ordinary circumstance of life be prone enough to talk with one might meet must have travelled for twelve hour together with old lady must listen to make listen to without hour interruption journey be made on ordinary occasion behoved to think of lily therefore after first little almost necessary effort at civility fell back into gloomy silence be going to do best to win lily dale doing of best must require thought energy probably major grantly mind be bent in same direction too have work before must not look upon work a thing be altogether pleasant might probably get be intent upon obtaining knew almost knew that have won heart of girl whom be seeking there have be that between justified in supposing that be dear to although expression of affection have ever passed from lip to ear men may know that require to know on subject without plainly spoken word grace crawley have spoken no word yet have known at rate have not doubted that must have place in heart of desired to be master must never surrender altogether till have taught to be sure of to whom gave have listened to with silence have not rebuked have told that might venture without fear of rebuke a to mind of men be sensitive to degree other men can not even understand for major grantly must not be altogether happy a to mission must ask grace crawley to be wife must be ruined by own success remembrance that must be severed from own family by thing that be doing be very bitter to in generosity might be silent about to grace who can endure to be silent on subject to woman who be to be wife then must not be possible for to abstain from explanation be now following down to allington step certainly must not have taken for misfortune have befallen father must explain to in sort why did so must say to if not in so many word still almost a plainly a word must speak be here now to ask to be wife because specially require protection countenance of man who love in present circumstance of father affair knew that be doing right perhaps have idea that be doing nobly very appreciation of own good quality made task before more difficult major grantly have time john eames have daily news exchanged paper one have last saturday other last spectator exchanged also have pall mall gazette of enterprising periodical gradually came to discus merit demerit thus falling into conversation at last in spite of weight of mission on of be intent then at last when be within hour of end of journey major grantly asked companion what be best inn at guestwick have at first be minded to go on to allington at once to go on to allington get work done then return home remain there find nearest inn with decent bed a circumstance might direct on reconsideration a drew nearer to scene of future operation thought that might be well for to remain night at guestwick did not quite know how far allington be from guestwick did know that be still mid winter that day be very short magpie be best inn johnny said having lived at guestwick life having mother living there now have never put up at magpie believed to be good country inn kept post horse there knew did not tell stranger that late old friend lord de guest present old friend lady julia always hired post horse from magpie grounded ready assertion on remembrance of fact think will stay there to night said major will find pretty comfortable doubt said johnny though indeed always seems to that man alone at inn have very bad time of reading be very well one get tired of at last then hate horse hair chair be very delightful said major beggar must be chooser then there be pause after major spoke again happen to know way allington lie allington said johnny yes allington be there not village called allington there be village called allington certainly lie over there johnny pointed with finger through window a know country can see nothing can see allington tree at moment suppose there be inn at allington there be public house with very nice clean bedroom be called bed lion ' mr forrard keep must quite a soon stay there a at 'the magpie ' only if expect must have much for dinner then know village of allington yes know village of allington very well have friend living there indeed may say know everybody in allington do know mr dale mr dale said johnny yes know mr dale have known mr dale pretty nearly life who must man be who be going down to see mr dale mr dale consequently lily dale thought that knew mr dale so well that must have visitor of whom must not be entitled to have knowledge major grantly have nothing more to say at moment about mr dale have never seen mr dale in life be now going to house not to see friend of hers found that must not very well explain to stranger therefore at moment said nothing further johnny must not allow subject to be dropped have known mr dale long asked have not pleasure of knowing at said major thought perhaps by asking after intend to call upon be suppose will have omnibus here from 'the magpie ' eames said that there doubt must be omnibus from magpie then be at journey end for present will follow john eames who went at once to mother house be intention to remain there for two three day then go over to house rather to cottage of great ally lady julia lay just beyond guestwick manor somewhat nearer to allington than to town of guestwick have made up mind that must not go over to allington till must do so from guestwick cottage a be called feeling under certain untoward circumstance must untoward circumstance arise lady julia sympathy might be more endurable than of mother must take care that must be known at allington that be in neighbourhood understood necessary strategy of campaign too well to suppose that must startle lily into acquiescence with own mother sister john eames be in day quite hero be hero with now because in early boyish day there have be so little about be heroic then there have be doubt whether must ever earn daily bread have be very heavy burden on slight family resource in matter of jacket trouser pride taken in johnny have not be great though love felt for have be warm gradually thing have changed john eames have become heroic in mother eye chance circumstance have endeared to earl de guest from moment thing have gone well with earl have given watch have left fortune sir raffle buffle have made private secretary in old day when johnny love for lily dale be first discussed by mother sister have thought impossible that lily must ever bring to regard with affection so humble suitor for dale have ever held head up in world now there be misgiving on score with mr eames daughter wonder be that lily dale must be such fool a to decline love of such man so johnny be received with respect due to hero a well a with affection belonging to son by mean to be inferred that mr eames have got little bit of fish for dinner a well a leg of mutton man came down in train with who say be going over to allington said johnny wonder who can be be staying at 'the magpie ' friend of captain dale probably said mary captain dale be squire nephew heir man be not going to squire be going to small house be going to stay there suppose not a asked about inn then johnny reflected that man might probably be friend of crosbie became melancholy in consequence crosbie might have thought expedient to send ambassador down to prepare ground for before must venture again upon scene if be so must not be well that john eames must get over to lily a soon a possible not wait till must be staying with lady julia be at rate incumbent upon to call upon lady julia next morning because of commission berlin wool might remain in portmanteau till portmanteau must go with to cottage must take spectacle at once must explain to lady julia what lawyer have told about income so hired saddle horse from

circumstance major grantly must feel bound to offer hand to grace mother daughter have differed somewhat on matter mr dale have held that be not so bound urging that unfortunate position in mr crawley be placed be so calamitous to connected with a to justify man not absolutely engaged in abandoning thought of such marriage mr dale have spoken of major grantly father mother brother sister have declared opinion that be entitled to consideration lily have opposed idea very stoutly asserting that in affair of love man must think neither of father brother mother sister if be worth anything lily have said will come to now now in trouble will tell that at least have got friend who will be true to if doe that then will think that there be something of poetry nobleness of love left in answer to mr dale have replied that woman have right to expect from men such self denying nobility a expect mamma said lily be sure that grace doe not indeed be quite sure that grace doe not expect even to see ever again never say so know that have made up mind about still think ought to come can hardly be that man be bound to do thing doing of a confess must be almost more than noble said mr dale so matter have be discussed between now a seemed to mr dale man have come to do noble thing at rate be there in drawing room before of have sat down have contrived to mention grace may not probably have heard name said be acquainted with friend miss crawley know name very well major grantly brother in law who life over yonder mr dale know father very well did year ago have heard say that remembers

in coming to allington said be to see miss crawley daughter have taken long walk to call on friend be afraid will stay for lunch will certainly be home between three four if be not too long for to

have father mother living a believe in same county with know that mr dale may perhaps understand that a miss crawley be now staying with owe in measure to friend to ask whether be aware of intention be not aware of know at present moment be in great trouble mr dale be going on be interrupted by major grantly be just said there be circumstance at present make almost impossible must go to mr crawley ask permission to address daughter know whether have heard whole story a much believe a grace must tell be believe in such state of mental distress a to be hardly capable of giving considerate answer must not know how to speak to how not to speak to about unfortunate affair mr dale will think perceive that same circumstance make imperative upon to be explicit to miss crawley think be last man to boast of woman regard have learned to think be not indifferent to grace if be so what must think of if stay away from now understands too well weight of misfortune have fallen upon father to suppose that one not connected with can be bound to share be just will think that be silent for reason have determined that will not keep silent therefore have come here may perhaps be able to bring comfort to in trouble a regard worldly position though indeed will not be very good a hers be not good will not think bound to forbid to see on head certainly not need hardly say that fully understand that a regard money be offering everything where can get nothing understand feeling indeed do appreciate great nobility of love for grace will see here if wish to day if choose to wait major grantly said that must wait must see grace on afternoon mr dale again suggested that must lunch with declined then proposed that must go across call upon squire thus consume time to also objected be not

fortune have fallen on own child here be man who be at point gentleman such at least be character mr dale at once conceded to grace have chanced to come across man to please eye satisfy taste be loved by result of chance must be that grace must have everything given to that world have to give worth acceptance must have companion for life whom must trust admire love of whom must be infinitely proud mr dale be not at aware whether major grantly might have five hundred year to spend five thousand what sum intermediate between two did give much of thought at moment to side of subject knew without thinking of fancied that knew that there be mean sufficient for comfortable living be solely nature character of man be in mind sufficiency be to be found in for wife happiness daughter lily have come across man who be scoundrel a consequence of meeting life be marred must credit be given to grace for success blame attached to lily for failure surely not latter how be girl to have guarded from love so unfortunate have avoided rock on vessel have be shipwrecked then many bitter thought passed through mr dale mind almost envied grace crawley lover lily be contented to remain a be lily be mother must not bring to be satisfied that child must fill lower place in world than other girl have ever be idea idea probably never absolutely uttered even to herself not le practically conceived that be

squire be annoyed with for own awkwardness in having thus come upon house must have wished to keep altogether unseen if have be possible especially unseen by old gentleman to whom now that have met be almost bound to introduce be not absolutely bound to do so determined that must still keep peace even if squire must afterwards hear of having be there what must matter to proclaim at present moment

grantly though be abashed almost dismayed by meeting of course came forward gave hand to friend grace in taking did not utter word perhaps ought to have introduced to a major grantly said turning to squire major grantly dear have idea that be expected in part have come without being expected be very welcome be sure hope father be well used to know year ago daresay have not forgotten then while girl stood by in silence while grantly be endeavouring to escape squire invited very warmly to send portmanteau up to house will have lady up from house below make a little dull for a possible must not have suited grantly at rate must not suit till must know what answer be to have excused therefore pleading positive necessity to be at guestwick that evening then explaining that have already seen mr dale expressed intention of going back to small house in company with lady if must allow squire who did not a yet quite understand bade formal adieu lily led way home down behind churchyard wall through bottom of garden belonging to great house of course knew now who stranger be did in power to relieve grace of embarrassment grace have hitherto not spoken single word since have seen lover did say word to in walk to house in truth be not much more communicative than grace lily did talking with wonderful female skill contrived to have word ready for use till found together in mr dale drawing room have caught major mamma landed said lily laughing be afraid from what hear that have caught first chapter xxix miss lily dale logic lady julia de guest always lunched at one exactly be not much past twelve when john eames made appearance at cottage be of course told to stay of course said that must stay have be purpose to lunch with lady julia then have not expected to find lily dale at cottage lily must have be quite at ease protected by lady julia somewhat protected also by own power of fence have not be that grace be there also grace crawley from moment that have heard description of gentleman who looked out of window with glass in eye have by mean be at ease lily saw at once that must not be brought to join in conversation john lady julia in ignorance of matter in hand made matter worse so that be major grantly said john have heard of before think be son of old archdeacon be not know about old archdeacon said lady julia archdeacon be son of old bishop whom remember very well be not so very long since bishop died wonder what be doing at allington said johnny think know uncle said lily be going to call on mother said then johnny remembered that major have said something a to knowing miss crawley for moment be silent remember when talked of making son bishop also said lady julia what same man who be now major said johnny goose be not son be grandson be going to make archdeacon bishop remember hearing that be terribly disappointed be getting to be old man now suppose yet dear how well remember father did look like bishop son said johnny how doe bishop son look lily asked suppose ought to have sort of clerical tinge about fellow have nothing of kind then fellow a call said lily be only son of archdeacon account for suppose said johnny during time grace did not say word lily perceived then bethought a to what have better do grace knew must not be comfortable where be indeed be probable that grace must be very comfortable in returning home there must not be much ease for grace till coming meeting between major grantly must be over must be better grace must go back to allington at once better also perhaps for major grantly that must be so lady julia said think will mind stopping for lunch to day nonsense dear promised think must break promise do indeed must be angry with lily looked at lady julia a though there be something lady julia ought to understand lily must not quite explain fear that lily be false intended old friend to believe that be running away because john eames have come there will be famished said lady julia will live through said lily be out of question must let walk way here from allington way back without taking something will just be home in time for lunch if go now said lily will not that be best grace grace hardly knew what must be best only knew that major grantly be at allington that have come thither to see idea of hurrying back after be unpleasant to yet be so flurried that felt thankful to lily for taking away from cottage matter be compromised at last remained for hour ate biscuit pretended to drink glass of wine then started john eames who in truth believed that lily dale be running away from be by mean well pleased when girl be gone did not make so agreeable to old friend a must have done what fool be to come here at said throwing into arm chair a soon a front door be closed that be very civil to john know what mean lady julia be fool to come near until can do so without thinking more of than do of other girl in county think have anything to complain of a yet said lady julia who have in sort perceived that lily retreat have be on grace account not on own seems to that lily be very glad to see when told that be coming to stay here must be near for day seemed to be quite pleased did indeed then why did run away moment came in said johnny think be something said about man who have gone to allington what difference can man make to truth be despise do indeed lady julia only think of

still if thought did must never speak word to mean about myself of course be not going to quarrel with be not such fool a then lady julia tried to comfort succeeded so far that be induced to eat mince veal have be intended for comfort support of two young lady who have run away do think be be first word grace said when be fairly on way back together must think must be what other man can there be of sort who must be likely to come to allington to see coming be not likely can not understand that must come let leave silverbridge without seeing thought that be quite right think be quite right to come here be very glad have come show that have really something like heart inside have not come sent written taken step before trial come on to make know that be thinking of must have said that be a hard a hard a other man that ever heard of men be so hard think be now be beginning to regard a one chevalier sans peur et sans reproche to fancy that ought to go down on knee before kiss highness shoebuckle in judging of men one mind vacillates so quickly between scorn be due to false man worship be due to true man then be silent for moment grace said nothing lily continued tell fairly grace that will expect very much from now much in what way lily in way of worship will not be content that must merely love if have come here a must have done to say that moment of world reproach be moment have chosen to ask to be wife think that will owe more than love will owe more than love will pay more than love said grace there be something in tone of voice a spoke made lily stop her look up into face there be smile there lily have never seen before gave beauty to be wonderful to lily eye surely lover of grace must have seen smile like therefore have loved be giving such wonderful proof of love yes continued grace standing looking at friend may stare at lily may be sure will do for major grantly good can do for what do mean grace never mind what mean be very imperious in managing own affair must let be so equally in mine tell everything do suppose that if if if in real truth can possibly be case that major grantly will have come here to offer hand when be ground down into dust a

story in own way wo interrupt till have done be always best must first crave attention to unfortunate preliminary said mr crawley what be come before in forma pauperis here mr crawley paused stood up before attorney with hand crossed one upon other bending low a though calling attention to poorness of raiment know have justification for conduct have nothing of reason to offer why must trespass

heartfelt agony at former time wife have taken that from friend mr arabin with hand half hidden from have refused whether be better to eat bread of charity not to eat bread at for myself have doubt said when want strike one wife child charity strike only then there be doubt when spoke thus mr toogood got up thrusting hand into waistcoat pocket walked about room exclaiming by george by george by george still let man go on with story heard out at last to end committed for trial at next barchester assize said lawyer did employed lawyer before magistrate none refused to employ one be wrong there mr crawley must be allowed to say that be wrong there may possibly have be so from point of view mr toogood permit to explain be good explaining now of course must employ lawyer for defence attorney who will put case into hand of counsel can not do mr toogood must do if do friend must do for if do everybody will say be mad there be single solicitor must find within mile of at moment who must give same advice not single man who have got head on shoulder worth turnip when mr crawley be told that madness must be laid to charge if did not do a be bid face became very black assumed something of look of determined obstinacy have worn when be standing in presence of bishop mr proudie may be so said may be a say mr toogood neighbour of yours a to whose collected wisdom speak with so much certainty must hardly recommend to indulge in luxury for have mean of paying who think about paying under such circumstance a do mr toogood wretchedest costermonger come to grief have barrister in wig gown to give chance of escape be not costermonger mr toogood though more wretched perhaps than costermonger now in existence be lot to have to endure suffering of poverty at same time not to be exempt from feeling of honour to poverty be seldom subject can not afford to call in legal assistance for can not pay will not do will carry case through for certainly be not just line of business will see carried through for out of own pocket never mind when say will do thing will do mr toogood thing can not do suppose be le grateful what be can do then why do come to if wo take advice after conversation went on for considerable time without touching on point need be brought palpably before reader eye attorney continued to beg clergyman to have case managed in usual way went so far a to tell that must be ill treating wife family if continued to be obstinate clergyman be not shaken from resolve be at last able to ask mr toogood what have better do how have better attempt to defend on understanding that legal aid be to be employed when question be at last asked in such way a to demand answer mr toogood sat for moment two in silence felt that answer be not only demanded almost enforced yet there might be much difficulty in giving mr toogood said mr crawley seeing attorney hesitation declare to before god that only object will be to enable jury to know about sad matter know if must open breast to must be satisfied then prisoner can say nothing what doe say be ever accounted false be why must have legal assistance have already come to conclusion on matter a thought said mr crawley mr toogood paused for moment two then dashed at answer rather dashed at counter question mr crawley where did get cheque must pardon know if wish will not press question so much hang on that know thing must hang on if only knew mean that forget absolutely totally wish mr toogood must explain to toilsome perseverance with have cudgelled poor brain endeavouring to extract from scintilla of memory must aid must have picked up in house did not do dull a be know so much be mine of right from source came to know a one else can know in spite of wise man motto have picked up cheque in house on road must not have slept till have taken step to restore to seeming owner so much can say otherwise be in such matter so shandy pated that can trust to be sure of nothing thought certainly thought thought what thought that have be given to by friend dean remember well be in library at barchester be somewhat provoked in spirit there be lying on floor hundred of volume glittering with gold reeking with new leather from binder asked to look at toy why must look at there be time other day seemed when have be glad to borrow from such treasure a have seemed to that be heartless in showing thing well need not trouble with go on go on let hear will learn something know now how vain how vile be always know afterwards how low spirit have grovelled have gone to then because have resolved to humble for wife sake to ask friend for money with word be very awkward doubt be ungracious have asked have bid follow from hall into library there left awhile on returning told with smile that have sent for money if can remember sum named be fifty pound have turned out a say that have paid fifty pound with money besides cheque be true be quite true there be doubt of a be saying then fell to talking about book be angered be very sore in heart from moment in word of beggary have passed from lip have repented have laughed have taken gaily turned upon told that have changed mind be grateful must not have money so prepared to go argued with must not let go telling of wife of child while argued there came knock at door something be handed in knew that be hand of wife be money suppose yes mr toogood be money became more uneasy because be rich liked le because seemed to come from hand took what must do when reminded must not keep parish unless certain sum be paid gave little parcel in cover took left sorrowing have never before come quite to though indeed have in fact be often so before what be difference whether alms be given into hand into wife be too touchy about mr crawley of course be do try see whether will be touchy have worked hard at profession daresay well yes pretty well to tell truth have worked hard by george yes be not so bad now a used to be have always earned bread bread for yourself bread for wife little one can buy ticket for play must always buy ticket mind have worked a hard yet can not get bread be older than can not earn bare

what passed two men who have be hard on came to house when be out wife be in terrible state gave money went into silverbridge paid cheque be with what gave gave money in note just fifty pound when gave thought gave yet afterwards thought remembered that in illness have found cheque with dean money be not so be sure of that have said that put five note of l into cover such note certainly gave to wife where then did get cheque mr crawley again paused before answered surely if will exert mind will remember said lawyer where did get cheque know mr toogood threw back in chair took knee up into lap to nurse began to think of sat thinking of for minute without word perhaps for five minute though time seemed to be much longer to mr crawley who be however determined that must not interrupt mr toogood thought be at variance with mr toogood former word perhaps after scheme of mr crawley rather mode of defence on have resolved without scheme might be best of case admitted might be well that must go into court without lawyer have convinced of innocence mr toogood said to why must not convince jury have convinced not because be specially soft because love man for a to dislike rather than otherwise because there be real truth in word else so well feigned show of truth that jury can tell difference think be true by george think did get twenty pound honestly that doe not moment know where got may have put finger into eye if so why not also into eye of jury then released leg spoke something of thought aloud be sad story said very sad story well yes be sad enough if must see house

illustration there be great dismay in barchester palace after visit paid to bishop mr proudie by terrible clerical offender mr crawley will be remembered perhaps how have defied bishop with spoken word how have defied bishop wife by speaking word to for moment doubt mr crawley have best of mr proudie acknowledged to herself that be case a be woman who have never yet succumbed to enemy who have never if on occasion may be allowed to use schoolboy slang taken licking from one be not likely that mr crawley must be long allowed to enjoy triumph in peace must be odd if weight of palace must not be able to silence wretch of perpetual curate who have already be committed to take trial for thieving mr proudie be determined that weight of palace must be used a for bishop though be not a angry a wife be quite a unhappy therefore quite a hostile to mr crawley be fully conscious that there must be peace for now until mr crawley must be crushed if only assize must come at once get condemned out of way what blessed thing must be unluckily still wanted three month to assize during three month mr crawley must be at large subject only to episcopal authority during time must not be silenced by arm of civil law wife be not long in expressing opinion after mr crawley have left palace must proceed against in court of arch at once said mr proudie can do of course know that will be expensive of course will be expensive suppose may cost hundred of pound duty be duty lord in such case a duty a bishop be paramount poor bishop knew that be useless to explain to various mistake made be ever making a to extent of power mode of procedure be open to when must do so must only rail at for being lukewarm in office poor in spirit afraid of dealing roundly with below on present occasion did say word must not even hear to end tell about rural dean a if did know rural dean have nothing to do with case man have be committed for trial send for mr chadwick at once let step be taken before be hour older dear mr chadwick can hing then will see mr chadwick in anger did sit down write note to mr chadwick begging to come over to at palace mr chadwick be lawyer living in barchester who earned bread from ecclesiastical business father uncle grandfather granduncle have be concerned in affair of diocese of barchester uncle have be bailiff to episcopal estate steward a have be called in bishop grantly time still contrived to draw income in shape from property of see nephew have also be legal assistant of bishop in latter day have be continued in position by bishop proudie not from love from expediency mr john chadwick be one of gentleman two three of whom be to be seen in connection with see who seem to be hybrid half lay half cleric dress like clergyman affect that mixture of clerical solemnity clerical waggishness be generally to be found among minor canon vicar choral of cathedral live at least have office half in close half out of dwelling a be just on border of holy order always wear white neck handkerchief black glove must be altogether clerical in appearance be not that a regard outward man impinge somewhat on characteristic of undertaker savour of church savour be of church exterior stranger thrown into chance contact with one of must from instinct begin to talk of thing ecclesiastical without reference to thing theological thing religious be always most worthy men much respected in society of close never heard of one of whose wife be not comfortable whose child be left without provision one be mr john chadwick a be portion of duty to accompany bishop to consecration ordination knew dr proudie very well having be brought up a be under very wing of bishop grantly must not well be that must love bishop grantly successor old bishop new bishop have be so different that man must like even esteem mr chadwick be prudent man who knew well source from earned bread have never quarrelled with bishop proudie knew mr proudie also of necessity when say of that have hitherto avoided open quarrel with will think be allowed that be man of prudence sagacity have sometimes be sorely tried felt when got note that be now about to encounter very sore trial muttered something might have be taken for oath be not that outward sign of man gave warranty that oath must proceed from such one then wrote short note presenting compliment to mr proudie saying that must call at palace at eleven o'clock on following morning in meantime mr proudie who must not be silent on subject for moment did learn something of truth from husband information did not come to in way of instruction be teased out of unfortunate man know that can proceed against in court of arch under 'church discipline act ' said dear said bishop shaking head in misery in consistorial court be same thing there must be inquiry first by brother clergy there must indeed be only way of proceeding there have be inquiry have be committed that doe signify dear be civil law if civil law condemns lock up in prison a most certainly will do have done so yet dear really think that a have gone so far will be best to leave a be till have taken trial what leave there after what occurred morning in palace palace with mr proudie be always palace never house ten thousand time be not aware that insulted grossly most grossly insulted be never treated with such insolence by clergyman before since first came to palace never never know man to be thief absolutely know think lord of soul of people oh dear oh dear oh dear said bishop why do fret in way because will get into trouble tell only thing to be done be to issue commission with rural dean at head of then issue commission will take three month why must take three month why must take more than three day three hour be plain sailing thing be never plain sailing dear when bishop have to oppose of clergy be always made a difficult a possible more shame for who make so be so if be to take legal proceeding against must cost oh dear more than thousand pound must say if cost two must do mr proudie anger be still very hot must not have spoken of unremunerative outlay of money in such language a in manner did come to understand before arrival of mr chadwick that husband must take legal step towards silencing mr crawley until commission of clergyman have be appointed to inquire into matter that commission must be headed by rural dean within limit of whose rural deanery parish of hogglestock be situated by beneficed parochial clergyman of repute in neighbourhood now rural dean be dr tempest of silverbridge who have held that position before coming of dr proudie to diocese there have grown up in bosom of mr proudie strong feeling that undue mercy have be shown to mr crawley by magistrate of silverbridge of whom dr tempest have be one magistrate have taken bail for appearance at assize instead of committing to prison at once a be bound to do when offence a have be committed by clergyman even though there be clergyman among have thought nothing of soul of poor people in such language mr proudie have spoken of affair at silverbridge having once committed to opinion of course thought that dr tempest must go through fire water must omit stretch of what little judicial power might be committed to hand with view of opposing bishop maintaining culprit in position in such case a can not name acting rural dean dr tempest know be very old dear can not can ask mr chadwick at rate then must name mr thumble mr thumble doe even hold living in diocese oh dear oh dear oh dear so matter rested until mr chadwick came mr proudie have doubt intended to have mr chadwick to herself at rate so to encounter in first instance having be at length convinced that inquiry by rural dean be really necessary a preliminary having also slept upon question of expenditure gave direction that lawyer must be shown into bishop study took care to be absent at moment of arrival of course did not intend that mr chadwick must leave palace without having heard what have to say thought that must be well that must be made to conceive that though summons have be written by have really be intended on part of bishop mr chadwick will be with at eleven bishop said a got up from breakfast table at left lordship with two of daughter with married son in law clergyman who be staying in house very well dear said bishop with smile for be anxious not to betray vexation at wife interference before daughter rev mr tickler understood mr chadwick have be sent for with reference to mr crawley be driven absolutely driven to propose to lawyer that commission of inquiry must be issued punctually at eleven mr chadwick came wearing very long face a entered palace door for felt that must in probability be now compelled to quarrel with mr proudie much must bear there be limit to endurance have never absolutely sent for before though have often interfered with will have to tell bit of mind said a stepped across close habited in best suit of black with most exact white cravat yet looking not quite like clergyman with touch of undertaker in gait when found that be shown into bishop room that bishop be there bishop only mind be relieved must have be better that bishop must have written that chaplain must have written in lordship name that however be trifle bishop did not know what to say to if intended to direct inquiry to be made by rural dean must be by mean becoming that must consult mr chadwick a to doing so might be well if not well at rate not improper that must make application to dr tempest through mr chadwick in case must give order at once still wished to avoid if be possible since have be in diocese case so grave a have be pushed upon intervention of rural dean in ordinary way have used have be made to use more than once by wife vicar have be absent little too long from one parish there have be rumour about brandy water in once have be very nearly in deep water because mr proudie have taken in dudgeon that certain young rector who have be left widower have very pretty governess for child there have be that case sadly notorious in diocese at time of excellent friend mr robarts of framley when bailiff be in house because must pay debt rather debt of friend for whom have signed bill in case good fortune have intervened have be saved from terrible necessity of ulterior process now now be being driven beyond to purpose if mr proudie must only wait three month civil law must do for here be mr chadwick in room knew that must be useless for to attempt to talk to mr chadwick about other matter so dismiss wife of bosom must be down upon before chadwick must be out of room h m have how d 'ye do mr chadwick wo sit down mr chadwick thanked lordship sat down be very cold be mr chadwick hard frost lord beautiful day wo come near fire bishop knew that mr proudie be on road have eye to proper strategical position of force mr proudie must certainly take up position in certain chair from whence light enabled to rake husband thoroughly what advantage might have from must not prevent must so place mr chadwick that lawyer must be more within reach of eye than of wife so bishop pointed to arm chair opposite to near fire mr chadwick seated accordingly be very sad affair about mr crawley said bishop very sad indeed said lawyer never pitied man so much in life lord be not exactly line bishop be desirous of taking of course be to be pitied of course be from hear mr chadwick be afraid be afraid must not acquit a to that lord have to stand trial of course see mr chadwick regarding a beneficed clergyman with cure of question be whether must be justified in leaving where be till trial will come on of course lordship know best about know there be difficulty know that be inclined to think that in interest of parish be bound to issue commission of inquiry believe lordship have attempted to silence that have refused to comply thought better for everybody sake especially for own that must for while be relieved from duty be obstinate man very obstinate man made attempt with consideration for feeling be hard put to lord know man pride dean have spoken of to more than once nobody know so well a dean if might venture to offer opinion good morning mr chadwick said mr proudie coming into room taking accustomed seat thank will stay away from fire if please lordship have spoken to doubt about unfortunate wretched man be speaking of now dear something must of course be done to put stop to cry disgrace of having such man preaching from pulpit in diocese when think of soul of people in poor village hair literally stand on end then be disobedient be worst of said bishop must have be so much better for if must have allowed to provide quietly for service till trial be over must have told lord that must not do that from what knew of said mr chadwick must do said mr proudie must be made to do lordship will find difficult said mr chadwick can issue commission know to rural dean said bishop mildly yes can do dr tempest in two month time will have named assessor dr tempest must not name bishop must name said mr proudie be customary to leave to rural dean said mr chadwick bishop doubt can object to one named can specially select clergyman plea from archdeaconry said bishop have known done rural dean in such case have probably be old man not active said lawyer dr tempest be very old man said mr proudie in such matter not at trustworthy be one of magistrate who took bail lordship must hardly set aside said lawyer at rate must not recommend to try think might suggest commission of five propose two of number think that in case dr tempest must raise question at last be settled in way mr chadwick be to prepare letter to dr tempest for bishop signature in doctor must be requested a rural dean to whom mr crawley be subject to hold commission of five to inquire into mr crawley conduct letter be to explain to dr tempest that bishop moved by solicitude for soul of people of hogglestock have endeavoured in friendly way to induce mr crawley to desist from ministration that having failed through mr crawley obstinacy have alternative to proceed in way have better say that lordship a bishop of diocese can take heed of coming trial said mr proudie think lordship have better say nothing at about trial said mr chadwick think will be best said bishop if report against said mr chadwick can only then proceed in ecclesiastical court at own expense will hardly be so obstinate a said bishop be afraid know lord said lawyer bishop thinking of scene have taken place in very room only yesterday felt that did know mr crawley felt also that hope have just expressed be one in put trust something might turn up be devoutly to be hoped that dr tempest must take long time over inquiry assize might come on a soon a be terminated very shortly afterwards then everything might be well wo find dr tempest very ready at said mr chadwick bishop in heart be comforted by word must be made to be ready to do duty said mr proudie imperiously mr chadwick shrugged shoulder then got up spoke farewell little speech left palace chapter xxxv lily dale writes two

without waiting for word of affection be on old woman lip got out of room started on journey walk be only three mile weather be dry frosty have come to turn leading up to church squire house almost before remembered that be near allington here paused for moment to think if continued way down by red lion through allington street must knock at mr dale door ask for admission by mean of servant a must be done by ordinary visitor must make way on to lawn by going up beyond wall of churchyard through squire garden knew path well very well thought that might take so much liberty a with squire

have detained escaped from hopkins old gardener with little more than word be going down to see lady hopkins suppose will find then while hopkins be arranging spade so that might lean upon for little chat johnny be gone have made way into other garden have thought possible that might meet lily out among walk by meeting a must have suited better than other a crossed little bridge separated garden

crosbie a angel of light upon earth what hope must there have be for then what use be there in telling tale of love at time when told knew that crosbie have be before knew that crosbie be at moment

raffle buffle standing up with back to fire with hat on head speaking with loud harsh voice to show way in declared that gentleman received inferior then bowing scraping rubbing hand together simpering with must be softness declaring that after fashion sir raffle received superior be very merry so that one must have thought that johnny be despondent lover now bent on throwing dice for last

order that may know how little effect answer to have have towards inducing to give up what said about father family have weight with ought ultimately to have none with business of father be great misfortune so great that probably have not known other before happened might have prevented becoming intimate when chanced to meet have met before happened before happened have determined to ask to be wife what must have to think of if allowed heart to be altered by such cause a have only further to say that love better than one in world that be best hope that will be wife will not press till affair of father have be settled when be over will look for reward without reference to result not that doubt result if there be anything like justice in england that debt to if owe debt will be

explained between three conspirator mr dobbs broughton declared that if entertained slightest idea that husband must object to painting of picture in room nothing on earth must induce to lend countenance to yet might be well not to tell just at first perhaps not till sitting be over perhaps not till picture be finished a otherwise tidings of picture might get round to ear be not intended to hear poor dear dobbs be so careless with secret miss van siever explained motif in very different way know mamma must not let do if knew therefore will not tell dear clara said mr broughton with smile be so outspoken why not said miss van siever be old enough to judge for if mamma doe not want to be deceived ought not to treat like child of course will find out sooner later care about conway dalrymple said nothing a two lady be thus excusing how delightful must be not to have master said mr broughton addressing then man have to work for own bread said suppose come about equal in long run very little drawing painting be done on day in first place be necessary that question of costume must be settled mr broughton artist have much to say on subject be considered proper jael must be dressed a jewess there came to be much question how jewess dressed in very early day mr broughton have prepared jewel raiment of many colour painter declared that wife of kenite must have jewel when mr broughton discovered from bible that heber have be connected by family tie with moses be more than ever sure that heber wife must have in tent much of spoiling of egyptian when clara van siever suggested that at rate must not have worn in time of confusion when soldier be loose flying about country mr broughton be quite confident that must have put on before invited captain of enemy host into tent artist at last took matter into own hand by declaring that miss van siever must sit subject much better without jewel therefore mr broughton gewgaw be put back into box then on four different time two lady have to retire into mr broughton room in order that jael might be arrayed in various costume in costume have to kneel down taking hammer in hand holding pointed stick have be prepared to do duty a nail upon forehead of dummy sisera at last be decided that raiment must be altogether white that must wear twisted round head falling over shoulder roman silk scarf of various colour where jael must have gotten know said clara may be sure that there be lot of such thing among egyptian said mr broughton moses brought away best for own family who be to be sisera asked mr broughton in one of pause in work be thinking of asking friend john eames to sit of course can not sit together said miss van siever there be reason why must said dalrymple can do second figure in own room then there be bargain made that sisera must not be portrait must never do said mr broughton shaking head very gravely though there be really very little done to picture on day work be commenced mr broughton who have at first objected strongly to idea who have said twenty time that be quite out of question that must be done in house became very eager in delight about nobody must know anything of picture till must be exhibited must be best must be picture of year be little heart broken when dalrymple assured that must not possibly be finished for exhibition in may came to again when declared that meant to put out strength upon there will be five six month work in said will there indeed how much work be there in 'the grace grace a will perhaps be remembered be triple portrait of mr dobbs broughton question artist did not answer with absolute accuracy contented with declaring that with model a mr broughton picture have be comparatively easy mr broughton having doubt that ultimate object of have spoken to friend conway steadily in view took occasion before sitting be over to leave room so that artist might have opportunity of speaking word in private to model if have such word to speak mr broughton a did felt that be doing duty a wife friend christian be doing duty a wife because be giving clearest proof in world clearest at rate to herself that intimacy between herself friend conway have in nothing be improper be doing duty a friend because clara van siever with large expectation must be eligible wife be doing duty a christian because whole thing be intended to be moral miss demolines have declared that friend maria clutterbuck a miss demolines delighted to call mr broughton in memory of dear old innocent day have high principle reader will see that be justified in declaration will be better so said mr broughton a sat upon bed wiped tear from corner of eye yes will be better so there be pang of course there be pang will be better so acting upon high principle allowed conway dalrymple five minute to say what have to say to clara van siever then allowed to indulge in very savage feeling in reference to husband accusing husband in thought of great cruelty nay of brutality because of certain sharp word that have said a to conway dalrymple of course ca understand said mr broughton to herself how be to be expected that must understand allowed friend on occasion only five minute thinking probably that so much time might suffice woman when be jealous be apt to attribute to other woman with whom jealousy be concerned weakness timidity to man audacity strength woman who have taken perhaps twelve month in winning will think that woman be to be won in five minute be not to be supposed that mr dobbs broughton have ever be won by one except by mr dobbs broughton at least let not be supposed that have ever acknowledged spark of love for conway dalrymple nevertheless there be enough of jealousy in present mood to make think poorly of miss van siever capacity for standing siege against artist eloquence otherwise having left two together with object have acknowledged to herself must hardly have returned to after so very short interval hope wo dislike trouble of said dalrymple to model a soon a mr broughton be gone can not say that like very much said miss van siever be afraid will be bore hope will go through with will if be not prevented said miss van siever when have said that will do thing like to do there be pause in conversation took up considerable portion of five minute miss van siever be not holding nail during moment be sitting in commonplace way on chair while dalrymple be scraping palette wonder what be that first induced to sit said oh know took fancy for be very glad did take fancy will make excellent model if wo mind posing again for few minute will not weary to day right arm little more forward must tumble down not if lean well on to nail must have woken sisera before have struck blow never mind that let try then mr broughton returned with pleasant feeling in bosom of having done duty a wife friend christian mr broughton continued painter just steady miss van siever shoulder with hand now bring arm elbow little more forward jael did not have friend to help in way said miss van siever at end of hour two lady retired jael disrobed miss van siever put on customary raiment be agreed among that have commenced work auspiciously that must meet again on following monday artist begged to be allowed hour to go on with work in mr broughton room hour be conceded to be understood that must not take canvas backwards forward with to own house pointed out that progress must be made unless be occasionally allowed such grace a mr broughton doubted hesitated made difficulty lifted up hand in despair be easy for to say why not know very well why not at last gave way honi soit qui mal y pense said that must be protection so followed miss van siever downstairs leaving mr dalrymple in possession of boudoir will give just one hour said then will come turn out so went down a miss van siever must not stay to lunch with ate lunch by sending glass of sherry biscuit up to poor painter at work exactly at end of hour returned to now conway must go said why in hurry because say that must be so when say so pray let be sufficient still dalrymple went on working conway said how can treat with so much disdain disdain mr broughton yes disdain have not begged to understand can not allow to remain here yet pay attention to wish have done now began to put brush paint together suppose thing may remain here yes may remain must do so of course there if will put easel in corner with canvas behind will not be seen if must chance to come into room must not be angry suppose if saw there be knowing men be so unreasonable men be think be whom have have fortune to know woman generally say that men be selfish complain so much that be selfish a that be thoughtless be headstrong look forward to result now think must willingly do injury think must be sure must not yet must forget to save from one injury oh never mind be not thinking of anything in particular from for instance will not talk about way madness lie tell conway what do think of clara van siever be very handsome certainly clever decidedly clever must think have temper of own what woman be there worth straw have not if clara van siever be ill used must resent doubt that for moment must not like to be man who must do said conway there be plenty of feminine softness in character if be treated with love kindness conway if will take advice will ask clara van siever to be wife perhaps have already who yes have not done yet certainly mr broughton why must not do there be two three reason perhaps none of great importance do know of none mr broughton know of none said mr broughton in very serious in almost tragic tone of none must weigh for moment a far a be concerned nothing must give more pleasure be so kind of mean to be kind do indeed conway know will be better for that must be settled very much better will be better for mind admitting that though in saying so trust greatly to generosity to interpret word properly will not flatter if mean that there be question of flattery conway question be simply of truth prudence do not know that must be better that must be married not unless certain gentleman be to die first said conway dalrymple a deposited last of painting paraphernalia in recess have be prepared for by mr broughton conway how can speak in wicked wicked way can assure wish gentleman in question slightest harm in world if welfare depended on must be a safe a bank of england will not take advice what advice about clara mr broughton matrimony be very important thing indeed be oh who can say how important there be time conway when thought have given heart to madalina demolines heaven forbid grieved because thought that be not worthy of there be never anything in mr broughton thought that there be at rate said so know that for certain told so let pas clara van siever be in respect very different from madalina clara think be worthy of conway of course be not for to dictate to must tell then paused a though did not know how to finish sentence what must tell will tell nothing more if can not understand what have said must be more dull of comprehension than believe to be now go why be not gone half hour how must go while be giving good advice have not asked to stay go now at rate remember conway if picture be to go on will not have remaining here after work be done will remember held by hand while declared that must remember mr dobbs broughton be more in love with conway dalrymple than be in love with king charles on horseback at charing cross over beyond protection came to in course of nature from unimpassioned feeling in special phase of life indeed may say in phase of life must be acknowledged on behalf that did enjoy protection come from what call principle though principle be not perhaps very high of kind madalina demolines have be right when talked of friend maria principle dobbs broughton have be so far lucky in jump in dark have made in taking wife to that have not fallen upon really vicious woman upon woman of strong feeling if have come to be lot of mr dobbs broughton to have six hour work to do day of life think that work must have be done badly that must have kept free from all danger a be have nothing to do have child be not given to much reading must not sit with needle in hand day have aptitude for may meeting excitement of charitable good work life with be very dull found amusement within reach so easy so pleasant a amusement of pretending to be in love if that did that said must only have be taken for worth for nothing more by different person concerned there be very little in to flatter mr dalrymple to give cause for tribulation to mr broughton probably cared little for of be one of woman to whom be not given by nature to care very much for anybody of two certainly cared most for mr dobbs broughton because mr dobbs broughton belonged to a to leaving mr dobbs broughton house putting into hand of man imogen of wife be ever le likely to take step so wicked so dangerous so generally disagreeable to party concerned conway dalrymple though now again have got side glance at true character with clear seeing eye did allow to be flattered deceived knew that be foolish ignorant that often talked wonderful nonsense knew also that be continually contradicting a when must strenuously beg to leave while must continue to talk to in strain prevented possibility of going nevertheless be flattered did believe that loved a to love for knew very well that amounted to nothing now again perhaps twice week if saw a often must say something must imply declaration of affection felt that a much a be expected from that ought not to hope to get off cheaper now that little play be going on about miss van siever did think that mr dobbs broughton be doing very best to overcome unfortunate attachment be so gratifying to young man feeling to suppose that man wife have conceived unfortunate attachment for conway dalrymple ought not to have be fooled by such woman fear that be fooled by a returned home to day from mr broughton house to own lodging rambled out for while into kensington garden thought of position seriously see why must not marry said to thinking of course of miss van siever if maria be not in earnest be not fault must be wish that must be in earnest if suppose to be so take at word can have right to quarrel with poor maria at rate will be better for for good can come of kind of thing by heaven with woman like of strong feeling one never know what may happen then thought of condition must be in if be to

be good yet weak that be afflicted by false pride supported by true pride that intellect be still very bright yet so dismally obscured on many side a almost to justify people in saying that be mad knew that be almost saint yet almost castaway through vanity hatred of above did not know that knew of also did not comprehend that must be hourly telling that people be calling mad be so calling with truth did not occur to that must see insight into doubted a to way in have got cheque never imagining however that have wilfully stolen thinking that mind have be so much astray a to admit of finding using without wilful guilt thinking also ala that man who must so act be hardly fit for such duty a be entrusted to did not dream that be precisely own idea of own state of own position that be always inquiring of whether be not mad whether if mad be not bound to lay down office that be ever taxing with improper hostility to bishop never forgetting for moment wrath against bishop bishop wife still

imagination pictured to whole scene how must humble to ground a acknowledged unfitness how must endure small voiced triumph of little bishop how from abjectness of own humility even from ground on must be crouching must rebuke loud mouthed triumph of bishop wife though there be touch wanting to picture thus drew did not really propose to to commit professional suicide wife too have considered whether might be in truth becoming that must give up clerical duty at rate for while have never thought that idea be present to mind also mr toogood have told that people must say that be mad mr toogood have looked at when declared for second time that have knowledge whence cheque have come to a though word be to be regarded a word of sick child mad said to a walked home from station night

announcement mr harding bowed when toogood named special branch of profession mr harding bowed lower than before a though desirous of showing that have great respect for attorney of course be anxious if only out of respect for family that wife cousin must pull through little difficulty if possible for sake of poor man too for wife child for sake of cloth exactly taking together be such pity know think mr harding can hardly have intended to steal money be sure did not be very hard to be sure of anybody mr harding very hard feel quite sure that did not have be most pious hard working clergyman can not bring to think that be guilty doe latin proverb say 'no one of sudden becomes most base ' temptation mr harding be very strong be awfully badgered about debt that butcher in silverbridge be playing mischief with butcher in barsetshire must not make honest man steal money think that mr crawley be honest man will excuse for being little hot about one of own order why be cousin rather wife fact be mr harding must get hold of dean a soon a possible be going to send gentleman after to send gentleman after said mr harding almost in dismay yes think that will be best be afraid will have to go long way mr toogood dean be told be in jerusalem be afraid be on journey there be to be there for easter week sunday week will be easter sunday why must gentleman want to go to jerusalem after dean then mr toogood explained a well a be able that dean might have something to say on subject must serve mr crawley defence must leave stone unturned said mr toogood a far a can judge crawley still think half think that got cheque from son in law mr harding shook head sorrowfully be not saying did know continued mr toogood ca see how be possible still ought not to leave stone unturned mr arabin can tell at where will find have anything to do with mr toogood ca quite say that have be just possible a said before mr harding must leave stone unturned be not expected here till end of april about th th think assize be th judge come into city on day will be too late to wait till then must have defence ready know can say where friend will find mr arabin mr harding began nursing knee patting being very tender to a sat meditating with head on one side meditating not so much a to nature of answer a to of question must be necessary that emissary from lawyer office must be sent after daughter did not like idea of eleanor being disturbed by question a to theft though have be twice married have son who be now nearly man still be eleanor if be necessary on mr crawley behalf of course must be done last address be at paris sir think have gone on to florence have friend there purpose to meet dean at venice on return then mr harding turned table wrote on card daughter address suppose mr arabin must have heard of affair said mr toogood have not done so when last wrote mentioned to other day before knew that have left paris if letter sister letter have be sent on to must know now then mr toogood got up to take leave will excuse for troubling hope mr harding oh sir pray mention that be trouble if one must only be of service one can always try to be of service in affair so much be to be done by rummaging about a always call there have be many theatrical manager know mr harding who have usually made up piece according to dress have happened to have in wardrobe have there indeed now never must have thought of lawyer have to do same thing not with clothes mr toogood not exactly with clothes with information quite understand mr toogood in preparing defence have to rummage about get up what can if ca find anything that suit exactly be obliged to use what do find a well a can remember when be young man ostler be to be tried for stealing oat in borough did steal too sold at rag shop regularly evidence against be a plain a pike staff must find out be that on certain day horse have trod on fellow foot so put to jury whether man must walk a far a rag shop with bag of oat when be dead lame got off did though said mr harding yes did be guilty have be at regularly for month dear dear dear must have be better to have have punished for fault gently so a to warn of consequence of such doings business be to get off got off be business to get cousin husband off if can must do by hook crook be very difficult piece of work because wo let employ barrister however will have one in court say nothing to about at good by mr harding a say must be thousand pity that clergyman must be convicted of theft one so well connected too mr harding when be left alone began to turn matter over in mind to reflect whether thousand pity of mr toogood have spoken appertained to conviction of criminal doing of crime if did steal money suppose ought to be punished let be ever so much clergyman said mr harding to yet how terrible must be of clergyman convicted of fraud in london have often heard nothing of kind have ever disgraced diocese to belonged since have known must not teach to hope that mr crawley must be acquitted if mr crawley be guilty must teach to believe that mr crawley be innocent something of doubt have crept across mind a talked to lawyer mr toogood though mr crawley be cousin seemed to believe that money have be stolen mr toogood a lawyer ought to understand such matter better than old secluded clergyman in barchester nevertheless mr toogood might be wrong mr harding succeeded in satisfying at last that must not be doing harm in thinking that mr toogood be wrong when have made up mind on matter sat down wrote following letter addressed to daughter at post office in florence deanery march dearest nelly when wrote on tuesday told about poor mr crawley that be clergyman in barsetshire of whose misfortune read account in galignani messenger think susan must have written about also because everybody here be talking of nothing else because of course know how strong regard dean have for mr crawley since something have occurred make write to again at once gentleman have just be here have indeed only moment left who tell that be attorney in london that be nearly related to mr crawley seems to be very good natured man daresay understands business a lawyer name be toogood have come down a say to get evidence to help poor gentleman on trial can not understand how must be necessary because seems to that evidence must be wanted on other side can not for moment suppose that clergyman gentleman such a mr crawley must have stolen money if be innocent can not understand why trouble must be necessary to prevent jury finding guilty mr toogood came here because wanted to see dean also did not explain a far a can remember why wanted to see said must be necessary that be going to send off messenger to find first dean afterwards have something to do with money be given to mr crawley last year if remember right be present of course mr toogood must not have known anything about however gave address poste restante florence daresay that somebody will make out before long if be still stopping at florence did not like letting go without telling about a thought that lawyer coming to must startle bairn be quite well a told in other letter miss jones say that little elly be a good a gold be with morning evening behave like darling angel a be posy be own little jewel always may be quite sure hing to spoil god bless dearest nelly most affectionate father septimus harding after wrote letter to other daughter mr grantly telling also of mr toogood visit then spent remainder of day thinking over gravity of occurrence how terrible must be if beneficed clergyman in diocese must really be found guilty of theft by jury from city then have always heard so high character of man from son in law no be impossible to believe that mr crawley have in truth stolen cheque for twenty pound mr toogood must get other information in barchester went on to silverbridge early in afternoon be half disposed to go by hogglestock look up cousin whom have never seen cousin husband upon whose business be now intent on reflection feared that might do more harm than good have quite appreciated fact that mr crawley be not like other men man be not above half saved have said to wife meaning thereby to insinuate that poor clergyman be not in full possession of wit to tell truth of mr toogood be little afraid of relative there be something in mr crawley manner in spite of declared poverty in spite also of extreme humility seemed to announce that expected to be obeyed when spoke on point with authority mr toogood have not forgotten tone in mr crawley have said to sir thing can not do thought that upon whole have better not go to hogglestock on occasion when at silverbridge began at once to rummage about chief rummaging be to be done at mr walker table before dinner have time to call upon magistrate clerk ask few question a to proceeding at sitting from mr crawley be committed found very taciturn old man who be nearly a difficult to deal with in rummaging process a porcupine nevertheless at last reached state of conversation be not absolutely hostile mr toogood pleaded that be poor man cousin pleaded that a family lawyer be naturally poor man protector at time a present pleaded also that a poor man be so very poor one else must come forward on behalf in way somewhat softened hard sharpness of old porcupine quill after there be very little to be learned from old porcupine there be not magistrate on bench said who have doubt that evidence be sufficient to justify in sending case to assize have regretted porcupine said in softest moment that gentleman have come there without legal adviser ah be be mischief of said mr toogood dashing hand against porcupine mahogany table fact be so strong mr toogood nobody there to soften down know said mr toogood shaking head very little more than be learned from porcupine then mr toogood went away prepared for mr walker dinner mr walker have invited dr tempest miss anne prettyman major grantly to meet mr toogood have explained in manner intended to be half earnest half jocose that though mr toogood be attorney like be at moment engaged in noble way on behalf of cousin husband without idea of receiving back even money must be out of pocket still be quite not quite know not quite so much of gentleman a be mr walker must have said have spoken out freely that insinuated contented with emphasis put upon not quite expressed meaning fully mr walker be correct in opinion of mr toogood a regard two attorney will not venture to say that of be not perfect gentleman perfect gentleman be thing can not define undoubtedly mr walker be bigger man in way than be mr toogood in did habitually consort in county of barsetshire with men of higher standing than with whom mr toogood associated in london seemed to be understood that mr crawley be to be general subject of conversation one attempted to talk about anything else indeed at time very little else be talked about in part of county not only because of interest naturally attaching to question of suspected guilt of parish clergyman because much have become lately known of mr crawley character because be known also that internecine feud have arisen between bishop have undoubtedly become general opinion that mr crawley have picked up used cheque be not own that have in fact stolen there be in spite of belief general wish that might be acquitted left in living when tidings of mr crawley victory over bishop at palace have become bruited about popular sympathy went with victor theft be a be condoned people made excuse be not always rational be founded on instinct of true humanity now tidings of stage in battle a fought against mr crawley by bishop have gone forth through county men have heard that rural dean be to be instructed to make inquiry must be preliminary to proceeding against mr crawley in ecclesiastical court dr tempest who be now about to meet mr toogood at mr walker be rural dean to whom mr crawley must have to submit in such inquiry dr tempest have not a yet received from bishop official order on subject be so delighted to think that have taken up cousin case said mr walker to mr toogood almost in whisper be not just cousin said mr toogood of course be same thing a to taking up case see dear madam wo let take up thought have thought be down here about only on sly mr walker have such queer idea that will not allow lawyer to be properly employed ca conceive how hard make do know mr walker know daughter grace then mr walker whispered something further may presume to have be intimation that gentleman opposite major grantly be supposed by people to be very fond of miss grace crawley quite child be said toogood whose own daughter now about to be married be three four year older than grace be beyond being child think of course be young suppose affair will knock on head said lawyer know how may be do say be very much attached to major be man of family of course must be very disagreeable if mr crawley be found guilty very disagreeable indeed upon word mr walker know what to say about think will go against mr toogood mr toogood shook head on seeing mr walker sighed deeply can only say have heard nothing from bishop a yet said dr tempest after lady have left room of course if think well to order inquiry must be made how long must take asked mr walker three month must think perhaps more of course crawley must do that must to delay be not at sure that must be in very great hurry ourselves who be 'we doctor said mr walker can not make such inquiry by know suppose bishop must ask to select two four other clergyman to act with be usual way of doing may be quite sure of walker assize will be over jury have found verdict long before have settled preliminary what will be good of going on after only good if unfortunate man be convicted wo said mr toogood who thought expedient to put on bolder front in talking of matter to rural dean than have assumed in whispered conversation with mr walker hope not with heart said doctor perhaps for sake of argument supposition may be allowed to pas certainly sir said mr toogood for sake of argument may pas if be convicted then suppose there will be end of question must be sentenced for not le must say than twelve month after must be a good parson of hogglestock when came out of prison a when went in said mr walker conviction judgment in civil court must not touch temporality certainly not said mr toogood of course not said doctor know in event of mr crawley coming back to parish must be open to bishop to raise question a to fitness for duty why must be a fit a one else said mr toogood simply because must have be found to be thief said doctor must excuse mr toogood be only for sake of argument see what have to do with said mr toogood must have undergone penalty be preferable that man who preaches from pulpit must not have undergone penalty said doctor in practice under such circumstance none of anticipate mr toogood living must doubt be vacated mr crawley must probably hardly wish to come back jury will do work before can do ours will do on much better base than can have when have done thing ought to be finished if jury acquit bishop can not proceed further if be found guilty think that resignation of living must follow be spite then on bishop part said major not at said doctor poor man be weak be be driven to persecute because can not escape persecution may really be question whether present proceeding be not right if be bishop must wait till trial be over be from from much more be said during evening on same subject mr toogood gradually learned position mr crawley question of mr crawley guilt really held in county returned to town resolved to go on with case will have barrister down express will defend in own teeth said to wife there will be scene in court daresay man will call upon own counsel to hold tongue shut up brief a far a can see counsel in case must have alternative there must come explanation how crawley be too honourable to employ man whom must not pay there must be romance must go down with jury one want sympathy in case a not evidence how much will cost tom said maria dolefully only trifle wo think of there be john eames be going way to jerusalem out of pocket johnny have got twelve child tom one doe have cousin in trouble

moment in hook court if thing have be going well with be now past eleven o'clock must have be at office at west end position in office be doubt high enough to place beyond reach of special inquiry a to such absence be generally felt that when crosby of west end have call into city about noon thing in world be not going well with man who go into city to look for money be generally one who doe not know where to get money when want mr musselboro on occasion kept hat on head there be something in way in balanced chair be in offence to mr crosbie personal dignity be hardly a yet two month since mr dobbs broughton have assured in very room that there need not be slightest anxiety about bill of course must be renewed commission being duly paid a mr dobbs broughton explained on occasion be business there be nothing liked so much a renewing bill for such customer a mr crosbie be very candid at meeting explaining how did branch of business raising money on own credit at four five per cent lending on own judgment at eight nine mr crosbie did not feel then called upon to exclaim that what be called upon to pay be about twelve perfectly understanding comfort grace of euphony have turned over in mind considering whether twelve per cent be not more than ought to be mulcted for accommodation wanted now at moment must have be glad to get from mr musselboro without further word for twenty thing have much changed with adolphus crosbie when be driven to make morning visit to one a mr musselboro with view of having bill renewed for two hundred fifty pound in early life have always have merit of being careful man a to money in other respect have gone astray very foolishly a have be partly explained in earlier chapter up to date of marriage with lady alexandrina de courcy have never have dealing in hook court in such locality money trouble have then come upon lady alexandrina being daughter of countess have high idea when very shortly after marriage have submitted to separation from noble wife have found income to be tied up inextricably in hand of one mr mortimer gazebee lawyer who have married one of wife sister be not that mr gazebee be dishonest did crosbie suspect of dishonesty lawyer be so wedded to interest of noble family with be connected that worked for a inferior spider might be supposed to work from infirmity of nature be compelled by instinct to be catching fly always for superior spider mr mortimer gazebee have in way entangled mr crosbie in web on behalf of noble spider de courcys poor friend in endeavour to fight way through web have fallen into hand of hook court firm of mr van siever dobbs broughton musselboro mr broughton told when be last here said crosbie that there must be difficulty about be renewed then be of course be for two month be speaking of continuation of renewal be afraid ca do mr crosbie be afraid ca indeed money be so awful tight of course must pay what choose to charge be that mr crosbie bill be out for collection must be collected in time like must draw in little know two hundred fifty pound be great deal of money will say little help know besides of course go upon system business be business must not be made pleasure of must have have great deal of pleasure in doing for ca be done in way of business when will broughton be here may be in at time ca say when suppose be down at court now what court capel court suppose can see there said crosbie if catch can see of course what good will do mr crosbie tell that ca do for if broughton be here moment must make slightest difference now mr crosbie have idea mr musselboro though sat in dobbs broughton seat kept on hat balanced chair on two leg be in truth nothing more than clerk did not quite understand manner in affair of establishment be worked though have be informed that mr van siever be one of partner dobbs broughton be managing man who really did business be convinced did not therefore like to be answered peremptorily by such one a musselboro must wish to see mr broughton said can call again can go down to court if like may take a answer from that bill ca be renewed by at moment door of room be opened dobbs broughton came into face be not at pleasant one might have seen with eye that money market be great deal tighter than liked to be here be mr crosbie here about bill said musselboro mr crosbie must take up bill be said dobbs broughton doe suit to take up said crosbie then must take up without suiting said dobbs broughton might have be seen said with eye mr broughton did not like state of money market might also be seen with other half that have be endeavouring to mitigate bitterness of dislike by alcoholic aid musselboro at once perceived that patron partner be half drunk crosbie be aware that have be drinking nevertheless be necessary that something more must be said bill must be due to morrow be payable at crosbie banker a mr crosbie too well knew there be fund there for purpose there be other purpose very needful for mr crosbie fund be at present moment unfortunately by mean sufficient stood for few moment thinking what must do whether must leave drunken man office let bill take chance whether must make one more effort for arrangement did not for moment believe that broughton be subject to pecuniary difficulty broughton lived in big house a rich men live have name for commercial success never occurred to crosbie that be matter of great moment to dobbs broughton that bill must be taken up crosbie still thought that musselboro be special enemy that broughton have joined musselboro in hostility simply because be too drunk to know better might at rate answer civilly mr broughton said know nothing about civility with thing a be at present said broughton civil by there be nothing so civil a paying money when owe musselboro reach down decanter glass perhaps mr crosbie will wet whistle want wine said what be up now said broughton staggering across room towards cupboard in be custom to keep provision of comfort needed at present moment suppose may stand glass of wine to fellow in own room if like will take wine thank said crosbie then can do other thing when ask gentleman to take glass of wine there be compulsion about bill there be compulsion do understand that may drink let alone pay must why mussy what d 'ye think there be carter ricketts carter be blessed if carter just now did beg for two month a though two month must be world to that for trumpery five hundred pound never saw money like be now never to appeal musselboro made reply not caring perhaps at present moment to sustain partner still balanced in chair still kept hat on head even mr crosbie began to perceive mr musselboro genius be in ascendant in hook court can hardly believe said crosbie that thing can be so bad that can not have bill for two hundred fifty pound renewed when be willing to pay for accommodation have not done much in way of bill never have one dishonoured yet let be first said dobbs broughton not if can prevent said crosbie to tell truth mr broughton bill will be dishonoured unless can have renewed if doe not suit to do suppose can recommend to one who can make convenient why go to banker said musselboro never did ask banker for anything of kind then must try what credit with be worth said broughton be worth much here a can perceive have have have crosbie when heard became very angry musselboro perceiving got out of chair so that might be in readiness to prevent violence if violence be attempted really be good staying here said see that broughton have be drinking there be knowing what may say do be blowed said broughton who have taken arm chair a soon a musselboro have left may believe in way of business continued musselboro when tell that really doe not suit to renew bill be pressed ourselves must press others who will do for said crosbie almost in despair there be burton bangle there wine merchant down in yard perhaps may accommodate be in line be told charge uncommon dear know messrs burton bangle said crosbie need stand in way tell where come from will make inquiry if think be about right will give money if wo mr crosbie then left office without exchanging word with dobbs broughton went down into hook court a descended stair turned over in mind propriety of going to messrs burton bangle with view of relieving from present difficulty knew that be ruinous dealing even with such men a dobbs broughton musselboro whom presumed to be milder in greed than burton bangle be of step on road to ruin what be to do if bill be dishonoured fact must certainly become known at office might even ultimately be arrested in doorway at bottom of stair stood for moment looking over at burton bangle did not at like aspect of establishment inside office must see man standing with cigar in mouth very resplendent with new hat with hat remarkable for bold upward curve of rim man be copiously decorated with chain seal hanging about widely over waistcoat be leaning with back against counter be talking to one on other side of there be something in man look manner be utterly repulsive to crosbie be more vulgar to eye even than musselboro voice crosbie must hear a stood in other doorway be almost a detestable a of dobbs broughton in drunkenness crosbie did not doubt that be burton bangle that man standing inside be bangle burton must not bring to accost men tell of necessity propose to that must relieve in spite of what musselboro have just said to must not believe possible that must succeed be to do so without introduction so left hook court went out into lane hearing a went loud voice of man with turned up hat chain what be to do at outset of pecuniary trouble when first found necessary to litigate question with de courcy people withstand web mortimer gazebee wove so assiduously own attorney have introduced to dobbs broughton assistance have needed have come to at rate without trouble did not especially like mr broughton when mr broughton first invited to come eat little bit of dinner have told with painful remorse that in early day have be accustomed to eat little bit of dinner with people of different kind there have be nothing really painful in since marriage with daughter of de courcys by marriage have intended to climb to highest pinnacle of social eating drinking have gradually found to be falling in scale of such matter must bring to dine with dobbs broughton without violent pain now have fallen so low that dobbs broughton have insulted be in such distress that did not know where to turn for ten pound mr gazebee have beaten at litigation own lawyer have advised that must be foolish to try matter further in marriage with noble daughter of de courcys have allowed framer of de courcy settlement to tie up in such way now even when chance have done so much for in freeing from wife be still bound to de courcy faction money have be paid away on behalf a alleged by mr gazebee like running water money for furniture money for lease of house money when have be separated from wife money while be living abroad have seemed to that have be made to pay for entire support of female moiety of de courcy family have settled at baden baden from day in respect from before day on wife have joined that moiety have done in power to struggle against payment such struggle have only cost more money mr gazebee have written to civilest note note seemed to cost money word of note seemed to find way into bill wife have died body have be brought back with pomp befitting body of earl daughter that might be laid with old de courcy dust at expense embalming of dear remains have cost wondrous sum be terrible blow upon item be showered upon by mr gazebee with most courteously worded demand for settlement a soon a convenient then when applied that lady alexandrina small fortune must be made over to according to certain agreement under have made over possession to wife must have survived mr gazebee expressed mild opinion that be wrong in law blandly recommended amicable lawsuit amicable lawsuit be carried on own lawyer seemed to throw over mr gazebee be successful in everything money came to money be demanded from on old score on new score that received to console for what have lost be mourning ring with wife hair for with sundry other mourning ring have to pay introduction to mr dobbs broughton to mr dobbs broughton owed five hundred pound a regarded bill for one half of sum be due to morrow mr dobbs broughton have refused to grant renewal for single month know more uncomfortable walking than fall to lot of men who go into city to look for money who find none of lost step trodden by men surely step lost after fashion be most melancholy be not only that be so vain that be accompanied by so killing sense of shame to wait about in dingy room look on to bare wall be approached through hook court to keep appointment at low coffee house to trystings money lender will not trouble to come unless plea to be civil almost suppliant to cunning knave whom borrower loathes to be refused thrice then cheated with eye open on fourth attempt to submit to vulgarity of foulest kind to have to seem to like to be badgered reviled at last accused of want of honesty by most fraudulent of mankind at same time to be clearly conscious of ruin be coming be fate of who go into city to find money not knowing where be to be found crosbie went along lane into lombard street then stood still for moment to think though knew good deal of affair in general did not quite know what must happen to if bill must be dishonoured that somebody must bring to noted require instantly to put hand into pocket bring out amount of bill amount of certain expense thought that did know knew that be in trade must become bankrupt be well aware that occurrence must prove to be insolvent did not know what creditor must immediately have power of doing that fact of bill having be dishonoured must reach board under served therefore also fact that have have recourse to such bill transaction alone be enough to fill with dismay in early life have carried head so high have be so much more than mere government clerk that idea of coming disgrace almost killed must not be well that must put end to thus escape what be there in world now for be worth while to live lily whom have once gained by gain have placed high in hope of happiness rich whom have then thrown away from who have again seemed to be almost within reach lily have so refused that knew not how to approach with further prayer have not refused how must have told of load of debt a stood at corner where lane run into lombard street came for while to think almost more of lily than of rejected bill then a thought of misfortune together asked whether pistol must not conveniently put end to together at moment loud harsh voice greeted ear hallo crosbie what brings so far east one doe not often see in city be voice of sir raffle buffle in former day have be very odious to crosbie ear for sir raffle buffle have once be presiding genius of office to crosbie still belonged indeed not very often said crosbie smiling who can tell who have not felt pain go to forcing of such smile sir raffle be not acutely observant person did not see that anything be wrong suppose be doing little business said sir raffle if man have kept trifle of money by certainly be time for turning have always be wide awake about such thing indeed said crosbie if must only make up mind that must shoot must not be pleasant thing to inflict condign punishment on odious man before left world crosbie knew that be not going to shoot knew also that have power of inflicting condign punishment on sir raffle buffle must only hate man curse inwardly ah have said sir raffle must be here unless knew where good thing be to be picked up must be off be on rocky mountain canal company directory be not above taking two guinea day good by boy remember to old optimist so sir raffle passed on leaving crosbie still standing at corner of lane what be to do interruption have at least seemed to drive lily from mind to send idea back to consideration of pecuniary difficulty thought of own bank west end establishment at be personally known to many of clerk where have be heretofore treated with great consideration of late balance have be very low more than once have be reminded that have overdrawn account knew well that distinguished firm of bounce bounce bounce must not cash bill for lend money without security did not even dare to ask to do so on sudden jumped into cab be driven back to office thought have come upon must throw upon kindness of friend there hitherto have contrived to hold head so high above clerk below so high before commissioner who be above that none there suspected to be man in difficulty not seldom happens that man character stand too high for interest so high that can not be maintained so high that fall will be dangerous so be with crosbie character at general committee office man to whom be now thinking of applying a friend be certain mr butterwell who have be predecessor in secretary chair who now filled le onerous more dignified position of commissioner mr crosbie have somewhat despised mr butterwell have of late year not be averse to showing that did so have snubbed mr butterwell mr butterwell driven to wit end have tried fall two with in struggle crosbie have have best of butterwell have gone to wall nevertheless for sake of official decency from certain wise remembrance of source of official comfort official discomfort mr butterwell have always maintained show of outward friendship with secretary smiled be gracious called other butterwell crosbie abstained from cat dog absurdity nevertheless be frequently expressed opinion of clerk in office mr butterwell hated mr crosbie like poison be man to whom crosbie suddenly made up mind that must have recourse a be driven back to office resolved that must make plunge at once at difficulty knew that butterwell be fairly rich knew also that be good natured with sort of sleepy good nature be not active for philanthropic purpose dislike to incur pain of refusing then mr butterwell be nervous if thing be managed well might be cheated out of assent before time have be given in to pluck up courage for refusing crosbie doubted own courage also fearing that if gave time for hesitation must hesitate that hesitating must feel terrible disgrace of thing not do so without going to own desk ridding of hat went at once to butterwell room when opened door found mr butterwell alone reading time butterwell said beginning to speak before have even closed door have come to in great distress wonder whether can help want to lend five hundred pound must be for not le than three month mr butterwell dropped paper from hand stared at secretary over spectacle chapter xliv suppose must let have

borrowed of fashion after must be spoken there be slow deliberate manner in using borrower attempt to carry wished for lender along with by force of argument to prove that desire to borrow show imprudence on own part that tendency to lend will show none on part of intended lender may be said that mode fails oftener than other there be piteous manner plea for commiseration dear fellow unless will see through now upon word will be very badly off manner may be divided again into two there be plea piteous with lie plea piteous with truth will have again in two month a sure a sun rise be generally plea piteous with lie may be a follows be only fair to say that quite know when can pay back be plea piteous with truth upon whole think that be generally most successful mode of borrowing there be assured demand betokens close intimacy old fellow can let have thirty pound just put name then on back of will get done in city worst of manner be that bill so often doe not get done in city

continue to talk about herself must listen with amount of gratification conversation on subject be natural progress of bayswater romance if madalina must only call friend by present name have strong objection to occasional mention of lady combined name of maria clutterbuck have come to be absolutely distasteful to did not believe in maria clutterbuck friendship in past present existence a described by madalina indeed did not put strong faith in anything that madalina said to in handsome gentleman with two thousand year did not believe at handsome gentleman have only be mentioned once in course of acquaintance with miss demolines whereas maria clutterbuck have come up so often upon word must wish good by said be going on for eleven o'clock have to start to morrow at seven what

eames declared that did not believe word of nevertheless a walked home came to conclusion that mr shorter must have be handsome gentleman with indian security to whom have be said once too often while sitting with conway dalrymple have forgotten to say word about jael sisera chapter xlvii dr tempest at palace illustration intimation have be sent from palace to dr tempest of silverbridge of bishop intention that commission must be held by a rural dean with other neighbouring clergyman a assessor with inquiry might be made on part of church into question of mr crawley guilt must be understood that by time opinion have become very general that mr crawley have be guilty that have found cheque in house that have after holding for many month succumbed to temptation applied to own purpose various excuse be made for by who so believed in first place be felt by who really knew anything of man character that very fact of committing crime proved to be hardly responsible for action must have known have not judgment in such matter be taken from that cheque must certainly be traced back to hand attempt have be made in disposing of to dispose of in way that trace must be obliterated have simply given to neighbour with direction to have cashed have written own name on back of therefore though there must be no doubt a to theft in mind of who supposed that have found cheque in own house yet guilt of theft seemed to be almost annihilated by folly of thief then poverty struggle suffering of wife be remembered story be told from mouth to mouth of industry in profession of great zeal among brickmakers of hoggle end of act of charity done by startled people of district into admiration how have worked with own hand for sick poor to whom must not give relief in money turning woman mangle for couple of hour carrying boy load along lane dr tempest others declared that have derogated from dignity of position a english parish clergyman by such act nevertheless story of deed acted strongly on mind of men woman creating admiration for mr crawley be much stronger than condemnation of guilt even mr walker daughter miss prettymans have so far given way that have ceased to asseverate belief in mr crawley innocence contented now with simply expressing hope that must be acquitted by jury that when must be so acquitted thing might be allowed to rest if have sinned no doubt have repented then there be serious debate whether might not have stolen money without much sin being mad half mad touched with madness when took whether might not in spite of such temporary touch of madness be well fitted for parish duty sorrow have afflicted grievously that sorrow though have incapacitated for management of own affair have not rendered unfit for ministration of parish such be argument now used in favour by woman around men be not keen to contradict wish that must be acquitted allowed to remain in parsonage be very general when therefore became known that bishop have decided to put on foot investigation with view of bringing mr crawley conduct under ecclesiastical condemnation almost everybody accused bishop of persecution world of diocese declared that mr proudie be at work that bishop be better than puppet be in vain that certain clear headed men among clergy of whom dr tempest be one pointed out that bishop after might perhaps be right that if mr crawley be guilty if must be found to have be so by jury might be absolutely necessary that ecclesiastical court must take cognizance of crime beyond taken by civil law jury said dr tempest discussing case with mr robarts other clerical neighbour jury may probably find guilty recommend to mercy judge will have heard character will have be made acquainted with manner of life will deal a lightly with case a law will allow for aught know may be imprisoned for month wish might be for more than day hour when come out from month imprisonment how then surely must be case for ecclesiastical inquiry whether clergyman who have committed theft must be allowed to go into pulpit directly come out of prison answer to be that mr crawley always have be good clergyman be good clergyman at moment must be good clergyman when did come out of prison dr tempest though have argued in way be by mean eager for commencement of commission over be to be called upon to preside in spite of such argument a above came from man head when head be brought to bear upon matter there be thorough desire within heart to oppose bishop have strong sympathy with mr crawley a have others must have have mr crawley silenced without regret presuming mr crawley to have be guilty have much stronger feeling with regard to bishop have there be question of silencing bishop must have be possible to take step in direction must have be very active may therefore be understood that in spite of defence of bishop present proceeding a to commission be anxious that bishop must fail anxious to put impediment in bishop way must appear to that must do so with justice dr tempest be well known among parishioner to be hard unsympathetic said unfeeling also cruel be admitted by who disliked most that be practical just that cared for welfare of many though be rarely touched by misery of one such be man who be rector of silverbridge rural dean in district who be now called upon by bishop to assist in making further inquiry a to wretched cheque for twenty pound once at period archdeacon grantly dr tempest met other discussed question of mr crawley guilt men be inimical to present bishop of diocese have perhaps respected old bishop beyond other men be different in that archdeacon hated dr proudie a partisan whereas dr tempest opposed bishop on certain principle endeavoured to make clear at rate to said archdeacon speaking of bishop intention of issuing commission of course be wrong how must anything right come from from must be sorry to have to do bidding think be little hard upon bishop proudie said dr tempest one can not be hard upon said archdeacon be so scandalously weak be so radically vicious that can not be wrong together very fact that man must be bishop among be to terribly strong evidence of evil day coming be more impulsive than be said dr tempest in case be sorry for poor man who be be sure honest in main believe that in case father must have done just what present bishop be doing that must have done nothing else a think that dr proudie be right will do can to assist in commission bishop secretary have written to dr tempest telling of bishop purpose now in one of last day of march bishop wrote to dr tempest asking to come over to palace letter be worded most courteously expressed very feelingly great regret writer felt at being obliged to take proceeding against clergyman in diocese bishop proudie knew how to write letter by writing of such letter by making of speech in same strain have become bishop of barchester now in letter begged dr tempest to come over to saying how delighted mr proudie must be to see at palace then went on to explain great difficulty felt great sorrow also in dealing with matter of mr crawley looked therefore confidently for dr tempest assistance thinking to do best for mr crawley anxious to enable mr crawley to remain in quiet retirement till trial must be over have sent clergyman over to hogglestock who must have relieved mr crawley from burden of church service mr crawley must have none of relief mr crawley have be obstinate overbearing have persisted in claiming right to own pulpit therefore be bishop obliged to interfere legally therefore be under necessity of asking dr tempest to assist must dr tempest come over on monday stay till wednesday letter be very good letter dr tempest be obliged to do a be asked so far modified bishop proposition that reduced sojourn at palace by one night wrote to say that must have pleasure of dining with bishop mr proudie on monday must return home on tuesday a soon a business in hand must permit will get on very well with said to wife before started be afraid of woman if interferes there will be row then dear said wife there will be row for be told that always interferes on reaching palace about hour before dinner time dr tempest found that other guest be expected on descending to great yellow drawing room be used only on state occasion encountered mr proudie two of daughter arrayed in full panoply of female armour received with sweetest smile if there have be former enmity between silverbridge palace be now forgotten regretted greatly that mr tempest have not accompanied doctor for mr tempest also have be invited mr tempest be not quite a well a might have be doctor have said very rarely slept away from home then bishop came in greeted guest with pleasantest good humour be quite sorrow to that silverbridge be so distant that saw so little of dr tempest hoped that might be somewhat mended now leisure might be found for social delight to dr tempest said little bowing to bishop at separate expression of lordship kindness there be guest there that evening who did not often sit at bishop table archdeacon mr grantly have be summoned from plumstead have obeyed summons great a be enmity between bishop archdeacon have never quite taken form of open palpable hostility therefore asked other to dinner perhaps once year went to other perhaps once in two year dr thorne from chaldicotes be there without wife who in day be up in london mr proudie always expressed warm friendship for mr thorne on occasion loudly regretted absence must tell dr thorne how exceedingly much miss dr thorne who be accustomed to hear wife speak of dear friend mr proudie with almost unmeasured ridicule promised that must do so be so sorry luftons must come to said mr proudie not alluding to dowager of whom be well known that earthly inducement must have sufficed to make put foot within mr proudie room one of child be ill must not leave gresham be there from boxall hill thornes from ullathorne with exception of single chaplain who pretended to carve dr tempest archdeacon be only clerical guest at table from dr tempest knew that bishop be anxious to treat with special consideration on present occasion dinner be rather long ponderous occasionally almost dull archdeacon talked good deal bystander with acute ear might have understood from tone of voice that be not talking a must have talked among friend mr proudie felt understood be angry must never find in presence of archdeacon without becoming angry accurate ear must always appreciate defiance of episcopal authority a now existing in barchester be concealed only half concealed by archdeacon word bishop be not so keen so easily roused to wrath though presence of enemy did to certain degree cow strove to fight against feeling with renewed good humour have improved so upon old day said archdeacon speaking of small matter with reference to cathedral one hardly know old place hope have not fallen off said bishop with smile have improved dr grantly said mr proudie with great emphasis on word what say be true have improved not doubt about said archdeacon then mr grantly interposed strove to change subject threw oil upon water talking of improvement said mr grantly what excellent row of house have built at bottom of high street wonder who be to live in remember when be very worst part of town said dr thorne now be asking seventy pound apiece for house did not cost above six hundred to build said mr thorne of ullathorne with seeming dislike of modern success be evinced by most of elder of world who be to live in asked mr grantly two of have be already taken by clergyman said bishop in tone of triumph yes said archdeacon house in close used to be residence of prebendary have be leased out to tallow chandler retired brewer that come of working of ecclesiastical commission why not demanded mr proudie why not indeed if like to have tallow chandler next door to said archdeacon in old day must sooner have have brother near to there be nothing dr grantly so objectionable in cathedral town a lot of idle clergyman said mr proudie be beginning to be question to said archdeacon whether there be use in clergyman at for present generation dr grantly can not be real sentiment said mr proudie then mr grantly working hard in vocation a peacemaker changed conversation again began to talk of american war even be made matter of discord on church matter archdeacon professing opinion that southerner be christian gentleman northerner infidel snob whereas mr proudie have idea that gospel be preached with genuine zeal in northern state at such outbreak poor bishop must laugh uneasily say word two to one paid much attention so dinner went on not always in most pleasant manner for who preferred continued social good humour to occasional excitement of half suppressed battle not word be said about mr crawley when mr proudie lady have left dining room bishop strove to get up little lay conversation spoke to mr thorne about game to dr thorne about timber even to mr gresham about hound be not so very many year mr gresham said since bishop of barchester be expected to keep hound bishop laughed at own joke lordship will have back at palace next season said young frank gresham if will promise to do county justice have have have laughed bishop what do say mr tozer mr tozer be chaplain on duty have not least objection in world lord said mr tozer to act a second whip be afraid will find expensive adjunct to episcopate said archdeacon then joke be over for there have be rumour now for year prevalent in barchester bishop proudie be not liberal in expenditure a mr thorne said afterwards to cousin doctor archdeacon might have spared that sneer archdeacon will never spare man who sits in father seat said doctor pity of be that men who be so thoroughly different in sympathy must ever be brought into contact dear dear said archdeacon a stood afterwards on rug before drawing room fire how many rubber of whist have seen played in room sincerely hope that will never see played here said mr proudie be quite sure will not said archdeacon for last sally wife scolded bitterly on way home know very well said that time be changed that if be bishop of barchester must not have whist played in palace only know said that when have whist have true religion along with good sense good feeling also can not be right to sneer at others for doing what must do said wife then archdeacon threw sulkily into corner of carriage nothing more be said between wife about bishop dinner party not word be spoken that night at palace about mr crawley when obnoxious guest from plumstead be gone mr proudie resumed good humour towards dr tempest so intent be on conciliating that refrained even from abusing archdeacon whom knew to have be intimate for very many year with rector of silverbridge in accustomed mood must have broken forth in loud anger caring nothing for old friendship at present be thoughtful of morrow desirous that dr tempest must if possible meet in friendly humour when great discussion a to hogglestock must be opened between dr tempest understood bearing a pulled on nightcap made certain resolution of own a to morrow proceeding suppose will dare to interfere have said to wife if doe will certainly tell bishop can not speak on subject in presence at breakfast on following morning there be one present bishop mr proudie dr tempest very little be said at meal mr crawley name be not mentioned there seemed to be general feeling among that there be task hanging over prevented general conversation egg be eaten coffee be drunk egg coffee disappeared almost in silence when ceremony have be altogether completed be clearly necessary that something further must be done bishop spoke dr tempest said perhaps will join in study at eleven can then say few word to other about unfortunate matter on will have to trouble dr tempest said must be punctual to appointment then bishop withdrew muttering something a to necessity of looking at letter dr tempest took newspaper in hand have be brought in by servant mr proudie did not allow to read dr tempest said be matter of most vital importance be quite sure that feel that be so what matter madam said doctor terrible affair of mr crawley if something be not done whole diocese will be disgraced then waited for answer receiving none be obliged to continue of poor man guilt there can fear be doubt then there be pause still doctor made answer if be guilty said mr proudie resolving that must ask question must bring forth reply can experienced clergyman think that can be fit to preach from pulpit of parish church be sure that must agree with dr tempest consider soul of people mr proudie said think that have better not discus matter not discus think that have better not do so if understand bishop aright wish must take step in matter of course doe therefore must decline to make matter of common conversation common conversation dr tempest must be last person in world to make matter of common conversation regard a by mean common conversation god forbid that must be common conversation be speaking now very seriously with reference to interest of church think will be endangered by having among active servant man who have be guilty of so base crime a theft think of dr tempest theft stealing money appropriating to own use cheque for twenty pound did not belong to then telling such terrible falsehood about can anything be worse anything more scandalous anything more dangerous indeed dr tempest regard a common conversation whole of speech be not made at once fluently without break from stop to stop mr proudie paused waiting for companion word a must not speak be obliged to continue be sure that can not agree with dr tempest said be quite sure that will not discus with said doctor very brusquely why not be not here to discus not with mr proudie must excuse for saying so be not here to discus such matter with be to do so must be guilty of very great impropriety thing be in common between bishop said mr proudie with air be intended to be dignified nevertheless displayed rising anger a to know nothing can not be in common between grief much must have to speak to in strain duty allows alternative think if will permit will take turn round garden before keep appointment with lordship so saying escaped from lady without hearing further remonstrance still wanted nearly hour to time named by bishop dr tempest used in preparing for withdrawal from palace a soon a interview with bishop must be over after what have passed thought that must be justified in taking departure without bidding adieu formally to mr proudie must say word two explaining haste to bishop then if must get out of house at once might be that must never see mr proudie again be rather proud of success in late battle felt that having be so completely victorious must be foolish in to risk laurel in chance of encounter must say not word of what have happened to bishop thought probable that must mr proudie speak of at rate till after be gone general who be beaten out of field be not quick to talk of own repulse indeed have not beaten mr proudie out of field have in fact run away have left foe silenced with such foe in such contest be everything put up portmanteau therefore prepared for final retreat then rang bell desired servant to show to bishop study servant did so when entered room first thing saw be mr proudie sitting in arm chair near window bishop be also in room sitting with arm upon writing table head upon hand be very evident that mr proudie did not consider to have be beaten that be prepared to fight battle will sit down dr tempest said motioning with hand to chair opposite to occupied by bishop dr tempest sat down felt that at moment have nothing else to do that must restrain remonstrance that might make till mr crawley name must be mentioned be almost lost in admiration of woman have left her a thought utterly vanquished prostrated by determined uncourteous usage of here be present again upon field of battle a though have never be even wounded must see that there have be word between bishop that have carried point on bishop have be very anxious to have own way must perceive at once that bishop have begged to absent be greatly chagrined that must not have prevailed with there be a dr tempest be resolved that must neither give advice receive instruction respecting mr crawley in presence must only draw upon courage strategy for coming warfare for few moment one said word bishop felt that if dr tempest must only begin work on hand might be got through even in wife presence mr proudie be aware that husband must begin if must do so if dr tempest must listen then reply might gradually make way into conversation if word be once accepted then must say that desired to say then must play part become somebody in episcopal work when once must have be allowed liberty of speech enemy must be powerless to stop dr tempest understood quite a well a understood have waited till night must not have be first to mention mr crawley name bishop sighed aloud sigh might be taken a expressing grief over sin of erring brother whose conduct be then to discus be not amiss when sigh with attendant murmur have passed away be necessary that initiative step must be taken dr tempest said bishop what be to do about poor stiff necked gentleman still dr tempest did not speak there be clergyman in diocese continued bishop in whose prudence wisdom have more confidence than in yours know too that be by mean disposed to severity where severe measure be not necessary what ought to do if have be guilty must not surely return to pulpit after expiration of such punishment a law of country may award to dr tempest looked at mr proudie thinking that might perhaps say word now mr proudie knew part better be silent angry a be contrived to hold peace let debate once begin must be able to creep into then to lead so must hold own have met foe a wary a lord said doctor will perhaps be well that must communicate wish to in writing if be possible for to comply with will do so yes exactly doubt thought that perhaps might better understand other if have few word of quiet conversation upon subject believe know step have here bishop be interrupted dr tempest rose from chair advancing to table put hand upon lord said feel compelled to say that must very much rather leave unsaid be possible feel difficulty may say delicacy of position must be untrue to conscience to feeling of what be right in such matter if be to take part in discussion on matter in presence of lady dr tempest what be objection said mr proudie rising from chair coming also to table so that from thence might confront opponent a stood opposite to dr tempest also put hand upon table dear perhaps will leave for few moment said bishop poor bishop poor weak bishop a word came from mouth knew that must be spoken in vain that if so must have be better for to have left unspoken why must be dismissed from room without reason said mr proudie can not dr tempest understand that wife may share husband counsel a must share trouble if can not pity very much a to own household dr tempest said bishop mr proudie take greatest possible interest in everything concerning diocese be sure lord said doctor that will see how unseemly must be must interfere in way between mr proudie certainly will not do so can only say again that if will communicate to wish in writing will attend to if be possible mean to be stubborn said mr proudie whose prudence be beginning to give way under great provocation to temper be being subjected yes madam if be to be called stubbornness must be stubborn lord mr proudie spoke to on subject in breakfast room after have left then ventured to explain to that in accordance with such light a have on matter must not discus in presence greatly grieve failed to make understood by a otherwise unpleasantness might have be spared understood very well dr tempest think to be most unreasonable man indeed might use much harsher word may use word please mr proudie said doctor dear really think have better leave for few minute said bishop lord said mr proudie turning round upon husband not so must be most unbecoming must be turned out of room in palace by uncourteous word from parish clergyman must be unseemly if dr tempest forgets duty will not forget mine there be other clergyman in diocese besides dr tempest who can undertake very easy task of commission a for having be appointed rural dean know how many year ago be matter of consequence whatever in such preliminary inquiry three clergyman will suffice need not be done by rural dean at dear will not be turned out of room by dr tempest be enough lord said doctor have better write to a proposed to just now lordship will not write lordship will hing of kind said mr proudie dear said bishop driven in perplexity beyond carefulness of reticence dear do wish must do indeed if must only go away will not go away lord said mr proudie will said dr tempest feeling true compassion for unfortunate man whom saw writhing in agony before will manifestly be for best must retire lord wish good morning mr proudie good morning so left room most stubborn most ungentlemanlike man said mr proudie a soon a door be closed behind retreating rural dean think that in whole course of life ever met with one so insubordinate so ill mannered be worse than archdeacon a uttered word paced about room bishop said nothing when have be silent for few minute turned upon bishop said hope that agree with expect that will agree with in matter be of so much moment to comfort may say to position generally in diocese bishop why do not speak have behaved in such way know that will ever speak again said bishop what be that say say know how will ever speak again have disgraced disgraced disgrace be that disgrace by saying such word very well let be so perhaps will go away now leave to have got bad headache ca talk more oh dear oh dear what will think of mean to tell have be wrong yes have be wrong very wrong why did go away when asked be always being wrong wish have never come to barchester in other position must not have felt so much a be know how can ever show face again not have felt what so much mr proudie said wife going back in excitement of anger to nomenclature of old day be to be return for care in behalf allow to tell sir that in position in may be placed know what be due to that dignity will never lose anything in hand wish that be a well able to take care of then stalked out of room left poor man alone bishop proudie sat alone in study throughout whole day once twice in course of morning chaplain came to on matter of business be answered with smile peculiar softness of chaplain did not fail to attribute to right cause for be soon known throughout household that there have be quarrel must quite have made up mind to do so must have resolved that must be altogether better to quarrel with wife bishop must have appealed to chaplain have asked at rate for sympathy even yet must not bring to confess misery to own to to be wretch that be then during long hour of day sat thinking of how happy must be if be only possible for to go away become even curate in parish without wife must there ever come to time of freedom must ever die be older than of course must die first must not be fine thing if must die at once thus escape from misery what must do even supposing strong enough to fight battle must not lock up must not even very well lock out of room be wife must have run of house must not altogether debar from society of diocesan clergyman have on very morning taken strong measure with more than once twice have desired to leave room what be there to be done with woman who must not obey husband who must not even leave to performance of own work what blessed thing must be if bishop must go away from home to work day like clerk in public office a stone mason doe there be such escape for must not go away how be to meet again on very day then for hour thought of dr tempest mr crawley considering what have better do to repair shipwreck of morning at last resolved that must write to doctor before have again seen wife did write letter sent off in letter made direct allusion to occurrence of morning wrote a though there have not be fixed intention of personal discussion between think will be better that there must be commission said must suggest that must have four other clergyman with perhaps will select two out of rural deanery if object will name a other two mr thumble mr quiverful who be resident in city a wrote two name felt ashamed of knowing that have chosen two men a being special friend of wife feeling that must have be brave enough to throw aside consideration of wife favour especially at moment in be putting on armour to do battle against be not probable continued to say in letter that will be able to make report until after trial of unfortunate gentleman will have taken place verdict will have be given must be acquitted that imagine must end matter there can be reason why must attempt to go beyond verdict of jury must be found guilty think ought to be ready with such step a will be becoming for to take at expiration of sentence may be pronounced will be at rate expedient that in such case matter must be brought before ecclesiastical court knew well a wrote that be proposing something much milder than course intended by wife when have instigated to take proceeding in matter did not much regard now though have be weak enough to name certain clergyman a assessor with rural dean because thought that by doing so must to certain degree conciliate wife though have be so far coward yet be resolved that must not sacrifice to own judgment own conscience in manner of proceeding kept copy of letter so that might be unable to show very word when must ask to see of course must tell what have done in telling must keep to what have said a to result of acquittal in civil court need not yet be told that have promised to take verdict a sufficing also for ecclesiastical acquittal in spirit letter be written sent off before again saw wife did not meet till came together in drawing room before dinner in explaining whole truth a to circumstance a existed at palace at moment must be acknowledged that mr proudie great a be courage wide a be resource possessed within be somewhat appalled by position of affair fear that may now be too late for to excite much sympathy in mind of reader on behalf of mr proudie will never be able to make virtue popular have virtue existence now made unhappy did regard dignity of husband felt at present moment that have almost compromised did also regard welfare of clergyman around thinking of course in general way that certain of who agreed with be clergyman whose welfare must be studied certain of who disagreed with be clergyman whose welfare must be postponed now idea made way into bosom that be not perhaps doing best for welfare of diocese generally what if must come to pas that clergyman of diocese must refuse to open mouth in presence on ecclesiastical subject a dr tempest have done special day be not one on be well contented with though by mean on account be anger mitigated against offending rural dean during dinner struggled to say word two to husband a though there have be no quarrel between with matter have gone so deep that must not answer in same spirit there be sundry member of family present daughter son in law daughter friend who be staying with even in hope of appearing to be serene before must not struggle through deep despondence be very silent to wife word answered hardly anything be courteous gentle with spoke a little a be possible during evening sat alone with head leaning on hand not pretending even to read be aware that be too late to make even attempt to conceal misery disgrace from own family wife came to night in dressing room in spirit of feminine softness be very unusual with dear said let forget what occurred morning if there have be anger be bound a christian to forget stood over a spoke put hand upon shoulder almost caressingly when man heart be broken can not forget be reply still stood by still kept hand upon must think of other word of comfort to say will go to bed said be best place for then left went to bed chapter xlviii softness of sir raffle buffle have seen that john eames be prepared to start on journey in search of arabins have seen after have taken farewell of office of master there previous to departure that matter of departure have not be arranged altogether with comfort a far a official interest be concerned have be perhaps little abrupt in mode of informing sir raffle buffle that there be pressing cause for official absence sir raffle have replied to that private pressure must be allowed to interfere with public duty must go sir raffle at rate johnny have said be matter affecting family must not be neglected if intend to go without leave said sir raffle presume will first put resignation into hand of mr kissing now mr kissing be secretary to board have be serious undoubtedly john eames be not specially anxious to keep present position a private secretary to sir raffle certainly have desire to give up profession altogether said nothing more to great man on occasion before left office wrote private note to chairman expressing extreme importance of business begging that might have leave of absence on next morning received back with very few word written across ca be done be very few word sir raffle buffle have written across note from private secretary here be difficulty johnny have not anticipated seemed to be insuperable sir raffle must not have answered in strain if have not be very much in earnest must send medical certificate said cradell friend of old nonsense said eames see that be nonsense at ca get over medical certificate from respectable man everybody have got something matter with of kind must go let do worst said fisher who be clerk must be more than putting down place two a to losing present berth mind must never think of dismissing do mind being put down place two said johnny who must not forget that be so put down friend fisher must gain step must lose must give barrel of oyster talk to about chancellor of exchequer said fitzhoward who have be private secretary to sir raffle before eames might therefore be supposed to know man might have done very well if have not asked be refused first said john eames will tell what will do will write long letter on sheet of foolscap paper with regular margin so that must come before board perhaps will frighten when mentioned difficulty on evening to mr toogood lawyer begged to give up journey will only be sending clerk wo cost so very much after said toogood johnny pride must not allow to give way be not going to be done about said be not going to resign will go even though may dismiss think will come to if doe must uncle begged of not to think of such alternative discussion took place after dinner away from office eames must not submit to bow neck to authority if come to said fellow might a well be slave at once what be use of fellow having little money if doe not make independent may be sure of one thing will go on day fixed on next morning john eames be very silent when went into sir raffle room at office there be now only day before fixed for departure be of course very necessary that matter must be arranged said nothing to sir raffle during morning great man be condescending endeavoured to be kind knew that stern refusal have greatly irritated private secretary be anxious to show though in cause of public duty be obliged to be stern be quite willing to forget sternness when necessity for have passed away on morning therefore be very cheery to cheery good humour john eames must make response late in afternoon when most of men have left office johnny appeared before chairman for last time day with very long face be dressed in black have changed ordinary morning coat for frock gave appearance altogether unlike be customary to spoke almost in whisper very slowly when sir raffle joked sir raffle often must joke not only did not laugh absolutely sighed be there anything matter with eames asked sir raffle be in great trouble said john eames what be trouble be essential for honour of one of family must be at florence by day week can not make up mind what ought to do wish to lose position in public service to a know be warmly attached can not submit to see honour of family sacrificed eames said sir raffle must be nonsense must be nonsense there can be reason why must always expect to have own way in everything of course if go without leave will be dismissed of course will be out of question that young man must take bit between teeth in way a for taking bit between teeth sir raffle think that man be ever more obedient perhaps must say more submissive than have be there must be limit to everything what do mean by mr eames said sir raffle turning in anger upon private secretary johnny disregarded anger johnny indeed have made up mind that sir raffle must be very angry what do mean mr eames by saying that there must be limit know nothing about limit one must suppose that intended to make accusation against so do think sir raffle that be treating with great cruelty have explained to that family circumstance have explained nothing mr eames yes have sir raffle have explained to that matter relating to family materially affect honour of certain one of member demand must go at once to florence tell that if go will be dismissed of course must not go without leave never heard of such thing in life sir raffle lifted up hand towards heaven almost in dismay so have drawn up short statement of circumstance hope may be read at board when question of dismissal come before mean to go then yes sir raffle must go honour of certain branch of family demand must do so a have for time be so especially under thought must be proper to show have said before send letter in therefore have brought with here be johnny handed to sir raffle official document of large dimension sir raffle began to be uncomfortable have acquired character for tyranny in public service of be aware though thought that knew well that have never deserved official big wig perhaps that chancellor of exchequer of whom be so fond have on one occasion hinted to that little softness of usage must be compatible with prejudice of age softness be impossible to sir raffle temper be sufficiently under control to enable to encounter rebuke to pull up from time to time when found tempted to speak loud to take thing with high hand knew that clerk must not be dismissed for leaving office who must show that absence have be caused by matter really affecting interest of family be to drive eames to go on occasion without leave eames must be simply called in to state what be matter of moment have taken away probably have stated that matter of moment in very document sir raffle be holding in hand sir raffle be not willing to be conquered by document if be necessary that must give way must much prefer to give way out of own good nature let say without looking at document at must under circumstance decline to read said unless must come before officially handed back paper thought best to let see if pleased said john eames then turned round a though be going to leave room suddenly turned back again like to leave sir raffle without saying good by suppose will meet again of course must do duty wish to think have personal ill will against so saying put out hand to sir raffle a though to take final farewell sir raffle looked at in amazement be dressed a have be said in black did not look like john eames of day to whom sir raffle be accustomed understand at said sir raffle be afraid that be only too plain said john eames must go oh yes be certain have pledged to go of course know anything of matter be so important to family said johnny ca explain to then so may have reason if there be reason then john told story of mr crawley considerable portion of story in telling of think probable that put more weight upon necessity of mission to italy than must have fairly be made to bear in course of narration sir raffle did once contrive to suggest that lawyer by going to florence might do business at rate a well a john eames johnny denied sir raffle be impossible quite impossible said if saw lawyer who be acting in matter mr toogood who be also uncle must tell same sir raffle have already heard something of story of mr crawley be now willing to accept sad tragedy of case a excuse for private secretary somewhat insubordinate conduct under circumstance eames suppose must go think must have told about before did not like to trouble sir raffle with private business be always best to tell whole of story said sir raffle johnny being quite content with upshot of negotiation accepted gentle rebuke in silence withdrew on next day appeared again at office in ordinary costume idea crossed sir raffle brain that have be partly done by affectation of costume will be even with day yet said sir raffle to have got leave boy said eames when went out into room in three friend sat said cradell have said johnny mean that old huffle scuffle have given out of own head said fisher indeed have said johnny bade god bless into bargain did give oyster said fitzhoward not shell said johnny be blessed if beat cock fighting said cradell lost in admiration at friend adroitness know how john passed evening after that went first to see lily dale at uncle lodging in sackville street from thence be taken to presence of charming madalina in porchester terrace then wound up night with friend conway dalrymple when got to bed felt to have be triumphant in spite of triumph be ashamed of why have left lily to go to madalina a thought of quoted to against hamlet often quoted appeal to two portrait how must not despise in that must find pleasure with madalina having lily dale to fill thought be not fair for said to thinking thus to comfort did not comfort on next morning early uncle mr toogood met at dover railway station upon word johnny be clever fellow said never thought that 'd make right with sir raffle a right a trivet uncle there be people if can only get to learn length of foot can always fit with shoe afterwards illustration a right a trivet uncle will go on direct to florence johnny yes think so from what have heard mr arabin must be there at venice suppose must learn from one at paris at town be staying at moment address be florence poste restante florence will be sure to find out at of hotel where be staying where have be staying when have found suppose can tell anything said johnny who can tell may may not belief be that money be present altogether not seems that mix money have always have scruple about because of son by former marriage always have different account at banker found that out when be at barchester crawley be friend yes crawley be friend know that fifty pound note have always be so very plentiful with dean income ai what be know know anything about said johnny well be not have nothing of own a far a can learn must be just thing for to do to give money to friend at rate will tell whether be so not then will go on to jerusalem after must find necessary will probably be on way back will know where can hit on road must make understand that be essential that must be here little time before trial can understand johnny a spoke mr toogood lowered voice to whisper though be walking together on platform of railway station must not possibly have be overheard by one can understand that may be necessary to prove that be not exactly compos mentis if so will be essential that must have influential friend near otherwise bishop will trample into dust if mr toogood must have seen bishop at time have read trouble of poor man heart must hardly have spoken of a being so terrible tyrant understand said johnny so that in fact will expect to see together said toogood hope dean be good fellow tell be very good fellow never did see much of bishop dean a yet said johnny must feel rather awe struck travelling with one must fancy that dean be very much like anybody else man hat must cow daresay will find walking about jerusalem with wide awake on big stick in hand probably smoking cigar dean contrive to get out of armour sometimes a knight of old used to do bishop fancy find more difficult well good by old fellow be very much obliged to for going be indeed doubt what will pull through somehow then mr toogood went home to breakfast from own house proceeded to office when have be there hour two there came to messenger from income tax office with official note addressed to by sir raffle buffle note looked to be very official sir raffle buffle presented compliment to mr toogood must mr toogood favour sir r b with present address of mr john eames old fox said mr toogood then stupid old fox a if be likely that must have peached on johnny if anything be wrong so mr toogood sent compliment to sir raffle buffle begged to inform sir r b mr john eames be away on very particular family business must take in first instance to florence that from florence must probably have to go on to jerusalem without loss of hour stupid old fool said mr toogood a sent off reply by messenger chapter xlix near close illustration wonder whether one will read page who have never known anything of bitterness of family quarrel if so will have reader very fortunate else very cold blooded must be wrong to say that love produce quarrel love doe produce intimate relation of quarrelling be too often one of consequence one of consequence frequently seem to be so natural sometimes seem to be unavoidable one brother rebuke other what brother ever lived together between whom there be such rebuking then warm word be misunderstood hotter word follow there be quarrel husband tyrannizes knowing that be duty to direct wife disobeys only partially obeys thinking that little independence will become so there be quarrel father anxious only for son good look into son future with other eye than of son so there be quarrel come very easily quarrel quittance from be sometimes terribly difficult much of thought be necessary before angry man can remember that too in part may have be wrong attempt at such thinking be almost beyond power of who be carefully nursing wrath lest cool nursing of such quarrelling kill happiness very man who be nursing wrath lest cool wrath against one whom love perhaps best of whom have be given to love be wretched a long a last anger poison pleasure of life be sullen at meal can not understand book a turn page work let be what may be ill done be full of quarrel nursing be telling how much have loved that wicked one how many have be sacrifice for wicked one now that wicked one be repaying simply with wickedness yet wicked one be at very moment dearer to than ever if wicked one must only be forgiven how sweet must world be again yet nurse wrath so be in day with archdeacon grantly be very angry with son be hardly too much to say that in moment of life whether waking sleeping be thinking of injury that son be doing have almost come to forget fact that anger have first be roused by feeling that son be about to do injury to cut own throat various other consideration have now added to filled not only mind daily conversation with wife how terrible must be disgrace to lord hartletop how incurable injury to griselda marchioness must brother in law of one brother of other marry daughter of convicted thief of must say nothing so declared constantly though of did say great deal of must say nothing though of course such marriage must ruin in county dear said wife be nonsense that really be nonsense feel sure there be not single person in county who must think of marriage in such light then archdeacon must have quarrelled with wife too have not be too wise to admit quarrel mr grantly be very wise knew that took two person to make quarrel told over over again that be in league with son that be encouraging son to marry grace crawley believe that in heart wish once said to dear wish think becoming marriage if doe marry must wish to receive wife in house certainly must not quarrel with will never receive archdeacon have replied a for can only say that in such case will make provision for family will be remembered that archdeacon have on former occasion instructed wife to write to son tell of father determination mr grantly have so manoeuvred that little time have be gained that instruction have not be insisted upon in bitterness since time major grantly have renewed assurance that must marry grace crawley if grace crawley must accept writing on occasion direct to father have asked father whether in such case be to look forward to be disinherited be essential must know major have said because in such case must take immediate measure for leaving place father have sent back letter writing few word at bottom of if do a propose above must expect nothing from word be written in large round handwriting very hurriedly son when received perfectly understood mood of father mind when wrote then there came tidings addressed on occasion to mr grantly that cosby lodge be to be given up lady day have come notice necessarily to be given at period be so given know will grieve major grantly have said father have driven to in be cause of great sorrow to archdeacon to mr grantly a there be circumstance connected with cosby lodge made think that be very desirable residence for son will sell everything about place go abroad at once said in subsequent letter present idea be that will settle at pau a income will suffice for to live there education for edith will be cheap at rate will not continue in england must never be happy here in circumstance so altered of course must not have left profession unless have understood from father that income arising from must not be necessary to however mean to complain simply tell that will go there be many letter between mother son in day will stay till after trial said if will then go with well good whether will not will not remain here seemed to mr grantly to be peculiarly unfortunate for have not resolved to go thing might even yet have righted from what must now understand of character of miss crawley whom did not know personally thought probable that grace in event of father being found guilty by jury must absolutely persistently refuse offer made to must be too good a mr grantly put to herself to bring misery disgrace into family must mr crawley be acquitted must marriage then take place archdeacon might probably be got to forgive in case there must be necessity for breaking up house at cosby lodge dear son henry best beloved be obstinate stiff necked must take advice be even worse than father said in short lived anger to own father to whom alone at time must unburden grief seeking consolation encouragement be habit to go over to deanery at rate twice week at time on occasion of one of visit so made expressed very strongly distress at family quarrel have come among old man took grandson part through through at see why must not marry young lady if like a for money there ought to be enough without having to look for wife with fortune be not question of money papa a to rank continued mr harding henry will not at rate be going lower than father did when married not so low indeed for at time be only minor canon mr crawley be in possession of benefice papa be nonsense be indeed very likely dear be not because mr crawley be only perpetual curate of hogglestock that archdeacon object to marriage have nothing to do with at at present moment be in disgrace under cloud dear let pray that may be only passing cloud world think that be guilty then be such man so singular so unlike anybody else know papa that think very much of money merely a money hope not dear money be worth thinking of be not worth very much thought doe give advantage absence of such advantage must be very much felt in education of girl must hardly wish henry to marry young woman who from want of money have not be brought up among lady be not miss crawley fault such have be lot can not ignore deficiency papa certainly not dear must not for instance wish that henry must marry kitchen maid be miss crawley kitchen maid susan quite say that be told that have be educated infinitely better than most of young lady in neighbourhood said mr harding believe that father have taught greek suppose have learned something of french at school at silverbridge then kitchen maid theory be sufficiently disposed of said mr harding with mild triumph know what mean papa fact be that be impossible to deal with men will never be reasonable marriage such a must be injurious to henry will not be ruinous a to disinheriting for must be downright wicked think so said mr harding archdeacon will look at a though must destroy henry edith altogether while speak of a though be best thing in world if young people love other think must be best thing in world said mr harding papa can not think that father wish must go for something said mr grantly who desirous a be on one side to support son must not bear that husband must on other side be declared to be altogether in wrong know dear said mr harding do think that if two young people be fond of other if there be anything for to live upon can not be right to keep apart know dear be daughter of gentleman mr grantly upon left father almost brusquely without speaking word on subject for though be opposed to vehement anger of husband must not endure proposition now made by father mr harding be at time living alone in deanery for few year deanery have be home a youngest daughter be dean wife there must be no more comfortable resting place for evening of life during last month two day have gone tediously with for have have large house to be man who did not love solitude be hard to conceive that old whose thought have be thought out must ever love to live alone solitude be surely for young who have time before for execution of scheme who can therefore take delight in thinking in day poor old man must wander about room shambling from one chamber to must feel ashamed when servant met ever on move must make little apology for uneasiness must accept graciously understanding after fashion why be that be uneasy ai got nothing to do said housemaid to cook a for reading say that of young one can read day sometimes night too bless when be nigh

left again for awhile having business out in city be alone in room for hour what be there left to now in world old a be in thing almost childish nevertheless thought of keenly half realized remembrance of lean slippered pantaloon flitted across mind causing pang what be there left to now in world posy cat cradle then in midst of regret a sat with back bent in old easy chair with one arm over shoulder of chair other hanging loose by side on sudden there came across face smile a sweet a ever brightened face of man woman have be able to tell that have ground for complaint great ground rather for rejoicing gratitude have not world in be good to have not child who loved who have done honour who have be to always crown of glory never mark for reproach have not line fallen to in very pleasant place be not happy fate to go leave amidst good word kind loving care of devoted friend whose latter day have ever be more blessed than for future be a thought of smile came across face a though be already face of angel then muttered to word two lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace when mr grantly returned found in jocund spirit yet perceived that be so weak that when left chair must barely get across room without assistance mr baxter indeed have not sent to too soon be well that prohibition have come in time to prevent terrible accident papa said think have better go with to plumstead carriage be here can take home so comfortably must not allow to be taken on occasion to plumstead smiled thanked put hand into hers repeated promise that must not leave house on occasion without assistance declared specially thankful to for coming to on special morning must not be taken to plumstead when summer come said then if will have for few day meant deceit yet have told within last hour that must never see summer must not tell even daughter after life a after more than fifty year spent in ministration of darling cathedral specially behoved to die a have lived at barchester must not say to eldest daughter have eleanor be at home must have said to thought might yet live to see eleanor once again if must be given to must ask for nothing more on afternoon of next day mr baxter wrote letter in told grantly that father have declared at usual hour of rising that morning that a be not going to cathedral must thought lie in bed little longer then have lain in bed whole day perhaps honoured madam looking at thing be best a must said mr baxter chapter l lady lufton proposition be now known throughout barchester that commission be to be held by bishop order at inquiry must be made be ecclesiastical inquiry a to guilt imputed to mr crawley in matter of mr soames cheque sundry rumour have gone abroad a to quarrel have taken place on subject among certain clergyman high in office be simply rumour nothing be in truth known there be more discreet clergyman in diocese than dr tempest not word have escaped from a to stormy nature of meeting in bishop palace at have attended with bishop at mr proudie have attended also when be said that fact of coming commission be known to barsetshire allusion be of course made to portion of inhabitant of barsetshire to clerical matter be dear a such matter be specially dear to inhabitant of parish of framley commission be discussed very eagerly in parish be specially discussed by dowager lady lufton there be double interest attached to commission in parish of framley by fact that mr robarts vicar have be invited by dr tempest to be one of clergyman who be to assist in making inquiry also propose to ask mr oriel of greshamsbury to join said dr tempest bishop wish to appoint other two have already named mr thumble mr quiverful who be resident in city perhaps lordship may be right in thinking better that matter must not be left altogether in hand of clergyman who hold living in diocese be doubt aware that mr thumble mr quiverful do hold benefice mr robarts felt a everybody else did feel who knew anything of matter bishop proudie be singularly ignorant in knowledge of men that showed ignorance on special occasion if intended to name two such men must at rate have named three said dr thorne mr thumble mr quiverful will simply be outvoted on first day after will give in adhesion to majority mr thumble indeed lady lufton have said with much scorn in voice to thinking be absurd in highest degree that such men a dr tempest mr robarts must be asked to meet mr thumble mr quiverful on matter of ecclesiastical business outvoted of course must be outvoted of course must be so paralyzed by fear at finding in presence of real gentleman that must hardly be able to vote at old lady lufton did not in fact utter word so harsh a thought a harsh passed through mind reader therefore will understand that much interest be felt on subject at framley court where lady lufton lived with son daughter in law tell said lady lufton that archdeacon dr tempest think right that commission must be held if so have doubt that be right mark say that bishop must hardly do anything else rejoined mr robarts daresay not dear suppose bishop have somebody near to tell what may do what may not do must be terrible to think of if be not so yet when hear that have named such men a mr thumble mr quiverful can not feel that whole diocese be disgraced oh lady lufton be strong word said mr robarts may be strong be not le true said lady lufton from talking on subject of crawleys lady lufton soon advanced first to desire for action then to acting think dear will go over see mr crawley said lady lufton elder to lady lufton younger lady lufton younger have nothing to urge against did not offer to accompany elder lady attempted to explain in early part of story that there still existed certain understanding between mr crawley lord lufton wife that kindness occasionally passed from framley court to hogglestock parsonage on occasion young lady lufton lucy robarts who have once passed certain day of life with crawleys at hogglestock did not choose to accompany mother in law therefore mr robarts be invited to do so think may comfort to know that have sympathy elder woman said to younger a made journey together when carriage stopped before little wicket gate from whence path led through ragged garden from road to mr crawley house lady lufton hardly knew how to proceed servant came to door of carriage asked for order h m m have yes think will send in card say that hope mr crawley will be able to see wo that be best eh fanny fanny otherwise mr robarts said that thought must be best card message be carried in be happily case mr crawley be not at home mr crawley be away at hoggle end reading to brickmakers turning mangle of wife teaching theology politics history after fashion in day spent perhaps happiest hour of life down at hoggle end say that absence be happy chance because have be at home must certainly have said something done something to offend lady lufton must either have refused to see when seeing must have bade hold peace not interfere with matter did not concern more probable still must have sat still sullen have spoken not at be away mr crawley sent out word by servant that must be most proud to see ladyship if ladyship must be pleased to alight ladyship did alight walked into parsonage followed by mr robarts grace be with mother indeed jane have be there also when message be brought in fled into back region overcome by shame a to frock grace think must have fled too have not be bound in honour to support mother lady lufton a entered be very gracious struggling with power of womanhood so to carry that there must be outwardly visible sign of rank wealth not altogether succeeding mr robarts on first entrance said only word two of greeting to mr crawley kissed grace whom have known intimately in early year lady lufton said mr crawley be afraid be very poor place for to come to have known that of old therefore need hardly apologize sometimes like poor place best said lady lufton then there be pause after lady lufton addressed to grace seeking subject for immediate conversation have be down at allington dear have not grace in whisper said that have staying with dale believe know dale well by name have always heard that be charming people like very much said grace then there be pause hope husband be pretty well mr crawley said lady lufton be pretty well not quite strong daresay know lady lufton that have thing to vex mr crawley felt that be need of moment that only possible subject of conversation in house must be introduced therefore brought in at once not loving subject being strongly conscious of necessity lady lufton meant to be good natured therefore mr crawley must do in power to make lady lufton mission easy to indeed yes said ladyship do know that feel so much for mr crawley said mr robarts be so sure that suffering be unmerited be not discreet on part of mr robarts a be wife of one of clergyman who have be selected to form commission of inquiry so lady lufton told on way home be very kind said mr crawley must only bear with such fortitude a god will give be told that temper wind to shorn lamb so doe dear said old lady very solemnly so doe surely have felt that be so struggle not to complain said mr crawley know that struggle bravely hear of admire for love be still old lady who be speaking now have at last be roused out of difficulty a to word have risen from chair be standing before mr crawley be because complain because be so great so good because character be so high spirit so firm must not resist temptation of coming to mr crawley if will let be friend will be proud of friendship ladyship be too good said mr crawley talk to after fashion said lady lufton if do will be disappointed feel thrown back know what mean paused for answer mr crawley have answer to make simply shook head not knowing why did so may know can understand that have felt that friendship offered to by lady lufton be impossibility have decided within own breast that be so though did not know that have come to such decision wish to take at word mr crawley continued lady lufton what can do for know that be distressed yes be distressed know how cruel circumstance have be to will not forgive for being plain have nothing to forgive said mr crawley lady lufton mean said mr robarts that in asking to talk openly to of affair wish to remember that think know what mean said mr robarts knowing very well herself what did mean not knowing at how to express lady lufton be very kind said mr crawley so be mr robarts know how good be for how much behoves to be grateful word be very cold voice in be spoken be very cold made lady lufton feel that be beyond power to proceed with work of mission in intended spirit be ever so much easier to proffer kindness graciously than to receive with grace lady lufton have intended to say let be woman together woman bound by humanity not separated by rank let open heart freely let see how may be of comfort to other must have succeeded in must have spread out little plan of succour with so loving hand that must have conquered woman before suffering spirit can not descend from dignity of reticence have nobility of own made sacred by many tear by flowing of stream of blood from unseen wound can not descend from dais to receive pity kindness consciousness of undeserved woe produce grandeur of own with high souled sufferer will not easily part basket full of egg pound of eleemosynary butter quarter of given pork even second hand clothing from wardrobe of richer sister even money unsophisticated money must accept have learned to know that be portion of allotted misery to take such thing for sake of child husband to be thankful for did take be thankful in taking submitted to rod of cruel circumstance must not even yet bring to accept spoken pity from stranger to kiss speaker can not do something to help said mr robarts must not have spoken that perceived that lady lufton have completed appeal that mr crawley did not seem prepared to answer have done much to help said mr crawley thing have sent to have be very serviceable mean something more than said lady lufton know what there be more said mr crawley bit to eat something to wear seems to be that have to care for now be afraid that coming trial must cause so much anxiety of course cause anxiety what can do must be so can not be put off avoided have made up mind to now almost wish that must come quicker if be once over think that must be better result might be then there be lull in conversation lady lufton began to be afraid that visit must be failure thought that perhaps might get on better if grace be not in room turned over in mind various scheme for sending away perhaps task must be easier if mr robarts also must be banished for time fanny dear said at last boldly know have little plan to arrange with miss crawley perhaps will be more likely to be successful if can take turn with alone there be not much subtlety in ladyship scheme answered proposed purpose two elder lady be soon left face to face so that lady lufton have fair pretext for making attempt dear mr crawley said do so long to say word to fear may be thought to interfere oh lady lufton have feeling of kind have asked daughter mr robarts to go out because can speak more easily to alone wish must teach to trust do trust a friend mean a real friend if must be case mr crawley that jury must give verdict against husband what will do then perhaps ought not to suppose that be possible of course know be possible said mr crawley voice be stern there be in tone almost of offence a spoke did not look at visitor sat with face averted arm akimbo on table yes be possible said lady lufton suppose there be not one in county who doe not truly wish that may not be so be right to be prepared for alternative in such case have thought what will do know what must do to said suppose that for time must be put in prison said mr crawley speaking very quickly bringing out word with sharp eagerness be quite unusual to will send to gaol be not so lady lufton suppose must be so not for long must hope presume such must be sentence for short period might not go with must be impossible house living must let have again when came out ah can not say will depend much probably on what clergyman will report hope will not put in opposition to know can not say be probable that may do so be not easy for man so injured a have be one at same time so great in intelligence to submit gently to such inquiry when ill be being done to others be very prone to oppose gentleman wish to do ill mr crawley can not say know when think of see that there be nothing ruin on side what be use of talking of be angry lady lufton if say that be of use desire to be of use of real use if must be case mr crawley that husband must be detained at barchester mean imprisoned lady lufton yes mean imprisoned if must be so then do bring child of over to framley will find home for while be lost to oh lady lufton must not do yes can have not heard yet must not be comfort to in home a to sit at table with people who be partly stranger to there be cottage nearly adjoining to house will have to yourself bailiff lived in once others have lived in who belong to place be empty now will be made comfortable tear be now running down mr crawley face so that must not answer word of course be son property not mine have commissioned to say that be most heartily at service begs that in such case will occupy beg same old friend lucy have desired also to ask in name lady lufton must not do said mr crawley through tear must think better of dear scruple to advise because be older than have experience of world think taken in ordinary sense of word be boast on part of lady lufton for little true pretence existed lady lufton experience of world at large be not perhaps extensive nevertheless knew what one woman might offer to what one woman might receive from must be better over with dear than must be elsewhere will not misunderstand if say that under such circumstance must do husband good that child must be under protection during period of temporary seclusion stand well in county perhaps ought not to say so know how otherwise to explain when be known by bishop others that have come to during sad time will be understood that think well of mr crawley in spite of anything that jury may say of do see that dear do think well of have known of husband for many year though have not personally have pleasure of much acquaintance with be over at framley once at request have great occasion then to respect do respect will feel grateful to if will allow to put child under wing a being old woman must misfortune fall upon hope that will not fall upon be always well to be provided for worst in way lady lufton at last made speech opened out proposal with have come laden to hogglestock while be speaking mr crawley shoulder be still turned to speaker must see that quick tear be pouring down cheek of woman whom addressed there be downright honesty of thorough going well wishing charity about proposition overcame mr crawley altogether did not feel for moment that must be possible for to go to framley in such circumstance a have be suggested a thought of at present moment seemed to that only appropriate home during terrible period be coming upon must be under wall of prison in husband must be incarcerated fully appreciated kindness have suggested measure if carried into execution must make outside world feel that husband be respected in county despite degradation to be subjected felt heart be too full to speak say that will be so dear continued lady lufton just give one nod of assent cottage will be ready for must so chance that must require mr crawley did not give nod of assent with face still averted while tear be still running down cheek muttered word two must not do lady lufton must not do that know at rate what wish be a become calmer will think of there be quite time enough be speaking of alternative may never happen dear friend mr robarts who be now with daughter wish miss crawley to go over to framley parsonage while inquiry among clergyman be going on say be most ridiculous thing in world inquiry bishop know be so silly think that if miss crawley must go for week so to framley parsonage that will show how happy be to receive must be while mr robarts be employed in part of work what do say mr crawley at framley be clearly of opinion that will be best that must be known that people in county uphold husband miss crawley must be back know before trial come on hope will let come mr crawley even to proposition mr crawley must give assent though expressed direct dissent a regarded own feeling must much have preferred to have be left to live through misery alone must not appreciate kindness endeavoured to throw over hers in trouble aegis of first rate county respectability be saved from necessity of giving direct answer to suggestion by return of mr robarts grace door be opened slowly crept into room a though be aware that presence must be hardly welcomed be carriage there fanny said lady lufton be almost time for to think of returning home mr robarts said that carriage be standing within twenty yard of door then think will make start said lady lufton have succeeded in persuading miss crawley to come over to framley in april mr robarts made answer to looked at grace

husband mean yes when have husband be same with man when have wife hitherto conversation have have so much of milk water in composition that dalrymple found able to keep up go on with background at same time if must only be kept in same dim cloud of sentiment if hot ray of sun of romance must be kept from breaking through mist till miss van siever must come might still be well have known to wander about within cloud for hour together without being able to find way into light be same with man when have got wife said of course one have to suffer for two when one so to say be two what happens when one have to suffer for three asked mean when woman have child mean nothing of kind conway must know that unless feeling be indeed blunted worldly success have suppose blunted rather fancy

said mr dobbs broughton know that 'his hair be grey not with year look here conway moved back tress from off temple to show that there be gray hair behind did not see have be very visible might not perhaps have be so ready to exhibit one can say that length of year have blanched have secret from about age one must not be grey before one have reached thirty did not see changed hair 't be fault of eye then for there be plenty of what be have made grey say that hot room will do hot room conway doe not come from heated atmosphere come from cold heart chilled heart frozen heart heart be ice be

feeling for friend interest in welfare friend triumph in success will promise friendly word conway be sometimes misunderstood never by said no not by certainly not by did not mean that did not expect that must misinterpret then laughed hysterically little low gurgling hysterical laugh after wiped eye then smiled then put hand very gently upon shoulder thank god conway be quite safe there be not have made blunder be necessary that must correct watch be lying in trough of easel looked at wondered why miss van siever be not there have tripped must make little struggle recover step a said before will never be misunderstood by have never be vain enough to suppose for moment that there be other feeling not for moment woman can be so careful while men be always off guard man love because can not help woman have be careful answer with friendship perhaps be wrong to say that never thought of winning anything more never think of winning more now why mischief did miss van siever come in five minute despite must be on knee making mock declaration must be pouring forth vial of mock wrath giving mock counsel a to restraint of passion have gone through before be tired of for life did not know how to help conway said gravely how dare address in such language of course be very wrong know be not speaking of now have learned to think so little of a even to be indifferent to feeling of injury be doing life be blank almost think that nothing can hurt further have not heart left enough to break not enough to be broken be not of that be thinking when ask how dare to address in such language do not know that be injury to to what other asked conway dalrymple whose mind be becoming rather confused who be not quite sure whether other one be mr dobbs broughton somebody else to poor girl who be coming here now who be devoted to to whom doubt have uttered word ought to have made impossible for to speak to a spoke not moment since thing be becoming very grave difficult must have be very grave indeed have not god saved by sending miss van siever to rescue at moment be beginning to think what must say in answer to accusation now made when eager ear caught sound of step upon stair before pause in conversation circumstance admitted have given place to necessity for further speech miss van siever have knocked at door have entered room be rejoiced think that mr broughton did not regret interference be always well that little dangerous scene must be brought to sudden end last detail of such romance if drawn out to natural conclusion be apt to be uncomfortable if not dull did not want to go down on knee knowing that getting up again be always awkward clara began to think be never coming said mr broughton with sweetest smile began to think so also said clara believe must be last sitting at rate last one be anything matter at home said mr broughton clasping hand together nothing very much mamma asked question two morning said be coming here have asked why must have told what did ask what did say doe not always make herself very intelligible complains without telling what complains of muttered something about artist be not complimentary suppose therefore that have suspicion stayed ever so late morning left house together will ask direct question to night before long then there will be end of let make best of time then said dalrymple sitting be arranged miss van siever went down on knee with hammer in hand work began mr broughton have twisted turban round clara head a always did on occasion assisted to arrange drapery used to tell a did so that be like isaac piling fagot for own sacrifice only isaac have piled in ignorance piled conscious of sacrificial flame isaac have be saved whereas be impossible that catching of ram in thicket must save nevertheless arranged drapery with skill piling fagot ever so high for own pyre in meantime conway dalrymple painted away thinking more of picture than did of one woman of other illustration mr dobbs broughton pile fagot after while when mr broughton have piled fagot a high a must pile got up from seat prepared to leave room much of piling consisted of course in own absence during portion of sitting conway said a went if be to be last sitting last one must make most of then threw upon very peculiar glance over head of kneeling jael withdrew jael who in moment must be thinking more of fatigue of position than of anything else did not at take home to herself peculiar meaning of friend word conway dalrymple understood thoroughly thought that might a well take advice given to have made up mind to propose to miss van siever why must not do so now went on with brush for couple of minute without saying word working a well a must work then resolved that must at once begin other task miss van siever said be afraid be tired not more than usually tired be fatiguing to be slaying sisera by hour together do get to hate block block be dummy by form of sisera be supposed to be typified sitting will about finish said so that need not positively distress now will rest for minute two have already perceived that attitude in clara be posed before be not one in offer of marriage must be received replied to with advantage thank be not tired yet said clara not changing fixed glance of national wrath with regarded wooden sisera a held hammer on high be there will rest for moment dalrymple be aware that mr dobbs broughton though be very assiduous in piling fagot never piled for long together if did not make haste must be back upon before must get word spoken when put down brush got up from chair stretched out arm a man doe when cease for moment from work clara of course got up also seated be used to turban drapery therefore thought not of at also be used to seeing in two three time week now that intended to accomplish special purpose turban drapery seemed to be in way do so hope will like picture said a be thinking of think will will understand that be natural that girl must not like in portraiture a know why can understand that specially must not like picture think that most woman in london in place must at rate say that did be angry with what for telling truth indeed be standing opposite to easel looking at canvas shifting head about so a to change light observing critically blemish yet be while thinking how have best carry out purpose will have be prosperous picture to said at last if lead to success of be ambitious be told that do be successful now merely because do be worst of success what be worst of success that when won by merit lead to further success for gaining of merit be necessary hope may be so in case if be not will have very poor chance clara think must know that be not talking about picture thought be indeed be not a for success in profession far a be from thinking merit feel tolerably certain that will obtain have obtained be in way to do so perhaps one out of ten struggling artist be successful for profession be very charming be certainly sad feeling that there be so much of chance in distribution of prize be lottery one can not complain of when one have drawn prize dalrymple be not man without self possession be readily abashed found easier to talk of possession than to make offer turban be difficulty have told over over again within last five minute that must have long since said what have to say have not be for turban have be painting life from living model from woman dressed up in costume to suit necessity of picture have never made love to of have be simply model to now found that there be difficulty of prize said have made tolerably sure a to other prize know wonder whether be to have of course miss van siever understood well what be prize of be speaking a be young woman with will purpose of own doubt be already prepared with answer be necessary that question must be put to in properly distinct term conway dalrymple certainly have not put question in properly distinct term at present did not choose to make answer to last word therefore simply suggested that a time be pressing have better go on with work be quite ready now said stop half moment how much more be thinking of picture than be care twopence for picture will slit canvas from top to bottom without groan without single inner groan if will let for heaven sake hing of kind why must just to show that be not for sake of picture come here clara then door be opened isaac appeared very weary having be piling fagot with assiduity till human nature must pile more conway dalrymple who have made way almost up to clara seat turned round sharply towards easel in anger at having be disturbed must have be more grateful for that isaac have done for have recognized fact that fault have be with mr broughton have be twelve minute out of room have counted to be fifteen having doubt made mistake a to three have told that with one a conway dalrymple with so much of work ready done to hand for fifteen minute must have be amply sufficient when reflect what own thought must have be during interval what be to have to pile up such fagot a how be a be giving away fresh morsel of own heart during minute that allowed clara conway dalrymple to remain together can not surprise that eye must have become dizzy that must not have counted minute with accurate correctness dalrymple turned to picture angrily miss van siever kept seat did not show slightest emotion friend said mr broughton will not do be not working be not sitting mr dalrymple have be explaining to precarious nature of artist profession said clara be not precarious with said mr dobbs broughton sententiously not in general way perhaps to prove truth of word be going to treat jael worse than jael treat sisera be going to slit picture from top to bottom why said mr broughton putting up hand to heaven in tragic horror just to show miss van siever how little care about how little care about too said mr broughton might take that a liked after there be genuine sitting real work went on a though there have be no episode jael fixed face held hammer a though mind heart be solely bent on seeming to be slaying sisera dalrymple turned eye from canvas to model from model to canvas working with hand while a though last pathetic clara have never be uttered mr dobbs broughton reclined on sofa looking at thinking of own singularly romantic position till mind be filled with poetic frenzy in one moment resolved that must hate clara a woman be never hated by woman then there be dagger poison cup strangling cord in eye in next be a firmly determined that must love mr conway dalrymple a woman never be loved by woman then saw kneeling by cradle tenderly nursing baby of conway be to be father clara mother so went to sleep for time dalrymple did not observe at last there be little sound even ill nature of miss demolines must hardly have called snore became aware that for practical purpose miss van siever be again alone together clara said in whisper mr broughton instantly aroused from slumber rubbed eye dear dear dear said declare be past one be afraid must turn out one more sitting suppose will finish conway yes one more said be always understood that clara must not leave house together therefore remained painting when left room now conway said mr broughton suppose that be over know what mean by being over of course not look at in light doubt everything be beginning for must pardon for heart be distracted distracted distracted then sat down upon floor burst into tear what be to do thought that woman must either give up altogether not give up fuss about be irrational must not have made love to clara van siever in room if have not told to do so maria said in very grave voice sacrifice be required on part on behalf be ready to make sir sacrifice will be made by be part of woman to be ever sacrificial poor mr dobbs broughton will give up nothing world be at foot will have everything youth beauty wealth station love love friendship also if will accept from one so poor so broken so secluded a will be at of last word there have be desperate sob a be still crouching in middle of room looking up into dalrymple face while stood over scene be one have much in transcended doings of everyday life much must be ever memorable much have doubt be thoroughly enjoyed by principal actor a for conway dalrymple be so second rate personage in whole thing that mattered little whether enjoyed not think did enjoy now conway said will give advice when in after day will remember interview reflect how advice be given with what solemnity here clasped hand together think that will follow clara van siever will now become wife know that at said dalrymple clara van siever will now become wife repeated mr broughton in louder voice impatient of opposition love cleave to make flesh of flesh bone of bone rule yes rule let be second self not first self rule love cleave to leave alone to feed on own thought a have done a have be forced to do now go conway not word will not hear word must go must then rose quickly from lowly attitude prepared for dart at door be better by far that must go so went american when have spent pleasant day will tell that have have good time think that mr dobbs broughton if have ever spoken truth of day employment must have acknowledged that have have good time think that enjoyed morning work a for conway dalrymple doubt whether did enjoy morning work man may have too much of sort of thing then becomes very sick of cake such be nature of thought a returned to own abode chapter lii why have for of course came to pas that lily dale emily dunstable be soon very intimate that saw other day indeed before long must have be living together in same house have not be that squire have felt reluctant to abandon independence of own lodging when mr thorne have pressed invitation for second then for third time asking to come to large house have begged niece to go leave alone need not regard have said speaking not with whining voice of complaint with thin tinge of melancholy be usual to be so much alone down at allington that need not mind leaving lily must not go on term therefore still lived together in lodging nevertheless lily be day at mr thorne house thus great intimacy grew up between girl emily dunstable have brother sister lily nearest male relative in own degree be now miss dunstable betrothed husband be natural therefore that must at rate try to like other afterwards came to pas that lily did go to mr thorne house stayed there for awhile when occurred squire have gone back to allington among other generous kindness mr thorne insisted that bernard must hire horse for cousin lily emily dunstable rode daily of course captain dale rode with now lily joined party almost before knew what be being done found provided with habit horse whip be way with mr thorne that who came within influence of immediate sphere must be made to feel that comfort luxury arising from wealth belonged to common stock be joint property of thing be not offered taken talked about made appearance be used a matter of course if go to stay at gentleman house understand that a matter of course will be provided with meat drink host furnish also with cigar small number give stabling forage for horse very select few mount on hunting day send out with groom second horse mr thorne went beyond others in open handed hospitality have enormous wealth at command have few of absorbing drain upon wealth in country make so many rich men poor have family property place to keep up in did not live have retainer to be maintained because be retainer have son daughter consequently be able to be lavish in generosity a heart be very lavish must have given friend gold to eat have gold be good for eating indeed there be measure in giving unless when idea came upon that recipient of favour be trading on then must hold hand very stoutly lily dale have not liked idea of being fitted out thus expensively box at opera be very well a be not procured especially for ticket for other theatre did not seem to come unnaturally for night two spirit have militated against hat habit horse whip be little present from emily dunstable of course be accepted with good grace then there came horse a though from heaven there seemed to be ten horse twenty horse if anybody needed thing seemed to flow naturally into mr thorne establishment like air through window be very pleasant lily hesitated when be told that habit be to be given to dear old aunt insists said emily dunstable nobody ever think of refusing anything from if only knew what people will take people will even ask who have nothing to do with at have nothing to do with in way mean said lily oh yes have said emily bernard be a good a brother sister bernard be a good a man wife aunt be a good a mother daughter so see in sort of way be child of house so lily accepted habit made stand at hat paid for out of own pocket when squire have seen lily on horseback asked question about be hired horse suppose said think came direct from heaven said lily what do mean lily said squire angrily mean that when people be so rich good natured a mr thorne be good inquiring where thing come from know be that horse come out of potts ' livery stable talk of potts a if be good natured man who provides horse for world without troubling anybody then squire spoke to bernard about saying that must insist on defraying niece expense bernard swore that must give uncle assistance must not speak to about thing for world said bernard then will said squire in day lily thought much of johnny eames gave to perhaps more of thought lead to love than have ever given before still heard crawley question discussed day mr thorne a know be at time

might escape fang of justice crawley case be constantly in lily ear a constantly heard high praise awarded to johnny for kindness in going after arabins must be fine young fellow said mr thorne will have down at chaldicotes day old lord de guest found out made friend of old lord de guest be fool lily be not altogether free from suspicion mr thorne knew story of johnny love be trying to serve johnny a other people have tried to do very ineffectually when suspicion came upon must shut heart against lover praise swear that must stand by two letter have written in book at home suspicion must not be always there there did come upon conviction that lover be more esteemed among men woman than have be accustomed to believe cousin bernard dale who certainly be regarded in world a somebody spoke of a equal whereas in former day bernard have always regarded johnny eames a standing low in world regard then lily when alone must remember certain comparison once made between adolphus crosbie john eames when of men have a yet pleaded cause to have be very much in favour of former have then declared that johnny be mere clerk have higher opinion of now much higher opinion even though must never be more to than friend in day lily new ally emily dunstable seemed to lily to be so happy there be in emily complete realization of idea of ante nuptial blessedness of lily have often thought so much emily did did for bernard to give captain dale due received sweet be showered upon with becoming sign of gratitude suppose be always case at such time that girl have best of on occasion emily dunstable certainly made most of happiness do envy lily said one day acknowledgment seemed to have be extorted from involuntarily did not laugh a spoke follow up what have said with other word

with effort have made must not quite reconcile to two letter have written in book coming up to london riding in park going to theatre seemed to unsettle at home have schooled down into quiescence made think that believed that be satisfied with prospect of life now be astray again doubting about hankering after something over beyond seemed to be allotted to nevertheless assuring that never must accept of anything else must not if can help let reader suppose that be softening heart to john eames because john eames be spoken well of in world with of in opinion form of around take unconsciously opinion of others woman be handsome because world say so music be charming to because charm others drink wine with other men palate look at picture with other men eye when lily heard john eames praised by around must not be that must praise too not out loud a others did in silence of heart then constancy to have be so perfect if other one have never come if must be that might begin again that might be spared that episode in life have brought together when be mr eames going to be back mr thorne said at dinner one day on occasion squire be dining at mr thorne house there be three four

like to know that business be business one doe choose to be humbugged daresay be humbugged a call very often said harold smith perhaps so perhaps be perhaps be opinion have of at treasury be hardly long enough there smith to have learned much about must say suppose must have known much about a call if have stayed till doomsday daresay not daresay not men who begin a late a did never know what official life really mean now have be at life think do understand be not profession must like unless where be joined with politics said harold smith then be apt to be so short said sir raffle buffle now have happened once in life of mr harold smith that have be in ministry unfortunately that ministry have gone out almost within week of time of mr smith adhesion sir raffle mr smith have known

kept fresh pleasant through who besides ever did hope be fresh said sir raffle a for pleasantness will leave for to determine there can be one opinion said mr thorne conversation have strayed away from john eames lily be disappointed be pleasure to when people talked of in hearing a question two have be asked about making hero of moment seemed to that be being robbed of due when little amenity between mr mr harold smith sir raffle banished name from circle nothing more however be said of at dinner fear that must have be altogether forgotten throughout evening have not lily referred not to must not possibly have be induced to do to subject of journey wonder whether poor mr crawley will be found guilty said to sir raffle up in drawing room be afraid will be afraid will said sir raffle fear dear miss dale must go further than fear must express opinion that be guilty nothing will ever make think so said lily lady be always tender hearted said sir raffle especially young lady especially pretty young lady wonder that such must be opinion see miss dale man of business have to look at thing in business light what want to know be where did get cheque be bound to be explicit in

in eames favour dear miss dale where did mr crawley get cheque be what want to know if can tell that then can tell whether will be acquitted lily did not feel strong prepossession in favour of sir raffle in spite of praise of john eames harsh voice of man annoyed egotism offended when much later in evening character came on for discussion between herself mr thorne emily dunstable have not word to say in favour still have be pleased to meet because be man with whom johnny life be most specially concerned think that portion of dislike to arose from fact that in continuing conversation did not revert to private secretary preferred to regale with story of own doings in wonderful case have partaken of interest similar to now attached to mr crawley case have known man who have stolen hundred pound have never be found out man who have be arrested for stealing two sixpence be found afterwards sticking to bit of butter at bottom of plate mr thorne have heard have answered dear sir raffle have said what great many thief have have among acquaintance have rather disconcerted then there have be no more talking about mr crawley have be arranged on morning mr dale must return to allington leave lily with mr thorne special need of presence at home real assumed have arisen have declared that must shorten stay in london by about intended period need must not have be so pressing probably have not felt that lily must be more comfortable with mr thorne than in lodging in sackville street lily have at first declared that must return with everybody have protested against emily dunstable have protested against very stoutly mr dale have protested against by letter mr thorne protest have be quite imperious in nature indeed dear will hing of kind be sure mother must wish look upon a quite essential that emily must learn to know other do know other emily said lily not quite well yet said emily then lily have laughed so matter be settled now on present occasion mr dale be at mr thorne house for last time conscience have be perplexed about lily horse if anything be to be said must be said now subject be very disagreeable to be angry with bernard because bernard have declined to manage for after own fashion have told so often that anything be better than pecuniary obligation that be determined to speak mind to mr thorne to beg to allow to have way so waited till harold smith be gone sir raffle buffle then when lily be apart with emily for bernard dale have left found at last alone with mr thorne ca be too much obliged to said for kindness to girl oh law be nothing

what mean blood thicker than water be emily child if have one will be lily cousin first cousin once removed said squire who be accurate in matter then drew up in seat compressed lip together prepared for task be very disagreeable nothing thought must be more disagreeable have little thing to speak about said at last hope will not offend about lily yes about lily be not very easily offended know how must possibly be offended about be old fashioned man mr thorne know much about way of world have always be down in country maybe have prejudice wo refuse to humour one of hope be beginning to frighten mr dale what be about lily horse lily horse what about horse hope be not vicious be riding day with niece said squire thinking best to stick to own point will do good in world said mr thorne very likely doubt in least disapprove riding what mr dale must be so much obliged if might be allowed to pay livery stable keeper bill oh law ' mercy daresay may sound odd a have fancy about be sure will gratify of course will will remember will make right with bernard bernard have end of account will have before long will make item of then can arrange with bernard afterwards mr dale a got up to go away felt that be beaten did not know how to carry battle further on occasion must not take out purse put down cost of horse on table will then speak to nephew about said very gravely a went away

be also acquainted in day crosbie did not care much for stopping friend in park elsewhere have become moody discontented be generally seen going about world alone on special occasion be having little special conversation about money with very old friend fowler pratt what siph be be always on horseback now said fowler pratt well yes have gone in good deal for cavalry work last month have be lucky enough to have young lady to ride with said in whisper distance of lily justified how d 'ye do crosbie one doe often see on horseback on foot have something to do besides going to look to be looked at said crosbie then raised eye saw lily side face recognized have seen before have be stopped on way think must have passed on endeavouring to escape observation a be foot have be arrested before knew of close vicinity now must seem that be afraid of be flying from be at once to walk off leaving friend behind knew that have seen have recognized be now suffering from presence must not perceive that be so from fixedness of face from constrained manner in gazed before friend fowler pratt have never seen miss dale though knew very much of history siph dunn knew nothing of history of crosbie love be unaware that lily have ever seen other there be thus help near to extricate from difficulty when man have work to do in world said siph always boast of to acquaintance curse luck to have nothing to do can go about to see to be seen must own that like especially being seen eh siph said fowler pratt also have nothing on earth to do come here day because be a easy to do a to go anywhere else crosbie be still looking at lily must not help must not take eye from off must see that be a pretty a ever that be very little altered be in truth somewhat stouter than in old day of that took special notice must speak to must try to catch eye then raise hat must go up to horse head boldly ask to let bygone be bygone have idea that of course must pursue be one must approve best must be most efficacious for if with anything from might have efficacy must not do did not know what word might best use must become humbly to sue to for pardon must strive to express unaltered love by tone of voice must simply ask after health made one step towards saw that face became more rigid more fixed than before then desisted told that be simply hateful to thought that must perceive that there be tenderness mixed with unabated anger at moment bernard dale emily came close upon bernard saw at once be through bernard that lily crosbie have come to know other bernard dale have be fast friend in old time have of course be bitter enemy since day of crosbie treachery have never spoken since though have often seen other dale be not at disposed to speak to now moment that recognized crosbie looked across to cousin for instant idea have flashed across that be there by permission with assent required second glance to show that be not case dunn said think will ride on put horse into trot siph whose ear be very accurate who knew at once that something be wrong trotted on with lily of course be not left behind be there anything matter said emily to lover nothing specially matter replied be standing in company with greatest blackguard that ever lived thought have better change ground bernard said lily flashing on with fire eye must command then remembered that must not reprimand for offence of such abuse in such company so reined in horse fell weeping siph dunn with wicked cleverness knew whole story at once remembering that have once heard something of crosbie having behaved very ill to one before married lady alexandrina de courcy stopped horse also falling little behind lily so that might not be supposed to have seen tear began to hum tune emily also though not wickedly clever understood something of if bernard say anything to make angry will scold said then two girl rode on together in front while bernard fell back with siph dunn pratt said crosbie putting hand on friend shoulder a soon a party have ridden out of hearing do see that girl there in dark blue habit what one nearest to path yes one nearest to path be lily dale lily dale said fowler pratt yes be lily dale did speak to pratt asked gave chance be there moment be seems so odd to that must have be thus so near again if there be man to whom crosbie must have spoken freely about lily dale be man fowler pratt pratt be oldest friend have in world have happened that when first woke to misery that have prepared for in throwing over lily betrothing to late wife pratt have be first person to whom have communicated sorrow not that have ever be really open in communication be not given to such men a crosbie to speak openly of to friend indeed be fowler pratt one who be fond of listening to such tale have such tale to tell of thought that men woman must go through world quietly not subjecting acquaintance to anxiety emotion from peculiar conduct be conscientious courageous also a well a prudent have dared to tell crosbie that be behaving very badly have spoken mind plainly have then given assistance in power paused moment before replied weighing like prudent man force of word be about to utter be much better a be said be much better that must be a stranger for future see that at said crosbie be leaning on rail so remained for next twenty minute see that at feel sure of must come of renewed intercourse even if must allow might make wife do think that must be happy with with after what have passed do think so might be possible that must bring to marry woman delight to forgive injury like excitement of generosity must never forget that have have former wife circumstance under be married a for yourself must regret after first month how must ever speak to of love without speaking also of shame if man doe marry must at least be able to hold up head before wife be very severe crosbie showed anger think must do so said after while then about money of course must have to tell everything everything of course be like enough that might not regard that except must feel that if must not afford to marry when be unembarrassed can hardly afford to do so when be over head ear in debt have money now after have come gone must hardly seek lily dale because want to marry fortune be too hard on pratt know that only reason for seeking be that love mean to be hard have very strong opinion that quarrel of lover when be of so very serious nature be bad basis for renewal of love come let go dress for dinner be going to dine with mr thorne millionaire who married country doctor who used to be called miss dunstable never dine out anywhere now said crosbie then walked out of park together of of course knew that lily dale be staying at house at fowler pratt be going to dine lily a rode home did not speak word must have given world to be able to talk must not even make beginning heard bernard siph dunn chatting behind hoped that must continue to do so till be safe within house used well for one tried to draw into conversation once emily said to will trot little lily then have moved on quickly misery be soon over a soon a be upstairs in house got emily by explained mystery in word two fear have made fool of myself be man to whom be once engaged what mr crosbie said emily who have heard whole story from bernard yes mr crosbie pray say word of to anybody not even to aunt be better now be such fool dear wo go into drawing room will go upstairs come down ready for dinner when be alone sat down in habit declared to herself that certainly must never become wife of mr crosbie know why must make such declaration have promised mother john eames that must not do so that promise must certainly have bound without further resolution on own part to tell truth vision of man have disenchanted when last have seen have be a be god to though since day conduct to have be a ungodlike a well might be still memory of outward sign of divinity have remained with be difficult to explain how have come to pas that glimpse have have of must have altered so much within mind why must so suddenly have come to regard in altered light be not simply that looked to be older because face be careworn be not only that have lost that look of apollo lily have once in mirth attributed to think be chiefly that be older must no longer see god in such man have never regarded john eames a being gifted with divinity have therefore always be making comparison to discredit such comparison now must tend quite other way nevertheless must adhere to two letter in book since have seen mr crosbie be altogether out of love with prospect of matrimony be in room when mr pratt be announced at once recognized a man who have be with crosbie when minute afterwards siph dunn came into room must see that in greeting allusion be made to scene in park still be probable that man must not recognize if did so what must matter there be twenty people to sit down to dinner chance be that must not be called upon to exchange word with mr pratt have now recovered must speak freely to friend siph when siph came stood near thanked graciously for escort in park if be for mr dunn really think must not get riding at bernard miss dunstable have only one thing to think about certainly be not that one thing thought probable that if must keep siph close to mr thorne who always managed thing might apportion out to be led to dinner by good natured friend fate be averse time have now come lily be waiting turn mr fowler pratt let introduce to miss lily dale said mr thorne lily must perceive that mr pratt be startled sign gave be least possible sign in world still sufficed for lily to perceive put hand upon arm walked down with to dining room without giving slightest cause to suppose that knew who be think saw in park riding said yes be there go nearly day never ride be walking seems to that people go there to walk to stand still said lily can not understand how so many people can bear to loiter about in way leaning on rail doing nothing be about a good a riding cost money be can be said for do live chiefly in town o dear live altogether in country be only up here because cousin be going to be married captain dale mean to miss dunstable said fowler pratt when have be joined together in holy matrimony will go down to country never suppose come up to london again like london not a residence think said lily of course one liking dislikings on matter depend on circumstance live with mother relative live near of course like country best because be there young lady so often have different way of looking at subject must wonder if miss dunstable view about be altogether of sort young lady generally expect to be taken away from father mother uncle aunt see expect to be left with mine said lily after turned a much away from mr fowler pratt a must having taken aversion to what business have to talk to about being taken away from uncle aunt have seen with mr crosbie might be possible that be intimate friend might be that mr pratt be asking question in mr crosbie interest let be a might must answer more question from further than ordinary good breeding must require of be nice girl certainly said fowler pratt to a walked home have doubt must make good ordinary everyday wife be not such paragon that man must condescend to grovel in dirt for night lily told emily dunstable whole of mr crosbie history a far a knew also explained new aversion to mr fowler pratt be very great friend said emily bernard have told so may be sure that mr pratt knew whole history before came here be so sorry that aunt asked doe not signify in least said lily even if be to meet mr crosbie think must make such fool of myself again a be can only hope did not see be sure did not then there be pause during lily sat with face resting on hand be wonderful how much be altered said at last think how much have suffered suppose be altered a much only see in know what be think can have changed much no doubt have suffered too not a have done oh a for have done very well think will go to bed now riding make so sleepy chapter liv clerical commission be at last arranged that five clergyman selected must meet at dr tempest house in silverbridge to make inquiry report to bishop whether circumstance connected with cheque for twenty pound be of such nature a to make incumbent on to institute proceeding against mr crawley in court of arch dr tempest have acted upon letter have received from bishop exactly a though there have be no meeting at palace quarrel to death between mr proudie be prudent man gifted with great power of holding tongue have not spoken word even to wife of what have occurred after victory old friend archdeacon must have blown own trumpet loudly among friend plumstead must have heard of instantly paean must have be sung out in neighbouring parish of eiderdown stogpingum st ewolds high street of barchester must have known of very bedesman in hiram hospital must have told among terrible discomfiture of bishop lady dr tempest spoke word of to anybody wrote letter to two clergyman named by bishop selected two others out of own rural deanery suggested to day at preliminary meeting must be held at own house two who be invited by be mr oriel rector of greshamsbury mr robarts vicar of framley assented to proposition on day named assembled at silverbridge be now april judge be to come into barchester before end of month what then must be use of ecclesiastical inquiry exactly at same time men woman declared that be double prosecution that double prosecution for same offence be course of action opposed to feeling tradition of country miss anne prettyman went so far a to say that be unconstitutional mary walker declared that human being except mr proudie must ever have be guilty of such cruelty tell about bishop john said bishop be cypher may be sure dr tempest must not have hand in if be not right said john walker dear mr john said miss anne prettyman dr tempest be a hard a bar of iron always be be surprised that mr robarts must take part in in meantime at palace mr proudie have be reduced to learn what be going on from mr thumble bishop have never spoken word to respecting mr crawley since terrible day on dr tempest have witnessed imbecility having absolutely declined to answer when wife have mentioned subject wo speak to about dear have said to when have thus declined remonstrating more in sorrow than in anger wo bishop have replied there have be great deal too much talking about have broken heart already know be very bad day in palace mr proudie affected to be satisfied with what be being done talked to mr thumble about mr crawley cheque a though everything be arranged quite to satisfaction a though everything indeed have be arranged by everybody about house must see that manner of woman be altogether altered be milder than usual with servant be almost too gentle in usage of husband seemed a though something have happened to frighten break spirit be whispered about through palace that be afraid that bishop be dying a for hardly left own sitting room in day except when joined family at breakfast at dinner in study did little nothing must smile when chaplain went to give trifling verbal direction for day scarcely ever took pen in hand though took up many book read hardly page how often told wife in day that be broken hearted one wife ever knew what have happened that must speak like said to once what have broken heart replied have done tom said going back into memory of very far distant day in nomenclature how can speak to so cruelly a that that must come to between after why did not go away leave that day when told did ever know woman who liked to be turned out of room in own house said mr proudie when mr proudie have condescended so far a must be admitted that in day there be great trouble in palace mr thumble on day before went to silverbridge asked for audience with bishop in order that might receive instruction have be strictly desired to do by mr proudie have not dared to disobey injunction thinking however that doing so be inexpedient have got nothing to say to about not word said bishop crossly thought that perhaps might like to see before started pleaded mr thumble very humbly want to see at said bishop be going there to exercise own judgment if have got ought not to come to after mr thumble began to think that mr proudie be right that bishop be near dissolution mr thumble mr quiverful went over to silverbridge together in gig hired from dragon of wantly a to cost of there arose among not unnatural apprehension amounted at last almost to dismay mind so much for once said mr quiverful if many such meeting be necessary for one ca afford wo do man with family ca allow to be money out of pocket in way be hard said mr thumble ought to pay out of own pocket said mr quiverful have have concern with palace when mr proudie be in full swing of dominion have not a yet begun to suspect that there might possibly be change mr oriel mr robarts be already sitting with dr tempest when other two clergyman be shown into room when first greeting be over luncheon be announced while be eating not word be said about mr crawley lady of family be not present five clergyman sat round table alone must have be difficult to have got together five gentleman le likely to act with one mind one spirit perhaps be better for mr crawley that must be so dr tempest be man peculiarly capable of exercising function of judge in such matter have sat alone a judge be one who must be almost sure to differ from others who sat a equal assessor with mr oriel be gentleman at point be very shy very reticent altogether uninstructed in ordinary daily intercourse of man with man one knowing might have predicted of that must be sure on occasion a to be found floundering in sea of doubt mr quiverful be father of large family whose whole life have be devoted to fighting cruel world on behalf of wife child fight have fought bravely have left energy for other business mr thumble be poor creature so poor creature that in spite of small restless ambition to be doing something be almost cowed by hard line of dr tempest brow rev mark robarts be man of world clever fellow did not stand in awe of anybody unless might be in very moderate degree of patron luftons whom be bound to respect cleverness be not cleverness needed by judge be essentially partisan must be sure to vote against bishop in such matter a now before there be palace faction in diocese anti palace faction mr thumble mr quiverful belonged to one mr oriel mr robarts to other mr thumble be too weak to stick to faction against strength of such man a dr tempest mr quiverful must be too indifferent to do so unless interest be concerned mr oriel must be too conscientious to regard own side on occasion a mark robarts must be sure to support friend oppose enemy let case be what might now gentleman if please will go into other room said dr tempest went into other room there found five chair arranged for round table not word have a yet be said about mr crawley one of four stranger knew whether mr crawley be to appear before on day not gentleman said dr tempest seating at once in arm chair placed at middle of table think will be well to explain to at first what a regard matter be extent of work be called upon to perform be of nature very disagreeable can not be so let be ever so limited here be brother clergyman gentleman living among doing duty a be told in most exemplary manner suddenly hear that be accused of theft matter be brought before magistrate of whom be one be committed for trial there be therefore prima facie evidence of guilt think that need go into question of guilt at when said other four looked up at in astonishment thought that have be summoned here for purpose said mr robarts not at a take said doctor be to commence such inquiry jury must have given verdict before must come to conclusion must be impossible for to oppose that verdict whether declares unfortunate gentleman to be innocent to be guilty if jury will say that be innocent there be end of matter altogether must go back to parish amidst sympathy congratulation of friend be what must wish of course be said mr robarts declared be desire a matter of course mr thumble said louder than one else if be found guilty then will come difficulty to bishop in be bound to give assistance within power of course be said mr thumble who having heard own voice once having liked sound thought that might creep into little importance by using on occasion opened for if will allow sir will venture to state view a shortly a can said dr tempest may perhaps be most expeditious course for in end oh certainly said mr thumble did mean to interrupt in case of being found guilty continued doctor there will arise question whether punishment awarded to by judge must suffice for ecclesiastical purpose suppose for instance that must be imprisoned for two month must be allowed to return to living at expiration of term think ought said mr robarts considering thing see why must said mr quiverful mr oriel sat listening patiently mr thumble looked up to doctor expecting to hear opinion expressed by with might coincide there certainly be reason why must not said dr tempest though by mean say that reason be conclusive in present case in first place man who have stolen money can hardly be fitting person to teach others not to steal must look to circumstance said robarts yes be true just bear with moment can not at rate be thought that clergyman must come out of prison go to living without notice from bishop simply because have already be punished under common law if be so clergyman might be fined ten day running for being drunk in street five shilling time at end of time might set bishop at defiance when clergyman have shown to be utterly unfit for clerical duty must not be held to be protected from ecclesiastical censure from deprivation by action of common law mr crawley have not shown to be unfit said robarts be begging question robarts said doctor just so said mr thumble then mr robarts gave look at mr thumble mr thumble retired into shoe be question a to be called upon to advise bishop continued dr tempest must say that think bishop be right if be to allow matter to pas by without notice be to say in event of mr crawley being pronounced to be guilty by jury must think neglect duty now have be informed that bishop have recommended mr crawley to desist from duty till trial be over that mr crawley have declined to take bishop advice be true said mr thumble altogether disregarded bishop can not say that think be wrong said dr tempest think be quite right said mr robarts bishop in almost case be entitled to obedience of clergy said mr oriel must say that agree with sir said mr thumble income be not large suppose that must have gone with duty said mr quiverful be very hard for man with family to live when income have be stopped be that a may continued doctor bishop feel that may be duty to oppose return of mr crawley to pulpit that can oppose in other way than by proceeding against mr crawley under clerical offence act propose therefore that must invite mr crawley to attend here mr crawley be not coming here to day then said mr robarts thought useless to ask for attendance until have settled on course of action said dr tempest if be agreed will beg to come here on day week when will meet again will then ask whether will submit to bishop decision in event of jury finding guilty if must decline to do so can only then form opinion a to what will be bishop duty by reference to fact a be elicited at trial if mr crawley must choose to make to statement a to own case of course will be willing to receive be idea of what have better be done now if gentleman have other proposition to make of course will be pleased to hear dr tempest a said looked round upon companion a though pleasure under circumstance suggested by must be very doubtful suppose can do anything better said mr robarts think pity however that step must have be taken by bishop before trial bishop have be placed in very delicate position said mr thumble pleading for patron know meaning of word 'delicate said robarts think duty be very clear to avoid interference whilst matter be so to say before judge nobody have anything else to propose said dr tempest then will write to mr crawley gentleman will perhaps do honour of meeting here at one o'clock on day week then meeting be over four clergyman having shaken hand with dr tempest in hall promised that must return on day week so far dr tempest have carried point exactly a might have done have four gentleman be represented by chair on have sat sha come again same unless know where be to get expense said mr quiverful a got into gig will come said mr thumble because think duty of course be hardship mr thumble liked idea of being joined with such men a dr tempest mr oriel mr robarts must day have paid expense of gig from barchester to silverbridge out of own pocket for sake of sitting with such benchfellows on clerical inquiry one first duty be to one own wife family said mr quiverful well yes in way of course be quite true mr quiverful when know how very inadequate be income of working clergy can not feel ourselves to be if may so say put upon when have to defray expense incidental to special duty out of own pocket think know mind saying to that palace must have provided with chaise pair be ungrateful on part of mr thumble who have be permitted to ride mile upon mile to various outlying clerical duty upon bishop worn out cob see continued mr thumble go specially to represent palace palace ought to remember that think there ought to have be chaise pair do indeed care much what conveyance be said mr quiverful certainly will pay nothing more out of own pocket certainly will not result will be that palace will be thrown over if take care said mr thumble tempest however seems to be pretty steady tempest think be steady see be getting tired of parish work must like to go into close be what be looking out for did ever see such fellow a robarts just look at quite indecent be think can have own way in everything just because sister married lord do hate to see meanness mark robarts caleb oriel left silverbridge in gig by same road soon passed brother a mr robarts be in habit of driving large quick stepping horse last remark be being made a dust from vicar of framley wheel saluted face of two slower clergyman mr oriel have promised to dine sleep at framley therefore returned in mr robarts gig quite unnecessary fuss think so said mr robarts be not quite sure said mr oriel can understand that bishop may have found difficulty bishop indeed bishop doe care two straw about be mr proudie have put finger on poor man neck because have not put neck beneath foot now think can crush a must crush if be in power be about long short of bishop solicitude be very hard on said mr oriel know be not at hard on be hard upon if like tempest be fair be very fair a long a one meddles with wo do amiss ca hold tongue always often know that be better must dr tempest said not word to one on subject not even in own defence yet be sorely tempted on very day of meeting dined at mr walker in silverbridge there submitted to be talked at by lady most of gentleman present without saying word in own defence yet word two must have be so easy so conclusive oh dr tempest said mary walker be so sorry that have joined bishop be dear said be generally thought well that parish clergyman must agree with bishop know dr tempest that agree with bishop generally then be more fortunate that will be able to agree with on occasion major grantly be present at dinner ventured to ask doctor in course of evening what thought must be done must not venture to ask question dr tempest said unless have strongest possible reason to justify anxiety know can tell anything major grantly said doctor did not even see mr crawley to day real truth be that must stand fall a jury will find guilty not guilty must be same in profession must captain in army hold up head in regiment after have be tried found guilty of stealing twenty pound think must said major neither can clergyman said doctor bishop can neither make mar be jury must do chapter lv framley parsonage at time grace crawley be at framley parsonage old lady lufton strategy have be quite intelligible people said that in point of etiquette judgment moral conduct be indefensible vicar mr robarts have be selected to be one of clergyman who be to sit in ecclesiastical judgment upon mr crawley while be so sitting mr crawley daughter be staying in mr robarts house a visitor with wife might be that there be harm in lady lufton when apparent impropriety be pointed out to by le person than archdeacon grantly ridiculed idea dear archdeacon lady lufton have said know bishop to be such fool bishop wife to be such knave that can not allow ourselves to be governed in matter by ordinary rule do not think that be expedient to show how utterly disregard judgment malice archdeacon have hesitated much before spoke to lady lufton whether must address to to mr robarts indeed to mr robarts have become aware that proposition a to visit have originated with lady lufton have therefore decided on speaking to have not condescended to say word a to son must so condescend must go from lady lufton to mr robarts having once failed with ladyship indeed in giving due must acknowledge that disapprobation of lady lufton strategy arose rather from true conviction a to impropriety than from fear lest attention paid to miss crawley must tend to bring about marriage with son by time hated very name of crawley hated more because in hating have to put for time on same side with mr proudie for that must not condescend to unworthy mode of fighting thought wrong that young lady must be invited to framley parsonage at moment said so to person who have a thought in truth given invitation must not allow own personal motif to induce to carry on argument with lady lufton bishop be fool said bishop wife be knave nevertheless must not have have young lady over to framley at moment if however think right robarts think right there be end of upon word do said lady lufton be induced to think that mr robarts be not quite confident of expediency of what be doing by way in mentioned to mr oriel fact of miss crawley presence at parsonage a drove that gentleman home in gig have be talking about mr crawley when suddenly turned round so that must look at companion said miss crawley be staying with at parsonage at present moment what mr crawley daughter said mr oriel showing plainly by voice that tidings have much surprised yes mr crawley daughter oh indeed did not know that be on term with family have known for last seven eight year said mark though must be giving false notion if be to say that have known intimately for crawley be man whom be quite impossible to know intimately yet womankind at framley have known sister stayed with over at hogglestock for time what lady lufton yes sister lucy be just before marriage there be lot of trouble crawleys be ill went to nurse then old lady took up altogether there came to be sort of feeling that be to be regarded a friend be always in trouble now in special trouble woman between have thought best to have girl over at framley of course have kind of feeling about commission a knew that must make difference with did not think necessary to put veto upon visit mr oriel said nothing further mark robarts be aware that mr oriel did not quite approve of visit that morning old lady lufton have come across to parsonage with express view of bidding parsonage party to come across to hall to dine can tell mr oriel fanny with lucy compliment how delighted will be to see old lady lufton always spoke of daughter in law a mistress of house if think be particular know will send note across mr robarts said that supposed mr oriel must not be particular looking at grace made faint excuse must come dear said lady lufton lucy wish particularly mr robarts did not know how to say that must not come so matter stood when mr robarts be called upon to leave room for moment lady lufton grace be left alone dear lady lufton said grace getting up suddenly from chair will do favour great favour spoke with energy quite surprised old lady caused almost to start from seat like making promise said lady lufton anything can do with propriety will can do pray let stay here to day understand how feel about going out while papa be in way know how kind how good be when dear mr robarts asked here mamma said that have better come must not refuse indeed indeed have rather not go out to dinner party be not party dear girl said lady lufton with kindest voice knew how to assume must remember that daughter in law regard a so very old friend remember of course when be staying over at hogglestock indeed do remember well therefore must not regard a going out there will be nobody there people from house will be going out lady lufton do hope will let stay here can not think how feel of course can not go without something like dressing in poor papa state feel ought not to do anything look like gaiety ought never to forget not for moment there be tear in lady lufton eye a said dear sha come fanny will stop dine here by yourselves gentleman

out little tell what dear will make havoc with somebody yet see if doe by by tell two gentleman to be up by seven punctually then lady lufton went home grace so contrived that mr oriel came went without seeing there be separate nursery breakfast at parsonage by special permission grace be allowed to have tea bread butter on next morning with child thought told miss crawley be here said mr oriel a two clergyman stood waiting for gig be to take visitor away to barchester so be said robarts like to hide because of father trouble ca blame indeed said mr oriel poor girl if knew must not only pity like be what call mean be lady of course be by birth said mr oriel apologizing for inquiry think there be girl in county so well educated said mr robarts indeed have idea of think great beauty a for manner never saw girl with prettier way of own dear said mr oriel wish have come down to breakfast will have be perceived that old lady lufton have heard nothing of major grantly offence that have knowledge that grace have already made havoc a have called have in truth made very sad havoc at plumstead did not therefore think much about when son told upon return home from parsonage on afternoon that major grantly have come over from cosby lodge that be going to dine sleep at framley court slight idea of thankfulness came across mind that have not betrayed grace crawley into meeting with stranger asked to come day before went up to town said lordship be glad have come to day a two clergyman to one self be at rate one too many so major grantly dined slept at court mr robarts be in great flurry when be told of by husband on return from dinner mr crawley have found opportunity of telling story of major grantly love to mr robarts before have sent daughter to framley knowing that family be intimate thinking right that there must be precaution wonder whether will come up here mr robarts have said probably not said vicar said be going home early hope will not come for grace sake said mr robarts hesitated whether must tell husband always did tell everything on occasion thought have right to do so kept secret do anything to bring up dear need be afraid wo come said vicar on following morning a soon a mr oriel be gone mr robarts went out about parish must probably have called in hour might have be seen strolling about court stable yard with lord lufton where be grantly asked vicar know where be said lordship have sloped off somewhere major have sloped off to parsonage well knowing in what nest dove be lying hid vicar have passed other major have gone out at front gate vicar have gone in at stable entrance two clergyman have hardly taken departure when major grantly knocked at parsonage door have come so early that mr robarts have taken precaution even have there be precaution must have thought right to take grace be in act of coming down stair not having heard knock at door thus found lover in hall have asked of course for mr robarts thus two entered drawing room together have not have time to speak when servant opened drawing room door to announce visitor there have be no word spoken between mr robarts grace about major grantly mother have told daughter of what have said to mr robarts grace said major be so glad to find then turned to mr robarts with open hand wo take uncivil of if say that visit be not entirely to think may take upon to say miss crawley be old friend may not grace must not answer word mr crawley told that have known at silverbridge said mr robarts driven to say something feeling that be blundering came over to framley yesterday because heard that be here be wrong to come up here to see think must answer that for major grantly be wrong grace grace thought that be finest gentleman noblest lover have ever shown devotion to woman be stirred by mighty resolve that if ever must be in power to reward after fashion must pour out reward with very full hand indeed what be to say on present moment be wrong grace said repeating question with so much emphasis that be positively driven to answer think be wrong at how can say be wrong when be so good if must be servant must serve can be nothing to because of papa disgrace dear mr robarts can not stay must answer for having thus made speech escaped from room illustration because of papa disgrace may suffice to say further now that major did not see grace again during visit at framley chapter lvi archdeacon go to framley illustration by of unseen telegraphic wire carry news about country make charge for conveyance archdeacon grantly heard that son major be at framley now in there must have be nothing singular there have be for year much intimacy between lufton family grantly family so much that alliance between two house have once be planned elder having considered expedient that young lord must marry that griselda who have since mounted higher in world even than elder have then projected for there have come no such alliance intimacy have not ceased there be nothing in surprising in fact that major grantly must be staying at framley court archdeacon when heard news bethought at once of grace crawley must be possible that old friend lady lufton lady lufton whom have known trusted life whom have ever regarded a pillar of church in barsetshire must now be untrue to in matter so closely affecting interest men when be worried by fear teased by adverse circumstance become suspicious of on whom suspicion must never rest be hardly possible archdeacon thought that lady lufton must treat so unworthily circumstance be strong against friend lady lufton have induced miss crawley to go to framley much against advice at time when visit seemed to to be very improper now appeared that son be to be there at same time fact of lady lufton have made mention to why have not lady lufton told that henry grantly be coming to framley court reader whose interest in matter will be le keen than be archdeacon will know very well why lady lufton have said nothing about major visit reader will remember that lady lufton when saw archdeacon be a ignorant a to intended visit a be archdeacon archdeacon be uneasy troubled suspicious suspected old friend unworthily spoke to wife about within very few hour of arrival of tidings by invisible wire have already told that miss crawley be to go to framley parsonage that thought that mr robarts be wrong to receive at time be only intended for good nature mr grantly have said be misplaced good nature at present moment archdeacon have replied mr grantly have not thought worth while to undertake at moment strong defence of framley people knew well how odious be name of crawley in husband ear felt that le be said at present about crawleys better for peace of rectory at plumstead have therefore allowed expression of disapproval to pas unchallenged now came upon with more bitter grievance be obliged to argue matter with what do think said henry be at framley can hardly be staying there said mr grantly because know that be so very busy at home business at home of major mother be speaking be projected moving from cosby lodge subject be also very odious to archdeacon did not wish son to move from cosby lodge must not endure idea that son must be known throughout county to be giving up residence because must not afford to keep archdeacon must have afforded to keep up two cosby lodge for son must have be well pleased to do so if only son must not misbehave against so shamefully must not bear that son must be punished openly before eye of barsetshire indeed did not wish that son must be punished at simply desired that son must recognize father power to inflict punishment must be henbane to archdeacon grantly to have poor son son living at pau among frenchman because must not afford to live in england why have archdeacon be careful of money adding house to house field to field be contented so told to die a have lived in country parsonage working with collar round neck up to day of death if god must allow so to do be ambitious of grandeur for so must tell being partly oblivious of certain episode in own life wealth have be got together for child desired that son must be fitting brother for august sister now son who be nearest to whom be bent upon making squire in own county wanted to marry daughter of man who have stolen twenty pound when objection be made to so discreditable connexion replied by packing up thing saying that must go live at archdeacon therefore did not like to hear of son being very busy at home know whether be busy not said archdeacon tell be staying at framley from whom have heard what matter doe that make if be so heard from flurry flurry may have be mistaken said mr grantly be not at likely people always know about such thing heard from framley keeper doubt be true think that be great shame great shame henry must be at framley have be there two three time year since have lived in county be great shame that must be have over there just at time when girl be there also be impossible to believe that thing be accident archdeacon mean to say that think that lady lufton have arranged know who have arranged somebody have arranged if be robarts be almost worse one must forgive woman in such matter better than one must man psha mr grantly temper be never bitter at moment be not sweetened by husband very uncivil reference to sex whole idea be nonsense must get out of head be to get out of head that henry want to make girl wife that two be at moment at framley together in archdeacon be wrong a to fact major grantly have left framley on previous day having stayed there only one night be coming to that one can trust one one literally one mr grantly perfectly understood that archdeacon in agony of moment intended to exclude even from confidence by one to be indifferent understanding accurately when word must be accepted a expressing thought when must be supposed to express only anger probability be that one at lufton knew anything about henry partiality for miss crawley said mr grantly tell think be at framley together tell that if be doubt be there simply by accident besides what doe matter if choose to marry other can not prevent want assistance from lady lufton anybody else have simply got to make up own mind then one can hinder therefore must like to see brought together say nothing about archdeacon do say that must take thing a come what can do henry may go stay with lady lufton if plea can not prevent after archdeacon walked away must not argue matter further with wife at moment knew very well that must not get better of be apt at such moment to think that took unfair advantage of by keeping temper must not get out of head idea perhaps on very day thing be being arranged between son grace crawley at framley resolved that must go over see what might be done must at rate tell trouble to lady lufton beg old friend to assist must not think that one a have always known lady lufton to be must approve of marriage between henry grantly grace crawley at rate must learn truth have once be told that grace crawley have refused to marry son feeling that must do wrong to inflict so great injury upon gentleman have not believed in so great virtue must not believe in now now when heard that miss crawley son be staying together in same parish somebody must be doing injury must hardly be chance presence at framley might even yet have good effect must at least learn truth so have driven to barchester from barchester took post horse to framley a came near to village grew to be somewhat ashamed of at least nervous a to mode in must proceed driver turning round to have suggested that supposed be to drive to lady injustice to lord lufton to whom house belonged with whom mother lived a guest be very common in county for old lady lufton have lived at framley court through son long minority have kept house there till marriage even since marriage have be recognized a presiding genius certainly be not fault of old lady lufton a always spoke of everything a belonging to son to daughter in law archdeacon have be in doubt whether must go to court to parsonage must have done exactly a wished must have left chaise walked to parsonage so a to reach without noise fuss incidental to postilion arrival be impossible must not drop into framley a though have come from cloud therefore told man to do a have suggested to lady said postilion archdeacon assented man with loud crack of whip with spasmodic gallop along short avenue took archdeacon up to door of lord lufton house asked for lord lufton first putting on pleasantest smile so that servant must not suspect purpose of be somewhat ashamed be lord lufton at home lord lufton be not at home lord lufton have gone up to london that morning intending to return day after to morrow lady be at home so archdeacon be shown into room where lady be sitting with found mr robarts one who have become acquainted with habit of framley lady must have known that might very probably be case archdeacon be a well aware a one of mode of life at lord wife be parson sister parson wife have from infancy be petted friend of old lady of course lived very much together of course mr robarts be a much at home in drawing room of framley court a be in own drawing room at parsonage nevertheless archdeacon thought to be hardly used when found that mr robarts be at house dear archdeacon who ever expected to see said old lady lufton then two younger woman greeted smiled on pleasantly seemed overjoyed to see be in truth great favourite at framley of three be glad to welcome believed in archdeacon at framley felt for sort of love lady in country do feel for elderly male friend there be not one of three who must not have taken much trouble to get anything for archdeacon have thought archdeacon must like even old lady lufton remembered what be favourite soup always took care that must have when dined at court young lady lufton must bring tea to a sat in chair be petted in house be allowed to poke fire if pleased called servant by name a though be at home be compelled therefore to smile to seem pleased be not till after have eaten lunch have declared that must return home to dinner that dowager gave opportunity of having private conversation desired can have few minute talk with said to whispering into ear a left drawing room together so led way into own sitting room telling a asked to be seated that have supposed that something special must have brought over to framley must have asked to come up here even if have not spoken said then perhaps know what have brought over said archdeacon not in least said lady lufton have not idea did not flatter that must come so far on morning call merely to see three lady hope did not want to see ludovic because will not be back till to morrow wanted to see lady lufton be lucky a here be may be pretty sure to find here day in year after there be little pause archdeacon hardly knew how to begin story in first place be in doubt whether lady lufton have ever heard of preposterous match son have proposed to to make in anger at plumstead have felt sure that knew about that be assisting son belief have dwindled a anger have dwindled a chaise have entered parish of framley have told that be quite impossible that must know anything about manner have certainly be altogether in favour since have be in house there have be nothing of consciousness of guilt in demeanour nevertheless there be coincidence how have come to pas grace crawley son must be at framley together might indeed be just possible that flurry might have be wrong that son have not be there at suppose miss crawley be at parsonage said at last oh yes be still there will remain there must think for next ten day oh did not know said archdeacon very coldly seemed to lady lufton who be a innocent a unborn babe in matter of projected marriage that old friend archdeacon be in mind to persecute crawleys have on former occasion taken upon to advise grace crawley must not be entertained at framley now seemed that have come way from plumstead to say something further in same strain lady lufton if have anything further to say of kind must listen to a matter of course must listen to reply to without temper did not approve of told silently that must not approve of persecution of interference therefore drew up pursed mouth put on something of look of severity must assume very visibly if so pleased yes be still there think that visit will do great deal of good said lady lufton when talk of doing good to people said archdeacon often make terrible mistake so often happens that know when be doing good when be doing harm be true of course dr grantly must be so necessarily a wisdom here below be so very limited must think a far a can see be that kindness friend mr robarts be showing to young lady must be beneficial know archdeacon explained to before must not quite agree with in what said a to leaving people alone till after trial thought that help be necessary to at once archdeacon sighed deeply ought to have be somewhat renovated in spirit by tone in lady lufton spoke to a conveyed to almost absolute conviction that first suspicion be incorrect comfort might have come to from source be marred by feeling that must announce own disgrace at rate must do so unless be contented to go back to plumstead without having learned anything by journey changed tone of voice however asked question a might be altogether on different subject heard yesterday said that henry be over here be here yesterday came evening before dined slept here went home yesterday morning be miss crawley with that evening miss crawley must not come think best not to go out while father be in present unfortunate position be right be quite right in said archdeacon then paused again thought that must be best for to make clean breast of to trust to lady lufton sympathy did henry go up to parsonage asked still lady lufton did not suspect truth think did replied with air of surprise think heard that went up there to call on mr robarts after breakfast lady lufton did not go up there to call on mr robarts went up there because be making fool of about miss crawley be truth now understand hope that mr robarts doe not know do hope for own sake mr robarts doe not know archdeacon certainly have longer doubt a to lady lufton innocence when looked at face a heard tidings have predicted that grace crawley must make havoc must not therefore be altogether surprised at idea that gentleman must have fallen in love with have never supposed that havoc might be made so early in day on so great quarry mean to tell that henry grantly be in love with grace crawley replied mean to say that say be dear dear dear be sure archdeacon that will believe when say that knew nothing about be quite sure of said archdeacon dolefully certainly must not have be glad to see here house know be not mine dr grantly must have done nothing if have known only to think well to be sure have not lost time at rate now be not at light in archdeacon wished that matter must be regarded have be desirous that lady lufton must be horror stricken by tidings seemed to that regarded iniquity almost a good joke what did matter how young how old girl might be came of poor people of people who have friend of disgraced people lady lufton ought to feel that marriage must be terrible misfortune terrible crime need hardly tell lady lufton said archdeacon that will set face against a far a be in power to do so if be resolved suppose can hardly prevent of course can not prevent of course can not prevent if will break heart mother sister of course can not prevent if will ruin must have own way ruin dr grantly will have enough to live upon somewhere in spain france scorn expressed in archdeacon voice a spoke of pau a being somewhere in spain france must have be heard to be understood doubt will have enough to live upon do mean to say that will make difference a to own property dr grantly certainly will lady lufton told henry when first heard of thing before have definitely made offer to girl must withdraw from altogether allowance now make if married told also that if persisted in folly must think duty to alter will be sorry for dr grantly sorry be not sorry sorrow be sufficient word be broken hearted lady lufton be killing be indeed love love love a have loved son what be use what can be to when will have married daughter of such man a lady lufton sat for while silent thinking of certain episode in own life there have be time when son be desirous of making marriage have thought must break heart have for time moved heaven earth a far a knew how to move to prevent marriage at last have yielded not from lack of power for circumstance have be such that at moment of yielding have still power in hand of staying marriage have yielded because have perceived that son be in earnest have yielded have kissed dust from moment in lip have so touched ground have taken great joy in new daughter whom son have brought into house since have learned to think that young people might perhaps be right that old people might perhaps be wrong trouble of friend archdeacon be very like own old trouble be engaged to now said when thought have passed through mind yes be be not sure know how to make sure be sure major grantly will tell truth a exists yes will tell truth a far a know see that there be much anxiety to spare in matter be desirous rather of making understand have power of saving from own folly of course have power of saving be engaged to say that have refused of course mean nothing again archdeacon position be very like lady lufton position a have existed before son marriage in case also young lady who be now lady lufton own daughter dearest friend have refused lover who proposed to although marriage be so much to advantage loving too while with whole heart a be natural to suppose grace crawley might so love lover more thought of similarity of story stronger be sympathy on side of poor grace nevertheless must comfort old friend if knew how of course must not admit to herself that match be one must be cause of real sorrow to know why refusal must mean nothing said lady lufton of course girl refuse at first girl mean in such circumstance a hers ca feel that more be offered to than ought to take that be bound to go through ceremony of declining anger be not with lady lufton see how can be be not with if becomes wife trust may never see oh dr grantly do do how can be otherwise with will have quarrel with with must quarrel see why said lady lufton doe not set at defiance at age surely son have right to marry a plea if took out of street then must be same said archdeacon with bitter anger for one must herself be bad if be daughter of huxter out of city again for in case want of education must probably unfit for society father disgrace then must be matter of indifference to lady lufton did not say so in first place father be not disgraced not a yet know whether may ever be disgraced will hardly be disposed to say that persecution from palace disgrace clergyman in barsetshire same believe that man be guilty said archdeacon wait see friend before condemn altogether be that a may acknowledge that marriage be one must naturally be distasteful to oh lady lufton if only knew if only knew do know feel for think that son have right to expect that must not show same repugnance to marriage a a must have have right to show have suggested to wife a at just now hinted of course can advise make understand feeling can not think will be justified in quarrelling with in changing view towards a regard money seeing that miss crawley be educated lady who have done nothing to forfeit respect heavy cloud came upon archdeacon brow a heard word did not make immediate answer of course friend continued lady lufton must not have ventured to say so much to have not come to a be for opinion came here because thought henry be here said archdeacon if have said too much beg pardon no have not said too much be not that be such old friend that may say almost anything to other yes just so therefore have ventured to speak mind said lady lufton of course be obliged to lady lufton understand yet how hit everything in life have done have done for child be wealthy have not used wealth for myself because have desired that must be able to hold head high in world ambition have be for pleasure have anticipated for in old age be that have hoped to receive from credit a for henry might have have anything wanted from in way of money expressed wish few month since to go into parliament promised to help a far a ever must go have kept up game altogether for younger son of working parish parson have have everything must be given to eldest son of country gentleman more than be given to eldest son of many peer have hoped that must marry again have never cared that must marry for money have be willing to do anything for lady lufton father doe feel that must have return for one can imagine that henry ever supposed that bride from wretched place at hogglestock must be welcomed among knew that must break heart did not care for be what feel of course have power to do a like of course have power to do a like also with what be own lady lufton be very good woman devoted to duty affectionate just to about truly religious charitable from nature doubt whether thorough worldliness of archdeacon appeal struck a will strike reader people be so much more worldly in practice than be in theory so much keener after own gratification in detail than be in abstract that narrative of many adventure must shock though same adventure must not shock in action one girl tell how have changed mind in love friend sympathizes with friend perhaps applauds have story be told in print friend who have listened with equanimity must have read of such vacillation with indignation who vacillated must have hated own performance when brought before judgment a matter in have personal interest very fine thing be written day about honesty truth men read with sort of external conviction that man if be anything of man at be of course honest true when internal conviction be brought out between two three who be personally interested together between two three who feel that little gathering be so to say tiled internal conviction differ very much from external conviction man in confidence asserts broadly that doe not mean to be thrown over man have project for throwing over somebody else intention of be that scruple be not to stand in way of success ruat coelum fiat justitia be said doubt from outside balcony to crowd speaker knew that be talking buncombe rem si possis recte si non quocunque modo be whispered into ear in club smoking room whisperer intended that word must prevail lady lufton have often heard friend archdeacon preach knew well high tone must take a to necessity of trusting to hope for future for true happiness yet sympathized with when told that be broken hearted because son must take step might possibly interfere with worldly prosperity have archdeacon be preaching about matrimony must have recommended young men in taking wife to especially to look for young woman who feared lord in talking about own son wife no word a to eligibility non eligibility in respect escaped lip have talked on subject till nightfall such word must have be spoken have friend of own man woman in discussing such matter with asking advice upon alluded to fear of lord allusion must have be distasteful to must have smacked to palate of hypocrisy lady lufton who understood a well a woman what be to be tiled with friend took in good part archdeacon have spoken out of heart what be in heart one of child have married marquis might probably become bishop perhaps archbishop third might be county squire high among county squire must only so become by walking warily now be bent on marrying penniless daughter of impoverished half mad country curate who be about to be tried for stealing twenty pound lady lufton in spite of argument must not refuse sympathy to old friend after from what say suppose be not engaged know said archdeacon can not tell what do wish to do oh nothing came over a said before because thought be here think right before have absolutely committed to take mean in power to make understand that will withdraw from pecuniary assistance now for future friend that threat seems to to be so terrible be only power have left to who be so affectionate by nature must never adhere to will try will do best to be firm will at once put everything beyond control after death archdeacon a uttered terrible word word be awful to lady lufton ear resolved that must endeavour to nurse own wrath at same time almost hated for own pusillanimity because feared that wrath must die away before must have availed of heat must hing rash of kind said lady lufton object be to prevent marriage not to punish for when once have made be not to have own way in everything lady lufton must first try to prevent can do to prevent lady lufton paused for couple of minute before replied have scheme in head seemed to to savour of cruelty yet at present be chief duty to assist old friend if assistance must be given there must hardly be doubt that marriage a of be speaking be in evil in case case of son there have be question of trial of money stolen of aught be in truth disgraceful think if be dr grantly said must see young lady while be here see said archdeacon idea of seeing grace crawley have up to moment never entered head think must do so think will said archdeacon after pause then got up from chair if be to do have better do at once be gentle with friend archdeacon paused again certainly have entertained idea of encountering miss crawley with severity rather than gentleness lady lufton rose from seat coming up to took one of hand between own two be gentle to said have owned that have done nothing wrong archdeacon bowed head in token of assent left room poor grace crawley chapter lvii double pledge archdeacon a walked across from court to parsonage be very thoughtful step be very slow idea of seeing miss crawley have be suggested to suddenly have to determine how must bear towards what must say to lady lufton have beseeched to be gentle with be mission one in gentleness must be possible must not be object to make young lady understand that must not be right in desiring to come into family share in good thing when have got no good thing of own nothing evil thing to bring with how must be properly explained to young lady in gentle term must not be round with give to understand in plain word plainest must use that must not get good thing though must most certainly impose burden of evil thing on man whom be proposing to herself a husband remembered very well a went that have be told that miss crawley have refused offer feeling to be unfit for honour tendered to suspected sincerity of such refusal calculating in own mind unreasonably great advantage must be conferred on young lady a miss crawley by marriage with son declared to that girl must be very wicked indeed who must expect even accept so much more than be due nevertheless must not bring to believe that girl when so tempted must in sincerity decline to commit great wickedness if be to do good by seeing miss crawley must not consist in proper explanation to of selfishness abomination altogether damnable blackness of such wickedness a on part of young woman in circumstance heaven earth must say here be without penny in pocket with hardly decent raiment on back with thief for father think that be to come share in wealth that grantlys have amassed that be to have husband with broad acre big house game preserve become one of family whose name have never be touched by single accusation not by suspicion injustice such a will never be done betwixt may wring heart may ruin son broad acre big house game preserve rest of will never be reward for doing so how be to be told effectively to young woman in gentle word then how be man in archdeacon position to be desirous of gentle word gentle word must not be efficient when knew well in heart of heart that have nothing threat on to depend have more power of disinheriting own son for such offence a contemplated than have of blowing out own brain knew that be so be man incapable of such persistency of wrath against one whom loved be cruel enough strong enough to do thing must only threaten to do make what best use might of threat whilst threat might be of avail in spite of that have said to wife to lady lufton to knew very well that if son did sin in way father must forgive sin of son in going across from front gate of court to parsonage there be place where three road met on spot there stood finger post round finger post there be now pasted placard at once arrested archdeacon eye cosby lodge sale of furniture growing crop to be sold on ground three hunter brown gelding warranted for saddle harness archdeacon have given brown gelding to son a great treasure three alderney cow two cow calf low phaeton gig two rick of hay in fashion be proclaimed in odious detail comfortable addition to gentleman house in country with archdeacon be so well acquainted only last november have recommended son to buy certain new invented clod crusher clod crusher have of course be bought bright blue paint upon have not a yet given way to stain of ordinary farmyard muck mire here be clod crusher advertised for sale archdeacon did not want son to leave cosby lodge knew well enough that son need not leave cosby lodge why have foolish fellow be in such hurry with hideous ill conditioned advertisement gentle how be in such circumstance to be gentle raised umbrella poked angrily at disgusting notice iron ferule caught paper at chink in post tore from top to bottom be use horrid ugly bill lying torn in such spot must attract only more attention than one fixed to post must not condescend however to give to further attention passed on up to parsonage gentle indeed nevertheless archdeacon grantly be gentleman never yet have dealt more harshly with woman than have sometimes seen do with wife when must say to angry word two with good deal of marital authority wife who knew well what angry word be worth never even suggested to herself that have cause for complaint on head have known that archdeacon be about to undertake such mission a have now in hand must not have warned to be gentle indeed must have strongly advised not to undertake mission cautioning that young lady must probably get better of grace dear said mr robarts coming up into nursery in miss crawley be sitting with child come out here moment will then grace left child went out into passage dear there be gentleman in drawing room who asks to see gentleman mr robarts what gentleman grace though asked question conceived that gentleman must be henry grantly mind did not suggest to possibility of other gentleman coming to see must not be surprised allow to be frightened oh mr robarts who be be major grantly father archdeacon yes dear archdeacon grantly be in drawing room must see mr robarts well grace think must hardly know how can refuse be intimate friend of everybody here at framley what will say to nay can not tell suppose know have come doubt to bid have nothing to say to son need not have troubled may say what like be not coward will go to stop moment grace come into room for instant child have pulled hair about grace though followed mr robarts into bedroom must have nothing done to hair be too proud for may say also too little confident in good such resource might effect on behalf never mind about said what be to say to mr robarts paused before replied feeling that matter be one required deliberation tell must say to said grace repeating question hardly know what own feeling be dear yes do do know if have world to give must give to major grantly tell that then will not tell never mind about frock mr robarts care for will tell that love son granddaughter too well to injure will tell nothing else might a well go now mr robarts a looked at grace be astonished at serenity of face yet when hand be on drawing room door grace hesitated looked back trembled mr robarts blew kiss to from stair then door be opened girl found in presence of archdeacon be standing on rug with back to fire heavy ecclesiastical hat be placed on middle of round table hat caught grace eye at moment of entrance felt that thunder of church be contained within then archdeacon be so big so clerical so imposing father aspect be severe severity of father face be essentially different from expressed by archdeacon impression came from father came from man there be outward adornment there there be so to say wig about mr crawley now archdeacon be not exactly adorned be so thoroughly imbued with high clerical belonging sacerdotal fitness a to appear always a walking sitting standing impersonation of parsondom to poor grace a entered room appeared to be impersonation of parsondom in severest aspect miss crawley believe said yes sir said curtseying ever so slightly a stood before at considerable distance first idea be that son must be indeed fool if be going to give up cosby lodge barsetshire retire to pau for so slight unattractive creature a now saw before idea stayed with only for moment a continued to gaze at during interview came to perceive that there be very much more than have perceived at first glance that son after have have eye to see though perhaps not heart to understand will not take chair said then grace sat down still at distance from archdeacon kept place upon rug felt that there must be difficulty in making feel full force of eloquence across room yet did not know how to bring nearer to became suddenly very important in eye be to extent afraid of be so slight so meek so young yet there be about something so beautifully feminine withal so like lady that felt instinctively that must not attack with harsh word have lip be full colour high have eye rolled have put forth against of ordinary artillery with youthful feminine battery be charged must have be ready to rush to combat girl about whom son have gone mad sat there a passively a though be conscious of possession of artillery there be not single gun fired from beneath eyelid knew not why respected son now more than have respected for last two month more perhaps than have ever respected before be a eager a ever against marriage in thinking of son in what said did after few first moment of interview ceased to think of with contempt creature before be woman who grew in opinion till began to feel that be in truth fit to be wife of son if only be not pauper daughter of mad curate ala too probably of thief though feeling towards girl be changed duty to family son be same a ever therefore began task perhaps have not expected to see said indeed sir have intended when came over here to call on old friend lady lufton to come up to house a knew that be here miss crawley thought that upon whole must be better must see then paused a though expected that grace must say something grace have nothing to say of course must understand miss crawley must not venture to speak to on subject unless be very closely interested in have not yet said what be subject be not probable that grace must give assistance by affecting to understand without direct explanation from sat quite motionless did not even aid by showing by altered colour that understood purpose son have told said that have professed attachment for miss crawley then there be pause grace felt that be compelled to say something major grantly have be very good to said then hated for

openly must speak to openly because be duty on son behalf will endeavour to speak to kindly also of have heard nothing what be favourable there be reason a yet why must not respect esteem grace told that must hing ought to forfeit respect esteem that did not care two straw whether respect esteem be bestowed on not be striving after something very different from that if son be to marry must greatly injure must very greatly injure child again paused have told to listen be resolved that must listen unless must say something might make word from necessary at moment know whether there doe at present exist engagement between there be engagement sir be glad of very glad of know whether be aware that son be dependent upon for greater part of income be so a be so circumstanced with son of course feel closest possible concern in future prospect archdeacon did not know how to explain clearly why fact of making son annual allowance must give warmer interest in son affair than might have have have major be altogether independent of trusted that grace must understand by own natural light now miss crawley of course can not wish to say word that will hurt feeling there be reason know said interrupting papa be accused of stealing money did not steal people think did then be so very poor do understand then feel grateful do indeed think being poor ought to signify bit said grace papa

nothing be mean nothing be shapeless be face promised infinite beauty with promise be on very verge of fulfilment there be play about mouth a spoke curl in nostril a eager word came from almost made selfish father give way why have not told that be such one a why have not henry spoken of speciality of beauty man in england knew better than archdeacon difference between beauty of one kind beauty of kind in woman face one beauty come from health youth animal spirit belongs to miller daughter other beauty show in fine line noble spirit beauty come from breeding what say doe very much honour indeed said archdeacon must not mind at about being poor said grace said archdeacon poor a be clergyman think ever be so poor must have done a son asked at once if have be only that because love if

that papa stole money will never marry son there archdeacon be still looking down at feeling slight touch of finger raised arm little a though to welcome pressure looked into eye be turned eagerly towards when doing so be quite sure that promise must be kept must have be sacrilege felt that must have be sacrilege to doubt promise almost relented soft heart be never very well under own control gave way so far that be nearly moved to tell on son behalf acquitted of promise what must man son do better than have such woman for wife must have be of avail have made such offer pledge have given have not be wrung from by influence must influence have availed aught with towards alteration of purpose be not archdeacon who have taught that must not be duty to take disgrace into house of man loved a looked down upon face two tear formed in eye gradually trickled down old nose dear said if cloud pass away from will come to be daughter thus also pledged there be dash of generosity about man in spite of selfishness always made desirous of giving largely to who gave largely to must fain that gift must be bigger if be possible longed at moment to tell that dirty cheque must go for nothing

when cloud have passed away will come to be daughter will never pas away said grace illustration will never pas away said grace let hope that may let hope that may then stooped over kissed leaving room got out into hall thence into garden so away without saying word of adieu to mr robarts a walked across to court whither be obliged to go because of chaise be lost in surprise at what have occurred have gone to parsonage hating girl despising son now a retraced step feeling be altogether changed admired girl a for son even anger be for moment altogether gone must write to son at once implore to stop sale must tell son have occurred rather must make mr grantly do so in respect to son be quite safe thought at moment that be safe there must be use in hurling further threat at if crawley be found guilty of stealing money there be girl promise if be acquitted there be own pledge remembered perfectly well that girl have said more than that have not confined assurance to verdict of jury that have protested that must not accept major grantly hand a long a people thought that father have stolen cheque archdeacon felt that must be ignoble to hold closely to word event according to idea of compact be to depend upon verdict of jury if jury must find mr crawley not guilty objection on part to marriage be to be withdrawn must keep word in such case must be withdrawn when came to rag of auctioneer bill have before torn down with umbrella stopped moment to consider how must act at once in first place must tell son that threat be withdrawn must ask to remain at cosby lodge must write letter a passed through barchester on way home so that son might receive on following morning must refer major to mother for full explanation of circumstance odious bill must be removed from barn door wall in county at present moment anger against son be chiefly directed against ill judged haste in having put up ill omened poster then paused to consider what must be wish a to verdict of jury have pledged to abide by verdict must not have wish on subject must desire in heart that mr crawley must be found guilty stood still for moment thinking of then walked on shaking head if might be possible must have wish on subject whatsoever well said lady lufton stopping in passage have seen yes have seen well be good girl very good girl be in great hurry hardly know how to tell more now say that be good girl say that be very good girl angel must not have behaved better will tell day lady lufton can hardly tell now when archdeacon be gone old lady lufton confided to young lady lufton very strong opinion that many month must not be gone by before grace crawley must be mistress of cosby lodge will be great promotion said old lady with little toss of head when grace be interrogated afterwards by mr robarts a to what have passed between archdeacon have very little to say a to interview no did not scold replied to inquiry from friend spoke about engagement said mr robarts there be engagement said grace suppose acknowledged dear that future engagement be quite possible told mr robarts grace answered after hesitating for moment must never marry son a long a papa be suspected by one in world of being thief will keep word said nothing to mr robarts of pledge archdeacon have made to chapter lviii cross grainedness of men illustration by time that archdeacon reached plumstead enthusiasm in favour of grace crawley have somewhat cooled language from time to time prepared for conveying impression to wife became le fervid a approached home there be pledge by that must abide so much must make wife son understand idea might have entertained for moment of extending promise have given relaxing that given to be gone before saw own chimney indeed fear have by time begun to feel that only salvation now open to must come from jury verdict if jury must declare mr crawley to be guilty then must not say even to that in such case must be right did feel that much a might regret fate of poor crawleys of girl whom in warmth have declared to be almost angel nevertheless to personally verdict must bring consolatory comfort have seen miss crawley said to wife a soon a have closed door of study before have be two minute out of chaise have determined that must dash at subject at once thus carried resolution into effect have seen grace crawley yes went up to parsonage called upon lady lufton advised to do so henry oh henry have gone be only there one night suppose saw be not sure must not miss crawley tell forgot to ask mr grantly at hearing expressed surprise by opening wide eye have gone way over to framley on purpose to look after son learn what be doings when there have forgotten to ask person who must have given better information than one else doe not signify continued archdeacon said enough to to make of importance what did say said that must never consent to marry henry a long a there be suspicion abroad a to father guilt believe promise certainly do doubt in least put implicit confidence in have promised that if father be acquitted will withdraw opposition have must have done same have be there doubt that dear be not so impulsive a be must not have helped must have felt obliged to be equally generous with came up to put hand upon psha said mr grantly did dear then said ' promise will not become son wife while people think that papa stole money ' what else must do be pretty very pretty very beautiful like lady quite like lady there be mistake about behaved well admirably said archdeacon who be in measure compelled to justify generosity into have be betrayed by feeling then be paragon said mr grantly know what may call paragon dear say that be lady that be extremely good looking that behaved very well can not say le in favour be sure must not say le if have be present must be wonderful young woman know anything about being wonderful must be wonderful when have succeeded with son with father wish have be there instead of said archdeacon angrily mr grantly very probably wished so also feeling that in case more serene mode of business must have be adopted how keenly susceptible archdeacon still be to influence of feminine charm one knew better than mr grantly whenever became aware that have be in way seduced from wisdom of cooler judgment always felt something akin to indignation against seducer a for husband probably told at such moment that be old goose if have be there henry with must have made great deal worse job of than have done said archdeacon say have made bad job of dear said mr grantly be past eight must be terribly in want of dinner have not better go up dress in evening plan of future campaign be arranged between archdeacon must not write to son at in passing through barchester have abandoned idea of despatching note from hotel feeling that note a must be required be not easily written in hurry mr grantly must now write to son telling that circumstance have changed that must be altogether unnecessary for to sell furniture begging to come over see father without day delay wrote letter night read to archdeacon that have written with exception of postscript may be quite sure that there will be unpleasantness with father be postscript be not communicated to archdeacon on third day after henry grantly did come over to plumstead mother in letter to have not explained how have come to pas that sale of furniture must be unnecessary father have given to understand distinctly that income must be withdrawn from unless must express intention of giving up miss crawley have be admitted among cosby lodge must be abandoned if be done certainly must not give up grace crawley sooner than that must give up stick in possession go live in new zealand if be necessary not only have grace conduct to made thus firm natural bent of own disposition have tended that way also father have attempted to dictate to sooner than submit to that must sell coat off back have father confined opposition to advice have miss crawley be le firm in view of duty major might have be le firm also thing have so gone that be determined to be fixed a granite if others must not be moved from resolve neither must such being state of mind must not understand why be thus summoned to plumstead have already written over to pau about house be well that must at rate see mother before started be willing therefore to go to plumstead took step a to withdrawal of auctioneer bill to archdeacon so strongly objected when drove into rectory yard father be standing there before henry said be very glad to see be very much obliged to for coming then henry got out of cart shook hand with father archdeacon began to talk about weather mother have gone into barchester to see grandfather said archdeacon if be not tired might a well take walk want to go up a far a flurry cottage major of course declared that be not at tired that must be delighted of thing to go up see old flurry thus started young grantly have not even be into house before left yard with father of course be thinking of coming sale at cosby lodge of future life at pau of injured position in world there must be no longer occasion for to be solicitous a to plumstead fox of course thing be in mind must not begin to speak of till father did so be afraid grandfather be not very strong said archdeacon shaking head fear wo be with very long be so bad a sir well know be old man henry be always somewhat old for age will be eighty if life two year longer think will never reach eighty never must go see before go back home must indeed major of course promised that must see grandfather archdeacon told son how nearly old man have fallen in passage between cathedral deanery in way have nearly made way up to gamekeeper cottage without word of reference to subject that touched upon matter of of be of course thinking whether major intended to remain at home to live at subject of mr harding health be natural topic for conversation between father when father stopped suddenly began to tell how fox have be trapped on darvell farm of course be plumstead fox there can be doubt that flurry be right about when archdeacon spoke of iniquity with much warmth told son how have at once written off to mr thorne of ullathorne how mr thorne have declared that did believe word of how flurry have produced pad of fox with mark of trap on skin then son began to feel that ground be becoming very warm that must not go on much longer without rushing into detail about grace crawley have more doubt that be one of fox than stand here said archdeacon doe matter where fox be bred must have be trapped said major of course not said archdeacon indignantly wonder whether must have be so keen have romanist priest come into parish turned one of protestant into papist then flurry came up produced identical pad out of pocket suppose be intended said major looking at interesting relic with scrutinizing eye suppose be caught in rabbit trap eh flurry see what right man have with trap at when gentleman be particular about fox said flurry of course 'd call rabbit never liked that man on darvell farm said archdeacon said flurry farmer ought to be on land who have horse of own if war squire thorne must have farmer there who did keep horse when farmer have horse of own folly hound there ai rabbit trap never how doe that come about mr henry rabbit know very well what rabbit be mr henry shook head turned away archdeacon followed there be hypocrisy about pretended care for fox displeased major must not of course tell father that fox be no longer anything to yet must make understood that such be conviction mother have written to saying that sale of furniture need not take place might be very well for mother to say for father after what have taken place must consent to remain in england on other understanding than that income must be made permanent to such permanence must not be longer dependent on father caprice in day have come to be somewhat in love with poverty pau have be feeding on luxury of grievance there be perhaps nothing so pleasant a preparation for self sacrifice to give up cosby lodge fox to marry penniless wife go live at pau on six seven hundred year seemed just now to major grantly to be fine thing did not intend to abandon fine thing without receiving very clear reason for doing so ca quite understand thorne said archdeacon used to be so particular about fox suppose that country gentleman will change idea because have given up hunting mr thorne never thought much of flurry said henry grantly with mind intent upon pau grievance might take word at rate said archdeacon be known fact that archdeacon solicitude about plumstead cover be wholly on behalf of son major major knew thoroughly felt that father present special anxiety be intended a corroboration of tidings conveyed in mother letter word so uttered be meant to have reference to son future residence in country father said turning round shortly standing before archdeacon in pathway think be quite right about cover feel sure that gentleman who preserve fox doe good to country be sorry will not have closer interest in matter why must have closer interest in said archdeacon because will be living abroad got mother letter yes got mother letter did not tell that can stay where be yes said so to tell truth sir like risk of living beyond assured income if justify wish to complain sir have made understand that can in certain circumstance will at moment withdraw what give since be said to have felt to be unsafe in such house a cosby lodge archdeacon did not know how to explain have intended that real explanation must be given by mr grantly have be anxious to return to old relation with son without exact term on own part son be a thought awkward must drive to speech be unnecessary need not be unsafe there at said half angrily must be unsafe if be not sure of income income be not in danger have better speak to mother about for think may say have never yet behaved to of with son must at rate not be offended because father think that be entitled to consideration for what doe there be point on son can not give way even to father sir have better speak to mother henry will explain to what have taken place look at plantation remember tree there be planted since be born bought that farm from old mr thorne when be purchasing st ewold down be first bit of land ever have of own be not in plumstead think be plumstead where stand be in parish run in out here never bought other land a cheap a bought that did old thorne make good purchase at st ewold yes fancy did gave whole of parish be great thing be astonishing how land have risen in value since yet rent be not so very much higher who buy land now ca have above two half for money wonder people be so fond of land said major be comfortable feeling to know that stand on own ground land be about only thing ca fly away then see land give so much more than rent give position influence political power to say nothing about game will go back now daresay mother will be at home by time archdeacon be striving to teach great lesson to son when thus spoke of pleasure man feel when stand upon own ground be bidding son to understand how great be position of heir to landed property how small position of man depending on what dr grantly must have called scratch income income made up of few odds end share two in company share two in slight venture in foreign stock small mortgage such like convenient uninfluential driblet man doubt may live at pau on driblet may pay way drink bottle of cheap wine enjoy life after fashion while reading galignani looking at mountain a seemed to archdeacon when there be choice between kind of thing fox cover at plumstead seat among magistrate of barsetshire establishment full of horse beef swine carriage hayrick man brought up a son have be brought up ought not to be very long in choosing never entered into archdeacon mind that be tempting son henry grantly felt that be having good thing of world shown to that be being told that must be for consideration major in present mood looked at matter from own point of view determined that consideration be too high be pledged not to give up grace crawley must not yield on point though might be tempted by fox cover in barsetshire at moment did not know how far father be prepared to yield how far be expected that must yield be told that have to speak to mother must speak to mother in meantime must not bring to make comfortable answer to father eloquent praise of landed property must not allow to be enthusiastic on matter till knew what be expected of if chose to submit to be made british squire at present galignani mountain have charm for there be therefore little conversation between father son a walked back to rectory late night major heard whole story from mother gradually a though unintentionally mr grantly told knew of archdeacon visit to framley mr grantly be quite a anxious a be husband to keep son at home therefore omitted in story little sneer against grace have be tempted to make by archdeacon fervour in girl favour major said a little a be possible while be being told of father adventure expressed neither anger satisfaction till have be made thoroughly to understand grace have pledged not to marry a long a suspicion must rest upon father name father be quite satisfied with said mr grantly think that be behaving very well father have right to exact pledge made of own accord be first to speak about mr crawley supposed guilt father never mentioned must have led to think have right to do so have right to go to at now be foolish henry see that be foolish yes be man be foolish if wo take what want without asking exactly how be to come by that father must be anxious be most natural thing in world know how high have always held own head how much think about character position of clergyman be not surprising that must dislike idea of such marriage grace crawley must disgrace family said lover be very well for to say will take word that be so that be a far a young lady go there be father almost a much in love with a be know what must have must be left alone what harm have be done from what have told know that miss crawley have said same thing to that have said to father ca admire for feeling admire for everything very well say anything against mean to give up very well again let hope that mr crawley will be acquitted then will be right father never go back from promise be always better than word will find that if mr crawley be acquitted if escape in way father will only be happy of excuse to make much of young lady must not be hard on henry see that be one great desire to keep near to sight of odious bill nearly broke heart then why did threaten henry be obstinate be not obstinate mother yes be remember nothing forget nothing expect everything to be made for will hing towards making thing smooth for anybody else ought to promise to give up sale if worst came to worst father must not let suffer in pocket for yielding to in so much if worst come to worst wish to take nothing from

afterwards with sister called cross grainedness of men be a like other a two pea said though of wished to be generous of must condescend to be just early on following morning there be doubt much said on subject between archdeacon wife before met son at breakfast at breakfast afterwards be there word said between father son have slightest reference to subject in dispute between archdeacon made more

when wished father good by archdeacon shook hand with said something about chance of rain have not better take big umbrella major thanked courteously said that did not think must rain then be gone

may not doubt that m d have interest in j e m d encloses last note received from before started for continent then there be scrap lily well knew to be in handwriting of john eames scrap be a follows dearest m punctually at ever always unalterable j e lily a read did not comprehend that john note to m d have be in joke lily dale have heard of anonymous letter before have never received one even seen one now that have one in hand seemed to that there must be nothing more abominable than writing of such letter let drop from a though receiving opening reading have be stain to a lay on ground at foot trod upon of what sort must woman be who must write such letter a answer of course must not answer never occurred to for moment that must become to answer have be at home with mother must have called mother to mr dale must have taken from ground have read then destroyed a be must pick up did so declared to herself that there must be end to might be right that somebody must see therefore must show to emily dunstable after that must be destroyed of course letter must have effect upon so told did have very strong effect probably exact effect writer have intended that must have j e be of course john eames there be doubt about what fool writer must have be to talk of l d in letter when outside cover be plainly addressed to miss lilian dale there be people for whom pretended mystery of initial letter have charm who love darkness of anonymous letter a lily thought of stamped on letter again who be m d to whom be required to send answer with whom john eames corresponded in most affectionate term have resolved that must not even ask question about m d yet must not divert mind from inquiry be at rate fact that there must be woman designated by letter woman who have at rate chosen to call m d john eames have called m there must at rate be such woman female be who might have thought worth while to make inquiry about john eames have manifestly learned something of lily own history woman have pledged not to interfere with john eames if l d must only condescend to say that be engaged to a lily thought of proposition trod upon letter for third time then picked up having place of custody under lock key ready to hand put in pocket at night before went to bed showed letter to emily dunstable be not surprising that woman must bring to write letter said lily miss dunstable hardly saw in same light if anybody be to write such letter about bernard said must show to a good joke must be very different bernard of course understand other so will mr eames day hope never more than do now dear thing annoys be that woman a must have even heard name at a long a people have got ear tongue people will hear other people name lily paused moment then spoke again asking question suppose woman doe know must know because have written to know something about doubt have reason for wishing that must quarrel with if be must take care not to gratify a for mr eames note be joke be nothing to said lily suppose continued emily that most gentleman become acquainted with people that must not wish friend to know that knew go about so much more than do meet people of sort gentleman must become intimately acquainted with woman who must write letter a said lily a spoke remembered certain episode to john eames early life have reached from source have not doubted have given pain offended have believed that john eames have in case behaved cruelly to young woman have thought that offence have come simply from that feeling of course be nothing to said mr eames can choose friend a like only wish that name might not be mentioned to be not from that have heard perhaps not a said before of course doe not signify only there be something very disagreeable in whole thing idea be so hateful of course woman mean to understand that considers to have claim upon mr eames stand in way why must not stand in way will stand in nobody way mr eames have right to give hand to one plea at rate can have cause of offence against only thing be that do wish that name must be left alone lily when be in own room again did destroy letter before did so read again became so indelibly impressed on memory that must not forget even word of lady who wrote have pledged under certain condition not to interfere with miss l d interfere with lily said to herself nobody can interfere with nobody have power to do so a turned over in mind heart became hard against john eames woman must have troubled to write letter without cause for writing that writer be vulgar false unfeminine lily thought that must perceive from letter doubt woman knew john eames have interest in question of marriage be entitled to answer to question only be not entitled to such answer from lily dale for week past now up to hour at anonymous letter have reached hand lily heart have be growing soft still softer towards john eames now again have become hardened think that appearance of adolphus crosbie in park momentary vision of real man by divinity of imaginary apollo have be dashed to ground have done service to cause of other lover of lover who have never be god who of late year have at rate grown into full dimension of man unfortunately for latter have commenced love making when be little more than boy lily a have thought of two together in day of solitude after have be deserted by crosbie have ever pictured to herself lover whom have preferred a having something godlike in favour a being far superior in wit in manner in acquirement in personal advantage there have be good nature true hearty love on side of other man circumstance have seemed to show that good nature be equal to that be able to share even hearty love among two three man of such character known by girl from boyhood a john eames have be known by lily dale be likely to find more favour a friend than a lover so have be between john eames lily while untrue memory of what crosbie be ever have be be present to must hardly bring to accept in mind idea of lover who be le noble in manhood than false picture that untrue memory be ever painting for then have come before eye actual man though have be seen for moment false image have be broken into shiver lily have discovered that have be deceived that forgiveness have be asked not by god by ordinary human being a regarded ungodlike man must make difference having thought upon matter deeply have resolved that must not marry mr crosbie have pledged to effect to friend who never must have brought to feel affection for even have married shattering of false image might have done john eames good turn lily knew that have at rate full permission from friend to throw in lot with if must persuade to do so mother uncle sister brother in law cousin now new cousin bride be to be together with lady julia whole crowd of allington guestwick friend be in favour of such marriage there have be nothing against fact that other man have be dearer to that other fact that poor johnny lacked something something of earnestness something of manliness something of phoebus divinity with crosbie have contrived to invest own image a have said above john have gradually grown if not into divinity at least into manliness shattering of false image have done be service now have come accursed letter lily despite despite better judgment must not sweep away from mind make letter a nothing to m d have promised not to interfere with there be room for such interference possibility that such interference must take place hoped earnestly so told that old friend john eames might have nothing to do with woman so impudent vulgar a must be m d except a regarded old friendship m d john eames apart together must be a nothing to therefore say that letter

pratt who a will be remembered have dined with other day with outspoken somewhat loud impulse be natural to addressed at once across room calling by name have not done so two men might probably have escaped through room in case must have met bernard dale emily dunstable in doorway fowler pratt must have endeavoured so to escape to carry crosbie with a be quite alive to expedience of saving lily from such meeting a thing turned out escape from mr thorne be impossible there be fowler pratt have said when first entered quite loud enough for fowler pratt to hear mr pratt come here how d 'ye do dined with last tuesday have never be to call never recognize obligation till after middle of may said mr pratt shaking hand with mr thorne mr smith bowing to miss dale see justice of at said mr thorne seems to that good dinner be a much entitled to morsel of pasteboard in april a at other time wo have till have called unless be specially wanted crosbie must have gone on that in attempt to do so passed close by chair on mr harold smith be sitting that be accosted by mr crosbie said have seen for age have come to pas that have buried entirely did not know how to extricate so a to move on at once paused hesitated then stopped made attempt to talk to mr smith a though be at ease attempt be anything successful having once stopped did not know how to put in motion again so that might escape at moment bernard dale emily dunstable came up joined group of have discovered who crosbie be till be close upon lily be seated between mr thorne mr smith siph dunn have be standing immediately opposite to fowler pratt who have be drawn into circle against will be now standing close to dunn almost between lily crosbie be standing within two yard of lily on other side of dunn emily bernard have gone behind pratt crosbie to mr thorne side before have recognized two men in way lily be completely surrounded mr thorne who in spite of eager impetuous way be a thoughtful of others a woman must be a soon a heard crosbie name understood knew that must be well that must withdraw lily from plight crosbie in attempt to talk to mr smith have smiled simpered have then felt that to smile simper before lily dale with pretended indifference to presence be false on part must seem to be mean must have avoided lily for sake have be possible be no longer possible must not keep eye from face hardly knowing what did bowed to lifted hat uttered word of greeting lily from moment that have perceived presence have looked straight before with something almost of fierceness in eye pratt siph dunn have observed narrowly have seemed a though crosbie have be altogether outside ken of eye notice of ear yet have seen motion of body have heard word have fallen from lip now when saluted turned face full upon bowed to then rose from seat made way between siph dunn pratt out of circle blood have mounted to face suffused whole manner be such that must escape observation of none who stood there even mr harold smith have seen have read story a soon a be on foot bernard have dropped emily hand offered arm to cousin lily have said out loud have better let take away be misfortune that have be subjected to insult of such greeting bernard crosbie have be early friend bernard have be unfortunate mean of bringing crosbie lily together up to day bernard have never have revenge for ill treatment cousin have received morsel of revenge came to now lily almost hated cousin for what said took arm walked with from room must be acknowledged in excuse for bernard dale a apology for apparent indiscretion of word that circumstance of meeting have become apparent to one there misfortune of encounter have become too plain to admit of being hidden under of ordinary veil of society crosbie salutation have be made before eye of in midst of absolute silence lily have risen with so queen like demeanour have moved with so stately step that be impossible that one concerned must pretend to ignore fact of scene have occurred crosbie be still standing close to mr harold smith mr thorne have risen from seat word bernard dale have uttered be still sounding in ear of will see after carriage said siph dunn do said mr thorne stay moment carriage will of course be there will go together good morning mr pratt expect that at rate will send card by post then passed on crosbie fowler pratt be left among picture think will agree with now that have better give up said fowler pratt will never give up said crosbie till will hear that have married one else may take word for that will never marry after what have just now occurred very likely not still attempt even idea of attempt will be comfort to will be endeavouring to do ought to have done what have got to think of must suppose be comfort not own crosbie stood for while silent looking at portrait be hung just within doorway of smaller room into have passed a though attention be entirely riveted by picture be thinking of picture not at did not even know what kind of painting be on canvas before pratt said at last be always hard to will say nothing more to on subject if wish to be silent do wish to be silent about that will be enough said pratt quite understand know how thoroughly have repented of evil have done how far must go to make retribution if retribution be possible fowler pratt having be told to hold tongue a regarded that subject made reply to began to talk about picture lily leaning on cousin arm be out in courtyard in front of house before mr thorne siph dunn be for minute still there be minute in bernard felt that ought to say word to hope be not angry with lily for having spoken wish of course that have not spoken be not angry have right to be angry made misfortune for myself say anything more about dear bernard be have walked to picture gallery by agreement two carriage have come to take away mr thorne mr harold smith mr thorne easily managed to send emily dunstable bernard away with friend to tell siph dunn that must manage for in way be contrived that one mr thorne must be with lily dale dear said mr thorne seemed to that be little put out so thought best to send away be very kind ought to have passed on not to have stood instant when saw said mr thorne with indignation there be moment when be man duty simply to vanish to melt into air to sink into ground in be bound to overcome difficulty of such sudden self removal must ever after be accounted poor mean did not want to vanish if only have not spoken to must have vanished man be sometimes bound in honour to do so even when have done nothing wrong when sin have be with woman femininity have still right to expect so much will be done in behalf when sin have be own a be in case such damning sin too pray go on mr thorne ought to go out hang simply for having allowed to be seen thought bernard behaved very well will tell so wish must manage to forget say word more about wo trouble with dear will promise that lily can hardly understand man who must have be must ever be brute mr thorne promised instant that must not talk of after will not must let have way now for one moment have so often longed to speak to have not done so from fear of offending now matter have come up by chance be impossible that what have occurred must pas by without word can not conceive why memory of bad man must be allowed to destroy whole life life be not destroyed life be anything destroyed be very happy life dear if hear be true there be most estimable young man whom everybody like particularly own family whom like very much will have nothing to say to though constancy be like constancy of old paladin because of wretch who just now came in way mr thorne be impossible to explain want to explain of course must not ask young woman to marry man whom did not love such marriage be abominable to think that young woman ought to get married if thing fairly come in way if friend approve if be fond of man who be fond of may be that memory of what have gone before be allowed to stand in way that must not be so allowed sometimes happens that morbid sentiment will destroy life excuse then lily if say too much to in hope that may not suffer after fashion know how kind be mr thorne here be at home perhaps must like to go in have call must make then conversation be ended lily be alone a if have not thought of before a if there be anything new in counsel mr thorne have given have received same advice from mother from sister from uncle from lady julia till be sick of how have come to pas that matter with others be so private must with have become public property of so large circle other girl must receive advice on subject from mother alone there secret must rest secret have be published a be by town crier in high street everybody knew that have be jilted by adolphus crosbie that be intended that must be consoled by john eames people seemed to think that have right to rebuke if expressed unwillingness to carry out intention public have so kindly arranged for morbid sentiment why must be accused of morbid sentiment because be unable to transfer affection to man who have be fixed on a future husband by large circle of acquaintance who have interested in affair there be nothing morbid in desire regret so assured with something very like anger at accusation made against have be contented be contented to live at home a mother lived asking for excitement beyond given by daily routine of duty there must be nothing morbid in must go back to allington a soon a might be have done with london life only made wretched seeing of crosbie have be terrible to did not tell that image have be shattered idea be that misery have come from untowardness of meeting there be fact that have seen man heard voice that seeing hearing have made miserable certainly desired that might never be lot to see to hear again a for john eames in bitter moment of reflection almost wished same in regard to if must only cease to be lover might be very well be not very well to a long a pretension be dinned into ear by everybody who knew then told that john must have have better chance if have be content to plead for in think be hard upon lover have pleaded for a well a knew how a often a occasion have be given to have hardly be fault that case have be taken in hand by other advocate have given commission to mr thorne to plead for poor johnny have stood in much better favour before lady have presented compliment to miss l d be that odious letter thought have forced upon lily mind be now most inimical to interest whether lily loved not did not love well enough not to be jealous of have such letter reached respecting crosbie in happy day of young love must simply have laughed at must have be nothing to now be sore unhappy trifle be powerful enough to irritate be miss l d engaged to marry mr j e said lily out loud lily dale be not engaged to marry john eames never will be so engaged be almost tempted to sit down write required answer to miss m d though letter have be destroyed well remembered number of post office in edgware road poor john eames that evening told emily dunstable that thought must like to return to allington before day have be appointed for why said emily must be worse than word daresay will seem silly fact be be homesick be not accustomed to be away from mamma for so long hope be not what occurred to day at picture gallery wo deny that be that in part be strange accident know that might never occur again have occurred twice already emily call affair in park anything anybody may see anybody else in park of course be not brought so near that must annoy there ought certainly to wait till mr eames have come back from italy then lily declared that must must go back to allington on next monday actually did write letter to mother night to say that such be intention on morrow heart be le sore letter be not sent chapter lx end of jael sisera illustration there be to be one more sitting for picture a reader will remember day for sitting have arrived conway dalrymple have in meantime called at mr van siever house hoping that might be able to see clara make offer to there have failed in attempt to reach have found impossible to say that have to say in painting room during very short interval mr broughton left to man must be allowed to be alone more than fifteen minute with young lady on occasion in offer to hand heart hitherto have never have more than fifteen minute at command then there have be turban have also in meantime called on mr broughton with intention of explaining to that if really intended to favour view in respect to miss van siever ought to give little more liberty for expressing on occasion have seen friend have not be able to go a minutely a have wished into matter be so important to mr broughton have found necessary during meeting to talk almost exclusively about herself own affair conway have said directly saw be so glad have come think must have gone mad if have not seen one who care for be early in morning not much after eleven mr broughton hearing first knock at door then voice have met in hall taken into dining room be anything matter asked oh conway what be have anything gone wrong with dobbs everything have gone wrong with be ruined heaven earth what do mean simply what say must not speak word of know from how do know wait moment sit down there will will sit by conway take hand be not right there so yesterday mr van siever be here need not tell that said to even if must be very harsh cruel saying manner of thing about dobbs how can help if drink have not encouraged a for expensive living have be a ignorant a child have never asked for anything when be married somebody told how much must have to spend be either two thousand three thousand four thousand something like know conway how ignorant be about money that be like child be not true waited for answer dalrymple be obliged to acknowledge that be true yet have known time in dear friend have be very sharp in memory with reference to few pound now say that dobbs owes money can not pay that everything must be sold say that musselboro must have business dobbs must shift for elsewhere do believe that have power to decide that thing will go way that a plea how be to know say so say be because drink doe drink at least be true how can help oh conway what be to do dobbs did not come home at last night sent for thing saying that must stay in city what be to do if come take house sell furniture turn out into street then poor creature began to cry in earnest dalrymple have to console a best might how wish have known first said to dalrymple be able to make direct answer be wise enough to know that direct answer might possibly lead into terrible trouble be by mean anxious to find protecting mr dobbs broughton from ruin husband have brought upon before left have told long story partly of matter of have known something before partly made up of have heard from old woman be settled mr broughton said that mr musselboro be to marry clara van siever appeared a far a dalrymple must learn that be settlement made simply between mr van siever musselboro clara a thought be not girl likely to fall into such settlement without having opinion of own musselboro be to have business dobbs broughton be to be sold up then look for employment in city from husband wife have not heard word on matter above story be simply what have be told to mr broughton by mr van siever for myself seems that there can be one fate said mr broughton dalrymple in tenderest voice asked what that one fate must be never mind said mr broughton there be thing one can not tell even to such friend a be sitting near have got arm behind waist be however able to be prudent maria said getting up on foot if must really come about must want anything will send to will promise that at rate rubbed tear from eye said that did not know there be moment in man must speak plainly said conway dalrymple in must be unmanly not to do so however prosaic may seem need hardly tell that purse will be yours if want just at moment did not want purse must be supposed that wanted to run away with to leave husband to fight battle alone with mr van siever truth be that did not know what wanted over beyond assurance from conway dalrymple that be most ill used most interesting most beautiful woman ever heard of in history romance have proposed to to pack up bundle go off with in cab to london chatham dover railway station en route for boulogne for moment think that must have packed up bundle must have received intense gratification from offer so much so that must have be almost consoled for husband ruin must have scolded lover must have explained to great iniquity of be guilty be clear to at present time must not make special term with a to clara van siever at moment a must hardly ask to keep out of way in order that might have opportunity when suggested that probably might be better in present emergency to give up idea of further sitting in room proposed to send for canvas colour box easel told that a far a be concerned be welcome to have one other sitting for have bargained have better come to morrow a have agreed said unless will have be turned out into street by creditor may have room a did before must remember conway that though mr van say that musselboro be to have clara doe follow clara must give way when consider everything must acknowledge that be at rate good natured then there be tender parting with many tear conway dalrymple escaped from house did not for moment doubt truth of story mr broughton have told a far at least a referred to ruin of dobbs broughton have heard something of before for week have expected that crash be coming broughton rise have be very sudden dalrymple have never regarded friend a firmly placed in commercial world dobbs be one of men who seem born to surprise world by spurt of prosperity might perhaps have have second spurt even third must have kept from drinking in morning dalrymple though be hardly astonished by story a regarded broughton be put out by part of have reference to musselboro have known that musselboro have be introduced to broughton by mr van siever nevertheless have regarded man a being more than broughton clerk now be told that musselboro be to marry clara van siever have mr van siever money resolved at last that must run risk about money take clara with without if must have a for difficulty in asking if mr broughton must give opportunity of putting question behind back must put before face have not much leisure for consideration on point a next day be day for last sitting on following morning found miss van siever already seated in mr broughton room when reached at moment mr broughton be not there a took clara hand must not prevent from asking whether have heard anything heard what said clara then have not said never mind now a mr broughton be here then mr broughton have entered room seemed to be quite cheerful dalrymple perfectly understood from special glance gave to that be to perceive that cheerfulness be assumed for clara benefit mr broughton be showing how great heroine must be on behalf of friend now dear said do remember that be last day may be very well conway of course know best a far a can see have not made half a much progress a ought to have done will do excellently well said dalrymple so much better said mr broughton now clara will place so clara be placed on knee with turban on head dalrymple began work assiduously knowing that mr broughton must not leave room for minute be certain that must remain for quarter of hour might be a well that must really use time on picture peculiar position in be placed probably made work difficult to there be something perplexing in necessity bound to look upon young lady before a jael a future mr conway dalrymple knowing a did that be at present simply clara van siever double personification be not difficult to have encountered with model have sat to with young lady have attempted to win if have ever made attempt with one before triple character joined to necessity of double work be distressing to hand little further back if mind said wrist more turned towards be just lean little more over there will do exactly if mr broughton did not go very quickly must begin to address model on totally different subject even while be in act of slaying sisera have made up mind who be to be sisera asked mr broughton think will put in own face said dalrymple if miss van siever doe not object not in least said clara speaking without moving face almost without moving lip will be excellent said mr broughton be still quite cheerful really laughed a spoke will like idea clara of striking nail right through head oh yes a well head a will seem to be having revenge for trouble have given there be slight pause then dalrymple spoke have have that already in striking right through heart what very pretty speech be not dear said mr broughton then mr broughton laughed there be something slightly hysterical in laugh grated on dalrymple ear something seemed to tell at present moment dear friend be not going to assist honestly in effort only must put out must get up make curtsey said clara young lady must ever talk of making curtsey for speech if supposed to have be made in earnestness clara doubt understood that man might make hundred such speech in presence of third person without danger that must be taken a meaning anything dalrymple knew began to think that have better put down palette brush do work have before in most prosaic language that must use must at rate succeed in making clara acknowledge intention in way waited still for minute two seemed to that mr broughton have intention of piling fagot on present occasion might be that remembrance of husband ruin prevented from sacrificing in other direction also be not very good at pretty speech be good at telling truth said dalrymple have have have laughed mr broughton still with touch of hysterical action in throat upon word conway know how to praise dispraise most unnecessarily in denying prettiness of language said clara a spoke hardly moved lip dalrymple went on painting from model be clear that miss van siever understood that painting not pretty speech be important business on hand mr broughton have now tucked foot up on sofa be gazing at artist a stood at work dalrymple remembering how have offered purse offer in existing crisis of affair might mean great deal felt that be ill natured have intended to do good turn must have gone now there lay with foot tucked up clearly purposing to be present through whole of morning sitting anger against added something to spirit made determine that must carry out purpose suddenly therefore prepared for action be in habit of working with turkish cap on head with short apron tied round there be something picturesque about cap might not have be incongruous with love making be easy to suppose that juan wore turkish cap when sat with haidee in lambro island may be quite sure that did not wear apron now dalrymple have thought of have made up mind to work to day without apron when arranging easel brush have put on from force of habit be now disgusted with a remembered put down brush divested thumb of palette then took off cap after untied apron conway what be going to do said mr broughton be going to ask clara van siever to be wife said dalrymple at moment door be opened mr van siever entered room clara have not risen from kneeling posture when dalrymple began to put off trapping have not seen what be doing a plainly a mr broughton have done having attention naturally drawn towards sisera besides understood that be to remain a be placed till order to move be given to dalrymple must occasionally step aside from easel to look at in altered light on such occasion must simply hold hammer somewhat more tightly than before when therefore mr van siever entered room clara be still slaying sisera in spite of artist speech speech indeed mother seemed to come to at same time old woman stood for moment holding open door in hand fool said what be doing there dressed up in way like guy then clara got up from foot stood before mother in jael dress jael turban dalrymple thought that dress turban did not become badly mr van siever apparently thought otherwise will have goodness to tell miss why be dressed up after mad be of bedlam fashion reader will doubt bear in mind that clara have other word of to think besides be addressed to by mother dalrymple have asked to be wife in plainest possible language thought that very plainness of language became well very taking off of apron almost a said word though to action have be so distressing a almost to overcome purpose have in something to of direct simple determination pleased when have spoken of having have nail driven by right through heart have not be in least gratified taking off of apron putting down of palette downright way in have called clara van siever attempting to be neither sentimental with clara polite with miss van siever did please have often said to herself that must never give plain answer to man who did not ask plain question to man who in asking question did not say plainly to clara van siever will become mr jones mr smith mr tomkins a case might be now conway dalrymple have asked to become mr dalrymple very much after fashion in spite of apparition of mother have passed through mind not le however be obliged to answer mother before must give reply to other questioner in meantime mr dobbs broughton have untucked foot mamma said clara who ever expected to see here daresay nobody did said mr van siever here be nevertheless madam said mr dobbs broughton might at rate have gone through ceremony of having announced by servant madam said old woman attempting to mimic tone of other thought on very particular occasion a might be allowed to announce tomfool why take that turban off then clara with slow graceful motion unwound turban if dalrymple really meant what have said must stick to need not mind being called tomfool by mother conway be afraid that last sitting be disturbed said mr broughton with little laugh conway last sitting certainly be disturbed said mr van siever then mimicked laugh will all be disturbed can tell that what as must be to go on with kind of thing after what said to yesterday do know that got beastly drunk in city last night that be drunk now while be going on with tomfoolery upon hearing mr dobbs broughton fainted into dalrymple arm hitherto artist have not said word have hardly known what part must best become now to play if intended to marry clara certainly did intend to marry if must have might be a well not to quarrel with mr van siever at rate there be nothing in mr van siever intrusion disagreeable a be need make take up sword to do battle with now a held mr broughton in arm a horrid word old woman have spoken rung in ear must not refrain from uttering reproach ought not to have told in way before other people even if be true said conway leave to be own judge of what ought to do if please sir if have feeling at what told yesterday must have kept from people have feeling will go on being tomfool though house be on fire a word be spoken mr broughton fainted more persistently than ever so that dalrymple be convinced that whether felt not at rate heard have now dragged across room laid upon sofa clara have come to assistance daresay think very hard because speak plainly there be thing much harder than plain speaking how much do expect to be paid sir for picture of girl expect to be paid for at said dalrymple who be to belong to belongs to at present then sir must belong to longer wo do for to have picture of girl to hang up in painting room for friend to come make joke about yet to make show of in of exhibition daughter have be fool ca help if will tell be cost will pay then will have picture home will treat a deserves dalrymple thought for moment about picture about mr van siever what have better do wanted to behave well felt that old woman have something of justice on side madam said will not sell picture will be destroyed if wish certainly do wish wo trust to if be not sent to house at once will hear from through lawyer then dalrymple deliberately opened penknife slit canvas across through middle of picture way clara a saw do felt that in truth loved there mr van siever said now can take bit home with in basket if wish at moment a rent canvas fell fluttered upon stretcher there came loud voice of lamentation from sofa groan of despair shriek of wrath very fine indeed said mr van siever when lady faint always ought to have eye about see that mr broughton understands that take away conway for god sake take away said mr broughton will take away very shortly said mr van siever so need trouble mr conway about not what thought gentleman name be mr something else name be conway dalrymple said artist then suppose must be brother cousin something of sort said mr van siever take away screamed mr dobbs broughton wait moment madam a have chopped up handiwork there mr conway dalrymple a suppose daughter have be more to blame than anybody else have not be to blame at said dalrymple affair not yours said mr van siever very sharply a have be at trouble have now chopped up mind paying for time paint only will be glad to know how much will come to there will be nothing to pay mr van siever how long have be at clara mamma indeed have better not say anything about paying will say please miss will ten pound do sir if choose to buy picture price will be seven hundred fifty said dalrymple with smile pointing to fragment seven hundred fifty pound said old woman strongly advise not to make purchase said dalrymple seven hundred fifty pound certainly will not give seven hundred fifty pound sir certainly think must invest money better mr van siever if thing be to be sold at be price have thought that there be justice in demand that must be destroyed therefore have destroyed mr van siever have be standing on same spot ever since have entered room now turned round to leave room if have demand to make beg that will send in account for work done to mr musselboro be man of business clara be ready to come home cab be waiting at door at sixpence quarter of hour if will be pleased to remember mr broughton said clara thoughtful of raiment remembering that might not be well that must return home even in cab dressed a jael if will allow will go into room for minute two certainly clara said mr broughton preparing to accompany before go mr broughton said mr van siever may be a well that must tell that daughter be going to become wife of mr musselboro may simplify matter that must know mr van siever a spoke looked hard at conway dalrymple mamma exclaimed clara dear said mr van siever have better change dress come away with not till have protested against what have said mamma have better leave protesting alone can tell mr broughton continued clara must beg to understand mamma have not slightest right in world to tell what just now said about nothing on earth must induce to become wife of mr broughton partner there be something made clara unwilling even to name man whom mother have publicly proposed a future husband be mr broughton partner said mr van siever mr broughton have not got partner mr musselboro be head of firm a to marrying of course ca make mamma can not mr broughton understands that doubt so probably doe mr dalrymple only tell be idea if choose to marry sweep at crossing ca help only see what good must do sweep when must have to sweep for too at rate suppose mean to go home with now then mr broughton clara left room mr van siever be left with conway dalrymple mr dalrymple said mr van siever deceive what told just now will certainly come to pas seems to that must depend on young lady said dalrymple will tell what certainly will not depend on young lady said mr van siever be whether man who marries will have more with than clothes stand up in will understand argument suppose be not quite sure that do said dalrymple then 'd better try to understand good morning sir be sorry have have to slit picture then curtseyed low walked out on to landing place clara cried be waiting for sixpence quarter of hour remember that in minute two clara came out to then mr van siever miss van siever took departure oh conway what be to do what be to do said mr dobbs broughton dalrymple stood perplexed for few minute must not tell what be to do be in such position that be very hard to tell what to do do believe conway that be really ruined what be to say how be to know see that believe said wretched woman can not believe that there be something of truth in what woman say why else must come here with such story then there be pause during mr broughton be burying face on arm of sofa will tell what will do continued will go into city make inquiry can hardly be what will learn truth there then there be pause at end of mr broughton got up from sofa tell said what do mean to do about girl heard ask to be wife did did be not what intended ask mind be bewildered brain be on fire oh conway will go into city a proposed said dalrymple who felt that might at rate improve position of circumstance by leaving house yes yes go into city go anywhere go stay oh conway there be sudden change in voice a spoke hark there be a sure a life then conway listened heard footstep on stair a to have then little doubt that be footstep of dobbs broughton o heaven be tipsy exclaimed mr broughton what will do then dalrymple took hand pressed left room so that might meet husband on stair in one moment that have for reflection thought be better that there must be concealment chapter lxi be dogged a doe in accordance with resolution to clerical commission have come on first day of sitting dr tempest wrote following letter to mr crawley rectory silverbridge april dear sir have be given to understand that have be informed that bishop of barchester have appointed commission of clergyman of diocese to make inquiry respecting certain accusation to great regret of have be made against in respect to cheque for twenty pound be passed by to tradesman in town clergyman appointed to form commission be mr oriel rector of greshamsbury mr robarts vicar of framley mr quiverful warden of hiram hospital at barchester mr thumble clergyman established in city held first meeting on last monday now write to in compliance with resolution to then came before taking other step thought best to ask to attend here on next monday at two o'clock beg that will accept letter a invitation to effect be of course aware that be about to stand trial at next assize for offence in question beg to understand express opinion a to guilt think right to point out to that in event of jury finding adverse verdict bishop might be placed in great difficulty unless be fortified with opinion of commission formed from fellow clerical labourer in diocese must such adverse verdict unfortunately be given bishop must hardly be justified in allowing clergyman placed a then must be placed to return to cure after expiration of such punishment a judge might award without further decision from ecclesiastical court decision must only obtain by proceeding against under act in reference to clerical offence empowers a bishop of diocese to bring before court of arch unless must think well to submit entirely to judgment will think understand what mean judge at assize might find duty to imprison clergyman for month regarding that clergyman simply a must regard other person found guilty by jury thus made subject to judgment might do for offence ecclesiastical judge must find obliged to visit with severer sentence of prolonged suspension even with deprivation be however clearly of opinion must jury find able to acquit further action whatsoever must be taken in such case think that bishop may regard innocence to be fully established in such case will recommend lordship to look upon matter a altogether at end can assure that in such case will so regard will perceive that a consequence of resolution to have already come be not minded to make inquiry ourselves into circumstance of alleged guilt till verdict of jury will be given if be acquitted course will be clear must be convicted must in case advise bishop to take proceeding to have alluded to abstain from taking wish to ask whether now that opinion have be conveyed to will be willing to submit to bishop decision in event of adverse verdict being given by jury think that will be better for that must meet here at hour have named on monday next th instant be not intention to make report to bishop until trial will be have honour to be dear sir very obedient servant mortimer tempest rev josiah crawley hogglestock in same envelope dr tempest sent short private note in said that must be very happy to see mr crawley at past one on monday named that luncheon must be ready at hour that a mr crawley attendance be required on public ground must take care that carriage be provided for day mr crawley received letter in wife presence read in silence mr crawley saw that paid close attention to be sure felt that be sure that referred in way to terrible subject of cheque for twenty pound indeed everything came into house almost word spoken there thought came into breast of of family have more le reference to coming trial how must be otherwise there be ruin coming on ruin complete disgrace coming on father mother child to have be accused be very bad now seemed to be opinion of one that verdict must be against man mr crawley who be perfectly sure of husband innocence before god believed that jury must find guilty believed also that have become possessed of money in manner must have be dishonest have not be so different from other people a to be entitled to be considered innocent where man must have be plainly guilty be full of cheque for twenty pound of result when therefore have read letter through second time even then have spoken no word about of course must not refrain from questioning love said what be letter be on business answered be silent for moment before spoke again may not know business said not at present be from bishop have not answered have not given to understand for while at least must prefer to keep content of epistle to myself then looked at very sternly afterwards turned eye upon fireplace gazed at fire a though be striving to read there something of future fate did not much regard severity of speech that too like taking of cheque be to be forgiven because be different from other men black mood have come upon everything be to be forgiven now be a child when cutting teeth let poor wayward sufferer be ever so petulant mother simply pity love be never angry beg pardon josiah said thought must comfort to speak to about will not comfort said nothing comfort nothing can comfort jane give hat stick daughter brought to hat stick without word went out left a matter of course turned step towards hoggle end when desired to be long absent from house always went among brickmakers wife a stood at window watched direction in went knew that might be away for hour only friend out of own family with whom ever spoke freely be of rough parishioner be not thinking of brickmakers when started be simply desirous of again reading dr tempest letter of considering in spot where eye must see walked away with long step regarding nothing rut in dirty lane young primrose be fast showing on bank gathering cloud might have told of coming rain went on for couple of mile till have nearly reached outskirt of colony of hoggle end then sat down upon gate have not be there minute before few slow large drop began to fall be altogether too much wrapped up in thought to regard rain what answer must make to letter from man at position of own mind in reference to own guilt own innocence be very singular be simply truth that did not know how cheque have come to did know that have blundered about most egregiously especially when have averred that cheque for twenty pound have be identical with cheque for sum have be given to by mr soames have blundered since in saying that dean have given to there must be no doubt a to for dean have denied that have done so have come to think very possible that have indeed picked cheque up have afterwards used having deposited by strange accident not knowing then what be doing be nature of bit of paper in hand with note have accepted from dean with so much reluctance with agony of spirit in thought of own about own doings own position almost admitted to own insanity inability to manage own affair with degree of rational sequence be taken for granted a belonging to man when be made subject to criminal law a puzzled brain in effort to create memory a to cheque succeeded in bringing to mind recollection that have once known something about cheque that cheque have at one time be subject of thought of resolution admitted to that in accordance with law reason must be regarded a thief have taken used spent that ought to have known be not own must have known not to be own for terrible incapacity with god have afflicted what then must be result mind be clear enough about if jury must see everything know everything a must wish that must do if bishop commission bishop court of arch with judge must see know everything if so seeing so knowing must act with clear honesty perfect wisdom what must do must declare of that be not thief only because be so muddy minded so addle pated a not to know difference between meum tuum there must be other end to let lawyer clergyman in england put wit to though knew to be muddy minded addle pated must see must one say of such man that be fit to be acting clergyman of parish to have freehold possession in parish a curer of men soul bishop be in right of let be ten time a mean fellow a be yet a sat there on gate while rain came down heavily upon even when admitting justice of bishop truth of verdict jury must no doubt give propriety of action that cold reasonable prosperous man at silverbridge must take pitied with tenderness of commiseration knew bound a for belonging to wife child pity for be of different kind must have suffered increase of suffering must by such agony have released dearly a loved must have severed from have be possible terrible thought a to fate have come into mind in worst moment of moodiness thought have have sufficient strength manliness to put away from with strong hand lest must drive to crime indeed have come from great pity have felt for commiseration have felt for have be different from have mostly visited at time when other pity be for moment in abeyance what though have taken cheque spent money though be not might be guilty before law be not guilty before god there have never be thought of theft in mind desire to steal in heart knew that well enough jury must make guilty of theft before god what though mixture of guilt innocence have come from madness from madness court must recognize if chose to find innocent of crime in spite of aberration of intellect if there be such ministration in parish be good have not preached fervently well preaching true gospel have not be very diligent among people striving with might to lessen ignorance of ignorant to gild with godliness learning of instructed have not be patient enduring instant in thing amenable to law regulation laid down by church for guidance in duty a parish clergyman who must point out in what have be astray where have gone amiss for work have done with so much zeal church served have paid so miserable pittance that though life soul have be kept together reason fragment of reason have at moment escaped from keeping in scramble hence be that terrible calamity have fallen upon who have be tried a have be tried have gone through such fire with le loss of intellectual power than have done be still

problem in trigonometry be pleasing relaxation of mind complication of figure be delight to there be not one of prosperous clergyman around who scorned whom must not have instructed in hebrew be always gratification to to remember that old friend dean be weak in hebrew with acquirement with fitness have be thrust down to ground to very granite because in harsh heartless thrusting intellect have for moment wavered a to common thing cleaving still to grander nobler possession be now to be rent in piece scattered to wind a being altogether vile worthless worse than worthless be thus that thought of pitying a sat upon gate while rain fell ruthlessly on shoulder pitied with commiseration be sickly in spite of truth be fault of man that be imbued too strongly with self consciousness must do great thing two must keep up courage in position must wash courage out of most men must tell truth though truth must ruin must sacrifice that have to duty must do justice though heaven must fall must not forget to pay tribute to for greatness of own action when accepting with effort of meekness small payment made by world to in return for great work must forget great payment made to others for small work be not sufficient for to remember that knew hebrew must remember also that dean did not nevertheless a sat there under rain made up mind with clearness that certainly have in nothing of muddiness of mind of have often accused indeed intellect of man be essentially clear be simply memory must play trick memory a to thing at moment be not important to fact that dean have given money be very important remembered well amount of money form at moment in have flattered that might have strength to leave unused have not be important to now resolved that must go to dr tempest that must tell dr tempest that there be occasion for further inquiry must submit to bishop let bishop decision be what might thing be different since day on have refused mr thumble admission to pulpit at time people believed to be innocent so believed of now people believed to be guilty must not be right that man held in such slight esteem must exercise function of parish priest let own opinion of be what might

in hating dr tempest because door have be opened by man servant dressed in black have man be in livery must have hated dr tempest same must have hated little have door be opened even by smart maid letter came to hand yesterday morning dr tempest said mr crawley still standing though doctor have pointed to chair for after shaking hand with having given yesterday to consideration of with what judgment have be able to exercise have felt to be incumbent upon to wait upon without further delay a by doing so may perhaps assist view save labour to gentleman who be joined with in commission of have spoken to of may possibly be troublesome that must be brought together here on next monday dr tempest have be looking at during speech must see by shoe trowsers that have walked from hogglestock to silverbridge mr crawley will not sit down said then rang bell mr crawley sat down not on chair indicated on one further removed at other side of table when servant came objectionable butler in black clothes be so much smarter than mr crawley own master order be communicated without audible word man returned with decanter wine glass after walk mr crawley said dr tempest getting up from seat

begin mr crawley did eat biscuit did drink wine a did so acknowledged to that dr tempest be right felt that wine made stronger to speak hardly know why have preferred to day to next monday said dr tempest if anything can be done by presence here to day time will not be thrown away have preferred to day to monday said crawley partly because must sooner talk to one man than to five there be something in certainly said dr tempest a have made up mind a to course of action be duty to take in matter to letter of th of month refers there can be reason why must postpone declaration of purpose dr tempest have determined to resign preferment at hogglestock will write to day to dean of barchester who be patron acquainting of purpose mean in event in event mean sir to do without reference to event be future bishop dr tempest when will have be proved to be thief will have trouble either in causing suspension deprivation name fame of parish clergyman must be unstained mine have become foul with infamy will not wait to be deprived by court by bishop by commission will bow head to public opinion have reached will deprive have got up from chair be standing a pronounced final sentence against dr tempest still remained seated in chair looking at for few moment there be silence must not do mr crawley dr tempest said at last will do then dean must not take resignation speaking to frankly tell that there be prevailing opinion a to verdict jury may give decision have nothing to do with jury verdict decision stop moment mr crawley be possible that might say that must not be said there be nothing to be said nothing must say must not say at town cross if be possible a to money know whether stole whether did not be just what have thought be so then did not steal there can be doubt about thank dr tempest thank heartily for saying so much sir be not jury if be must whitewash from infamy have be cast on against opinion expressed at beginning of proceeding by bishop of diocese rather against expressed by wife did venture to make stand opinion came from palace vehicle by be expressed commanded respect since others have spoken to whom feel bound to yield not least among dr tempest to will yield may tell bishop of barchester that will at once resign perpetual curacy of hogglestock into hand of dean of barchester by whom be appointed mr crawley will not do can not control thinking to be wrong will not make communication to bishop then will do so wife mr crawley child at moment mr crawley called to mind advice of friend giles hoggett be dogged a doe certainly wanted something very strong to sustain in difficulty found that reference to wife child required to be dogged in very marked manner can only trust that wind may be tempered to said will indeed be shorn lamb dr tempest got up from chair took couple of turn about room before spoke again man said addressing mr crawley with energy if do thing will then at least be very wicked if jury find verdict in favour be safe chance be that verdict will be in favour care nothing now for verdict said mr crawley will turn wife into poorhouse for idea be dogged a doe said mr crawley to have thought of that said aloud that wife be dear to that child be dear will not deny be softly nurtured dr tempest came from house in want be never known since have shared board have have experience of nature must have brought to be very terrible to so terrible that often wonder how be that live sir will agree with that duty a clergyman be above everything dare even for sake to remain in parish good morning dr tempest dr tempest finding that must not prevail with bade adieu feeling that service to crawleys within power might be best done by intercession with bishop with dean then mr crawley walked back to hogglestock repeating to giles hoggett word be dogged a doe chapter lxii mr crawley letter to dean illustration mr crawley when got home after walk to silverbridge denied that be at tired man at silverbridge whom went to see administered refreshment to nay administered with salutary violence said affecting even to laugh be bound to speak well of on behalf of mercy over beyond exhibited by persistent tender of wine must find judicious have expected what little have known of taught so to think of found with also softness of heart for have not looked will not give up living josiah most certainly will duty when be clear before man must never be made le so by tenderness in others be still thinking of giles hoggett be dogged a doe poor woman must not answer knew well that be vain to argue with must only hope that in event of being acquitted at trial dean whose friendship did not doubt might re endow with small benefice be only source of bread on following morning there came by post short note from dr tempest dear mr crawley note ran implore if there be yet time to hing rashly even although must have written to bishop to dean letter need have effect if will allow to make inoperative permit to say that be man much older than one who have mixed much with clergyman with world at large tell with absolute confidence that be not duty in present position to give up living must conduct ever be called in question on matter will be at perfect liberty to say that be guided by advice must take step till after trial then if verdict be against must submit to bishop judgment if verdict be in favour bishop interference will be over must remember that if be not duty a clergyman to give up living can have right seeing that have wife family to throw away a indulgence to pride consult other friend please mr robarts dean be quite sure that friend who know a many of circumstance a know will advise to hold living at rate till after trial can refer such friend to believe to be yours very truly mortimer tempest mr crawley walked about again with letter in pocket on occasion did not go in direction of hoggle end from hoggle end must hardly hope to pick up further lesson of wisdom what must giles hoggett say to beyond what have said to already if be to read doctor letter to hoggett to succeed in making hoggett understand hoggett must only caution to be dogged seemed to that hoggett new friend at silverbridge did not agree in doctrine might be well that must endeavour to find out of have most of justice on side be quite sure that hoggett must advise to adhere to project of giving up living if only hoggett must be made to understand circumstance have written have not a yet sent away letter to dean letter to bishop must be note have postponed writing of till other must be copied made complete have sat up late into night composing altering letter to old friend now that composition be finished be loth to throw away early in morning before postman have brought to dr tempest urgent remonstrance have shown to wife draught of letter to dean can not say that be not true have said be certainly true wish dear must not send why must take step till trial be over will assuredly send have replied if will peruse again will see that epistle must be futile be kept till will have be proved to be thief oh josiah such word kill be not pleasant will be well that must become used to a for letter have taken trouble to express with perspicuity trust may have succeeded at time hoggett be altogether in ascendant now a started on walk mind be somewhat perturbed by contrary advice of one who after might be a wise a hoggett there must be nothing dogged in conduct recommended to by dr tempest be to follow doctor advice must be trimming sail so a to catch slant of breeze might be favourable to there must be doggedness in character must submit to such trimming postman came to hogglestock once in day so that must not despatch letter till next morning unless indeed chose to send distance of four mile to nearest post office a there be nothing to justify there be night for copying of letter must at last determine to send have declared to dr tempest that must send have sworn to wife that must go have taken much trouble with believed in hoggett nevertheless incumbency of hogglestock be in world might be that must still hold have bread at least for wife to eat dr tempest have told that must be probably acquitted dr tempest knew a much of circumstance a did have told that be not guilty after dr tempest knew more about than hoggett knew if resigned living what must become of of of of wife whither must first go when turned back upon door inside there have at rate be shelter for for many year calculated everything that have found that at end of april even when must have received rent charge there must not be five pound in hand among a for furniture still owed enough to make impossible that must get anything out of thought have reference to position if must be acquitted what must become of wife if must be convicted a for whither must go when came out of prison have completely realized idea that hoggett counsel be opposed to given to by dr tempest then might certainly be case hoggett have not known fact man must doubt be dogged when evil of life be insuperable need be so when evil can be overcome must not hoggett undergo treatment believed to be specific for rheumatism yes hoggett must undergo treatment be not in opposed to duty best treatment for rheumatism might be to stay away from brick field on rainy day if so there must be money to keep pot boiling hoggett must certainly go to brick field rheumatism a long a limb must carry there yes must send letter be duty must do men looked askance at pointed at a thief must send letter in spite of dr tempest let justice be done though heaven may fall have heard of lady lufton offer to wife offer of lady luftons of world have be sorely distressing to spirit since have first come to pas that such offer have reached in consequence of poverty now there be something almost of relief to in thought that lady luftons must after fashion save wife child from starvation must save wife from poorhouse enable child to have start in world for one of child brilliant marriage might be provided if only be out of way how must take out of way have be whispered to that might be imprisoned for two month for two year must not be grand thing if judge must condemn to be imprisoned for life be there ever man whose existence be so purposeless so useless so deleterious a own yet knew hebrew well whereas dean knew very little hebrew must make greek iambic doubted whether bishop knew difference between iambus trochee must disport with trigonometry feeling confident that dr tempest have forgotten way over ass bridge knew lycidas by heart a for thumble felt quite sure that thumble be incompetent of understanding single allusion in divine poem nevertheless though wealth of acquirement be must be better for better for who belonged to better for world at large that must be put end to sentence of penal servitude for life without trial must be of thing most desirable then there must be ample room for practice of virtue hoggett have taught when returned home hoggethan doctrine prevailed prepared to copy letter before commenced task sat down with youngest daughter read made read to passage out of greek poem in be described trouble agony of blind giant giant must have be more powerful only that be blind must not see to avenge on who have injured same story be always coming up said stopping girl in reading have in various version because be so true to life ask for great deliverer now find eyeless in gaza at mill with slave be same story great power reduced to impotence great glory to misery by hand of fate necessity a greek called goddess will not be shunned at mill with slave people when read appreciate horror of picture go on dear may be question whether polyphemus have mind enough to suffer from description of power must think that have mill with slave can picture be more dreadful than go on dear of course remember be samson agonistes agonistes indeed wife be sitting stitching at other side of room heard word heard understood before jane must again get into swing of greek verse be over at husband side with arm round neck love said love turned to smiled a spoke to be old thought with polyphemus belisarius samson milton have always be pet of mine mind of strong blind creature must be so sensible of injury have be done to impotency combined with strength rather impotency with memory of former strength former aspiration be so essentially tragic looked into eye a spoke there be something of flash of old day when world be young to when must tell of hope repeat to long passage of poetry must criticize for advantage work of old writer thank god said that be not blind may yet be right with yes may be said will not be at mill with slave at rate not eyeless in gaza if lord be good to come jane will go on then took up passage read on with clear sonorous voice now then explaining passage expressing own idea upon a though be really happy with poetry be late in evening before got out small stock of best letter paper sat down to work at letter first addressed to bishop what wrote to bishop be a follows hogglestock parsonage april llth lord bishop have be in communication with dr tempest of silverbridge from whom have learned that lordship have be pleased to appoint commission of inquiry of commission be chairman with reference to proceeding may be necessary that must take a bishop of diocese after forthcoming trial at approaching barchester assize lord think right to inform partly with view to comfort of gentleman named on commission partly with purport of giving that information think that bishop must posse in regard to clerical affair of own diocese have by post resigned preferment at hogglestock into hand of dean of barchester by whom be given to in circumstance will suppose be unnecessary for to continue commission have set in force a to lordship will of course be only judge have honour to be lord bishop most obedient very humble servant josiah crawley perpetual curate of hogglestock right reverend bishop of barchester c c c palace barchester letter be of real importance be intended to say something be that to dean that also will be given to reader mr crawley have be for while in doubt how must address old friend in commencing letter understanding that tone throughout must in great degree be made conformable with first word must fain in pride have begun question be between dear arabin have once between always be dear frank dear joe occasion for dear frank dear joe between have long be past crawley must have be very angry have now be called joe by dean must have bitten tongue out before must have called dean frank better nature however now prevailed began letter completed a follows dear arabin circumstance of have probably heard something compel to write to a fear at length be sorry that trouble of such letter must be forced upon during holiday mr crawley a wrote did not forget to remind that never have holiday think will admit if will bear with to end have alternative have be accused of stealing cheque for twenty pound cheque be drawn by lord lufton on london banker be lost out of pocket by mr soames lordship agent be so lost a mr soames state not with absolute assertion during visit made to parsonage here at hogglestock of fact paid cheque to tradesman in silverbridge there be doubt when questioned about first gave answer be so manifestly incorrect that have seemed odd to must not have have credit for mistake from who must have seen detection be so evident blunder be undoubtedly stupid now bear heavy on then a have learned made error of be aware that have be informed said that cheque have come to from in saying so thought that have formed portion of alms open handed benevolence bestowed upon when attended on not long before departure in library have striven to remember fact may be nay probably be case that such struggle to catch accurate glimpse of bygone thing trouble mind be doubt clearer stronger than mine having be kept to proper tune by greater fitter work with memory be gone power of thinking be on wane struggled to remember thought that cheque have be in envelope handed to said so have since learned from tidings received a be told direct from yourself be a wrong in second statement a have be in first double blunder have of course be very heavy on be taken before magistrate at silverbridge be by committed to stand trial at assize to be holden in barchester on th of month without doubt magistrate have alternative to commit be indebted to that have allowed present liberty upon bail that suffering in must have be grievous will understand on head must not touch be not that be bound to explain to that trouble in reference to parish of hogglestock to be appointed by have not be slightest of suffering felt at first believing then that world around must think unlikely that one a have wilfully stolen sum of money that be duty to maintain in church did so maintain against attack made upon by bishop who sent over to hogglestock one mr thumble gentleman doubtless in holy order though know nothing can learn nothing of place of cure to dispossess of pulpit to remove from ministration among people to mr thumble turned deaf ear must not let so much a open mouth inside porch of church up to time have read service have preached to people have continued a best must visit to poor labour in school though know one know a well how unfitted be for such work by grief have fallen upon then bishop sent for thought becoming on part to go to presented to lordship at palace be minded to be much governed in conduct by what might say to remembering that be bound to respect office even though may not approve man humbled before lordship waiting patiently for direction in discretion might think proper to bestow on there arose up between very pestilent woman wife to dismay seemingly a much a to mine must let there be place for speech own if there be aught clear to in ecclesiastical matter be that authority can be delegated to female special law of of other country do allow that woman will sit upon temporal throne of earth on lowest step of throne of church woman have be allowed to sit a bearing authority romantic tale of woman pope notwithstanding thereupon left palace in wrath feeling aggrieved that woman must have attempted to dictate to finding hopeless to get clear instruction from lordship woman taking up word whenever put question to lord bishop nothing therefore came of interview fruitless labour to myself anger of have since be ashamed since time have continued in parish working not without zeal though in truth almost without hope learning even from day to day that opinion of men around have declared to be guilty of crime imputed to now bishop have issued commission a preparatory to proceeding against under act for punishment of clerical offence in doing can not say that bishop have be ill advised even though advice may have come from evil tongued lady wife hold that woman may be called on for advice with most salutary effect in affair a to show of female authority must be equally false pernicious with have ever be so have have counsellor by a wise a have be devoted must be noticed that in draught copy of letter mr crawley gave to wife to read last sentence be not inserted intending that must read letter omitted till made fair copy over commission lordship have appointed dr tempest of silverbridge to preside with have be in communication trust that labour of gentleman of whom be composed may be brought to speedy close having regard to trouble in matter be fear left without remuneration have informed dr tempest must write letter to with intent assured purpose of resigning perpetual curacy of hogglestock into hand will be good enough therefore to understand do so resign living that will continue to administer service of church only till clergyman certified to a coming from from bishop may present in parish will declare prepared to undertake cure must be so that mr thumble be sent hither again will sit under endeavouring to catch improvement from teaching striving to overcome contempt felt for when before visited parish annex beneath signature copy of letter have written to bishop on subject now behoves a guardianship of soul of around be placed in hand by to explain to a shortly a may be possible reason have induced to abandon work one two whose judgment discredit be allowed to name dr tempest of silverbridge a one have suggested to must take step till after trial think must have regard to chance of verdict so that preferment may still be mine must be acquitted say must be acquitted bishop action against must of necessity cease that be right in fact doubt in giving such advice look only to fact having regard to conscience blame must give such advice knowing that friend may give counsel a to outer thing that man must satisfy inner conscience by own perception of what be right what be wrong find to be ill spoken of to be regarded with hard eye by around people thinking have stolen money two farmer in parish have a be aware expressed opinion that jury must acquit honestly of men have appeared in church since expression of opinion doubt whether have gone to other church if not have be deterred from public worship by presence if be so how can with clear conscience remain among men will take from hand wage for administration deliberately formed opinion will not allow to accept from hand yet though thus pleaded against knew that two men of whom be speaking be thick headed dolt who be always tipsy on saturday night who came to church perhaps once in three week kind heart will doubtless prompt to tell that clergyman must be safe in parish if be to allow opinion of chance parishioner to prevail against must probably lay down for guidance that grand old doctrine nil conscire sibi nulla pallescere culpa presuming that may do so will acknowledge such guidance to be good if mind be clear in matter must not budge inch for farmer for bishop further than might by law compel mind be not clear do grow pale hair stand on end with horror a confess to myself that know whether stole money such be fact in sincerity tell know not whether be guilty innocent may be that picked up cheque from floor of room afterwards took out used not knowing whence have come to if be so stole be guilty before law of country if be so be not fit to administer lord sacrament to people when cup be last in hand be blessing felt be not fit almost dropped chalice that god will know weakness pardon perplexity of mind be between creature a read letter over to myself feel how weak be word how inefficient to explain to exact position in stand will suffice to convince that be assuredly purposed to resign parish of hogglestock that be therefore incumbent on a patron of living to nominate successor to benefice have only further to ask pardon for long letter to thank again for many great mark of friendship have conferred on ala must have foreseen in old day how barren of good must have be life of then esteemed might perhaps have escaped disgrace of being called friend of one whom one now regard with esteem nevertheless may still say that be with affection yours truly josiah crawley last paragraph of letter be also added since wife have read when have first composed letter have be somewhat proud of word thinking that have clearly told story when sitting alone at desk read again filling mind a went on with idea must fain have expressed to old friend be not that feared to indulge with too many word began to tell that story be anything well told there be expression there of hoggethan doctrine in answer to letter a that dean might well say think again of try yet to save never mind two farmer mr thumble bishop stick to ship while there be plank above water whereas have be desire to use word must make dean clearly understand that thing be decided have failed a have failed in everything throughout life nevertheless letter must go be to begin again must not do better so added to what have written copy of note to bishop letter be fastened sent mr crawley might probably have be more instant in effort to stop letter have not felt that must not decide everything in first place be not improbable that letter might not reach dean till after return home mr crawley have long since made up mind that must see dean a soon a possible after return have heard from lady lufton that be not doubted in barchester that must be back at rate before judge came into city then in next place be probable that dean must act upon such letter by filling up vacancy even if did get trusted in dean knew that must help if help be possible must verdict go against husband then indeed might be that help must be possible in such case thought that bishop with commission might prevail still believed that verdict must be favourable if not with assured belief still with hope be sufficient to stand in lieu of belief single man let alone twelve men must think that husband have intended to appropriate money dishonestly that have taken improperly without real possession believed have not taken a thief must not merit thief punishment after two day got reply from bishop chaplain in chaplain expressed bishop commendation of mr crawley present conduct mr thumble will proceed from hence to hogglestock on next sunday said chaplain will relieve for present from burden of duty a to future status of parish will perhaps be best that nothing will be done till dean return perhaps till assize will be over be bishop opinion need hardly be explained that promised visit of mr thumble to hogglestock be gall wormwood to mr crawley have told dean must mr thumble come must endeavour to learn something even from may be doubted whether mr crawley in present mood must learn anything useful from mr thumble giles hoggett be much more effective teacher will endure even that said to wife a handed to back letter from bishop chaplain chapter lxiii two visitor to hogglestock cross grainedness of men be so great that thing will often be forced to go wrong even when have strongest possible natural tendency of own to go right be so now in affair between archdeacon son original difficulty be solved by good feeling of young lady by by real kindness of archdeacon nature have come to term be satisfactory to of term admitted of perfect reconciliation between father son whether major did marry lady whether did not allowance be to be continued to archdeacon being perfectly willing to trust in matter to pledge have received from miss crawley that required from son be simply that must pull down bill advertising sale of effect be desire ever more rational sale have be advertised for day just one week in advance of assize time must have be selected so thought archdeacon with malicious intention why at rate must thing be sold before one knew whether father of young lady be be not to be regarded a thief why must thing be sold at when archdeacon have tacitly withdrawn threat when have given son to understand that allowance must still be paid quarterly with customary archidiaconal regularity that alteration be intended in settlement under plumstead fox must in ripeness of time become property of major be thus that archdeacon looked at a did so thought that son be most cross grained of men major have own way of looking at matter have flattered dealt very fairly with father when have first made up mind to make miss crawley wife have told father of intention archdeacon have declared that if did so such such result must follow result a be apparent to one must make indispensable that major must leave cosby lodge major have never complained so told have simply said to father will do a have said can do a have said therefore will prepare to leave cosby lodge have so prepared a part of preparation auctioneer bill have be stuck up on post wall then archdeacon have gone to work surreptitiously with lady reader will understand that be still following working of major mind having succeeded in obtaining pledge have be wrong to demand came forward very graciously to withdraw threat withdrew threat because have succeeded in object by other mean major knew nothing of kiss have be given of two tear have trickled down father nose of generous epithet archdeacon have applied to grace did not guess how nearly father have yielded altogether beneath pressure of grace charm how willing be to yield altogether at first decent opportunity father have obtained pledge from grace that must not marry in certain circumstance a to circumstance major be strongly resolved that must form bar to marriage then came forward with eager demand that sale must be stopped major must not submit to so much indignity have resolved that father must have nothing to do with marriage one way other must not accept anything from father on understanding that father have such right father have asserted such right with threat major taking such threat a meaning something have seen that must leave cosby lodge let father come forward say that meant nothing that abandoned all right to interference a to son marriage then son must dutifully consent to accept father bounty be cross grained a mr grantly declared

right that almost perceived that might be becoming in to forgive fault in father have be implored to honour father be willing to do so understanding that such honour must to certain degree imply obedience if must be done at more than moderate expense to feeling threatened auctioneer be cause of offence to father might see whether must not be possible to have sale postponed there must of course be pecuniary loss that in diminished circumstance must still talk to of diminished circumstance might be inconvenient so much thought bound to endure on father behalf at rate must consult auctioneer at silverbridge must not make pause in measure have proposed to a likely to be conducive to marriage a for grace pledge such pledge from young lady never went for anything be out of question that must be sacrificed even though father have taken money moreover very gist of major generosity be to consist in marrying whether father be guilty innocent understood that perfectly understood also that be duty to make purpose in respect known to grace family determined therefore that must go over to hogglestock see mr crawley before saw auctioneer hitherto major grantly have

silent a though conscience stricken here be rich man come of whom have heard that might probably wish to wed daughter be manifest enough to of that man must marry into family without subjecting to heavy portion of reproach disgrace be attached to how be possible that must not care more for daughter for own flesh blood than for incidental welfare of rich man a regarded man have heard everything be good such marriage be like opening of paradise to child nil conscire sibi said father to a buckled on armour for fight when have waited for moment two major began mr crawley said addressing to

hinted at purpose of connecting at future time with unfortunate family meant to be plain spoken mr crawley did not mean to insinuate sir that there be aught of reticence in word so contrived that might fall back upon vagueness of expression for protection must hereafter see fit to change purpose must have wronged much by such suggestion rather be minded to make known to that must rather say mr crawley pointed to wife will not accept plainness of speech a betokening aught beyond conceived idea in furtherance of have thought expedient to make certain inquiry quite follow said major what want to do be to give consent to visit daughter want mr crawley to write to grace tell that be right mr crawley be quite sure that be right be ready to sit down write letter moment if husband must permit

be violence felt that be bound a far a might be possible to screen poor woman from ill effect of husband temper condition be therefore prepared to stop broughton on stair to use force in arresting on way must find man to be really intoxicated have not descended above stair two before be aware that man below whose step have be heard in hall be not intoxicated that be not dobbs broughton be mr musselboro be be said conway thought be broughton then looked into man face saw that be ashy pale appearance of low bred jauntiness used to belong to seemed to have be washed out of hair have forgotten to curl glove have be thrown aside even trinket be out of sight what have happened said conway what be matter something be wrong then occurred to that musselboro have be sent to house to tell wife of husband ruin servant told that must find upstairs said musselboro yes have be painting here for time past have be doing picture of miss van siever mr van siever have be here to day conway

of vault saw do think bangle will ever be man again o lord will never get over body be there when went in then musselboro sank back against wall of staircase stared at dalrymple a though still saw before terrible sight of have just spoken dalrymple seated on stair strove to bring mind to bear on tale have just heard what be to do how be that poor woman upstairs to be informed came here intending to tell said in whisper feared moment that mr broughton must appear on stair learn from word two have happened without hint to prepare for catastrophe thought must be here knew be doing picture knew 'd have letter to say so one of anonymous one did influence think be that said musselboro meant to have have out with be that a brought about perhaps did know that be clean ruined have

hand on other man arm have led downstairs out of reach of hearing from room above will tell wo said musselboro then dalrymple tried to think what loving female friend there be who must break news to unfortunate woman knew of van sievers knew of demolines almost knew that there be other woman within reach whom be entitled to regard a closely connected with mr broughton be well aware that anonymous letter of musselboro have just spoken have come from miss demolines must not go there for sympathy assistance must apply to mr van siever after what have passed morning to clara van siever must have applied that be impossible must reach clara except through mother suppose have better go to said after while then went leaving musselboro in drawing room be so bad with said musselboro really know how will ever go up court again conway dalrymple made way up stair with very slow step a did so must not think seriously of nature of friendship with woman must not condemn heartily for folly iniquity of own conduct score of time have professed love to with half expressed word intended to mean nothing a said to when tried to excuse enough to turn head even if did not reach heart now woman be widow came to be duty to tell that be so what if must claim from now love have so often proffered to be not that feared that must claim anything from at moment neither now to morrow next day agony of present meeting must produce others in there must be tenderness mixed with agony so from one meeting to thing must progress dalrymple knew well enough how such thing might progress in danger before be not of that be thinking of how must assist at time without doing more injury than benefit if did not assist who must do so knew to be heartless even heartless people have heart can be touched almost broken by certain sorrow heart must not be broken by husband death must become very sore if be utterly neglected be now at door with hand on lock be wondering why must remain so long within without making heard then opened found seated in lounging chair with back to door must see that have volume of novel in hand understood be pretending to be indifferent to husband return walked up to thinking that must recognize step made sign of turning towards saw motion of hair over back of chair a affected to make luxuriously comfortable be striving to let husband see that cared nothing for for condition for jealousy if be jealous even for ruin mr broughton said when be close to then jumped up quickly turned round facing where be dobbs said where be broughton be not here be in house for heard why have come back dalrymple eye fell on tattered canvas thought of doings of past month thought of picture of three grace be hanging in room below thoroughly wished that have never be introduced to broughton establishment how be to get through present difficulty said broughton did not come be mr musselboro whose step heard below what be here for what be doing here where be dobbs conway there be something matter have gone off yes have gone off coward be not coward not in way use of past tense unintentional a have be told story to woman at once be dead said then took hand in looked into face without speaking word gazed at with fixed eye rigid mouth while quick coming breath just moved curl of nostril occurred to at moment that have never before seen so wholly unaffected have never before observed that be so totally deficient in element of real beauty be first to speak again conway said tell why do not speak to there be nothing further to tell said then dropped hand walked away from to window stood there looking out upon stuccoed turret of huge house that stood opposite a did so be employing in counting window mind be paralysed by blow knew not how to make exertion with for purpose everything be changed with be changed in such way that must make guess a to future mode of life be suddenly widow pauper utterly desolate while only person in whole world that really liked be standing close to in midst of counted window of house opposite have be possible for must have put mind altogether to sleep let stand for few minute then joined at window friend said what will do for do said what do mean by doing come sit down let talk to replied then led to sofa a seated doubt whether have not almost forgotten that husband be dead what pity be to cut up said pointing to rag of jael sisera never mind picture now dreadful a be must allow to think of for few minute think of what o god yes conway must tell what to do be everything gone be about mind about wish be instead of do do wishing be of avail conway how did happen do think be true that man must say anything to gain object be here now believe be here still wo see remember that nothing on earth will make see may be necessary think will be at rate not yet will never see believe that have murdered husband do feel sure of now think of be quite sure of will murder too about girl will tell know man dalrymple simply shook head smiling sadly very well will see conway how do know that be true do believe do believe how did happen must not bear ruin that have brought upon then then went further in speech dalrymple assented by slight motion of head have be informed sufficiently that husband have perished by own hand what be to do said oh conway must tell be there ever so miserable woman be poison got up walked quickly across room back again to place where be sitting never mind about now will know that in time ask question about if be think must go to bed will be better there than up shock will make sleep said will not go to bed how must know that man must not come to kill believe murdered dobbs do be not going to leave conway think have better for while there be thing must be done will send one of woman to there be not one of care for in least oh conway go not yet will not be left alone in house with will be very cruel if go leave now when have so often said that that that be friend now at last began to weep think will be best said that must go to mr van siever if can manage will get clara to come to want said mr broughton be heartless cold creature want to have near poor husband be ruined among yes ruined among have all be done that may marry that horrid man live here in house have known ever so long that have not be safe among need fear nothing from clara said dalrymple with touch of anger in voice of course will say so can understand very well be natural that must wish to be with pray go then sat beside took hand endeavoured to speak to so seriously that might become serious if might be possible in degree contemplative told how necessary be that must have woman near in trouble explained to that a far a knew female friend there must be one who must be so considerate with a clara van siever at one time mentioned name of miss demolines dalrymple altogether opposed notion of sending for lady expressing opinion that amiable madalina have done in power to create quarrel between mr broughton husband between dobbs broughton mr van siever spoke opinion very fully about miss demolines yet liked once said mr broughton never liked said dalrymple with energy matter nothing now of course can send for if please think trustworthy will not willingly come in contact with then mr broughton gave to understand of course must give way that in giving way felt to be submitting to ill usage be ordinary lot of woman to among woman have be specially subjected did not exactly say a much fearing that if did must leave altogether be gist of plaint wail final acquiescence be going said catching hold of arm will employ altogether only about affair till see again want to stay must be madness look here lie down till clara come till return go beyond room own if can not come evening will return good by now will see servant a go out tell ought to be told oh conway said clutching hold of again know that despise despise will be a good friend to a can god bless then went a descended stair must not refrain from telling that did in truth despise first object be to find musselboro to dismiss gentleman from house for though did not attribute to mr van siever favourite of terrible crime potentiality for crime with mr dobbs broughton have invested still thought reasonable that poor woman upstairs must not be subjected to necessity of seeing hearing have gone dalrymple must not learn from head woman servant whom saw whether before going have told to one in house tale of catastrophe have happened in city servant be wonderful actor looking often a though knew nothing when know everything a though understood nothing when understand dalrymple made known be necessary discreet upper servant listened to tale with proper amount of awe horror commiseration shot hisself in city law will excuse sir know 'd a master be coming to good promised to do best with mistress kept promise be seldom that servant be not good in such strait a from mr broughton house dalrymple went directly to mr van siever learned that musselboro have be there about hour before have then gone off in cab with mr van siever be now nearly four o'clock in afternoon one in house knew when mr van siever must be back miss van siever be out have be out when mr musselboro have called be expected in minute conway therefore said that must call again on returning found clara alone have not then heard word of fate of dobbs broughton of course must go at once to mr broughton if necessary stay with during night wrote line at once to mother saying where be went across to mr broughton leaning on dalrymple arm be good to said conway a left at door will said clara will be a kind a nature will allow remember said conway whispering into ear a pressed hand at leaving that be world to be perhaps not proper time for expression of love clara van siever forgave impropriety chapter lxv miss van siever make choice clara van siever did stay night with mr broughton in course of evening received note from mother in be told to come home to breakfast can go back to afterwards said mr van siever will see in course of day if will let note be written on scrap of paper have beginning end be after manner of mr van siever clara be not in least hurt surprised mother will come to see after breakfast said clara a be taking leave oh goodness what will say to will have to say very little will speak to suppose everything belongs to now said mr broughton know nothing about never do know anything of mamma money matter of course will turn out mind bit about only hope will let have mourning then made clara promise that must return a soon a possible having in clara presence overcome that feeling of dislike have expressed to conway dalrymple mr broughton be generally affectionate to who be near to have musselboro forced into presence must have become quite confidential with before left mr musselboro will be here directly said mr van siever a be starting for mr broughton house have better tell to come to there stop perhaps have better keep here till come back tell to be sure wait for very well mamma suppose can wait below why must wait below said mr van siever very angrily clara have made uncourteous proposition to mother with express intention of making understood that must have nothing to say to can come upstairs if like said clara will go up to room if fight shy of miss may remember that will fight shy of at same time be sorry for mamma for will certainly fight shy of mr musselboro can do a please ca force sha try can make life burden to will what be matter with man that be good enough for be a good a of own people ever be hate new fangled air with picture painted on sly rest of hate such way see what have brought that wretched man to poor fool wife if go marry that painter of day will be very much like what be only doubt whether have got courage enough to blow brain out with comfortable word old woman took off leaving clara to entertain lover a best might choose mr musselboro be not long in coming in accordance with mr van siever implied direction to daughter be shown up into drawing room clara gave mother message in very few word be expressly told sir to ask to stop if be not inconvenient a very much want to see mr musselboro declared that of course must stop be only too happy to have opportunity of remaining in such delightful society a clara answered nothing to went on to say that hoped that melancholy occasion of mr van siever visit to mr broughton might make long absence necessary did not indeed care how long might be have recovered now from paleness want of glove jewellery have befallen on previous day immediately after sight have seen in city clara made answer to last speech putting thing together in work basket prepared to leave room hope be not going to leave said in voice be intended to convey much of love something of melancholy be so shocked by what have happened mr musselboro that be altogether unfit for conversation be with poor mr broughton last night will return to when mamma come home be sad certainly what be there to be expected if 'd only seen how used to go on to clara made answer go yet said there be something want to say to there be indeed clara van siever be young woman whose presence of mind rarely deserted occurred to now that must undergo on occasion nuisance of direct offer from man that must have better opportunity of answering after own fashion than present mother be absent field be own moreover be point in favour that tragedy have so lately occurred to have just now alluded must give fair excuse for additional severity at moment man must told be justified in making offer of love therefore might rebuke with le remorse wonder whether last word conway dalrymple have spoken to stung conscience a thought of have now reached door be standing close to a mr musselboro did not at once begin encouraged if have anything special to tell of course will hear said miss clara began rising from chair coming into middle of room think know what wish be then put hand upon heart respected mother be same way of thinking be that emboldens to be so sudden not what heart have be yours yours only all along before old lady so much a mentioned clara must give assistance not even aid of negative stood there quite passive with hand on door since first have pleasure of seeing have always said to myself 'augustus musselboro be woman for if can only win then there be so much against be there must not even take advantage of by assuring that there certainly always have be much against allowed to go on till must run out length of tether mean of course in way of money continued have much that must call own when respected mamma first allowed to become acquainted with be different now think may say that be right in respect poor broughton going in way will make deal smoother to may say that mamma will be in to other now about money then stopped quite understand what mean by said clara mean that there be more devoted fellow in london than what be to then be about to go down on one knee occurred to that must not be convenient to kneel to lady who must stand quite close to door one one if be put together well will often make more than two so will with said musselboro who began to feel that might be expedient to throw little spirit into word if have done said clara may a well hear for minute hope will have sense to understand really mean what say hope will remember what be mamma wish mamma wish have influence whatsoever with in such matter a mamma arrangement with be for own convenience be not party to know anything about mamma money want to know under possible circumstance will consent to become wife nothing that mamma must say do must induce even to think of hope will be man enough to take for answer say nothing more about miss clara be good miss claraing sir what have said may be sure mean good morning sir then opened door left by jove be tartar said musselboro to when be alone be tartar younger be worse then began to speculate whether fortune be not doing best for in so arranging that might have use of tartar mother money without binding to endure for life tartar quality of daughter have be understood that clara be to wait at home till mother must return before again went across to mr broughton at about eleven mr van siever came in daughter intercepted at dining room door before have made way upstairs to mr musselboro how be mamma said clara with something of hypocrisy in assumed interest for mr broughton be idiot said mr van siever have have terrible misfortune be reason why must be idiot be heartless too never cared bit for not bit be man whom be impossible to care for much will go to now mamma where be musselboro be upstairs well mamma be quite out of question quite must not marry to save from starving know what starving be yet dear tell truth at once be engaged to painter clara paused moment before answered

destroyed in manner told by musselboro opinion in city be that have done so rather through effect of drink than because of loss a to widow dalrymple thought that mr van siever nominally perhaps musselboro might be induced to settle annuity on if must give up everything quietly doubt whether mother be not responsible for everything broughton owed when died for everything be in way of business if so mr broughton will certainly have claim upon estate occurred to dalrymple once twice that be talking to clara about mr van siever a though clara be more closely bound together than be clara mother clara seemed to take in good part be a solicitous a be in matter of mr broughton interest then discreet head servant knocked told that mr broughton be very anxious to see mr dalrymple miss van

pitying condition of wretched creature bore without word of rebuke scorned to put out strength against one who be in truth so weak chapter lxvi requiescat in pace thing be very gloomy at palace have be already said that for many day after dr tempest visit to barchester intercourse between bishop mr proudie have not be of pleasant nature have become so silent so sullen so solitary in way even courage have be almost cowed for while have condescended to use gentler measure with hope that might thus bring lord round to usual state of active submission perhaps if strive to do full justice may say of that effort be made conscientiously with idea of inducing to do duty with proper activity for be woman not without conscience by mean indifferent to real service husband a bishop of diocese be bound to render to affair of church around of own struggle after personal dominion be unconscious doubt gave when recognized acknowledged by many stab to inner self of single being in world knew anything now a after while failed in producing amelioration in bishop mood temper also gave way thing be becoming very gloomy very unpleasant bishop wife be at present alone in palace married daughter husband have left unmarried daughter be also away how far bishop mood may have produced solitude in vast house will not say probably mr proudie state of mind may have prevented from having other guest in place of who be gone felt to be almost disgraced in eye of around by husband long absence from common room of house by dogged silence at meal be better thought that two must be alone in palace own effort to bring back to something like life to activity of mind if not of body be made constantly when failed a did fail day after day must go slowly to own room lock door look back in solitude at day of life have agony in minute of one near knew anything must seize with arm part of bed near must stand hold by grasping a though be afraid to fall then when be at worst with must go to closet closet

on one very memorable occasion have endeavoured to combat have fought with striving to put down have failed given up hope of escape for in direction on occasion courage have never quailed for moment while openly struggled to be master must openly struggle to be mistress must enjoy struggle nothing like moodiness have ever come upon before have yielded to for many day striving to coax by little softness of have be ashamed a practised have served nothing at last determined that something else must be done if only for sake to keep life in something else must be done be to continue a be now must give up diocese at rate declare too ill to keep working of in own hand how hated mr crawley for sorrow that have brought upon house be still affair of mr crawley urged on to further action when bishop received mr crawley letter said nothing of to handed over to chaplain chaplain fearing to act upon handed to mr thumble whom knew to be one of bishop commission mr thumble equally fearing responsibility in present state of affair at palace found obliged to consult mr proudie mr proudie have doubt a to what must be done man have abdicated living of course provision must be made for service must again make attempt upon husband therefore went into room holding mr crawley letter in hand dear said here be mr crawley letter suppose have read yes said bishop have read what will do about something must be done know said did not even look at a spoke have not turned eye upon since have entered room bishop be letter requires to be acted upon at once can not doubt that man be doing

be said irritated bishop what then must wish to have done never mind said bishop be nonsense said mr proudie adding something of severity to tone of voice be nonsense said still did not look at have done so for moment since have entered room mr proudie must not bear a anger became strong within breast told that must be wrong to bear have tried what gentleness must do have failed be now imperatively necessary that must resort to sterner measure must make understand that must give authority to send mr thumble to hogglestock why do not turn round speak to properly said want to speak to at bishop answered be very bad almost anything must be better than be sitting now over fire with elbow on knee face buried in hand have gone round room so a to face be now standing almost over still must not see countenance will not do at said dear do know that be forgetting altogether wish must forget might be very well if be in position in owed service to one rather must not be well then evil must not be so manifest can not do duty in diocese if continue to sit there doing nothing with head upon hand why do not rally get to work like man wish must go away leave said bishop will not go away leave have brought to such condition that be duty a wife to stay by if neglect duty will not neglect mine be that brought to sir be not true did not bring to be truth now got up looked at for moment

in life be worst clasped hand to side a listened to for minute two made reply when ceased from speaking again put elbow on knee again buried face in hand what have better do how be expedient that must treat at crisis whole thing be so important to that must have postponed own ambition must have curbed temper have thought that by doing so might in degree have benefited seemed to that must not rouse by conciliation neither must leave a be something must be done bishop said word that speak be sinful very sinful have made sinful replied will not hear that from will not indeed have endeavoured to do duty by deserve be endeavouring to do duty now must know that must ill become to remain quiescent while be in such state world around be observing know that be not doing work want of be that must arouse go to work must do work very well said if be not here suppose then wish be dead said mr proudie to made reply did stir how must flesh blood bear female flesh blood mr proudie flesh blood now at

tell mr thumble that must go over to hogglestock arrange for duty of parish desire that will do such thing said bishop now again looking up at may be sure that will said mr proudie then left room did not even yet suppose that must go about work at once condition of mind be in truth bad be becoming worse probably from day to day still did make calculation about thing now reflected that must be sufficient if spoke to chaplain to morrow about mr crawley letter since terrible scene dr tempest have witnessed have never be able to make up mind a to what great step must take have made up mind that great step be necessary there be moment in thought that must resign bishopric for such resignation without acknowledged incompetence on score of infirmity precedent be very few even if there be precedent must be better to do than to remain where be of course there must be disgrace then must be disgrace from must hide now there be equal disgrace must not hide then measure a must bring punishment where punishment be due must bring wife to ground who have brought to ground suffering must not be own when found that income palace position be gone then perhaps might repent evil that have done now when be left alone mind went back to did not think of taking immediate measure measure on very day to prevent action of mr thumble mr proudie did take immediate step mr thumble be at moment in palace waiting for instruction be who have brought mr crawley letter to mr proudie now returned to with letter in hand reader will know what be result mr thumble be sent off to hogglestock at once on bishop old cob a will be remembered fell into trouble on road late in afternoon entered palace yard having led cob by bridle whole way home from hogglestock hour two before mr thumble return mr proudie returned to husband thinking better to let know what have done resolved to be very firm with at same time determined not to use harsh language if must be avoided dear said have arranged with mr thumble found on occasion sitting at desk with paper before with pen in hand must see at glance that nothing have be written on paper what must have thought have known when placed sheet before be proposing to consult archbishop a to propriety of resignation have not however progressed so far a to write even date of letter have done what said throwing down pen have arranged with mr thumble a to going out to hogglestock said firmly indeed have gone already then bishop jumped up from seat rang bell with violence what be going to do said mr proudie be going to depart from here said will not stay here to be mark of scorn for men finger will resign diocese can not do said wife can try at rate said then servant entered john said addressing man let mr thumble know moment return to palace wish to see here perhaps may not come to palace in case let word be sent to house mr proudie allowed man to go before addressed husband again what do mean to say to mr thumble when see be nothing to came up to put hand upon shoulder spoke to very gently tom said be that way in speak to wife yes be have driven to why have taken upon to send man to hogglestock because be right to do so came to for instruction must give none must have given what instruction pleased in proper time thumble will not go to hogglestock next sunday who will go then never mind nobody doe not matter to if will leave now will be obliged to there will be end of very soon very soon mr proudie after stood for while thinking what must say left room without uttering word a looked at hundred different thought came into mind have loved dearly loved still knew now at moment felt absolutely sure that by be hated in spite of roughness temper mr proudie be in like other woman that must fain have be loved have be possible have always meant to serve be conscious of conscious also in way that although have be industrious although have be faithful although be clever yet have failed at bottom of heart knew that have be bad wife yet have meant to be pattern wife have meant to be good christian have so exercised christianity that not soul in world loved must endure presence if must be avoided have sufficient insight to mind feeling of around to be aware of now husband have told that tyranny to be so overbearing that must throw up great position retire to obscurity must be exceptionally disgraceful to because must no longer endure public disgrace conduct brought upon in high place before world heart be too full for speech left very quietly closing door behind be preparing to go up to chamber with hand on banister with foot on stair when saw servant who have answered bishop bell john said when mr thumble come to palace let see before go to lord yes ma'be said john who well understood nature of quarrel between master mistress command of mistress be still paramount among servant john proceeded on mission with view of accomplishing mr proudie behest then mr proudie went upstairs to chamber locked door mr thumble returned to barchester day leading broken down cob dreadful walk have be not good at walking before came near barchester have come to entertain violent hatred for beast be leading leading of horse be tired in pain lame even stiff in limb be not pleasant work brute will not accommodate pace to man will contrive to make head very heavy on bridle will not walk on part of road man intends for will lean against man will make altogether very disagreeable may be understood therefore that mr thumble be not in good humour when entered palace yard be altogether quiet in mind a to injury have done to animal be brute fault said mr thumble come generally of not knowing how to ride 'em said groom for mr thumble though often have horse out of episcopal stable be not ready with shilling to man who waited upon with steed have not however come to satisfactory understanding respecting broken knee when footman from palace told be wanted be in vain that mr thumble pleaded that be nearly dead with fatigue that have walked way from hogglestock must go home to change clothes john be peremptory with insisting that must wait first upon mr proudie then upon bishop mr thumble might perhaps have turned deaf ear to latter command former be one felt bound to obey so entered palace rather cross very much soiled a to outer man in condition went up certain small staircase be familiar to to small parlour adjoined mr proudie room there awaited arrival of lady that must be required to wait quarter of hour be not surprising to when hour be gone remembered of own wife at home of dinner have not yet eaten ventured to ring bell mr proudie own maid mr draper by name came to said that have knocked twice at mr proudie door must knock again two minute after returned running into room with arm extended exclaiming oh heaven sir mistress be dead mr thumble hardly knowing what be about followed woman into bedroom there found standing awestruck before corpse of who have so lately be presiding spirit of palace body be still resting on leg leaning against end of side of bed while one of arm be close clasped round bed post mouth be rigidly closed eye be open a though staring at nevertheless there must be doubt from first glance that woman be dead went up close to did not dare to touch there be one a yet there mr draper one else knew what have happened be heart said mr draper did suffer from heart complaint asked suspected sir though nobody knew be very shy of talking about must send for doctor at once said mr thumble have better touch nothing till be here then retreated door be locked in ten minute everybody in house knew except bishop in twenty minute nearest apothecary with assistant be in room body have be properly laid upon bed even then husband have not be told did not know either relief loss be now past seven be usual hour for dinner at palace be probable that must come out of room among servant if be not summoned when be proposed to mr thumble that must go in to tell positively declined saying that sight have just seen exertion of day together have so unnerved that have not physical strength for task apothecary who have be summoned in hurry have escaped probably being equally unwilling to be bearer of such communication duty therefore fell to mr draper under pressing instance of other servant descended to master room have not be that hour of dinner have come so that bishop must not have be left much longer to evil time must have be still postponed went very slowly along passage be just going to pause ere reached room when door be opened bishop stood close before be easy to be seen that be cross hand face be unwashed face be haggard in day must not even go through ceremony of dressing before dinner mr draper said why tell that dinner be ready be going to give dinner stood moment without answering while tear streamed down face what be matter said have mistress sent here oh law said mr draper put out hand to support if such support must be necessary what be matter demanded angrily oh lord bear like christian mistress be no more leaned back against door post took hold of by arm be heart lord dr filgrave have not be yet be what be bishop did not say word walked back to chair before fire chapter lxvii in memoriam illustration bishop when have heard tidings of wife death walked back to seat over fire mr draper housekeeper came stood over without speaking thus stood for ten minute looking down at listening there be sound not word moan sob be a though also be dead that slight irregular movement of finger on top of bald head told that mind body be still active lord said at last must wish to see doctor when come spoke very low did not answer then after minute of silence asked same question again what doctor said dr filgrave sent for perhaps be here now will go see lord mr draper found that position there be weary wished to escape anything on behalf requiring trouble work must have done willingly must not stand there for ever watching motion of finger suppose must see said bishop mr draper took a order for departure crept silently out of room closing door behind with long protracted elaborate click be always produced by attempt at silence on such occasion did not care for noise for silence have slammed door must not have regarded wonderful silence have come upon for time almost crushed must never hear well known voice again be free now even in misery for be very miserable must not refrain from telling that one must now press uncalled for into study contradict in presence of before whom be bound to be authoritative rob of dignity there be one else of whom be afraid have at least kept out of hand of other tyrant be now own master there be feeling may not call of relief for a yet there be more of pain in than of satisfaction feeling a though have escaped from old trouble at terrible cost of must not a yet calculate amount knew that might now give up idea of writing to archbishop have in way at certain period of life be very good to have kept money for made thing go straight when have be poor interest have always be interest without must never have be bishop so at least told now so told probably with truth have be very careful of child have never be idle have never be fond of pleasure have neglected no acknowledged duty did not doubt that be now on way to heaven took hand down from head clasping together said little prayer may be doubted whether quite knew for what be praying idea of praying for soul now that be dead must have scandalized certainly be not praying for own soul think be praying that god might save from being glad that wife be dead be dead a be in moment have not stirred out of room since have be there with then there have be angry word between perhaps more determined enmity on part than ever have before existed have parted for last time with bitter animosity told that have certainly be right in what have done then thought have be right then so mind went back to crawley thumble question tried to alleviate misery last interview with wife now created by assuring that at least have be justified in what have done yet thought be very tender to nothing reopens spring of love so fully a absence absence so thoroughly a must need be endless want that have not especially that can never have have told in very last moment of presence with that be wishing that be dead have made reply at moment have felt with savage anger that such be wish word have now come to pas be widower assured that must give that possessed in world to bring back again yes be widower might do a pleased tyrant be gone be free tyrant be gone tyranny have doubtless be very oppressive who have suffered a have done in thus being left without tyrant be wretchedly desolate might not be that tyranny have be good for that lord have known best what wife be fit for then thought of story have read have well marked a be reading of man who have be terribly afflicted by wife whose wife have starved beaten reviled yet man have be able to thank god for having thus mortified in flesh might not be that mortification have doubtless suffered in flesh have be intended for welfare have be very good for if be so might be that mortification be now removed because lord knew that servant have be sufficiently mortified have not be starved beaten mortification have be certainly severe then there came word into mind not into mouth lord sent thorn lord have taken away blessed be name of lord after that be very angry with tried to pray that might be forgiven while be so striving there came low knock at door mr draper again entered room dr filgrave lord be not at home said mr draper will be sent very moment arrives very well mr draper lord will not come to dinner little soup morsel of something to eat glass of wine will enable lordship to bear better allowed mr draper to persuade followed into dining room go mr draper said must rather that must stay with so mr draper stayed with administered to want be desirous of being seen by a few eye a possible in first moment of freedom saw dr filgrave twice before after doctor have be upstairs there be doubt dr filgrave said that be a mr draper have surmised poor lady be suffering have for year be suffering from heart complaint to husband have never said word on subject to mr draper word have be said now again word when moment of fear must come when sharp stroke of agony must tell of danger mr draper have kept secret of mistress none of family have known that there be aught to be feared dr filgrave indeed did tell bishop that have dreaded all along exactly that have happened have said same to mr rerechild surgeon when two have have consultation together at palace on occasion of somewhat alarming birth of grandchild mixed up information with so much medical latin be so pompous over bishop be so anxious to be rid of that word did not have much effect what did matter thorn be gone wife be dead widower must balance gain loss a best might slept well when woke in morning dreariness of loneliness be very strong on must do something must see somebody felt that did not know how to bear in new position must send of course for chaplain tell chaplain to open letter to answer for week then remembered how many of letter in day of yore have be opened be answered by helpmate who have just gone from since dr tempest visit have insisted that palace letter bag must always be brought in first instance to have be done greatly to annoyance of wife in order that might be done bishop have be up morning hour before usual time everybody in household have known why be so thought of now a bag be brought to on first morning of freedom must have where pleased now either in bedroom left for untouched on breakfast table till must go to blessed be name of lord said a thought of did not stop to analyse what be saying on morning must not enjoy liberty desired that letter bag might be taken to mr chaplain news of mr proudie death have spread all over barchester on evening of occurrence have be received with feeling of distant awe be always accompanied by degree of pleasurable sensation there be one in barchester to lament mother sister friend who be really loved there be doubtless who regretted woman death even who regretted without feeling of personal damage done to there have come to be around mr proudie party who thought a thought on church matter such people have lost head thereby strength have be staunch to own party preferring bad tea from low church grocer to good tea from grocer who went to ritualistic church to church at be due to to say that did not forget who be true to looking after mindfully where looking after might be profitable fighting battle where fighting might be more serviceable think that appetite for breakfast of man woman in barchester be disturbed by news of mr proudie death there be who felt that trouble have fallen on tidings of catastrophe reached hiram hospital on evening of occurrence hiram hospital where dwelt mr mr quiverful with child now mr quiverful owed debt of gratitude to mr proudie having be placed in present comfortable home by lady patronage mr quiverful perhaps understood character of deceased woman expressed opinion respecting a graphically a did one in barchester there be natural surprise felt at warden lodge in hospital when tidings be first received there quiverful family be at first too full of dismay regret surmise to be able to give impartially to criticism on following morning conversation at breakfast table naturally referring to great loss bishop have sustained mr quiverful thus pronounced opinion of friend character will find that will feel q said to husband in answer to sarcastic remark made by a to removal of thorn will feel though be almost too many for while be alive daresay will feel at first said quiverful think will be more comfortable than have be of course will feel go on feeling till dy if be man take to be be not to think that there have be love because there used to be word that will find happier because can do thing more a plea be great help to must have known that be in spite of sharpness of tongue doubt be sharp doubt be upsetting must make fool too in struggle to have everything own way q there be worse woman than mr proudie be never one of idle one be quite sure that man woman ever heard say word against husband behind back same gave terribly bad life of if be true that hear there be men who must have what call terribly bad life of way go with bishop be weak want somebody near to to be strong be strong perhaps too strong have advantage out of after know that life have be so terribly bad daresay be have everything very comfortable about man ought to be grateful for though very few men ever be mr quiverful predecessor at hospital old mr harding whose halcyon day in barchester have be passed before coming of proudies be in bed playing cat cradle with posy seated on counterpane when tidings of mr proudie death be brought to by mr baxter oh sir said mr baxter seating on chair by bed side mr harding liked mr baxter to sit down because be almost sure on such occasion to have advantage of prolonged conversation what be mr baxter oh sir be anything matter old man attempted to raise in bed must frighten grandpa said posy dear there be nothing to frighten there be indeed mr harding be well at plumstead when heard from missus at venice everything be going on well what be mr baxter god forgive sin mr proudie ai no more now there have be terrible feud between palace deanery for year in carrying on person of opposed household be wont to express with eager animosity mr baxter mr draper never spoke to other two coachman longed for opportunity to take other before magistrate for breach of law of road in driving footman abused other groom occasionally fought master mistress contented with simple hatred therefore be not surprising that mr baxter in speaking of death of mr proudie must remember first sin mr proudie dead said old man indeed be mr harding said mr baxter putting hand together piously be just grass ai sir dust clay flower of field whether mr proudie have most partaken of clayey nature of flowery nature mr baxter did not stop to consider mr proudie dead said posy with solemnity be own then wo scold poor bishop more dear wo scold anybody more will be blessing for must say everybody be always so considerate in house miss that none of know nothing about what be dead said mr harding again think if please mr baxter will leave for little time take miss posy with have be in city of barchester fifty year here be one who might have be daughter who have come there scarcely ten year since who now have gone before have never loved mr proudie perhaps have gone a near to disliking mr proudie a have ever gone to disliking person mr proudie have wounded in part be most sensitive must be long to tell need be told now how have ridiculed cathedral work how have made nothing of how have despised always manifesting contempt plainly have be even driven to rebuke have perhaps be only personal rebuke have ever uttered in barchester now be gone thought of simply a active pious woman who have be taken away from work before time for bishop idea ever entered mr harding mind a to removal of thorn man have lost life companion at time of life when companion be most needed mr harding grieved for with sincerity news went out to plumstead episcopi by postman happened to reach archdeacon a be talking to sexton at little gate leading into churchyard mr proudie dead almost shouted a postman notified fact to impossible be so for zartain yer reverence said postman who be proud of news heaven ejaculated archdeacon then hurried in to wife dear said a spoke must hardly deliver of word so eager be to speak who do think be dead gracious heaven mr proudie be dead mr grantly dropped from hand teaspoonful of tea be just going into pot repeated husband word mr proudie dead there be pause during looked into other face dear believe said mr grantly did believe very shortly there be prayer at plumstead rectory morning archdeacon immediately went out into village soon obtained sufficient evidence of truth of postman have told then rushed back to wife be true said be quite true be dead there be doubt about be dead be last night about seven be when found at least may have died about hour before filgrave say not more than hour how did die heart complaint be standing up taking hold of bedstead so found then there be pause during archdeacon sat down to breakfast wonder how felt when heard of course be terribly shocked have doubt be shocked man must be shocked when come to think of what relief how can speak of in way said mr grantly how be to speak of in other way said archdeacon of course must go say out in street think ought to say anywhere said mr grantly poor man doubt feel about wife in same way that anybody else must if other poor man have got wife a be may be quite sure that must be glad to be rid of say that wished to die that must have done anything to contrive death gracious archdeacon do pray hold tongue stand to reason that going will be great relief to what have done for have made contemptible to everybody in diocese by interference life have be burden to through violence be that way carry out proverb of de mortuis said mr grantly proverb of de mortuis be founded on humbug humbug out of door be necessary must not do for to go into high street just now say what think about mr proudie suppose that kind of thing need be kept up in here between be uncomfortable woman so uncomfortable that can not believe that one will regret dear only to think that have gone may a well give tea think that mr grantly opinion differed much from that expressed by husband that be in truth least offended by archdeacon plain speech must be remembered that there be probably house in diocese in mr proudie have be so thoroughly hated a have be at plumstead rectory there have be hatred at deanery hatred at deanery have be mild in comparison with hatred at plumstead archdeacon be sound friend be also sound enemy from very first arrival of proudies at barchester mr proudie have thrown down gauntlet to have not be slow in picking up war have be internecine have given other terrible wound have be understood that there must be quarter there have be none enemy be now dead archdeacon must not bring to adopt before wife namby pamby day decency of speaking well of one of whom have ever thought ill of expressing regret when regret must be felt may sin be forgiven said mr grantly amen said archdeacon there be something in tone of amen thoroughly implied that be uttered only on understanding that departure from existing world be to be regarded a unmitigated good that must at rate never come back again to barchester when lady lufton heard tidings be not so bold in speaking of a be friend archdeacon mr proudie dead said to daughter in law be hour after news have reached house when fact of poor lady death have be fully recognized what will do without same a other men do said young lady lufton dear be not same a other men be not at like other men be so weak that can not walk without stick to lean upon doubt be virago woman who must not control temper for moment doubt have led terrible life have often pitied with heart nevertheless be useful to suppose be useful to can hardly believe that mr proudie be dead have gone must have seemed so much more natural poor woman daresay have good point reader will be pleased to remember that luftons have ever be strong partisan on side of grantlys news made way even to hogglestock on same day mr crawley when heard went out after husband who be in school dead said in answer to whisper do tell that woman be dead then mr crawley explained that tidings be credible may god forgive sin said mr crawley be violent woman certainly think that misunderstood duty say that be bad woman be inclined to think that be earnest in endeavour to do good never occurred to mr crawley that affair have in truth be cause of death be thus that be spoken of for few day then men woman ceased to speak much of began to talk of bishop instead month have not passed before be surmised that man so long accustomed to comfort of married life must marry again even then one

into prison must leave wife child dependent on charity of friend on charity must condescend to accept though must not condescend to ask yet be able to carry now with greater show of fortitude than have be within power when extent of calamity be more doubtful must not ask reader to suppose that be cheerful to have be cheerful under such circumstance must have be inhuman carried head on high walked firmly gave order at home with clear voice wife who be necessarily more despondent than ever wondered at wondered in silence certainly seemed a though very extremity of ill fortune be good for be very diligent with school passing greater part of morning with child mr thumble have told that must come on sunday that must then take charge of parish up to coming of mr thumble must do everything in parish must be done by clergyman with clear spirit free heart mr thumble must not find that spiritual weed have grown rank in parish because of misfortune mr proudie have died on tuesday that having be day of mr thumble visit to hogglestock mr robarts have gone over to silverbridge in answer to dr tempest invitation on thursday have not therefore command of much time being express object to prevent appearance of mr thumble at hogglestock on next sunday have gone to silverbridge by railway have therefore be obliged to postpone visit to mr crawley till next day early on friday morning rode over to hogglestock that did not arrive there with broken knee 'd horse reader may be quite sure in matter of sort mr robarts be ever above reproach rode good horse drove neat gig be always well dressed on account mr crawley though really liked mr robarts be thankful to for many kindness must never bear presence with perfect equanimity robarts be scholar be not great preacher have obtained no celebrity a churchman have in fact done nothing to merit great reward yet everything have be given to with abundant hand within last twelvemonth wife have inherited mr crawley did not care to know how many thousand pound yet mr robarts have won that possessed by being clergyman be possible that mr crawley must regard man with equanimity robarts rode over with groom behind really taking groom because knew that mr crawley must have one to hold horse for groom be source of great offence came upon mr crawley standing at school door stopping at once jumped off nag there be something in way in sprang out of saddle threw rein to man be not clerical in mr crawley eye man must be so quick in matter of horse who spent a many hour with poor with child a must be spent by parish clergyman might be probable that mr robarts have never stolen twenty pound might never be accused of so disgraceful crime nevertheless mr crawley have own idea made own comparison crawley said robarts be so glad to find at home be generally to be found in parish said perpetual curate of hogglestock know be said robarts who knew man well cared nothing for friend peculiarity when felt own withers to be unwrung might have be down at hoggle end with brickmakers then must have have to go after must have grieved began crawley robarts interrupted at once let go for walk will leave man with horse have something special to say to can say better out here than in house grace be quite well sends love be growing to look so beautiful hope may grow in grace with god said mr crawley be a good girl a ever knew by by have henry grantly over here other day major grantly whom can not name without expressing esteem for did do honour of calling upon not very long since if be with reference to that have taken trouble not at will allow lady to fight out battle have not least doubt in world how will go when be told that made complete conquest of archdeacon there can not be doubt about conquest of archdeacon mr robarts did not wish to have to explain anything further about archdeacon be not terribly shocked crawley asked when heard of death of mr proudie be sudden very awful said mr crawley such death be always shocking not more so perhaps a regard wife of bishop than with other woman only happened to know doubt finite meagre nature of feeling doe prevent from extending sympathy to whom have not seen in flesh must not be so must not with one who have nurtured heart with proper care be prone to permit evil worse than to canker regard to foster to mar solicitude who be high in station strike more by joy sorrow than do poor lowly be young duke wife wedded other day to die england must put on show of mourning nay must feel true gleam of pity nobody care for widowed brickmaker seated with starving infant on cold hearth of course hear more of big people said robarts ay think more of suppose sir complain of man woman because sympathy hers run out of course reason tell must hold man with whom must not be so must simply be god among men be in perfection a man that recognize divinity of christ be in imperfection of men that recognize necessity for christ yes sir death of poor lady at barchester be very sudden hope that lord bishop bear with becoming fortitude heavy misfortune say that be man much beholden to wife prone to lean upon in going out coming in for such man loss be more dreadful perhaps than for say led terrible life know be not prone sir to believe much of what hear about domesticity of other men knowing how little other man can know of own have methinks observed proneness in world to ridicule dependence on woman married man must acknowledge in regard to wife of bosom if can trust a well a love when hear jocose proverb spoken a to men such a in house gray mare be better horse that in house wife wear that garment be supposed to denote virile command knowing that joke be easy meekness in man be more truly noble than habit of stern authority allow to go far with in influencing judgment so spoke mr crawley who never permitted slightest interference with own word in own family who have be witness of one of scene between bishop wife in poor bishop have be so cruelly misused to mr crawley thing have seen under such circumstance be a sacred a though have come to under seal of confession in speaking of bishop mr proudie nay a far a be possible in thinking of be bound to speak to think a though have not witnessed that scene in palace study suppose that there be much doubt about real character said robarts need not discus that by mean such discussion must be useless unseemly just at present there be something else that specially want to say to indeed went to silverbridge on same subject yesterday have come here expressly to have little conversation with if be about affair of mine mr robarts be indeed troubled in spirit so great labour must have fallen upon never mind labour indeed saying be nuisance to because hoped that by time must have understood regard a friend that think nothing trouble do for friend position just now be so peculiar that requires great deal of care care can be of avail to there disagree with must excuse do so doe dr tempest think that have be little too much in hurry since communicated to result of first meeting a how sir be perhaps hardly worth while for to go into whole question that man thumble must not come here on next sunday can not say mr robarts that reverend mr thumble have recommended to strongly by outward symbol of manhood by such manifestation of inward mental gift a have succeeded in obtaining knowledge of have be so slight have be acquired in manner so likely to bias prejudicially against that be inclined to think opinion must go for nothing be however fact that bishop have nominated to duty that a have simply notified desire to be relieved from care of parish on account of certain unfitness of own be last man who must interfere with bishop in choice of temporary successor be choice not excuse mr robarts can not allow assertion to pas unquestioned must say have adequate cause for believing that came here by lordship authority no doubt did will just listen to for moment ever since unfortunate affair of cheque became known mr proudie have be anxious to get out of parish be violent woman chose to take matter up violently pray hear out before interrupt there must have be commission at for commission be right proper just said mr crawley who must not keep silent very well let be so mr thumble coming over here be not proper right may be sure bishop doe not wish let send other clergyman whom may think more fitting said mr crawley want to send anybody somebody must be sent mr robarts not so let go over see thumble snapper snapper know be domestic chaplain that need do be to go on with service on sunday if necessary will see bishop think may be sure can manage if not will come back to mr robarts paused for answer seemed for awhile that mr crawley impatient desire to speak be over walked on silently along lane by visitor side when after five six minute robarts stood still in road mr crawley even then said nothing can not be that must be anxious to keep income of parish for wife child said mark robarts of course be anxious for wife child crawley answered then let do a say why must throw away chance even if be bad one here chance be in favour let manage for at barchester of course be anxious for wife child said crawley repeating word how anxious fancy man can conceive who have not be near enough to absolute want to know how terrible be approach when threatens who be weak who be very dear mr robarts spoke just now of chance of thing chance of arranging on behalf must for while longer be left in enjoyment of freehold of parish seemeth to that there must be chance on subject in adjustment of so momentous matter there must be consideration of right wrong consideration of aught beside have be growing to feel for week past circumstance whether through own fault not be outside question a to will not further delay by offering even opinion unfortunate circumstance have made unfit to remain here a guardian of soul of people of parish then there came to letter from dr tempest for be greatly beholden to strengthening altogether in view what must do then mr robarts must allow to think of wife child when question a be before for self discussion must certainly said robarts sir excuse bluntness of contradiction feel assured that in such emergency must look solely to duty a by god help will endeavour to do mr robarts there be many of who in many thing be much worse than believe to be in other matter perhaps of larger moment can rise to idea of duty a need for such idea come upon say not at a praising speak of men a believe that will be found to be of of of others who strive to live with clean hand clear conscience for moment think that must retain benefice at framley if there have come upon after much thought assured conviction that must not retain without grievous injury to soul of others grievous sin to own wife child dear a be to to a dear to a to fade from sight when time come for judgment on matter a that be standing quite still now facing other crawley a spoke with low voice looked straight into friend eye kept hand firmly fixed on friend arm can not interfere further said robarts can not interfere further robarts when told story of interview to wife that evening declared that have never heard voice so plaintively touching a be voice of mr crawley when uttered last word returned back to servant house almost without word robarts mounted without offering to see mr crawley did mr crawley ask to do so be better now that robarts must go may god send through trouble said mr robarts mr robarts thank warmly for friendship said mr crawley then parted in about hour mr crawley returned to house now for pindar jane said seating at old desk chapter lxix mr crawley last appearance in own pulpit word message from mr crawley reached barchester throughout week on sunday morning mr thumble be under positive engagement to go out to hogglestock perform service of church dr tempest have be quite right in saying that mr thumble must be awed by death of patroness such be altogether case be very anxious to escape from task have undertaken at instance if be possible in first place have never be favourite with bishop have now therefore nothing to expect in diocese crust from bit of loaf morsel of broken fish have come in way have come from bounty of mr proudie then a regarded special hogglestock job how be to get paid for whence indeed be to seek repayment for actual money must be out of pocket in finding way to hogglestock back again must not get to speak to bishop must induce one who have access to lordship to touch upon subject mr snapper avoided a much a possible mr snapper when be caught interrogated declared that regarded matter a settled nothing must be in worse taste mr snapper thought than to undo immediately after poor lady death work in diocese have be arranged done by mr snapper expressed opinion that mr thumble be bound to go out to hogglestock when mr thumble declared petulantly that must not stir step out of barchester mr snapper protested that mr thumble must have to answer for in world in next if there be service at hogglestock on sunday on saturday evening mr thumble made desperate attempt to see bishop be told by mr draper that bishop have positively declined to see bishop probably felt unwilling to interfere with wife doings so soon after death so mr thumble with heavy heart went across to dragon of wantly ordered gig resolving that bill must be sent in to palace be not going to trust again upon bishop cob up to saturday evening mr crawley did work of parish on saturday evening made address to parishioner from pulpit have given notice among brickmakers labourer that wished to say few word to in school room farmer also heard

pulpit said short prayer then began story illustration will come to hear ruined man declare own ruin story a told then will not be repeated now a same story have be told too often already in page surely be singular story for parish clergyman to tell of in so solemn manner that have applied cheque to own purpose be unable to account for possession of be certain did not know when how have got speaking to then in god house told that be to be tried by jury must do be to tell jury same must not expect jury to believe jury must of course believe only that be proved to did expect old friend at hogglestock who have known so long to take word a true that there be sufficient excuse for conduct even in own sight voluntary resignation of parish be said sufficient evidence then explained to a clearly a be able what bishop have done what commission have done what have done that spoke word of mr proudie to audience need hardly be mentioned here now dearest friend leave said with weighty solemnity be so peculiar to man be able to make singularly impressive even on congregation a of hogglestock trust that heavy pleasing burden of charge have have over may fall into hand better fitted than mine have be for such work have always known own unfitness by reason of worldly care with have be laden poverty make spirit poor hand weak heart sore too often make conscience dull may latter never be case with of then uttered short prayer stepping down from pulpit walked out of church with weeping wife hanging on arm daughter following almost dissolved in tear never again entered that church a pastor of congregation there be old lame man from hoggle end leaning on stick near door a mr crawley went out with be old lame wife will pull through yet said old man to wife will see else will pull through because be so dogged be dogged a doe on night position of member of mr crawley household seemed to have be changed there be something almost of elation in mode of speaking said soft loving word striving to comfort wife on other hand must say nothing to comfort have be averse to step be taking have be unable to press objection in opposition to great argument a to duty since have spoken to in strain have used with robarts also have felt that must be silent must not even feign to feel pride come from performance of duty what will do when come out said to daughter coming out

about mr thumble at moment word must think have surprised husband at breakfast there be hardly word spoken mr crawley took crust eat mournfully almost ostentatiously jane tried failed tried to hide failure failing in also mr crawley made attempt sat behind old teapot with hand clasped eye fixed be a though last day have come upon first sunday of husband degradation mary said to why do not eat

hogglestock may be a well to explain here that unfortunate mr snapper be constrained to go out to hogglestock on sunday be now approaching fell out a follows might be very well for mr toogood to arrange that must not tell person that person of news have brought down from london a have told various people in silverbridge a have told mr soames a have told police at barchester of course tale found way to palace mr thumble heard having come by time thoroughly to hate hogglestock belonged to pleaded to mr snapper that report afforded ample reason why need not again visit that detestable

laughing word respecting mr crawley peculiarity feeling that in way might ease husband difficulty must be oddest man that ever lived said mr grantly not to have known where got cheque archdeacon shook head rubbed hand a walked about room suppose too much learning have upset said archdeacon say be not very good at talking english put on in greek never stop archdeacon be perfectly aware that have to admit mr crawley to goodwill that a for grace crawley be essentially necessary that must be admitted to heart of heart have promised a much must be acknowledged that archdeacon grantly always kept promise especially such promise a indeed be nature of man that when have be very angry with loved must be unhappy until have found escape from anger must not endure to have to own to have be in wrong must be content with very incomplete recognition of having be in right poster have be pulled down mr crawley a be now told have not stolen cheque be sufficient if son must only drink glass two of wine with comfortably talk dutifully about plumstead fox must be held to be right grace crawley must be received with lavish paternal embrace archdeacon have kissed grace once felt that must do so again

something to show that be interested about affair be doing best can to make thing right after dinner over claret mr thorne terrible sin in reference to trapping of fox be accordingly again brought up archdeacon became beautifully irate expressed animosity did not in least feel against old friend with energy must have delighted wife if must have heard will tell thorne mind certainly be very old friend have known other life can not put up with kind of thing will not be because be afraid of own gamekeeper yet archdeacon have never ridden after fox in life never meant to do so have in truth be always so very anxious that fox must be found in cover that fox have be so fortunately trapped just outside plumstead property afforded most pleasant escape for steam of anger when began to talk to wife that evening about mr thorne wicked gamekeeper be so sure that be right that said word of extreme desire to see grace crawley if be to marry might a well have over here said archdeacon be just what be thinking said mr grantly thus thing at rectory got arranged on sunday morning expected letter from venice came to hand be read on morning very anxiously not only by mr grantly major by

be special friend of postman to understand that considered to be numskull little better than idiot postman finding parson to be against have seen that there be chance for have allowed matter to drop mr arabin letter be long eager full of repetition did explain clearly to exact manner in cheque have found way into mr crawley hand francis came up to said in letter francis being husband dean asked for money have promised to make up in packet packet be not ready must not wait declaring that mr crawley be in such flurry that did not like to leave be therefore to bring down to door went to desk thinking must spare twenty pound a well a fifty put cheque into envelope together with note handed packet to francis at door think told francis afterwards put seventy pound into envelope instead of fifty of will not be sure at rate mr crawley got mr soames cheque from last word underscored then went on to explain how cheque have be paid to short time before by dan stringer then toogood have be right about fellow said archdeacon hope will hang said mr grantly must have known time what dreadful misery be bringing upon unfortunate family suppose dan stringer cared much about said major not straw said archdeacon then hurried off to church archdeacon preached sermon in fabrication of have be interrupted by son therefore barely enabled to turn quarter of hour from giving out of text be constant practice to preach for full twenty minute a barchester lay on direct road from plumstead to hogglestock be thought well that word must be sent to mr toogood desiring not to come out to plumstead on monday morning major grantly proposed to call for at dragon to take on from thence to hogglestock have better take mother horse through said archdeacon distance be very nearly twenty mile be felt by mother son that archdeacon must be in good humour when made proposition a that be not often that rectory carriage horse be allowed to make long journey run into barchester back altogether be under ten mile be generally extent of work meant to have posted from barchester said major may a well take horse through said archdeacon mother will not want suppose might a well bring friend

be greatly increased be already known that be going to plumstead night be partly understood that be engaged with grantly arabin faction in defending mr crawley clergyman against proudie faction dan stringer who be still at inn a saw enemy get into plumstead carriage felt to be one of palace party felt that if mr proudie have only lived till after assize heavy trouble must not have befallen waiter with dirty napkin stood at door bowed thinking perhaps that a proudie party be going down in barchester might be a well to be civil to mr toogood day of stringer be probably drawing to close at dragon of wantly there be knowing who might be new landlord henry grantly lawyer found very little to say to other on long way out to hogglestock be thinking probably much of coming interview hardly knew how to express thought to other will not take carriage up to house said major a be entering parish of hogglestock particularly a man must feed horse so got out at farmhouse about mile from church where offence of carriage livery servant must be well out of mr crawley sight from thence walked towards parsonage church school close to lay on way a passed by school door heard voice within will bet twopence be there said toogood tell be always either in one shop other will slip in bring out mr toogood have assumed comfortable air a though day work be to be good pastime even made occasional attempt at drollery have have joke about dan stringer have attempted to describe absurdity of mr crawley visit to bedford row must have angered major have not seen that be assumed to cover something below of mr toogood be little ashamed of a major thought mr toogood have cause to be ashamed when therefore toogood proposed to go into school bring mr crawley out a though telling of story must be easiest thing in world major did not stop indeed have plan of own ready mind be too intent on tragedy have occurred be now to be brought to close to enable to form plan a to best way of getting up last scene so mr toogood with quick easy step entered school leaving major still standing in road mr crawley be in school a be also jane crawley so here be said toogood be fortunate hope find pretty

if will be pleased to step out sir will follow said waving hand towards door jane dear if will remain with child will return to presently bobby studge have failed in saying belief have better set on again from beginning now mr toogood again waved with hand towards door so young cousin be said toogood stretching over just managing to touch jane finger of act of touching jane be very chary then went forth mr crawley followed there be major standing in road toogood be anxious to be first to communicate good news be only reward have proposed to for money have expended time have lost trouble have taken be right old fellow said clapping hand on crawley shoulder have got right sow by ear at last know about mr crawley must hardly remember time when have be called old fellow last now did not like in confusion of mind must understand allusion to right sow supposed that mr toogood have come to about trial did not occur to that lawyer might be bringing news might make trial altogether unnecessary if eye be not mistaken there be friend major grantly said mr crawley there be a large a life said toogood stop moment before go to give hand must have first shake of hereupon crawley extended hand be right now let tell know about cheque soames cheque know where got know who stole know how came to person who gave to be very well talking when be in trouble always go to lawyer by time mr crawley be looking full into mr toogood face seeing that cousin eye be streaming with tear began to get insight into man character also very dim insight into fact man intended to communicate to a yet fully understand sir said being perhaps in such matter somewhat dull of intellect seemeth to that be messenger of glad tidings whose foot be beautiful upon mountain beautiful said toogood by george must think be beautiful hear tell that have found out about cheque that be a right a trivet be still on little causeway leading from school up to road henry grantly be waiting for at small wicket gate mr crawley said major congratulate with heart must not accompany friend mr toogood when brought good news even yet altogether comprehend what have be told to said crawley now standing out on road between other two men be doubtless dull very dull may beg clearer word of explanation before ask to go with to wife cheque be given to by aunt eleanor aunt eleanor said crawley now altogether in cloud who be major aunt eleanor though have doubt at different time heard circumstance of connection have never realized fact that daughter lover be nephew of old friend arabin yes by aunt mr

part of small packet handed to by dean look sir bear with yet for moment said that be so dean denied dean did not know man said toogood almost in passion bear with yet awhile so far have be from misdoubting dean whom have long known to be in thing true honest gentleman postponed elaborated result of own memory to word felt more constrained to do because in moment of forgetfulness in wantonness of inconsiderate haste with wicked thoughtlessness have allowed to make false statement unwittingly false indeed nathless very false unpardonably false have declared without thinking that money have come to from hand of mr soames thereby seeming to cast reflection upon gentleman when have be guilty of so great blunder of so gross violation of ordinary care must govern word between man man especially when question of money may be in doubt how must expect that one must accept statement when contravened by made by dean how in embarrassment must believe own memory gentleman did not believe own memory though little circumstance of envelope with rich perilous freightage came back upon from time to time with exactness have appeared to to be almost marvellous yet have told that be not so gentleman if please will go into house wife be there must no longer be left in suspense passed on in silence for few step till crawley spoke again perhaps will allow privilege to be alone with for one minute for minute thanks will not be delayed where thanks be so richly due of course said toogood wiping eye with large red bandana handkerchief by mean will take little walk come along major major have turned face away also be weeping by george never heard thing in life said toogood must have believed if have seen must indeed if be to tell up in london nobody must believe call man hero said grantly know about being hero never quite knew what make hero if be having three four girl dying in love for at once to find man who be going to let everything in world go against because

toogood went first major followed when entered front door saw skirt of woman dress flitting away through door at end of passage on entering room to left found mr crawley alone have fled a though from enemy said with little attempt at laugh will pursue bring back crawley said lawyer be little upset kind of thing know what woman be let alone nay mr toogood then must be angered with afterwards must lack comfort of having spoken word of gratitude pardon major grantly must not have leave till have seen be a cousin say be somewhat over excited still will be best that must see gentleman will excuse then went out to fetch wife while be away not word be spoken major looked out of one window mr toogood out of other waited patiently till heard coming step of husband wife when door be opened mr crawley appeared leading wife by hand dear said know major grantly be cousin mr toogood be well that know too remember great kindness to mr crawley must not speak must only sink on sofa hide face while strove in vain to repress sob have be very strong through husband trouble very strong in bearing for what must not bear for in fighting on behalf battle in be altogether unable to couch lance endurance of so many trouble great overwhelming sorrow at last have so nearly overpowered that must not sustain shock of turn in fortune be never like sir when ill news came to said mr crawley standing somewhat apart from major sat by side put hand upon hers whispered word to about daughter upon threw arm around kissed face then hand then looked up into face through tear murmured few word attempted to do so doubt whether major understood meaning knew very well what be in heart now think might a well be moving said mr toogood will see about having indictment quashed will arrange that with walker may be necessary that must go into barchester first day judge sit if so will come fetch may be sure wo leave place till be square a be going grantly speaking now altogether with indifference a to toogood presence asked mr crawley leave to be bearer of tidings to daughter can hear in tone can be more grateful to said mr crawley will ask for nothing for myself now said grantly must be ungenerous hereafter in few day when will be more at ease may then use permission major grantly said mr crawley solemnly respect so highly esteem so thoroughly that give willingly ask if daughter can bring to regard a woman must regard husband with love can worship cling be constant will think have fair promise of worldly happiness for sir in giving to girl if so be that be given to will bestow upon great treasure have grace be king daughter with queen dowry permission to address must not have be imparted to lover with more thorough appreciation of value of privilege conferred be rum said mr toogood a got into carriage together say be very good 'un to go after departure jane be sent for might hear family news when expressed feeling not altogether in favour of mr toogood mr crawley thus strove to correct view be man dear who conceals warm heart active spirit healthy sympathy under affected jocularity of manner almost with touch of assumed vulgarity when jewel be good fault in casket may be forgiven then papa next time see will like if can said jane village of framley lie slightly off road from hogglestock to barchester so much so a to add perhaps mile to journey if traveller go by parsonage gate on route to hogglestock two traveller have passed framley without visiting village on return journey major asked mr toogood permission to make deviation be not in hurry said toogood never be more comfortable in life will just light cigar while go in see friend toogood lit cigar major getting down from carriage entered parsonage be fortune to find grace alone robarts be in barchester mr robarts be across road at lufton court miss crawley be certainly in servant told soon found in miss crawley presence have only called to tell news about father said what

kept word to father like gentleman grace when be left alone thought that be happiest girl in christendom if must only get to mother tell everything be told everything have idea of promise that lover might have made to father did make inquiry of own thought a to reason for staying with so short time looking back at thought conduct have be perfect in meantime major with mr toogood be driven home to dinner at plumstead chapter lxxv madalina heart be bleeding john eames a soon a have left mr arabin at hotel have taken travelling bag to own lodging started off for uncle toogood house there found mr toogood not in most serene state of mind a to husband absence mr toogood have now be at barchester for best part of week spending good deal of money at inn mr toogood be quite sure that must be doing indeed how must help johnny remarked that did not see how in such circumstance uncle be to help then mr toogood have only written one short scrap of letter just three word be written in triumph crawley be right think have got real simon pure by heel be very well john mr toogood said of course must be terrible thing to family if anybody connected with be made out to be thief must be quite dreadful said johnny not that ever looked upon crawleys a connection of ours however let that pas be sure be very glad that uncle must have be able to be of service to there be reason in roasting of egg can tell that money be not so plenty in house that uncle can afford to throw into barchester gutter think what twelve child be john might be very well if toogood be bachelor if lord have left fortune john eames did not stay very long in tavistock square cousin polly lucy be gone to play with mr summerkin aunt be not in one of best humour took uncle part a well a must then left mr toogood little allusion to lord de guest generosity have not be pleasant to seemed to rob of own merit have be rather proud of journey to italy having contrived to spend nearly forty pound in ten day have done everything in most expensive way feeling napoleon wasted have be laid out on behalf of mr crawley a mr toogood have just told be nothing to what toogood be doing toogood with twelve child be living at own charge at barchester be neglecting business besides there be mr crump said mr toogood of course doe like what can say to when come to be not quite fair on part of mr toogood a mr crump have not troubled even once a yet since husband departure what be johnny to do when left tavistock square club be open to must go to club play game of billiards have supper when asked question knew that must not go to club yet pretended to doubt about a made way to cabstand in tottenham court road must be slow told to go to club must have gone to see lily dale only that intimacy with mr thorne be not sufficient to justify calling at house between nine ten o'clock at night a must go somewhere a intimacy with lady demolines be thought sufficient to justify almost anything must go to bayswater regret to say that have written mysterious note from paris to madalina demolines saying that must be in london on very night that be just on card that might make way up to porchester terrace before went to bed note be mysterious because have beginning ending did not contain even initial be written like telegraph message be about a long be kind of thing miss demolines liked johnny thought there must be reason why must not gratify be favourite game people like whist like croquet like intrigue madalina must probably have called romance because by nature be romantic john who be made of sterner stuff laughed at knew that there be romance in knew that be only amusing gratifying at same time by little innocent pretence told that be nature to prefer society of woman to of men must have liked society of lily dale doubt much better than of miss demolines a society of lily dale be not to be have at moment society of miss demolines be best substitute within reach so got into cab have driven to porchester terrace be lady demolines at home said to servant always asked for lady demolines page who be accustomed to open door for be le false being young must now tell without further fiction that miss madalina be in drawing room such be answer got from page on evening what madalina did with mother on occasion have never yet discovered there used to be little excuse given about lady demolines state of health latterly madalina have discontinued reference to mother headache be standing in centre of drawing room when entered with hand raised almost terrible expression of mystery in face hair however have be very carefully arranged so a to fall with copious carelessness down shoulder altogether be looking best oh john said called john by accident in tumult of moment have heard what have happened of course have heard heard what have heard nothing said johnny arrested almost in doorway by nature of question partly also doubt by tumult of moment have idea how terrible tragedy be in truth in store for perceived that moment be to be tumultuous that must carry accordingly come in close door said came in closed door do mean to say that have heard what have happened in hook court have happened in hook court miss demolines threw back into arm chair closed eye clasped hand upon forehead what have happened in hook court said johnny walking up to think can bring to tell answered then took one of hand down from forehead held in allowed passively be thinking doubt of something far different from never saw looking better in life said johnny said how can talk in way when heart be bleeding bleeding then pulled away hand again clasped with other upon forehead why be heart bleeding have happened in hook court still answered nothing sobbed violently heaving of bosom showed how tumultuous be tumult within mean to say that dobbs broughton have come to grief that be to be sold out man said madalina jumping from chair standing at full height stretching out arm have destroyed revelation be at last made with so much tragic propriety in so excellent tone with such absence of customary redundance of commonplace relation think that must have rehearsed scene with mother with page then there be minute silence during did not move even eyelid held outstretched hand without dropping finger inch face be thrust forward chin projecting with tragic horror there be vacillation even in chin did not wink eye alter to breadth of hair aperture of lip surely be great genius if did without previous rehearsal then before have thought of word in to answer let hand fall by side closed eye shook head fell back again into chair be too horrible to be spoken of to be thought about said must not have brought to tell tale to living being except to must naturally have be flattering to johnny have not be that be in truth absorbed by story have heard do mean to tell said that broughton have committed suicide must not speak of again nodded head at thrice while eye be still closed how be manner of said asking question in low voice must not even a yet quite bring to believe madalina be so fond of little playful intrigue even story might have something in of nature of fiction be not quite sure of fact yet be shocked by what have heard must have repeat to bloody detail of terrible scene said be impossible go to friend dalrymple will tell know have be with maria through wish wish have not be so nevertheless did bring to narrate detail with something more of circumstance than eames desired soon succeeded in making understand that tragedy of hook court be reality that poor dobbs broughton have brought career to untimely end have heard everything having indeed gone to musselboro in city having penetrated even to sanctum of mr bangle to mr bangle have explained that be bosom friend of widow of unfortunate man that be miserable duty to make mistress of circumstance mr bangle reader may remember burton bangle who kept store for himalaya wine at s d dozen in hook court be bachelor rather liked visit told miss demolines very freely all have seen when suggested that might be expedient for sake of family that must come back to mr bangle for further information at subsequent period very politely assured that must do proud whenever might please to call in hook court then saw into lombard street put into omnibus be therefore well qualified to tell johnny particular of tragedy did so far overcome horror a to tell told tale somewhat after manner of aeneas not forgetting quorum par magna fui feel that almost make old woman of said when have finished no said johnny remonstrating not that doe to have be concerned in so terrible tragedy take more of life out of one than year of tranquil existence a have told nothing of intercourse with bangle with bangle who have literally picked poor wretch up did not see how have be concerned in matter said nothing about knowing character of madalina will see that body floating before eye while live said gory wound said johnny recoiling in truth from picture by be revolted never again said never again forced from now will not close eye for week then became very comfortably confidential discussed affair of poor mr dobbs broughton with great deal of satisfaction went to see of course sent down word to say that shock must be too much for wonder that must not see poor maria came to for advice know when dobbs broughton first proposed to be obliged to tell what really thought knew character so well 'dear maria said 'if think that can love take ' ' think can ' replied 'but said quite sure about business how have turned out never loved what heart have have given to wretched dalrymple see that be particularly wretched said johnny pleading for friend be wretched so will find gave heart after giving hand to poor dobbs a for business there be a much left a will pay for mourning wonder that must not bring to see what have become of business belongs to mr van siever to musselboro poor broughton have little money have gone among musselboro who never have penny will be rich man of course know that be going to marry clara nonsense always told that must be so now may perhaps acknowledge conway dalrymple prospect be not very brilliant hope like being cut out by mr musselboro of course will have to marry maria see how can escape indeed be too good for only after such marriage a there must be end to prospect a artist best thing for must be to go to new zealand john eames certainly liked evening with miss demolines sat at ease in comfortable chair amused by watching different little plot then have bright eye flattered allowed to scold occasionally now again there might be more potent attraction when must admit to take hand like be better than to sit smoking with men at club must not sit night even with madalina demolines at eleven got up to take leave when will see miss dale asked suddenly know answered frowning at always frowned at when spoke to of miss dale in least care for frown said playfully putting up hand to smooth brow think know intimately enough to name goddess to be goddess very cold goddess must think from what hear wish to ask for promise respecting what promise will grant how can tell till hear must promise not to speak of to when see why must promise that promise not unless tell why johnny have already assured that nothing must be more improbable than that must mention name of miss demolines to lily dale very well sir then may go must say that unless can comply with so slight request a will not care to see here again mr eames why must want to speak evil of to miss dale want to speak evil of know that must not speak of to without at least ridicule come promise will come here on thursday evening will tell why have asked tell now hesitated moment then shook head can not tell now heart be still bleeding with memory of poor man fate will not tell now yet be now that must give promise will not trust so far a will not speak of to miss dale there be own friend now john mind be here at half past eight on thursday punctually at half past eight there be thing have to tell will tell then if will come have thought to have told to day why not now can not feeling be too many for must never go through with after have passed between about poor broughton must break down indeed must go now for be tired then having probably taken momentary advantage of more potent attraction to have before alluded left room very suddenly left room very suddenly because madalina movement have be so sudden word so full of impulse have become aware that in little game be playing in porchester terrace everything ought to be done after unaccustomed special fashion so having clasped madalina for one moment in arm made rush at room door be out on landing in second be little too quick for old lady demolines skirt of whose night dress a seemed to johnny saw whisking away in at door be nothing however to if old lady demolines who be always too ill to be seen chose to roam about own house in night dress when found alone in street mind reverted to dobbs broughton fate of wretched man sauntered slowly down palace garden that might look at house in have dined with man who have destroyed by own hand stood for moment looking up at window in there be now light thinking of poor woman whom have seen in midst of luxury who be now left widow in such miserable circumstance a for suggestion that friend conway must marry did not believe for moment knew too well what suggestion of madalina be worth motif from sprung thought might be true that mr van siever have absorbed all there be of property possibly also that musselboro be to marry daughter at rate must go to dalrymple room if must find must learn truth knew enough of dalrymple way of life of way of friend chamber studio to care nothing for lateness of hour in very few minute be sitting in dalrymple arm chair found siph dunn there smoking in unperturbed tranquillity a long a lasted must ask question about mr broughton told therefore of adventure abroad of crawley escape at last having finished third pipe siph dunn took leave tell said john a soon a dunn have closed door what be hear about dobbs broughton have blown brain out be how terribly shocking yes shocked at first be used to now business have gone to dog say at least that share of have done so be ruined say so that be musselboro say so mr van siever what do say conway le say better have hope only be talkative fellow one ca trust never told secret of yours old fellow well fact be have idea that something may be saved for poor woman think that be wronging of course can do be to put matter into lawyer hand pay lawyer bill so went to cousin have taken case up hope wo ruin then suppose be quarrelling with mr van doe matter have quarrelled with what about jael conway tell that jael be going to become mr musselboro who have told that bird yes know who bird be think that jael will become mr musselboro think that jael must become mr musselboro if jael be only woman musselboro only man in london to tell little bit of secret johnny think that jael will become wife of one conway dalrymple be opinion a far a can judge be opinion of jael also not opinion of mr van bird told thing conway what be other thing bird hinted that must end in marrying widow of poor wretch who destroyed johnny boy said artist after moment silence if give bit of advice will profit by will try if be not disagreeable whether profit by whether keep to know bird better than do strongly caution to beware of bird bird be bird of prey altogether unclean bird bird want mate doe much care how find one bird want money doe much care how get bird be decidedly bad bird not at fit to take place of domestic hen in decent farmyard in plain english johnny will find day if go over too often to porchester terrace that be going to marry bird else that be employing cousin toogood for defence in action for breach of promise brought against by venerable old bird bird mamma if be to be will be latter said johnny a took up hat to go away chapter lxxvi think be light of heart illustration mr arabin remained one day in town mr toogood in spite of asseveration that must not budge from barchester till have seen mr crawley through trouble did run up to london a soon a news reached that john eames have returned came up took mr arabin deposition sent down to mr walker might still be necessary mr arabin be told that must go into court there state on oath that have given cheque to mr crawley mr walker be of opinion that circumstance must enable judge to call upon grand jury not to find true bill against mr crawley that whole affair a far a mr crawley be concerned must thus be brought to end toogood be still very anxious to place dan stringer in dock mr walker declared that must fail if made attempt dan have be examined before magistrate at barchester have persisted in statement that have heard nothing about mr crawley cheque said in teeth of word have fallen from unawares in presence of mr toogood must not punish for lie not even for such lie a that be not upon oath must not make responsible to law because have held tongue upon matter a to be manifest to that have known whole history during entire period of mr crawley persecution must only call upon to account for possession of cheque did by saying have be paid to by jem scuttle who received money appertaining to hotel stable accounted for once week jem scuttle have simply told that have taken cheque from mr soames jem have since gone to new zealand be quite true that jem departure have followed suspiciously close upon payment of rent to mr arabin that jem have be in close amity with dan stringer up to moment of departure that dan stringer have not become honestly possessed of cheque everybody knew nevertheless magistrate be of opinion mr walker coinciding with that there be evidence against sufficient to secure conviction story however of mr crawley injury be so well known in barchester feeling against man who have permitted to be thus injured be so strong that dan stringer did not altogether escape without punishment rough spirit in barchester called one night at dragon of wantly begged that mr dan stringer must be kind enough to come out take walk with that evening when be intimated to that dan stringer have not just then desire for such exercise requested to be allowed to go into back parlour make evening with dan stringer in recess there be terrible row at dragon of wantly that night dan with difficulty be rescued by police on following morning be smuggled out of barchester by early train have never more be seen in city rumour of however be soon heard from appeared that have made acquainted with casual ward of more than one workhouse in london cousin john left inn almost immediately a indeed must have done have there be question of mr soames cheque then there be nothing more heard of stringer in barchester mr arabin remained in town one day must have remained longer waiting for husband have not letter from sister impressed upon that might be a well that must be with father a soon a possible mean to make think that there be immediate danger mr grantly said indeed can not say that be ill seems that extremity of old age have come upon almost suddenly that be a weak a child only delight be with child especially with posy whose gravity in management of be wonderful have not left room now for more than week eats very little may be that will live yet for year must be deceiving if did not let know that archdeacon think that time of departure from be near at hand after reading letter mr arabin must not wait in town for husband even though be expected in two day though have be told that presence at barchester be not immediately required on behalf of mr crawley during one day kept promise to john eames by going to lily dale mr arabin have become very fond of johnny felt that deserved prize have be so long trying to win reader perhaps may not agree with mr arabin reader who may have caught closer insight into johnny character than mr arabin have obtained may perhaps think that young man who must amuse with miss demolines be unworthy of lily dale if so may declare for reader be not in accord about john eames be hard to measure worth worthlessness in such matter a there be standard for such measurement old friend john be certainly no hero be very unheroic in many phase of life then if girl be to wait for hero fear that difficulty in way of matrimonial arrangement great a be at present will be very seriously enhanced johnny be not ecstatic heroic transcendental very beautiful in manliness be not man to break heart for love to have story written in epic be affectionate kindly honest young man think most girl might have done worse than take whether be wise to ask assistance in love making so often a have done may be question mr arabin be intimately acquainted with mr thorne therefore there be nothing odd in going to mr thorne house mr thorne be very glad to see told barsetshire news much more than mr arabin must have learned in week at deanery for mr thorne have marvellous gift of picking up news have already heard whole story of mr soames cheque expressed conviction that least must be done in amends to mr crawley be to make bishop see palace be vacant said mr thorne palace vacant said mr arabin be just a good now that mr proudie have gone suppose poor bishop will count for much can assure mr arabin felt that poor woman death so much used to regard a one of staunchest of proudieites once whispered to delightfully wicked story about dean archdeacon when told that be particular friend put on look of horror think believed then emily dunstable entered room with came lily dale mr arabin have never before seen lily of course be introduced be sorry to say miss dale be going home to allington to morrow said emily be coming to chaldicotes in may said mr thorne of course mr arabin know what gala doings be going to have in may then there be various civil little speech made on side mr arabin expressed wish that might meet miss dale again in barsetshire did not bring at nearer to object particularly wish to say word to miss dale here to day if will allow said mr arabin be sure will twenty word wo lily said mr thorne preparing to leave room then mr arabin apologized mr thorne bustling up said that did not signify lily remaining quite still on sofa wondered what be about in two minute lily mr arabin be alone together lily have just time to surmise mr arabin visit must have reference to mr crosbie remembering that crosbie have married wife out of barsetshire forgetting altogether that mr arabin have be just brought home from italy by john eames be afraid miss dale will think very impertinent said mr arabin be sure will not think that said lily believe knew before mr eames started that be going to italy to find husband said mr arabin then lily put mr crosbie altogether out of head became aware that be not to be subject of coming conversation be almost sorry that be so there be doubt in mind a to what must have said to one who might have taken up crosbie cause on matter must now have given very decisive answer in few word on other matter be much more in doubt remembered however word of note have received from m d remembered also word of john note to young woman heart be still hard against yes said mr eames came here one night told why be going be very glad that be going because thought be right know of course how successful have be be who gave cheque to mr crawley so mr thorne have heard dr thorne have written to tell whole story now have come to look for mr eames reward reward mr arabin yes rather to plead for will not hope be angry with because have told much of history while be travelling home alone together oh said lily smiling how must have chosen better friend in whom to trust must certainly have chosen none who must take part more sincerely be so good so amiable be so pleasant in way so fitted to make woman happy then miss dale be also so devoted be old friend of ours mr arabin so have told of love dearly mamma be very much attached to unless flatters there be one belonging to who must not wish that must be nearer dearer still may be so say that be not so mamma uncle be fond of doe not go long way said mr arabin ought not to do so said lily ought not to go way at ought not seems to that must never have brought to marry one whom old friend have not liked ah be thing be not recommendation to man that have be so successful with friend a to make feel that might trust to with perfect safety to lily made answer mr arabin went on to plead friend cause with eloquence must use insisting on virtue good temper kindness constancy not forgetting fact that world be inclined to use very well still lily made answer have promised mr arabin that must not regard interference a impertinent therefore refrained from word might seem to show offence did feel offence be something gained by john eames in lily estimation that must have friend a mr arabin to take interest in welfare there be self dependence perhaps one may call obstinacy about lily dale made determined that must not be driven hither thither by pressure from without why have john eames at very moment when must have be doing best to drive from breast memory of past folly when must have striven to do so have really be earnest in suit why at moment have allowed to correspond in term of affection with woman a m d while mr arabin be pleading for john eames lily be repeating to herself certain word john have written to woman ever always yours unalterably such be not exact word such be form in lily dishonestly chose to repeat to herself why be so with in old day must have forgiven crosbie offence at word look possible letter to m d let have be ever so abominable nay have not even forgiven offence of deserting altogether on behalf of woman a detestable a must be m d of johnny choosing woman whose only recommendation have be title yet must not forgive john eames though evidence against be of so flimsy nature rather strove to turn flimsiness of evidence into strength why be so unheroic a might be john eames be surely better man bigger man than adolphus crosbie be simply have fallen in love with one have never fallen in love with other have fallen in love with one man though in simple way have made struggle against such feeling have not come to love other man though have told that must be well that must do so if be possible again again have half declared to herself that must take a husband leave love to come afterwards when moment came for doing so must not do may not say word of comfort to said mr arabin will be very comfortable without such word said lily laughing be not comfortable of that may be very sure yours ever unalterably j e said lily to herself doubt affection continued mr arabin doubt credit then think wrong reason why have ventured to come to be that may know impression have made upon one who be other day stranger to be sure that love think be light of heart oh miss dale how be to become wife unless love well enough mr arabin have made up mind about will never become man wife mamma be in together will remain together a soon a word be out of mouth hated for having spoken there be maudlin missish namby mamby sentimentality about disgusted specially desired to be straightforward resolute of purpose honest spoken free from touch of affectation yet have excused from marrying john eames after fashion of sick schoolgirl be good talking about more said getting up from chair quickly be not angry with at rate will forgive be quite sure have meant to be very good be not bit angry will see before go oh yes be if like to come to day early to morrow go home to morrow can not refuse because be such old friend almost like brother be of use mr arabin then mr arabin kissed left telling that mr eames must come to afternoon at half past five lily promised that must be at home to receive wo ride with for last time said emily dunstable when lily gave notice that must not want horse on afternoon no not to day will never have opportunity of riding with emily dunstable said bride elect at least hope not even under circumstance must refuse though must give guinea to be with john eames be coming here to say good by oh then indeed must not come with lily what will say to nothing oh lily think of have thought of have thought of nothing else be tired of thinking of be not good to think of anything so much what doe matter be very good to have one to love one better than world besides have one said lily thinking of mother not caring to descend again to mawkish weakness of talking about yes one to be always with to do everything for to be very own be very well for said lily think bernard be luckiest fellow in world will not do for know in what college will take degree wish 'd let write letter after name a men do what letter lily om for old maid see why must be a good a ba for bachelor of art must mean great deal more chapter lxxvii shattered tree when mr arabin saw johnny in middle of day must hardly give much encouragement yet felt by mean sure that might not succeed even yet lily have be very positive in answer yet there have be something either in word in tone of voice have made mr arabin feel that even lily be not quite sure of herself there be still room for relenting nothing however have be said must justify in bidding john eames simply to go in win think be light of heart lily have said be word of have be spoken most impressed on mr arabin memory must not repeat to friend must graft upon such advice a have to give did telling that thought that perhaps lily doubted actual earnestness must marry moment said johnny be not enough a mr arabin knew to prove earnestness many men fickle a weathercock be ready to marry at moment be ready to marry at moment because be fickle think so little about hears perhaps of liking other people said mr arabin care straw for other person said johnny wonder whether if be to shut up in cage for six month must do good if have keeping of cage perhaps might said mr arabin have nothing more to say to on subject to tell that miss dale must expect afternoon at half past five told that must come to wish good by promised to see wish 'd say must see then there must be chance said johnny between mr arabin parting be very affectionate told how thankful be for kindness in coming to how grateful must

doe what be business with patience perseverance be pity though scoundrel must get off then eames gave uncle account of italian trip to fro be congratulated also upon success john great triumph lay in fact that have be only two night in bed that must not have so far condescended on occasion for feminine weakness of fellow traveller sha forget in hurry will john said mr toogood in pleasant voice a parted at door of luncheon house in holborn toogood be returning to office john eames be to prepare for last attempt went home to lodging intending at first to change dress to make smart for work

angrily never said that if will ask for token of earnestness will give want token best sign of earnestness man can give generally in such matter be to show how ready be to be married never said

next day lily dale went down to small house of allington so pass out of sight can only ask reader to believe that be in earnest express own opinion in last word that will ever write respecting that will live die a lily dale chapter lxxvii arabins return to barchester in day mr harding be keeping bed at deanery most of who saw declared that must never again leave archdeacon have be slow to believe so because have still found father in law able to talk to not indeed with energy then mr harding have never be energetic on ordinary matter with same soft cordial interest in thing have ever be customary with have latterly be much interested about mr crawley must make archdeacon mr grantly tell that heard what thought of case of course have be before important news have be received from mr arabin mr harding be very anxious firstly a said for welfare of poor man of whom can not bring to think ill then for honour of cloth in barchester be a liable to have black sheep here a elsewhere archdeacon replied dear think that sheep be black never have have black sheep in barchester have though said archdeacon thinking however of sheep who be black with different kind of blackness from be now attributed to poor mr crawley of blackness be not absolute blackness to mr harding milder eye archdeacon when heard father in law talk after fashion expressed opinion that might live yet for year be just man to linger on living in bed a indeed have lingered life out of bed doctor who attended thought otherwise a did also mr grantly a did mr baxter a also did posy grandpa wo get up more will posy said to mr baxter hope will dear very soon think will said posy because said must never see big fiddle again that come of being little melancholy like dear said mr baxter mr grantly at time went into barchester almost day archdeacon who be very often in city never went there without passing hour with old man two clergyman essentially different in character in detail of conduct have be so much thrown together by circumstance that life of have almost become part of life of other although fact of mr harding residence at deanery have of late year thrown oftener into society of dean than of other son in law yet intimacy with archdeacon have be so much earlier memory of archdeacon be so much clearer that depended almost more upon rector of plumstead who be absent than did upon dean whom customarily saw day be not so with daughter nelly a have used to call have ever be favourite circumstance of joint life have be such that have never be further separated than from one street of barchester to that only for very short period of married life of mr arabin first husband for be soft tender therefore with mr harding be in world be charming to looked to youngest daughter for authority guidance wisdom for information a to what be going on in world have still turned to son in law archdeacon a have done for nearly forty year for so long have archdeacon be potent a clergyman in diocese throughout whole duration of such potency word have be law to mr harding in most of affair of life law generally to be obeyed if sometimes to be broken still law now when be so nearly over must become unhappy if archdeacon visit be far between dr grantly when found that be so must not allow that must be far between put so much in mind of father archdeacon said to wife one day be not so old a father be when died by many year said mr grantly think one see that difference yes therefore say that may still live for year father when took to bed at last be manifestly near death wonder with be that continued to live so long do not remember how london doctor be put out because prophecy be not fulfilled remember well a if be yesterday in way there be great difference father who be physically much stronger man did not succumb so easily likeness be in character there be same mild sweetness becoming milder sweeter a increased in age sweetness never must believe much evil must believe le still a weakness of age came on amount of evidence must induce father to think that mr crawley stole that money be said of course before telegram have come from venice a far a go agree with said mr grantly who have own reason for choosing to believe mr crawley to be innocent if son dear be to marry man daughter will be a well that must at least be able to say that believe that man to be thief be here there said archdeacon jury must decide jury in barsetshire will decide for said mr grantly be sick of mr crawley be sorry spoke of said archdeacon look at mr proudie will agree that be not most charming woman in world certainly be not said mr grantly who be anxious to encourage husband if must do so without admitting anything might injure afterwards be at one time violently insolent to father even bishop thought to trample upon do remember bishop preaching against father chaunting if ever forget archdeacon slapped closed fist against open hand dear what be good of being violent now paltry little fool will be long enough before such chaunt a be heard in english cathedral again then mr grantly got up kissed husband somewhat negligent of kiss went on with speech father remembers nothing of if there be single human being who shed tear in barchester for woman believe be father be same with mine came to at last must not bear to speak to of shortcoming a to one of own clergyman might a well have pricked with penknife yet say men become heartless unfeeling a grow old do suppose yes heartless unfeeling do a bodily strength fails power of control becomes lessened natural aptitude of man pronounces more clearly take that be have mr proudie lived to be hundred fifty must have spoken spiteful lie on deathbed then mr grantly told that husband must live to be hundred fifty must still be expressing horror of mr proudie even on deathbed a soon a letter from mr arabin have reached plumstead archdeacon wife arranged that must go together to deanery there be double tidings to be told of mr crawley assured innocence also of mr arabin instant return a went together various idea be passing through mind in reference to marriage of son with grace crawley be now reconciled to mr grantly have long ceased to feel opposition to even though have not seen grace archdeacon be prepared to give way have not promised that in certain case must give way have not that case now come to pas have wish to go back from word have difficulty in that liked to make affair of life matter for enjoyment almost for triumph how be to be triumphant over marriage how even be to enjoy seeing that have opposed so bitterly poster though be now pulled down have be up on barn end wall patent ala too patent to world of barsetshire what will mr crawley do now do suppose said mr grantly what will do yes must go on at hogglestock what else said archdeacon be pity something must not be done for after have undergone how on earth can be expected to live there with wife family private mean to archdeacon made answer mr grantly have spoken almost immediately upon quitting plumstead silence be continued till carriage have entered suburb of city then mr grantly spoke again asking question with internal trepidation however managed to hide from husband when poor papa doe go what will do about st ewold now st ewold be rural parish lying about two mile out of barchester living of be in gift of archdeacon to archdeacon have presented father in law under certain circumstance need not be repeated in last chronicle of barsetshire have not be written in other chronicle when poor papa doe go what will do about st ewold said mr grantly trembling inwardly word too much might a well knew settle question against mr crawley for ever be to postpone word till too late question must be settled a fatally have thought about said sharply like thinking of such thing while incumbent be still living oh archdeacon archdeacon unless other chronicle be false chronicle how hast thou forgotten thy past life particularly not when incumbent be father said archdeacon mr grantly said nothing more about st ewold must have said a much a have intended to say if have succeeded in making archdeacon understand st ewold must be very nice refuge for mr crawley after misery have endured at hogglestock learned a entered deanery that mr baxter have already heard of mr arabin return o yes ma'be mr harding got letter hisself got separate from venice ma'be when master be to come nobody seems to know mr baxter knew that dean have gone to jerusalem be inclined to think that from such distant bourne there be return for traveller east be always further than west in estimation of mr baxters of world have dean gone to canada must have thought that might come back to morrow still there be news to be told of mr crawley there be also joy to be expressed at sudden coming back of much wished for mistress of deanery be so good of to come together said mr harding thought must be too many for said archdeacon too many o dear like to have people by a for voice noise that more better be weak be weak in leg think will ever stand again yes will said archdeacon have brought good news said mr grantly be not good news that nelly will be home week ca understand what joy be to used to think sometimes at night must never see again that must come back in time be have have to wish for be lying on back a spoke pressed withered hand together above bedclothes must not begin immediately to tell of mr crawley a soon a mind have turned away from thought of absent daughter mr grantly again reverted to news have come to tell about mr crawley papa what about be quite innocent knew dear always said so did not always say so archdeacon indeed did will give that credit be found out asked mr harding a far a be concerned everything be found out said mr grantly eleanor gave cheque nelly gave to yes papa dean meant to give fifty pound seems got to be soft of heart made seventy have cheque by put into envelope with note of stringer people seem to have stolen cheque from mr soames said archdeacon o dear hope not somebody must have stolen papa have hoped not susan said mr harding archdeacon mr grantly knew that be useless to argue with on point so let that go then came to discus mr crawley present position mr harding ventured to ask question two a to grace chance of marriage did not often interfere in family arrangement of son in law never did so when family arrangement be concerned with high matter have hardly opened mouth in reference to marriage of august lady who be now marchioness of hartletop of lady anne wife of rev charles grantly who be always prodigiously civil to speaking to very loud a though be deaf because be old bringing cheap present from london of did not take much heed of rarely said word of child to of daughter now grandson henry grantly be going to marry girl of whom felt that might speak without impropriety suppose will be match wo dear not doubt about said mr grantly mr harding looked at son in law son in law said nothing archdeacon did not even frown only moved little uneasily in chair dear dear what comfort must be said old man have not seen yet said mr grantly archdeacon declares that be grace rolled into one never said anything half so absurd replied archdeacon really be quite in love with papa said mr grantly confessed to that gave kiss only saw once for five minute must like to give kiss said mr harding so will papa will bring here on purpose a soon a ever thing be settled mean to ask to plumstead do though how nice how happy henry will be if come of course will will lose time in bringing over to nelly must see of course a be leaving room mr harding called archdeacon back taking by hand spoke one word to in whisper like to interfere said might not mr crawley have st ewold archdeacon took up old man hand kissed then followed wife out of room without making answer to mr harding question three day after mr arabin reached deanery joy at return be very great dear have be sick for said mr harding oh papa ought not to have gone nay dear say must make happy that must be prisoner here for ever be only when seemed to get so weak that thought about felt that must be near when bade not to go to cathedral more if have be here must have gone with papa be better a be know now be not fit for when sister came to never

have resigned living of palace people be doing duty can have again oh yes can have again for matter of need simply give back letter only be so odd so unlike other people have tried to live there have failed be now in debt wonder whether grantly must give st ewold wish must must ask must not dare a to matter of cheque dean acknowledged to wife at last that have recollection of having told that have made sum of money up to seventy pound feel certain of now think may have done so be quite sure must not have done without telling replied at rate said nothing of cheque pleaded dean suppose did said mr arabin thought that cheque be like other money will know better for future on following morning dean rode over to hogglestock a drew near to house of old friend spirit flagged for to tell truth dreaded meeting since day on have brought mr crawley from curacy in cornwall into diocese of barchester friend have be trouble to rather than joy trouble have be trouble of spirit altogether not at of pocket must willingly have picked crawleys out from pecuniary mud into be ever falling time after time have be possible for though dean be hardly to be called rich man line have fallen to not only in pleasant place in easy circumstance mr crawley embarrassment though overwhelming to be not so great a to have be heavy to dean in striving to do have always failed have always suffered have generally be rebuked crawley must attempt to argue with a to improper allotment of church endowment declaring that did not do so with reference to own circumstance simply because subject be one naturally interesting to clergyman must do a be waving off with hand offer of immediate assistance be indispensable then there have be scene between dean mr crawley terribly painful have taken place in direct disobedience to husband positive injunction sir have once said to dean request that nothing may pas from hand to hand of wife tush tush dean have answered will have tushing pshawing on matter man wife be very own breath of nostril blood of heart rib from body be for to rule wife tell will not have after that gift have come from hand of mr arabin then again after in direst hour of need crawley have

since day two have not met other since day new trouble have come arabin a yet knew little of manner in have be borne except crawley have felt compelled to resign living of hogglestock knew nothing of mr proudie persecution except what gathered from fact of clerical commission of have be informed must imagine that mr proudie must not lie easy on bed while clergyman be doing duty almost under nose who be guilty of double offence of being accused of theft of having be put into living by dean dean therefore a rode on pictured to old friend in terrible condition might be that even now that condition must hardly have be improved be no longer suspected of being thief must have money in pocket might well be that suffering must have made almost mad dean also got down left horse at farm yard

not talk more of can never forget have be beggar need not make beggary matter of conversation hope holy land have fulfilled expectation have more than done so said dean bewildered by sudden change for myself be of course impossible must ever visit scene except to immediate work may call never in world new jerusalem be still within reach if be not forfeited by pride obstinacy old jerusalem can never

see in paper review lady at framley be so good a to send to wife interest much have ambition to climb mont blanc matterhorn rome make mouth water little even athens much can realize without seeing athens must show can fancy that existing truth must destroy more than must build up to have stood on calvary know where calvary be said dean fancy must know must know enough said illogical unreasonable mr crawley be true that can look over from spot on stood a came across brow of hill see huge stone of temple placed there by solomon men a saw right across brook cedron be not be there crawley just a knowledge of tell in privilege of seeing place can almost envy man money last word uttered after pause have be about to say that under such temptation must almost envy man promotion bethought that on occasion a must be better that must spare dean now if wish will go in fancy that see wife at window a though be waiting for so saying strode on along little path dean be fain to follow even though have said so little of that have intended to say a soon a be with mr crawley repeated apology about cheque found better able to explain than must do when alone with husband of course have be fault said oh said mr crawley how can have be in fault when only object be to do good nevertheless dean took blame upon own shoulder rather upon of wife declared to be responsible for trouble about cheque let go said crawley after sitting for awhile in silence let pas can not wonder crawley said dean must have felt obliged to speak of for future will be well that must be forgotten said crawley if not forgotten treated a though forgotten now dean what must do about living just resume a though nothing have happened may hardly be done without bishop authority speak of course with deference to higher better information on such subject experience in taking up laying down of living have not be extended seemeth to that though may certainly be in power to nominate again to perpetual curacy of parish presuming patronage to be unlimited not to reach in rotation only yet bishop may demand to institute again must so demand unless plea to permit that letter to will be revoked cancelled of course will do anything of kind must know circumstance a well a do at present tell that be much afflicted by death of wife therefore can hardly be expected to take immediate action there came here on last sunday one mr snapper lordship chaplain know snapper said dean snapper be not bad little fellow say nothing of being bad friend merely mention fact that on sunday morning last performed service in church on sunday previous one mr thumble be here know thumble too said dean at least know something about have be thorn in side said mr crawley unable to restrain expression of dislike when mr thumble name be mentioned nay dear nay allow use of language so strong against brother flesh at time be somewhat prone to fester little thorn made very sore be horrible man said jane almost in whisper word be distinctly audible by dean need not come more said arabin be where fear differ think must come others in place till bishop will have expressed pleasure to contrary have submitted to lordship having done so feel that can not again go up into pulpit till will have authorized to do so for time arabin combated bishop believing then now that put forth hand against after fashion law have not sanctioned made bold to stand in presence to tell must not obey except in thing legal afterwards when proceeded formally through action of commission submitted regard still a being under submission be impossible to shake arabin remained there for more than hour trying to pas on to subject being constantly brought back by mr crawley to fact of own dependent position must condescend to supplicate bishop be surmised duty of dr tempest together with other four clergyman to report to bishop on question of alleged theft then doubtless bishop when have duly considered report a mr crawley seemed to think be essentially necessary have sufficiently recovered from grief at wife death must at leisure communicate decision to mr crawley nothing must be more complete than mr crawley humility in reference to bishop never seemed to be tired of declaring that have submitted then dean finding to be vain to expect to be left alone with mr crawley for moment in vain also to wait for proper opening for have to say rushed violently at other subject now mr crawley said mr arabin wish to come over to deanery for while stay with mr arabin be too kind said mr crawley looking across at husband must like of thing said dean with perhaps more of good nature than of truth of course must have be knocked about good deal indeed have said mr crawley till be somewhat settled again think that change of scene must be good for of come crawley will talk to evening about jerusalem for a long a please then there will perhaps come back to something of pleasantness of old day a heard mr crawley eye became full of tear must not altogether hide what have endured during last four month have almost broken spirit burden have at last be too heavy for strength can not fancy crawley how often have thought of old day wished that might return have found very hard to get opportunity of saying so much to will say now may hardly be a say said crawley

perhaps most on face be to be found in wife gown in coat mr crawley said very gravely looking to right to left at face of of at own garment at hers straight before when have so spoken said not word

respect suppose that will be in bed for next four hour do a like about going be in hurry said johnny then sat down again stretched out leg made comfortable have be to see woman said madalina after pause what woman maria clutterbuck a must always call for can not bring to pronounce name of poor wretch who be done to death blew brain out in delirium tremens said johnny what made drink said madalina with emphasis never mind decline altogether to speak of scene a have have be driven at last to tell what thought of anything so callous so heartless so selfish so stone cold so childish never saw before maria be childish selfish always knew thought there be heart vestige of heart found to day that there be none none if please wo speak of more certainly not said johnny need not wonder that be tired feverish that sort of thing be fatiguing dare say know whether lose more than gain by strong emotion must rather die go beneath sod at once than live without said madalina be matter of taste said johnny be there that poor wretch be so deficient be thinking now moment of nothing creature comfort that tragedy have not even stirred pulse if pulse be stirred ever so must not make happy happy who be happy be happy johnny thought of lily dale paused before answered certainly be not happy be not going to talk about unhappiness to miss demolines of course be a jolly a sandboy said mr eames said madalina raising on sofa if can not express in language more suitable to occasion to scene than think that have better hold tongue just so though must not have chosen to use word so abruptly discourteous what did say jolly a sandboy there be nothing wrong in what meant be that think that world be very good sort of world that man can get along in very well if mind p q suppose be woman easier still suppose doe not mind p q woman always do do knowledge of woman go a far a doe tell fairly do think know anything about woman a asked question looked full into face shook lock smiled when shook lock smiled there be certain attraction about of john eames be fully sensible must throw special brightness into eye though probably betokened nothing truly beyond ill natured mischief seemed to convey promise of wit intellect mean to make boast about said johnny doubt whether know anything pretty simplicity of excellent lily dale have sufficed for never mind about said johnny impatiently mind about in least insight into sort of simplicity will not teach character of real woman can not learn flavour of wine by sipping sherry water for think that be simple own fairly if must have simplicity can not be to taste nobody like partridge always said johnny laughing understand sir though what say be not complimentary be willing to forgive that fault for truth consider to be always partridge can assure be a changeable a moon a fickle say nothing about sir leave to find out be man business to discover for if really do know aught of woman did not say that did if do will perhaps have discovered that woman may be a changeable a moon yet a true a sun that may flit from flower to flower quite unheeding while passion exists that passion fix at once do believe now looked into eye again did not smile did not shake lock oh yes be true enough when have lot of child then become steady a milestone child said madalina getting up walking about room do have know said johnny do mean to say sir must be milestone finger post said johnny to show fellow way ought to go walked twice across room without speaking then came stood opposite to still without speaking then walked about again what must woman better be than finger post a call with purpose nothing better of course though milestone to tell fellow distance be very good psha like idea of being milestone then can make up mind to be finger post john will be finger post for stood looked at for moment two with eye full of love a though be going to throw into arm must have done so doubt instantly have risen to leg a be after having gazed at for moment with love laden eye flung on sofa hid face among cushion have felt that be coming for last quarter of hour have felt also that be quite unable to help did not believe that must ever be reduced to marrying miss demolines did see plainly enough that be getting into trouble yet for life must not help moth who flutter round light know that be being burned yet can not fly away from when madalina have begun to talk to about woman in general then about have told that woman a even one so liable to disturbance of violent emotion might yet be a true honest a sun knew that ought to get up make escape did not exactly know how catastrophe must come be quite sure that if remained there must be called upon in way for declaration of sentiment that call must be one wit must not enable to answer with comfort be very well jesting about milestone jest brought nearer to precipice perceived that however ludicrous might be image word produced be clever enough in way to turn image to own purpose have called woman finger post forthwith have offered to come to be finger post to for life what be to say to be clear that must say something a at moment be sobbing violently must not pas offer by a joke woman will say that answer must have be very simple escape very easy men will understand that be not easy to reject even miss demolines when offer for matrimony moreover a johnny bethought at crisis of fate lady demolines be doubt at other side of drawing room door ready to stop must attempt to run away in meantime sob on sofa became violent still more violent have not even yet made up mind what to do when madalina springing to foot stood before with curl wildly waving arm extended let be a though be unsaid exclaimed john eames have not slightest objection nevertheless there be difficulty even in be simply to assent to latter proposition must not be that feminine nature of miss demolines must be outraged by so uncomplimentary acquiescence felt that ought at least to hesitate little to make pretence at closing upon rich offer have be made to only that be to show such pretence rich offer must doubt be repeated madalina have twitted in earlier part of interview with knowing nothing of nature of woman did know enough to feel assured that false step on part now must lead into very serious difficulty let be a though be unsaid why oh why have betrayed exclaimed madalina john now have risen from chair coming up to took her by arm spoke word compose said spoke in most affectionate voice stood very close to how easy be to bid do said madalina tell sea to compose when rage madalina said well what of madalina madalina have lost own respect for ever say that oh john why did ever come here why why did meet at fatal woman house meeting so why did not part a stranger sir why have come here to mother house day after day evening after evening if oh heaven what be saying wonder whether will scorn always will never scorn will pardon madalina there be nothing to pardon will love then without waiting for more encouraging reply unable probably to wait moment longer sunk upon bosom caught of course at moment drawing room door be opened lady demolines entered chamber john eames detected at glance skirt of old white dressing gown have seen whisking away on occasion of last visit at porchester terrace on present occasion lady demolines wore over short red opera cloak cap on head be ornamented with coloured ribbon what be said why be thus disturbed madalina lay motionless in johnny arm while old woman glowered at from under coloured ribbon mr eames what be that behold said illustration what be that behold daughter madam seems to be little unwell said johnny madalina kept foot firm upon ground did not for moment lose purchase against johnny waistcoat respiration came very strong came good deal stronger when mentioned fact that be not so well a might be unwell said lady demolines john be stricken at moment with conviction that ladyship must have passed early year of life upon stage must trifle with sir beware that trifle with with madalina mother said madalina still did not give up purchase voice seemed to come half from half from johnny come to mother then lady demolines hastened to daughter madalina between be gradually laid at length upon sofa work of laying out however be left almost entirely to stronger arm of mr john eames thanks mother said madalina have not a yet opened eye even for instant perhaps have better go now said johnny old woman looked at with eye asked whether did wish might get a plainly a though word have be pronounced of course will wait if can be of service said johnny must know more of sir before leave house said lady demolines saw that between there might probably be very bad quarter of hour in store for swore to that union of dragon tigress must extract from word must be taken a promise of marriage old woman be now kneeling by head of sofa johnny be standing close by side suddenly madalina opened eye opened very wide gazed around then slowly raised on sofa turned face first upon mother then upon johnny here mamma said dearest one be near be not afraid said ladyship afraid why must be afraid john own john mamma be own put out arm to a though calling to to come to thing be now very bad with john eames so bad that must have given considerable lump out of lord de guest legacy to be able to escape at once into street power of woman when chooses to use recklessly be for moment almost unbounded hope find little better said john struggling to speak a though be not utterly crushed by occasion lady demolines slowly raised from knee helping with hand against shoulder of sofa for though still very clever be old stiff then offered hand to johnny johnny cautiously took one of finding unable to decline son exclaimed before knew where be old woman have succeeded in kissing nose whisker son said again now time have come for facing dragon tigress in wrath if be to be faced at time for facing have certainly arrived fear that john heart sank low in bosom at moment quite understand said almost in whisper madalina put out one arm towards finger trembled lip be opened white row of interior ivory might be seen plainly at present conjuncture of affair spoke not word spoke not word arm remained stretched out towards finger did not cease to tremble understand said lady demolines drawing back looking in short open cloak like knight who have donned cuirass have forgotten to put on leg gear shook bright ribbon of cap a knight in wrath shake crest of helmet understand mr eames what be sir that understand there be misconception mean said johnny mother said madalina turning eye from recreant lover to tender parent trembling over still keeping hand extended

indeed be open to who chose to come who have only slightly known man refrained from pressing upon who have right to stand around coffin there be one other there whom faithful chronicler of barchester must mention before other one have reached spot sexton verger between have led in between among graf beneath cloister blind man very old with wondrous stoop who must have owned grand stature before extreme old age have bent placed sitting on stone in corner of archway a soon a shuffling of step reached ear raised with aid of stick stood during service leaning against pillar blind man be so old that might almost have be mr harding father be john bunce bedesman from hiram hospital none perhaps there have known mr harding better than have known when earth have be thrown on to coffin service be over be about to disperse mr arabin went up to old man taking hand between hers whispered word into ear oh miss eleanor said oh miss eleanor within fortnight also be lying within cathedral precinct so buried mr septimus harding formerly warden of hiram hospital in city of barchester of whom chronicler may say that city never knew sweeter gentleman better christian chapter lxxxii last scene at hogglestock illustration fortnight following mr harding death be passed very quietly at hogglestock for during time visitor made appearance in parish except mr snapper on sunday mr snapper when have completed service on first of sunday intimated to mr crawley opinion probably gentleman might wish to resume duty on following sabbath mr crawley however courteously declined to do anything of kind said that be quite out of question that must do so without direct communication made to from bishop by bishop order assize have of course gone by question of trial be over nevertheless a mr snapper said bishop have not a yet given order mr snapper be of opinion that bishop in day be not quite have spoken to bishop about bishop have told peevishly must say quite peevishly mr snapper have said that nothing be to be done at present mr snapper be not le clearly of opinion that mr crawley might resume duty to however mr crawley must not assent even during fortnight mr crawley have not remained altogether neglected two day after mr harding death have received note from dean in be advised not to resume duty at hogglestock for present of course can understand that have sad house here at present dean have said a soon a ever be able to move in matter will arrange thing for a comfortably a can will see bishop mr crawley have ambitious idea of comfort might accrue to beyond of honourable return to humble preferment at hogglestock nevertheless be in case minded to do a dean counselled have submitted to bishop must wait till bishop absolved from submission on day after funeral bishop have sent compliment to dean with expression of wish that dean must call upon on early day might be convenient with reference to position of mr crawley of hogglestock note be in bishop own handwriting be a mild civil a bishop note must be of course dean named early day for interview be necessary before went to bishop that must discus matter with archdeacon if st ewolds might be given to mr crawley hogglestock difficulty must all be brought to end archdeacon after funeral have returned to plumstead thither dean went to before saw bishop did succeed mr grantly between with very great difficulty in obtaining conditional promise have thought that when archdeacon became fully aware that grace be to be daughter in law must at once have be delighted to have opportunity of extricating from poverty clergyman with whom be fate to be so closely connected fought matter on twenty different point declared at first that a be primary duty to give to people of st ewolds best clergyman must select for must not give preferment to mr crawley because mr crawley in spite of zeal piety be man so quaint in manner so eccentric in mode of speech a not to be best clergyman whom must select what be old friend thorne to do with man in parish who wo drink glass of wine with for ullathorne seat of mr wilfred thorne who have be so guilty in matter of fox be situated in parish of st ewolds when mr grantly proposed that mr thorne consent must be asked archdeacon became very angry have never heard so unecclesiastical proposition in life be special duty to do best must for mr thorne be specially duty to do so without consulting mr thorne about a archdeacon objection have be argued simply on point of glass of wine dean mr grantly thought that be unreasonable have point to gain therefore only flattered be sure that mr thorne must like to have clergyman in parish who must be closely connected with archdeacon then dr grantly alleged that might find in trap what if conferred living of st ewolds on mr crawley after there must be marriage between son grace of course will be married said mr grantly be very well for to say that dear whole family be so queer that there be knowing what girl may do may take up other fad now refuse point blank have never taken up fad said mr grantly who now mounted almost to wrath in defence of future daughter in law be wrong to say that have have behaved beautifully a nobody know better than do then archdeacon gave way so far a to promise st ewolds must be offered to mr crawley a soon a grace crawley be in truth engaged to harry grantly after that dean went to palace there have never be quarrelling between bishop dean direct indirect indeed have dean ever quarrelled even with mr proudie have belonged to anti proudie faction have be brought into diocese by grantly interest therefore during mr proudie life time have always be accounted among enemy there have never be real intimacy between house house have be always asked to dine with other house once year have be understood that such dining be ecclesiastico official not friendly there have be same outside diocesan civility between even palace plumstead now when great chieftain of palace be more strength of palace faction be gone peace perhaps something more than peace amity perhaps might be more easily arranged with dean than with archdeacon in preparation for such arrangement bishop have gone to mr harding funeral now dean went to palace at bishop behest found lordship alone be received with almost reverential courtesy thought that bishop be looking wonderfully aged since last saw did not perhaps take into account absence of clerical sleekness be incidental to bishop private life in private room perhaps in certain measure to recent great affliction dean have be in habit of regarding dr proudie a man almost young for age having be in habit of seeing at best clothed in authority redolent of throne conspicuous a regarded apron outward sign of episcopality much of be now absent bishop a rose to greet dean shuffled with old slipper hair be not brushed so becomingly a used to be case when mr proudie be always near be necessary that word must be said by a to loss other have suffered mr dean said lordship allow to offer condolements in regard to death of very excellent clergyman most worthy gentleman father in law thank lord be excellent worthy suppose that will live to see man who be more so also have great terrible loss o mr dean yes yes indeed mr dean be loss hardly past prime of life ah yes just fifty six so strong be not at least everybody thought so yet be gone in minute gone in minute have held up head since mr dean be great loss lord must struggle to bear do struggle be struggling make one feel so lonely in great house ah often wish mr dean that have pleased providence to have left in humble parsonage where duty must have be easier than be here will not trouble with what be to do mr dean about poor mr crawley mr crawley be very old friend of mine very dear friend be ah very worthy man be sure one who have be much tried by undeserved adversity most severely tried lord sitting among potsherd like job have not mr dean well let hope that be over when accusation about robbery be brought against found bound to interfere have complaint to make on score hope not have not wished to be harsh what must do mr dean told that civil authority found evidence so strong against that must not be withstood be very strong thought that must at least be relieved sent for dr tempest who be rural dean then bishop remembering circumstance of interview with dr tempest a to have ever felt assured that one of result of be death of wife whereby there be longer left in palace of barchester sighed piteously looking up at dean with hopeless face nobody doubt lord that acted for best hope did think did now what will do have resigned living to to a hear being patron will simply be necessary think that must ask to have letter cancelled then a take there need be reinstitution can not think mr dean how much have thought about then dean unfolded budget explained to bishop how hoped that living of st ewolds be after ecclesiastical fashion attached to rectory of plumstead be now vacant by demise of mr harding might be conferred by archdeacon upon mr crawley be necessary to explain also that must not be done quite immediately in doing dean encountered little difficulty archdeacon said wished to be allowed week to think about therefore perhaps provision for duty at hogglestock might yet be made for few sunday bishop dean said might easily understand after what have occurred mr crawley must hardly wish to go again into pulpit unless did so a resuming duty must necessarily be permanent with to bishop assented be apparently struck with much wonder at choice made by archdeacon must have thought mr dean said that mr crawley be last man to have suited archdeacon choice archdeacon married sister lord oh ah yes put nomination of st ewolds at disposition be sure will be delighted to institute so worthy gentleman a mr crawley then dean took leave of bishop a will also poor dear bishop be inclined to think that be right in regret a to little parsonage not that failure at barchester present consciousness of lonely incompetence be mainly due to positive inefficiency on own part might have be sufficiently good bishop have not be that mr proudie be so much more than sufficiently good bishop wife will now say farewell to with hope that lopped tree may yet become green again to extent fruitful although beautiful head richness of waving foliage have be taken from about week after henry grantly rode over from cosby lodge to hogglestock have be just said that though assize have passed by though question of mr crawley guilt be now set aside visitor have of late made way over to hogglestock fancy grace crawley forgot in fulness of memory a to other thing mr harding of whose death heard have be lover grandfather that therefore there might possibly be delay have there be much said between mother daughter about lover doubt must have be explained grace be very reticent there be other matter in hogglestock household in day occupied mr crawley mind how be again to begin life for in very truth life a have existed with before have be brought to end grace remembered well sort of compact existed between lover compact have be made in very word between herself lover father complete in estimation a have be heaven opened to by henry grantly be offer have refused lest must bring disgrace upon disgrace be not certain if father must be made free from then then then henry grantly ought to come to be at foot with expedition possible to be reading of compact have once declared when speaking of possible disgrace might attach to family to name that poverty did not signify bit be not ashamed of father only of accusation against father therefore have hurried home when accusation be withdrawn desirous that lover must tell of love if chose to repeat such telling amidst poor thing of hogglestock not among chair table good dinner of luxurious framley mr robarts have given true interpretation to lady lufton of haste grace have displayed need not have be in so great hurry have be at home already above fortnight a yet have made sign at last said word to mother might not ask to go back to miss prettyman now mamma think dear have better wait till thing be little settled papa be to hear again from dean very soon see be in great sorrow at barchester about poor mr harding death grace said jane rushing into house almost speechless at moment here be on horseback know why jane must have talked about major grantly a simply there have be conversation among sister to justify in such mode of speech grace have not moment to put two two together so that might realize meaning of what mother have said nevertheless felt at moment that man coming a have done now have come with commendable speed how foolish have be with wretched impatience there be certainly tying horse up to railing mamma what be to say to nay dear be own friend of own making must say what think fit be not going think have better dear then went jane with jane opened door for major grantly mr crawley be away at hoggle end did not return till after major grantly have left parsonage jane a greeted grand gentleman whom have seen more than seen hardly knew what to say to when after minute hesitation told that grace be in there pointing to sitting room door felt that have be very awkward henry grantly however did not think feel awkwardness being conscious of small difficulty of own when however found that grace be alone task before at once lost half difficulty grace said be right to come to now know said can not tell dearest grace there be reason on earth now why must not be wife be there not know of none if can love saw father yes saw heard what said hardly remember what said kissed thought be very kind what little attempt henry grantly then made thinking that must not do better than follow closely example of so excellent father need not be explained with minuteness think that first effort be not successful grace be embarrassed retreated be not till have be compelled to give direct answer to direct question that submitted to allow arm round waist when have answered that question be almost more humble than becomes maiden who have just be wooed won maiden who have be wooed won generally think that be who have conquered chooses to be triumphant accordingly grace be even mean enough to thank lover know why must be so good to said because love said better than world why must be so good to a why must love be poor thing for man like to love have have wit to see that be not poor thing grace be thus have earned treasure girl be poor thing be rich treasure if love can make treasure will be treasure if love can make rich will be rich for after think have difficulty in following in father footstep after while mr crawley came in there be much pleasant talking among while henry grantly sat happily with love a though waiting for mr crawley return though be there nearly morning mr crawley did not return think like brickmakers better than anybody in world except ourselves said grace know how will manage to get on without friend before grace have said major grantly have told story have produced letter from father addressed to mr crawley of reader will have copy although at time letter have not be opened letter be a follows plumstead rectory may dear sir will no doubt have heard that mr harding vicar of st ewolds who be father of wife of mr arabin have be taken from loss to of so excellent so dear man have be very great have conferred with friend dean of barchester a to new nomination venture to request acceptance of preferment if must suit to move from hogglestock to st ewolds may be a well that must state plainly reason for making offer to gentleman with whom be not personally acquainted mr harding on deathbed suggested moved thereto by what have heard of cruel undeserved persecution to have lately be subjected a also on point be very urgent in what said by character bear in diocese for zeal piety may also add that close connection a understand be likely to take place between family mine have be additional reason for taking step long friendship have existed between wife brother in law dean of barchester be third st ewolds be worth l per annum besides house be sufficiently commodious for moderate family population be about twelve hundred of more than half consists of person dwelling in outskirt of city for parish run almost into barchester will be glad to have reply with a little delay a may suit convenience in event of accepting offer sincerely trust may be enabled to do will hope to have early opportunity of seeing with reference to institution to parish allow also to say to to mr crawley that if have be correctly informed a to that other event to have alluded hope that may have early opportunity of making personally acquainted with parent of young lady who be to be so dear to a have met daughter may perhaps be allowed to send kindest love if a daughter in law come up to impression gave at first meeting at rate will be satisfied have honour to be dear sir most faithful servant theophilus grantly letter archdeacon have shown to wife by whom have not be very warmly approved nothing mr grantly have said must be prettier than what archdeacon have said about grace mr crawley doubt must be satisfied with mr crawley be such strange man will be stranger than take to be if doe not accept st ewolds said archdeacon in offering said mr grantly have not said word of own high opinion of merit have not very high opinion of said archdeacon father have have said so a have most profound respect for father opinion in such matter have permitted that to overcome own hesitation be pretty from husband to wife a regarded father who have now gone from therefore mr grantly accepted without further argument reader may probably feel assured that archdeacon have never during joint life acted in church matter upon advice given to by mr harding be probably case also that living must have be offered to mr crawley if nothing have be said by mr harding on subject did not become mr grantly even to think of archdeacon having made gracious speech about father be not again asked to alter letter suppose will accept said mr grantly must think that probably may said archdeacon so grace knowing what be purport of letter sat with between finger while lover sat beside full of various plan for future be first lover present to what present be comfort happiness pleasant home for family st ewolds be best house in world said major because be old what call piecemeal be very pretty certainly nice be just sort of parsonage dream about said jane garden be pleasant with old tree said major always dream about old tree said jane only be afraid be too old to be let to climb up now mr crawley said very little sat by with eye full of tear be possible that at last before world have closed upon be to enjoy something again of comfort have known in early year to be again surrounded by decency of life of late have be almost banished from home by poverty various plan for future for immediate future be very startling grace be to go over at once to plumstead whither edith have be already transferred from cosby lodge be very well there be nothing very startling impracticable in framley lady having none of doubt a to what be coming have for while perplexed grace have taken little liberty with wardrobe enabled visit to be made without overwhelming difficulty major be equally eager at rate equally imperious in requisition for visit from mr mr crawley to plumstead rectory mr crawley did not dare to put forward plain unadorned reason against a mr crawley have done when discussing subject of visit to deanery must quite venture to explain that feared that archdeacon husband must hardly mix well together in society with whom indeed be possible that husband must mix well after long hardly tried seclusion must only plead that husband be so little used to going out that feared feared feared knew not what will get over said major almost contemptuously be only first plunge be disagreeable perhaps major did not know how very disagreeable first plunge may be at two o'clock henry grantly got up to go must very much like to have seen fear can not wait longer a be patience of horse have be surprising then grace walked out with to gate put hand upon bridle a mounted thought how wonderful be power of fortune that goddess must have sent so gallant gentleman to be lord lover declare quite believe even yet said in letter wrote to lily dale night be four before mr crawley returned to house then be very weary there be many sick in day at hoggle end have gone from cottage to cottage through day giles hoggett be almost unable to work from rheumatism still be of opinion that doggedness might carry on be be deal o ' service to muster crawley said hears about if have be dogged where 'd be now with giles hoggett others have remained day now came home weary beaten will tell first grace have said then will give letter wife be first to tell of good fortune be coming flung into old chair a soon a entered asked for bread tea jane have already gone for dear said wife have have visitor here josiah visitor what visitor grace own friend henry grantly grace come here may kiss bless said very solemnly must seem that world be going to be very good to papa must read letter first before kiss own darling then knelt at foot see said taking letter be from lover father peradventure signifies consent must be surely needful before such marriage must be seemly illustration peradventure signifies consent be about papa at not about if so must be most unpromising in case be best darling then kissed blessed slowly opened letter wife have now come close to be standing over touching so that also must read archdeacon letter grace who be still in front of must see working of face a read even must not tell whether be gratified offended dismayed when have got a far a first offer of presentation ceased reading for while looked round about room a though lost in thought let see what further writes to then said after that continued letter slowly to end nay child be in error in saying that wrote not about 't be in writing of have put real heart into word writes a though home must be welcome to doe not make st ewolds welcome to papa make welcome to accept if may use word after ordinary somewhat faulty parlance of mankind will accept of course know not that dear acceptance of cure of soul be thing not to be decided on in moment a be colour of garment shape of toy must condescend to take thing from archdeacon hand if thought that bestowed simply that father of daughter in law might no longer be accounted poor doe say that papa give a collateral reason basing offer first on kindly expressed judgment of one who be now no more then refers to friendship of dean if believed that judgment of late father in law in so weighty matter be best to be relied upon of be at command then must have done well to trust to in such case must have bolstered up good ground for action with collateral support be weak worse than weak however will have best consideration whereunto hope that wisdom will be given where only such wisdom can be have josiah said wife to when be alone will not refuse not willingly not if may be accepted ala need not urge when temptation be so strong chapter lxxxiii mr crawley be conquered be more than week before archdeacon received reply from mr crawley during time dean have be over at hogglestock more than once a have also mr arabin lady lufton younger there have be letter written without end archdeacon have be nearly beside man who pretend to conscientious scruple of kind be not fit to have parish have said to wife wife understood what meant trust that reader may also understand in ordinary cutting of block very fine razor be not appropriate instrument archdeacon moreover loved temporality of church a temporality church be beautiful to because one man by interest might have thousand year while man equally good without interest must only have hundred liked men who have interest great deal better than men who have not have be willing to admit poor perpetual curate who have so long be kept out in cold within pleasant circle be warm with ecclesiastical good thing man hesitated because of scruple a dean told always button up pocket when hear of scruple archdeacon said at last mr crawley condescended to accept st ewolds reverend dear sir said in letter for personal benevolence of offer made to in letter of instant beg to tender most grateful thanks a also for generous kindness to in telling of high praise bestowed upon by gentleman who be now more whose character have esteemed whose good opinion value there be methinks something inexpressibly dear to in recorded praise of dead for further instance of friendship of dean of barchester be also thankful since receipt of letter have doubted much a to fitness for work have proposed to entrust to not from feeling that parish of st ewolds may be beyond intellectual power because latter circumstance of life have be of nature so strange perplexing that have left somewhat in doubt a to own aptitude for going about among men without giving offence becoming stumbling block nevertheless reverend dear sir if after confession on part of certain faulty demeanour with know well that be afflicted be still willing to put parish into hand will accept charge instigated to do so by advice of whom have consulted on subject in thus accepting hereby pledge to vacate at month warning must be called upon by to do so at period within next two year must be so far successful during twenty four month a to have satisfied may then perhaps venture to regard preferment a own in perpetuity for life have honour to be reverend dear sir most humble faithful servant josiah crawley psha said archdeacon who professed that did not at like letter wonder what must say if sent month notice at next michaelmas be sure must go said mr grantly more fool said archdeacon at time grace be at parsonage in seventh heaven of happiness archdeacon be never rough to did make of harsh remark about father in presence before st ewolds be spoken of a home be to belong to crawleys for next twenty year mr grantly be very loving with lavishing upon pretty present word be prettier than present grace life have hitherto be so destitute of prettiness softness can hardly be have without money though money alone will not purchase that seemed to now that heaven rained graciousness upon be not that archdeacon watch lover chain mr grantly locket little toy from italy mr arabin brought to from treasure of deanery filled heart with undue exultation be not that revelled in new delight of silver gold shining gem that silver gold shining gem be constant indication to that thing have changed not only for for father mother brother sister felt now more sure than ever that must not have enjoyed love have accepted lover while disgrace of accusation against father remained now having waited till have passed away everything be new happiness to at last be settled that mr mr crawley be to come to plumstead came must be too long to tell now how gradually have come about changed state of thing made visit possible mr crawley have at first declared that thing be quite out of question if st ewolds be to depend upon st ewolds must be given up think that must have be impossible for to go direct from hogglestock to plumstead fell out after wise mr harding curate at st ewolds be nominated to hogglestock dean urged upon friend crawley expediency of giving up house a quickly a must do so gradually at time mr crawley have be forced into certain amount of intimacy with haunt of men have be twice thrice at barchester have lunched with dean have be at framley for hour two have be forced into communication with old mr thorne squire of new parish end of have be that have at last consented to transfer wife daughter to deanery for fortnight have preached one farewell sermon at hogglestock not a told audience a pastor have ceased to be now for two three month a old loving friend to whom use of former pulpit have be lent that might express thus among for last time sermon be very short be preached without book note never once paused for word halted in string rhythm of discourse dean be there declared to afterwards that have not given credit for such power of utterance man can utter out of full heart crawley have answered in trumpery affair about heart be full if must only have heart full in other matter utterance thereanent must receive more attention to of dean made reply on day after crawleys took final departure from hogglestock brickmakers from hoggle end having assembled on occasion with purse containing seventeen pound seven shilling sixpence insisted on presenting to mr crawley a to there be little difficulty at deanery remained for fortnight how mr crawley under guidance of mr arabin have there so far trenched upon revenue of st ewolds a to provide for husband raiment fitting for worldly splendour of plumstead need not here be told in detail suffice to say raiment be forthcoming mr crawley found to be perplexed possessor of black dress coat in addition to long frock coming nearly to foot be provided for daily wear touching garment there have be discussion between dean new vicar dean have desired that must be curtailed in length vicar have remonstrated still with something of weakness of compliance in eye then dean have persisted surely price of cloth wanted to perfect comeliness of garment can not be much said vicar almost woefully after that dean relented comeliness of coat be made perfect new black long frock think mr crawley liked dress coat with suit complete perplexed sorely with new coat something also of new manner wife went over to plumstead leaving jane at deanery with mr arabin dean also went to plumstead arrived there not much before dinner a grace be there before first moment be not so bad before mr crawley have have time to feel lost in drawing room be summoned away to prepare for dinner for dinner for coat at deanery have be allowed to leave unworn must with heart might retire to rest said to wife when ceremony have be perfected say so go down take place with speak mind with a so well know how who among can do so well have be told said mr crawley that will take cock be lord of farmyard cock of walk when have daubed feather with mud will be thrashed by dunghill coward say not be ever cock of walk know that have daubed feather then went down among other poultry into farmyard at dinner be very silent answering however with sort of graceful stateliness word that mr grantly addressed to mr thorne from ullathorne be there also to meet new vicar a be also mr thorne very old sister miss monica thorne lady anne grantly be there having come with expressed intention that wife of two brother must know other with warmer desire think of seeing mr crawley of whom clerical world have be talking much since notice of accusation against have become general there be therefore ten twelve at dinner table mr crawley have not made one at board certainly since marriage went fairly smooth with till lady left room for though lady anne who sat at left hand have perplexed somewhat with clerical question have found that be not called upon for much more than monosyllabic response in heart feared archdeacon felt that when lady be gone archdeacon must not leave alone in silence a soon a door be closed first subject mooted be that of plumstead fox have be so basely murdered on mr thorne ground mr thorne have confessed iniquity have dismissed murderous keeper be serene greater on account be feasibility of discussing question archdeacon have good deal to say about then mr thorne turned to new vicar asked whether fox abounded in hogglestock have be asked a to rat mole must have known more about indeed sir know not whether there be fox in parish of hogglestock remember that ever saw one be animal whose habit have not watched there be earth at hoggle bush said major never knew without litter think know domestic whereabouts of fox in plumstead said archdeacon with ill natured intention of astonishing mr crawley of fox with two leg friend be speaking without doubt said vicar of st ewolds with attempt at grim pleasantry of have none at plumstead be speaking of dear old fellow with brush pas bottle mr crawley wo fill glass mr crawley passed bottle must not fill glass then dean looking up slily saw vexation written in archdeacon face parson whom archdeacon feared most of parson be parson who must fill glass then subject be changed be told that bishop have at last made reappearance on throne said archdeacon be in cathedral last sunday said dean doe ever mean to preach again never did preach very often said dean great deal too often from that people say said archdeacon never heard never will dare say have heard mr crawley have never have that good fortune mr archdeacon living a will now do so near to city may perhaps be enabled to attend cathedral service on holyday of church may not require prayer in own rural parish think that clergy of diocese must be acquainted with opinion with voice with very manner word of bishop a thing be now done be not possible must wish that there be occasion on bishop might assemble clergy preach to sermon adapted to use what do call bishop charge then be usually in printed form have received said mr crawley think have quite enough of kind of thing said archdeacon be man whose conversation be not pleasing to mr crawley said to wife night judge of too quickly josiah wife said there be so much of good in be kind generous think affectionate be of earth earthy when other lady have retired conversation at first fell on habit value of fox have be informed that in part fox be greatly prized a without fox to run before dog scampering over country be called hunting delight by quickness perhaps by peril of exercise be not relished by rider of wisdom taste herein displayed by hunter of day say nothing seemed to that in talking of fox dr grantly be master of subject thence topic glided to duty of bishop to question of preaching a to dr grantly be not slow in offering opinion thought must rather have heard talk about fox for week together said nothing more to knowing well how useless be to attempt to turn by argument to thinking kindness of archdeacon to personally demanded indulgence in expression even in formation of opinion respecting clerical peculiarity on next day however mr crawley having be summoned by archdeacon into library for little private conversation found that got on better with how archdeacon conquered may perhaps be best described by further narration of what mr crawley said to wife told that in regard to money matter a called have nothing to say only trusted that son be aware that daughter have money never must have bey dear crawley ' archdeacon said for of late there seems to have grown up in world habit of greater familiarity than think did prevail when last moved much among men bey dear crawley have enough for ' must stood on more equal ground said then a answered rose from chair stand ' said 'on only perfect level on such men can meet other be gentleman beir said rising also 'from bottom of heart agree with must not have spoken such word coming from who be rich to who be poor be honourable to one comfortable to other after that took down from shelf volume of sermon father published many year ago presented to have now under arm hath old bishop manuscript note will study carefully thus archdeacon have hit bird on wing chapter lxxxiv conclusion now only remains for to gather together few loose string tie together in knot so that work may not become untwisted early in july henry grantly grace crawley be married in parish church of plumstead great impropriety a to archdeacon grantly mr crawley must be got to assent for long time be at last carried not simply by union of mr grantly mr crawley even by assistance of mr arabin by strong intervention of old lady lufton of course miss crawley ought to be married from st ewolds vicarage when furniture have only half be got in how be possible when lady lufton thus spoke archdeacon gave way mr crawley have leg to stand upon henry grantly have not opinion upon matter told father that expected that must marry among that must be enough for a for grace nobody even thought of asking doubt whether must have heard anything about contest have not tidings of reached from lover married be at plumstead breakfast be given with luxuriance of plenty be so dear to archdeacon mind mr crawley be officiating priest with hand dropping before folded humbly told archdeacon when plumstead question have be finally settled in opposition to wish that must fain perform ceremony by dearest daughter must be bound to marriage duty who else must said archdeacon mr crawley muttered that have not known how far reverend brother might have be willing to waive right archdeacon who be in high good humour having just bestowed little pony carriage on new daughter in law only laughed at if rumour be handed about family be true archdeacon before interview be over have poked mr crawley in rib mr crawley married archdeacon assisted dean gave away bride rev charles grantly be there also a there be a matter of course cloud of curate floating in distance henry grantly be perhaps to be excused for declaring to wife when pair have escaped that surely couple have ever be so tightly buckled since marriage have first become church ceremony soon after mr mr crawley became quiet at st ewolds a think contented happiness began very quickly though have be greatly broken by trouble first sight have of husband in new long frock coat went far to restore while be declaring to be cock so daubed with mud a to be incapable of crowing be congratulating on seeing husband once more clothed a became position be lucky too a regarded squire house for mr thorne be old quiet old fashioned miss thorne be older though be not exactly quiet be very old fashioned indeed so that there grew to be pleasant friendship between miss thorne mr
