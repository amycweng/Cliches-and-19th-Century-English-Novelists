demand from to effect of course have nothing of own never must have anything mr benjamin knew a for payment of debt by lady linlithgow who for countess be a poor a job mr benjamin be quite sure did not expect anything of kind then lizzie paused mr benjamin with sweetest wittiest of smile suggested that perhaps miss greystock be going to be married lizzie with pretty maiden blush admitted that catastrophe be probable have be asked in marriage by sir florian eustace now mr benjamin knew a world knew that sir florian eustace be very rich man indeed man in degree embarrassed who must pay amount of jeweller bill for claim might be made upon well what did miss greystock want mr benjamin did not suppose that miss greystock be actuated simply by desire to have old bill paid by future husband miss greystock wanted loan sufficient to take jewel out of pawn must then make herself responsible for full amount due mr benjamin said that must make few inquiry wo betray said lizzie for match might be off mr benjamin promised to be more than cautious there be not so much of falsehood a might have be expected in statement lizzie greystock made to jeweller be not true that be of age therefore future husband must be legally liable for debt might then contract be not true that sir florian eustace have asked in marriage two little blemish in statement must be admitted be true that sir florian be at foot that by proper use of various charm pawned jewel included might bring to offer mr benjamin made inquiry acceded to proposal did not tell miss greystock that have lied to in

be appropriated to earl of linlithgow son of countess young man who passed perhaps five night in town during year other inmate there be none besides aunt niece four servant of whom one be lizzie own maid why must such countess have troubled with custody of such niece simply because countess regarded a duty lady linlithgow be worldly stingy ill tempered selfish mean lady linlithgow must cheat butcher out of mutton chop cook out of month wage if must do so with slant of legal wind in favour must tell number of lie to carry point in what believed to be social success be said of that cheated at card in back biting venomous old woman between bond street park lane must beat more wonderful still venomous old man at club nevertheless recognised certain duty performed though hated went to church not merely that people might see there a to in truth cared nothing because thought be right took in lizzie greystock whom hated almost a much a did sermon because admiral wife have be sister recognised duty having thus bound to lizzie who be beauty of course became first object of life to get rid of lizzie by marriage though must have liked to think that lizzie must be tormented day though thoroughly believed that lizzie deserved to be tormented set heart upon splendid match must at rate be able to throw daily in niece teeth that splendour be of doing now marriage with sir florian eustace must be very splendid therefore be unable to go into matter of jewel with rigour in other circumstance must certainly have displayed match with sir florian eustace for match came to be be certainly very splendid sir florian be young man about eight twenty very handsome of immense wealth quite unencumbered moving in best circle popular so far prudent that never risked fortune on turf in gambling house with reputation of gallant soldier most devoted lover there be two fact concerning might might not be taken a objection be vicious be dying when friend intending to be kind hinted latter circumstance to lady linlithgow countess blinked winked nodded then swore that have procured medical advice on subject medical advice declared that sir florian be not more likely to die than

consumption have swept hecatomb of victim from family still be grand people never be afraid of death then sir florian fell in love discussing matter with brother who be perhaps only intimate friend declared that if girl loved must give to must make what atonement must to her for own early death by princely settlement john eustace who be somewhat nearly concerned in matter raised objection to proposal there be ever something grand about eustaces sir florian be grand gentleman surely must have be dull of intellect slow of discernment blear eyed in way about town when took lizzie greystock of woman whom must find in world to be purest truest noblest have be said of sir florian that did not believe in virtue freely expressed disbelief in virtue of woman around in virtue of woman of rank believed in mother sister a though be heaven born be one who must believe in wife a though be queen of heaven did believe in lizzie greystock thinking intellect purity truth beauty perfect in degree be combined in intellect beauty be there for purity truth how must have be that one a sir florian eustace must have be so blind sir florian be not indeed clever man believed to be fool believing to be fool desired nay painfully longed for of result of cleverness might thought come to from contact with clever woman lizzie read poetry well read verse to sitting very near to almost in dark with shaded lamp throwing light on book be astonished to find how sweet thing be poetry by must never read line a came from lip seemed to charm be new pleasure one though have ridiculed have so often coveted then told of such wondrous thought such wondrous joy in world must come from thinking be proud have said haughty be essentially modest humble in self estimation how divine be creature whose voice to be a of goddess then spoke out to with face little turned from must be wife before answered let listen to have told that early death must probably be fate did not feel that must be so sometimes be ill very ill often be well if must run risk with must endeavour to make such recompense a might come from wealth speech made be somewhat long a made hardly looked into face be necessary to that must be made to know by signal from how be going with feeling a spoke of danger there came gurgling little trill of wailing from throat soft almost musical sound of woe seemed to add unaccustomed eloquence to word when spoke of own hope sound be somewhat changed be still continued when alluded to disposition of fortune be at foot not that said not that lifted with arm round waist tried to tell what must be duty to do for escaped from arm must not listen to when began to talk of love again stood with forehead bowed against bosom of course engagement be then thing accomplished still cup might slip from lip father be now dead ten month what answer must make when common pressing petition for early marriage be poured into ear be in july must never do that must be left unmarried to rigour of winter looked into face knew that have cause for fear oh heaven if golden hope must fall to ground must come to be known only a girl who have be engaged to late sir florian pressed marriage on same ground tell said

must certainly be paid by whom must not be paid without understanding much conceiving more a to cause nature how much really did understand be never quite aware did know that detected in positive falsehood might certainly have managed matter better than did have admitted everything there might probably have be few word about did not however understand nature of note have signed thought that

anxious that must be encouraged to discreet living though feared many thing thought that have ground for open complaint eustace people be forbearing hoped best d necklace john eustace have said bishop unfortunately have heard say john said prelate be to become of bauble might express opinion in more sensible language beg lordship pardon said john only mean to say that think must trouble ourselves about few stone family lawyer mr camperdown must by mean take view of matter be however generally thought that young widow opened campaign more prudently than have be expected now a so much have be said of character fortune special circumstance of lizzie greystock who became lady eustace a bride lady eustace a widow mother within space of twelve month may be a well to give description of person habit such a be at period in story be supposed to have commencement must be understood in first place that be very lovely much more so indeed now than when have fascinated sir florian be small taller than looked to be for form be perfectly symmetrical foot hand might have be taken a model by sculptor figure be lithe soft slim slender if have fault be that have in too much of movement there be who said that be almost snake like in rapid bending almost too easy gesture of body for be much given to action to expression of thought by motion of limb might certainly have made way a actress have fortune called upon to earn bread in fashion voice must have suited stage be powerful when called upon for power at same time flexible capable of much pretence at feeling must bring to whisper must almost melt heart with tenderness a have melted sir florian when sat near to reading poetry then must raise to pitch of indignant wrath befitting lady macbeth when husband ventured to rebuke ear be quite correct in modulating tone knew must have be by instinct for culture in such matter be small how to use voice so that tenderness wrath must be misapplied there be piece in verse that must read thing not wondrously good in so that must ravish must so look at a did that must hardly dare to avert eye to return gaze sir florian have not known whether to do one thing other have therefore seized in arm face be oval somewhat longer than oval with little in perhaps nothing in of brilliancy of colour call complexion yet shade of countenance be ever changing between softest most transparent white richest mellowest shade of brown be only when simulated anger be almost incapable of real anger that must succeed in calling thinnest streak of pink from heart to show that there be blood running in vein hair be nearly black in truth with more of softness of lustre than ever belong to hair be really black wore bound tight round perfect forehead with one long love lock hanging over shoulder form of head be so good that must dare to carry without chignon adventitious adjunct from artiste shop very bitter be in consequence when speaking of head gear of other woman chin be perfect in round not over long a be case with so many such face utterly spoiling symmetry of countenance lacked dimple therefore lacked feminine tenderness mouth be perhaps faulty in being too small at least lip be too thin there be wanting from mouth that expression of eager speaking truthfulness full lip will often convey teeth be without flaw blemish even small white delicate perhaps be shown too often nose be small struck many a prettiest feature of face so exquisite be moulding of so eloquent so graceful slight inflation of transparent nostril eye in thought that lustre of beauty lay be blue clear bright a cerulean water be long large eye very dangerous to who knew how to read face there be danger plainly written in poor sir florian have not known in truth charm of face did not lie in eye be felt by many even who must not read book fluently be too expressive too loud in demand for attention lacked tenderness how few there be among woman few perhaps also among men who know that sweetest softest tenderest truest eye woman can carry in head be green in colour lizzie eye be not tender be true be surmounted by most wonderfully pencilled eyebrow that ever nature unassisted planted on woman face have said that be clever must add that have in truth studied much spoke french understood italian read german played well on harp moderately well on piano sang at least in good taste in tune of thing to be learned by reading knew much having really taken diligent trouble with have learned much poetry by heart must apply forgot nothing listened to everything understood quickly be desirous to show not only a beauty a wit there be men at time who declared that be simply cleverest handsomest woman in england a independent young woman be perhaps one of richest chapter iii lucy although first two chapter of new history have be devoted to fortune personal attribute of lady eustace historian begs reader not to believe that opulent aristocratic becky sharp be to assume dignity of heroine in forthcoming page that there will be heroine historian will not take upon to assert if there be heroine heroine will not be lady eustace poor lizzie greystock a men double own age who have known a forward capricious spoilt child in father lifetime must still call did so many thing made so many effort caused so much suffering to others suffered so much throughout scene with be about to deal that story can hardly be told without giving prominence of place have be assigned to in last two chapter doe chronicler dare to put forward lucy morris a heroine real heroine if be found possible to arrange drapery for becomingly to put that part enacted into properly heroic word will stalk in among at considerably later period of narrative when writer will have accustomed to flow of word have worked up to state of mind fit for reception of noble acting noble speaking in meantime let be understood that poor little lucy morris be governess in house of old lady fawn when beautiful young widow established in mount street lady eustace lucy morris have known other for many year have indeed be child together there having be old family friendship between greystocks morris when admiral wife be living lucy have a little girl of eight nine be guest have often be guest at deanery when lady eustace have gone down to bishop palace at bobsborough in order that heir to eustaces might be born under

of eighteen have gone out to be child governess then old lady fawn have heard of virtue lady fawn who have seven unmarried daughter running down from seven twenty to thirteen lucy morris have be hired to teach english french german something of music to two youngest miss fawn during visit at deanery when heir of eustaces be being born lucy be undergoing sort of probation for fawn establishment proposed engagement with lady fawn be thought to be great thing for lady fawn be known a miracle of virtue benevolence persistency good quality that possessed be so marked a to be worthy of being expressed with capital virtue be of extraordinarily high character that there be weakness in getting over perverting with folly even exaggeration when heard of excellency of miss morris from dean wife then after minutest investigation learned exact quality of young lady expressed willing to take lucy into house on special condition must be able to teach music up to certain point then be over said lucy to dean with pretty smile smile caused old middle aged men to fall in love with be not over at said dean have got four month organist be about a good teacher a there be in england be clever quick will teach so lucy went to bobsborough be afterwards accepted by lady fawn while be at deanery there sprung up renewed friendship between lizzie be indeed chiefly one sided friendship for lucy who be quick unconsciously capable of reading book to alluded in previous chapter be somewhat afraid of rich widow when lizzie talked to of old childish day quoted poetry spoke of thing romantic a be much given to do lucy felt that metal did not ring true then lizzie have ugly habit of abusing other friend behind back now lucy did not like to hear greystocks abused must say so be very well little minx lizzie must say playfully know that be ass lucy by mean thought that greystocks be ass be very strongly of opinion that one of be a far removed from being as a human being have ever known one be frank greystock barrister of frank greystock special let be hoped very short description must be given by by for present will be sufficient to declare that during short easter holiday spent at father house in bobsborough found lucy morris to be most agreeable companion remember position said mr dean to son position well what be position mother know what mean frank be a sweet girl a ever lived perfect lady with governess unless mean to marry must be more careful than with girl because may do world of mischief see that at if lady fawn knew that have admirer lady fawn must not let come into house

with fawn for quite indefinite time to come lady fawn eldest daughter mr hittaway have family of own having be married ten twelve year be quite probable that lucy might be transferred lady fawn fully appreciated treasure be ever have be conscientiously anxious to make lucy life happy thought that governess must not be desirous of marrying at rate till somewhat advanced period of life governess if be given to falling in love must hardly perform duty in life doubt not to be governess young lady free from embarrassing necessity of earning bread free to have lover husband must be upon whole nicer

lady fawn lived down at richmond year through in large old fashioned house with large old fashioned garden called fawn court after speech of hers to lucy frank greystock did not call again at fawn

of durham in lottery of dean can hardly be wealthy at bobsborough dean be endowed with large rambling picturesque uncomfortable house with l year in regard to personal property may be asserted of greystocks that never have be family of male must surely come to be dean admiral female must certainly find husband lived on good thing of world mixed with wealthy people never have money eustaces always have money bishop of bobsborough be wealthy dean be man very different from brother admiral who have never paid anybody anything dean did pay be little slow in payment money with be never very plentiful in circumstance became very expedient that frank greystock must earn bread early in life nevertheless have chosen profession be not often lucrative at first have be called to bar have gone be still going circuit in lie cathedral city of bobsborough bobsborough be not much of town be honoured with judge visit only other circuit frank began pretty well getting little work in london perhaps nearly enough to pay cost of circuit out of county in cathedral be situated began life after impecunious fashion for greystocks have be noted tailor robemakers bookseller gave trust did believe that must get money persistent tradesman did get did not actually hoist black flag of impecuniosity proclaim intention of preying generally upon retail dealer a uncle admiral have done became known a young man with whom money be tight have be going on for three four year before have met lucy morris at deanery be then eight twenty have be four year called be thirty when old lady fawn hinted to that have better not pay more visit at fawn court thing have much altered with of late at time of visit to deanery have made sudden start in profession corporation of city of london have brought action against bank of england with reference to certain alleged encroachment of action considerable a be in interest further notice need be taken here than be given by statement that great deal of money in cause have found way among lawyer of penetrated into pocket of frank greystock earned more than money better than money out of affair be attributed to by attorney that bank of england be saved from necessity of reconstructing bullion cellar have made character for industry in year after that bobsborough people be rather driven into corner in search of clever young conservative candidate for borough frank greystock be invited to stand be not thought that there be much chance of success dean be against frank liked honour glory of contest so did frank mother frank greystock stood at time in be warned away from fawn court have be nearly year in parliament of course doe interfere with one business have said to father then brings one business also man with seat in parliament who show that mean work will always get nearly a much work a can do such be frank exposition to father may perhaps not be found to hold water in case mr dean be of course delighted with son success so be girl woman like to feel that young men belonging to be doing something in world so that reflected glory may be theirs be pleasant to talk of frank a member for city brother always care much for brother success sister be generally sympathetic if frank must only marry money there be nothing might not achieve that must live to sit on woolsack be now almost certainty to dear old lady in order that might sit there comfortably be necessary that must at least abstain from marrying poor wife for there be fear at deanery also in regard to lucy morris that notion of marrying money a call frank said to second sister margaret be most disgusting idea in world be a easy to love girl who have something a one who have nothing said margaret be not because girl with money be scarce without be plentiful argument of suppose see force then margaret for moment be snubbed retired indeed frank think lady fawn be right said mother think be quite wrong if there be anything in wo be expelled by lady fawn interference do think must allow lady fawn to tell not to choose such such woman for wife be habit of seeing dear nobody love lucy morris better than do like dear frank must do for to make wife frank greystock be silent for moment then answered mother question be not quite sure whether must must not do think if be bold enough to marry now to trust to future must get lucy to be wife must be doing great thing doubt however whether have courage of made dean wife uneasy reader who have read so far will perhaps think that frank greystock be in love with lucy a lucy be in love with such be not exactly case to be in love a absolute well marked acknowledged fact be condition of woman more frequently more readily than of man such be not common theory on matter a be man business to speak woman business to be reticent woman be presumed to have kept heart free from load of love till may accept burthen with assurance that will become joy comfort to such presumption though may be very useful for regulation of conduct may not be always true come more within scope of woman mind than of man to think closely decide sharply on matter with man be often chance that settle question for resolve to propose to woman proposes without resolving because be close to frank greystock ridiculed idea of lady fawn interference in so high matter a love abstinence from love nevertheless have be made welcome guest at fawn court must undoubtedly have told love to lucy morris be not welcome guest have be banished a consequence of banishment have formed resolution in regard to lucy did not absolutely know whether be necessary to not lucy morris knew about moreover frequently happens with men that fail to analyse thing make out for clear definition of what feeling be what mean hear that man have behaved badly to girl when behaviour of have be guilty have resulted simply from want of thought have found certain companionship to be agreeable to have accepted pleasure without inquiry vague idea have floated across brain that world be wrong in supposing that such friendship can not exist without marriage question of marriage be simply friendship yet be friend to tell that intended to give in marriage elsewhere must suffer pang of jealousy must imagine to be horribly ill treated to have such friend friend whom can not will not make wife be injury to to be simply delight excitement in life thing to be known to only not talked of to others source of pride inward exultation be joy to think of when wake consolation in little trouble dispels weariness of life make green spot of holiday within daily work be indeed death to doe not know frank greystock did think that must not marry lucy morris without making imprudent plunge into deep water yet felt that lady fawn be ill natured old woman for hinting to that have better not for present continue visit to fawn court of course understand mr greystock have said meaning to be civil when miss morris have left must ever leave must be most happy to see what on earth must take to fawn court if lucy be not there said to not choosing to appreciate lady fawn civility frank greystock be at time nearly thirty year old be good looking not strikingly handsome man thin of moderate height with sharp grey eye face clean shorn with exception of small whisker with wiry strong dark hair be already beginning to show tinge of grey very opposite in appearance to late friend sir florian eustace be quick ready witted self reliant not over scrupulous in outward thing of world be desirous of doing duty to others be specially desirous that others must do duty to intended to get on in world believed that happiness be to be achieved by success be certainly made for profession have adopted father looking to certain morsel of church patronage occasionally came in way to fact that bishop be on most friendly term have wished son to take order frank have known own quality too well to follow father advice have chosen to be barrister now at thirty be in parliament have be asked to stand for bobsborough in conservative interest a conservative have be returned who invited knew probably little of own political belief

buddhist hardly know whether man doe believe in hidden god men perceive that be respectable self satisfied man of note be of course from society of such that conservative candidate be to be sought ala be hard to indoctrinate young mind with old belief since new theory of life have become so rife nevertheless frank greystock when be invited to stand for bobsborough in conservative interest have not for moment allowed political heterodoxy on own part to stand in way of advancement may perhaps be case that barrister be le likely to be influenced by personal conviction in taking side in politics than other man who devotes to public affair slur on profession be intended by suggestion busy clever useful man who have be at work life find that own progress towards success demand from that will become politician highest work of lawyer can only be reached through political struggle a large minded man of world peculiarly conversant with fact that question have two side that a much may often be

told friend greystock lady cousin that mr camperdown lawyer intended to jump upon lady making such allowance deduction from force of word a slang expression requires may say that john eustace be right

will be not till after sir florian death that terrible matter of jewel have even suggested to mr camperdown jeweller in whose custody thing have be since death of late lady eustace have mentioned affair to immediately on young widow return from naples sir florian have withdrawn not jewel by far most valuable of from jeweller care on return to london from marriage tour to scotland be result jeweller be at time without doubt a to date at necklace be taken from mr camperdown first attempt be made by most courteous even complimentary note in suggested to lady eustace that must be for advantage of party that family jewel must be kept together lizzie a read note smiled said to herself that did not exactly see how own interest must be best served by such arrangement made answer to mr camperdown month after when heir be born a lady eustace be passing through london on journey from bobsborough to portray meeting have be arranged between mr camperdown have endeavoured by wile knew to avoid meeting have be forced upon have be almost given to understand that unless submitted to must not be able to draw income from portray property messrs mowbray mopus have advised to submit husband gave necklace want to give back have said to mr mopus hing of kind mr mopus have replied if find necessary refer mr camperdown to will answer interview have taken place during mr camperdown took

repeated to lady eustace in presence of john eustace made remark on being so informed understand nature of settlement lady eustace mr camperdown have said believe understand everything replied then just at close of interview asked question about jewel lady eustace at first made reply might a well be sent back to messrs garnett said mr camperdown know have to send back answered then escaped before mr camperdown be able to arrange further attack can manage with better by letter than can personally said to john eustace lawyer such a mr camperdown be slow be three four month after when wrote letter in own name to lady eustace explaining to still courteously that be business to see that property of eustace family be placed in fit hand that certain valuable necklace of diamond be heirloom of family be undeniably property of heir be believed to be in custody a such property be peculiarly subject to risk must have kindness to make arrangement for handing over necklace to custody of messrs garnett to letter lizzie made answer did to second note calling attention to first when john eustace told greystock that camperdown intended to jump on lady eustace following further letter have be written by firm up to time lizzie have not replied to new square lincoln inn may madam be duty a attorney acting on behalf of estate of late husband sir florian eustace in interest of son heir

entrusted to keeping be appanage of family must not be in hand a widow of late baronet constitute amount of property certainly can not be alienated from family without inquiry right a might trifling article of use ornament jewel be valued at over l be reluctantly compelled by fact of having left unanswered three letter from mr camperdown senior on subject to explain to that if attention be not paid to letter will be obliged in performance of duty to take legal step for restitution of property have honour to be madam ladyship most obedient servant camperdown son to lady eustace c c few day after be sent old mr camperdown got letter book of office read letter to john eustace see how be to get said eustace will throw upon burthen of showing that have become legally property ca do suppose sold will follow up l dear john god bless soul be magnificent dowry for daughter ample provision for younger son be to be allowed to filch a other widow filch china cup silver teaspoon two be quite common thing never heard of such haul a will be very unpleasant said eustace then still go about everywhere declaring that portray property be own be bad lot knew from first of course will have trouble then mr eustace explained to lawyer that best way out of must be to get widow married to respectable husband be sure to marry sooner later so john eustace said decently decent fellow must be easier to deal with than must be very indecently indecent if be not said mr camperdown mr eustace did not name frank greystock barrister a probable future decent husband when lizzie first got letter did on day after visit at fawn court of mention have be made put by unread for couple of day opened not knowing clerk handwriting read only first line signature for two day went on with ordinary affair amusement of life a though such letter have reached be thinking of time diamond be in possession have have valued by old friend mr benjamin of firm of harter benjamin mr benjamin have suggested that stone of value must not be left to risk of ordinary london house lizzie have felt that if mr benjamin got into hand mr benjamin might perhaps not return messrs camperdown garnett between might form league with mr benjamin where must be must mr benjamin tell under legal sanction have given jewel up to mr camperdown hinted to mr benjamin that must perhaps sell if got good offer mr benjamin who be very familiar with hinted that there might be little family difficulty oh none in least said lizzie think will part with then gave benjamin order for strong box be supplied to strong box be so heavy that must barely lift be now in london bedroom on morning of third day read letter miss macnulty be staying with have not said word to miss macnulty about letter read up in own bedroom then sat down to think about sir florian a have handed to stone for purpose of special dinner party have be given to when passing through london have told that be family jewel that setting be done for mother said be already old when be at home again will be reset then have added little husband joke a to future daughter in law who must wear nevertheless be not sure whether fact of being so handed to did not make own have spoken second time to mr mopus mr mopus have asked whether there existed family deed a to diamond have heard of such deed did mr camperdown mention deed after reading letter once read dozen time then like woman made up mind that safest course must be not to answer yet felt sure that something unpleasant must come of mr camperdown be not man to take up question to let drop legal step what did legal step mean what must do to must mr camperdown be able to put in prison to take away from estate of portray must swear that husband have given to must invent form of word pleased a accompanying gift one else have be near then be felt to be absolutely alarmingly ignorant not only of law of custom in such matter messrs mowbray mopus mr benjamin be ally to whom looked for guidance be wise enough to know mowbray mopus harter benjamin be not trustworthy whereas camperdown son messrs garnett be a firm a rock a respectable a bank of england circumstance unfortunate circumstance drove to harter benjamin to mowbray mopus while must have taken so much delight in feeling strong honesty of other people to be on side must have talked to friend about mr camperdown people at garnett with so much satisfaction ease security even respectability may be bought too dearly ten thousand pound be prepared to surrender sum a have indeed already realised fact that might be very difficult to touch money when have suggested to mr benjamin that must buy jewel worthy tradesman have by mean jumped at offer of what use to must be necklace always locked up in iron box box for aught knew myrmidon from mr camperdown might carry off during absence from house must not be better to come to term surrender then what must term be if only there have be friend whom must consult friend whom must consult on really friendly footing not simply respectable off handed high minded friend who must advise a matter of course to make restitution uncle dean cousin frank old lady fawn must be sure to give such advice a that there be people who be so very high minded when have to deal with interest of friend what if be to ask lord fawn thought of second marriage have of course crossed lady eustace mind be by mean worst thought found place there have grand idea selfish hard fisted little woman who must not bring to abandon plunder on have laid hand grand idea of surrendering possession to great passion for florian eustace have never cared have sat down by side looked into handsome face read poetry to because of wealth because have be indispensable to to settle well have be very well generous open hearted chivalrous irascible rather heavy minded gentleman have never be in love with now desired to be so in love that must surrender everything to love there be a yet nothing of such love in bosom have seen no one who have so touched be alive to romance of thing be in love with idea of being in love ah must say to herself in moment of solitude if have corsair of own how must sit on watch for lover boat by sea shore believed of herself that must do so must also be very nice to be peeress so that might without doubt be one of great lady of london a baronet widow with large income be already almost great lady be quite alive to suspicion that be not altogether strong in position bishop people dean people did not quite trust camperdowns garnetts utterly distrusted mopuses benjamin be more familiar than must be with really great lady be sharp enough to understand must be lord fawn must be corsair worst of lord fawn be undoubted fact that be not great man must no doubt make wife peeress be poor encumbered with host of sister dull a blue book possessed of little beyond peerage to recommend if must only find peer unmarried with dash of corsair about in meantime what be to do about jewel there be staying with at time certain miss macnulty who be related after distant fashion to old lady linlithgow who be a utterly destitute of possession mean of

dead a to value care nothing wo do by time lady eustace be in tear have so far succeeded a to have produced amount of belief in miss macnulty mind if be own ca take from said miss macnulty sha' will find that have got spirit left then reflected that real corsair must protect jewel for must guard against score of camperdowns doubted whether lord fawn must do much in way then door be opened lord fawn be announced be not at unusual with lord fawn to call on widow at hour mount street be not exactly in way from india office to house of lord hansom cab can make almost in way of neglect of

corsair propensity be bold dashing unscrupulous clever man to make name for one to whom woman must endure to be obedient there must be question a to choice between lord fawn if be to allow to choose by liking thought that frank greystock must keep necklace if be made to have interest in necklace whereas lord fawn must undoubtedly surrender at once to mr camperdown lord fawn have slight idea of waiting to see cousin go a greystock have similar idea a be stronger of two of course lord fawn went perhaps remembered that hansom cab be at door costing sixpence fifteen minute that wished to show in house of lord before peer rose miss macnulty also left room frank be alone with widow lizzie said must be very solitary here be solitary hardly happy anything happy frank have thing make very

that being governess ought to give over falling in love with frank greystock have not liked lady fawn doubt have used word le abrupt have probably used few word have expressed meaning chiefly by little wink shaking of head small gesture of hand have ended by kiss in of have intended to mingle mercy with justice have in truth be full of love nevertheless lucy have not liked girl like to be warned against falling in love whether warning be needed not needed in case lucy knew very well that caution be too late might be very well for lady fawn to decide that governess must not receive visit from lover in house then governess might decide whether in circumstance must remain go away lady fawn must have right to tell governess not to be in love lucy said to herself over over again yet knew that lady fawn have treated her well old woman have kissed purred over praised have really loved a matter of course lucy be not entitled to have lover lucy knew well enough a walked alone among shrub made argument in defence of lady fawn a against yet at other minute must blaze up into grand wrath picture to herself scene in must tell lady fawn boldly that a lover have be banished from fawn court lucy must remain there no longer there be two objection to course first be that frank greystock be not lover second that on leaving fawn court must not know whither to betake be understood by everybody that be never to leave fawn court till unexceptionable home must be found for either with hittaways elsewhere lady fawn must no more allow to go away depending for future on mere chance of promiscuous engagement than must have turned one of own daughter out of house in same forlorn condition lady fawn be tower of strength to lucy then tower of strength may at moment become dungeon frank greystock be not lover ah there be worst of have given heart have got nothing in return conned over in own mind striving to ascertain whether there be real cause for shame to in own conduct have be unmaidenly have be too forward with heart have be extracted from a woman heart be extracted by effort on man part have simply chucked away from to first comer then remembered certain scene at deanery word have be spoken look have be turned upon pressure of hand late at night little whisper ribbon have be begged flower have be given once once then there came burning blush upon cheek that there must have be so much yet so little that be of avail have right to say to one that man be lover have right to assure that be lover knew that wrong be done in be not lover of importance of own self a living thing with heart to suffer soul to endure thought enough believed in thinking of herself must ever be lot to be man wife must be to true loving friend companion living in joy fighting if be necessary down to stump of nail in interest of what have to give over above heart intellect never thought at of personal beauty have very little appreciation even in others form face of lady eustace indeed be very lovely be distasteful to whereas delighted to look upon broad plain colourless countenance of lydia fawn who be endeared to by frank good humour unselfish disposition in regard to men have never asked question whether man be handsome man ugly of frank greystock knew that face be full of quick intellect of lord fawn knew that bore outward index of mind one man not only loved must not help loving other man a regarded that sort of sympathy marriage must recognise must always have be world asunder from knew that men demand that woman will posse beauty certainly have never thought of a beautiful did not occur to on account be doomed to fail be too strong hearted for such fear did not think much of thing felt to be so far endowed a to be fit to be wife of such man a frank greystock be proud stout self confident still modest little woman too fond of truth to tell lie of even to herself be possessed of great power of sympathy genial very social greatly given to mirth of conversation though in talking must listen much say little be keenly alive to humour have at command great fund of laughter must illumine whole face without producing sound from mouth knew to be too good to be governess for life yet how must be otherwise with lady linlithgow visit to niece have be made on thursday on same evening frank greystock have asked question in house of common rather have made speech about sawab of mygawb know meaning of such speech have not frank belonged to party be out have not resistance to sawab claim come from party be in frank must not probably have cared much about prince may be sure that must not have troubled to read line of very dull long pamphlet of have to make master before must venture to stir in matter have not road of opposition be open to in direction what exertion will not politician make with view of getting point of lance within joint of enemy harness frank made speech made very well be just case for lawyer admitting that kind of advocacy be lawyer business to practise indian minister of day lord fawn chief have determined after much anxious consideration that be duty to resist claim then for resisting be attacked have yielded to claim attack must have be a venomous very probably must have come from same quarter blame by assertion be cast upon young conservative aspirant for party honour be thus war be waged frank greystock took up sawab case must have drawn mingled tear indignation from hearer have not hearer known condition of contest on side did hearer care much for sawab claim felt that greystock be making good own claim to future reward from party be very hard upon minister be hard also upon lord fawn stating that cruelty of government ascendancy have never be put forward a doctrine in plainer term than have be used in place in reference to wrong of poor ill used native chieftain be very grievous to lord fawn who have personally desired to favour ill used chieftain harder again because greystock be intimate with other felt thing keenly be full of grievance when in accordance with custom came down to fawn court on saturday evening fawn family consisted entirely of woman dined early on saturday when lordship must come down dinner be prepared for alone on sunday dined together at three o'clock on sunday evening lord fawn must return to town to prepare for monday work perhaps also disliked sermon

already told lucy that brother be very angry with mr greystock now lucy sympathy be with frank sawab have endeavoured indeed have partially succeeded in perverting under secretary did now intend to change opinion although fawn girl lady fawn be against when brother son be under secretary of state sister mother will constantly be on side of government so far a under secretary office be concerned upon word frederic said augusta fawn do think mr greystock be too bad there be nothing fellow wo say do exclaimed lord fawn ca understand when have be in opposition never did that kind of thing wonder whether be because be angry with mamma said miss fawn everybody who knew fawn knew that augusta fawn be not clever that must occasionally say very thing ought not to be said oh dear said under secretary who must not endure idea that weak woman kind of family must have in way influence on august doings of parliament know mamma did nothing of kind at said lordship putting down sister with great authority mr greystock be simply not honest politician be about whole of chose to attack because there be opportunity there be man in house who care for such thing personally le than do have lordship said more than did might perhaps have be correct ca bear feeling fact be lawyer never understands what be what be not fair fighting lucy felt face tingling with heat be preparing to say word in defence of special lawyer when lady fawn voice be heard from drawing room window come in girl be nine o'clock in house lady fawn reigned supreme one ever doubted for moment a to obedience clicking of ball ceased who be walking immediately turned face to drawing room window lord fawn who be not one of girl took turn by thinking of wrong have endured frederic be so angry about mr greystock said augusta a soon a be seated do feel that be provoking said second sister considering that mr greystock have so often be here think be kind said third lydia did not speak must not refrain from glancing eye at lucy face believe everything be considered fair in parliament said lady fawn then lord fawn who have heard last word entered through window know about mother said gentleman like conduct be same everywhere there be thing may be said there be thing may not mr greystock have altogether gone beyond usual limit will take care that know opinion be not going to quarrel with man asked mother be not going to fight if mean that will let know think that have transgressed lordship said with haughty superiority man may generally display with safety among woman of own family lucy have borne great deal knowing well that be better that must bear such injury in silence there be point beyond must not endure be intolerable to that mr greystock character a gentleman must be impugned before lady of family one of whom did in fact know liking for man then seemed to that must rush into battle giving side blow at lordship on behalf of absent antagonist appearing to fight for sawab there have be time when poor sawab be in favour at fawn court think mr greystock be right to say must for prince if took up cause be bound to make best of spoke with energy with heightened colour lady fawn hearing shook head at did read mr greystock speech miss morris asked lord fawn word of in time understood allusion to what have be called upon to say in house of lord on behalf of government suppose did did not seem to be difficult to understand do think mr greystock must have abstained from attacking frederic said augusta be not not quite thing that be accustomed to said lord fawn of course know about said lucy think prince be being used very ill that be being deprived of own property that be kept out of right just because be weak be very glad that there be one to speak up for dear lucy said lady fawn if discus politics with lord fawn will get worst of at object to miss morris view about sawab said under secretary generously there be great deal to be said on side know of old that miss morris be great friend of sawab used to be friend too said lucy felt for do feel for be very well ask one to agree with on question only say that mr greystock mode of treating be unbecoming think be very best speech ever read in life said lucy with headlong energy heightened colour then miss morris have very different opinion about speech said lord fawn with severity have probably never read burke speech want to read said lucy be question said lord fawn tone manner be very severe indeed be talking about speech in parliament said lucy poor lucy knew quite a well a did lord fawn that burke have be house of common orator in impatience from absence of habit of argument omitted to explain that be talking about speech of day lord fawn held up hand put head little on one side dear lucy said lady fawn be showing ignorance where do suppose that mr burke speech be made of course know be made in parliament said lucy almost in tear if miss morris mean that burke greatest effort be not made in parliament that speech to elector of bristol for instance opening address on trial of warren hastings be upon whole superior to did mean anything at said lucy lord fawn be trying to help dear said lady fawn want to be helped said lucy only mean that thought mr greystock speech a good a must possibly be there be word in did seem to to be just what ought to be do think that be ill treating that poor indian prince be very glad that somebody have have courage to get up say so no doubt must have be better that lucy must have held tongue have simply be upholding against opponent political speaker whose speech have read with pleasure might have held own in argument against whole fawn family be favourite with even under secretary must not have be hard upon there have be more than for poor lucy to do heart be so truly concerned in matter that must not refrain from resenting attack on man loved have allowed to be carried into superlative have almost be uncourteous to lord fawn dear said lady fawn wo say anything more upon subject lord fawn took up book lady fawn busied in knitting lydia assumed look of unhappiness a though something very sad have occurred augusta addressed question to brother in tone plainly indicated feeling on part that brother have be ill used be entitled to special consideration lucy sat silent still then left room with hurried step lydia at once rose to follow be

received instruction to proceed by law for recovery of eustace diamond now in lady eustace hand will feel obliged to lady eustace if will communicate to name address of attorney new square may effect of note be to drive lizzie back upon fawn interest be frightened about diamond be nevertheless almost determined not to surrender at rate in strait must want assistance either in keeping in giving up lawyer letter afflicted with sense of weakness there be strength in fawn connexion a lord fawn be so poor perhaps must adhere to jewel knew that must not fight mr camperdown with other assistance than what messrs mowbray mopus might give therefore heart softened towards betrothed suppose frederic will be here to day said to miss macnulty a sat at breakfast together about noon miss macnulty nodded can have cab know if like to go anywhere miss macnulty said thought must go to national gallery can walk back know said lizzie can walk there back too said miss macnulty in regard to whom may be said

state from india office be loving discreetly amatory talking chiefly of thing material flattering other hinting now again at certain little circumstance of more accurate knowledge seemed to be desirable one be conversant with thing in general be slow other be quick a lizard in turning hither thither knew almost nothing when told lord fawn that ayrshire estate be own to do what liked with did not know that must certainly find out truth from other source before married indeed be not quite sure whether statement be true false though must not have made so frequently have idea of truth be fixed idea have be explained to there have be something about second son there be second son perhaps might have second son yet future little lord fawn might inherit in regard to honesty man be superior to woman because purpose be declared told lie one be a mercenary a other be not love have brought lord fawn to mount street what be name of place in ireland asked there be house know there be one frederic town land where house used to be be called killeagent old demesne be called killaud what pretty name doe go great many mile lord fawn explained that did run good many mile up into

be thing to be settled said lawyer have better see yours mr camperdown be mr camperdown almost shrieked lizzie lord fawn then explained with amazement that mr camperdown be lawyer a far a belief went there be not more respectable gentleman in profession then inquired whether lizzie have objection to mr camperdown mr camperdown be sir florian lawyer said lizzie will make easier must think said lord fawn know how may be said lizzie trying to bring mind to work upon subject steadily mr camperdown have be very uncourteous to must say a think unfair wish to rob now of thing be quite own what sort of thing asked lord fawn slowly very valuable thing will tell about frederic of course will tell everything now never must keep back anything from one loved be not nature there might a well read that note then put hand back brought mr camperdown letter from under bible lord fawn read very attentively a read there came upon great doubt what sort of woman be to whom have engaged because be possessed of income mr camperdown must be in wrong in such matter be idea never occurred to lord fawn there be form of belief stronger than ordinary english gentleman have in discretion honesty of own family lawyer what lawyer tell to do doe what lawyer tell to sign sign buy sell in obedience to same direction feel perfectly comfortable in possession of guide who be responsible divine what diamond be asked lord fawn in very low voice be own altogether own sir florian gave to when put into hand said that be to be own for ever ever 'there said 'those be yours to do what choose with ' after that ought to ask to give back ought if have be married before wife have given keepsake to keep for ever ever must give up to lawyer must not like must frederic have put hand on be looking up into face a asked question again perhaps acting be little overdone there be tear in eye tone of voice be perfect mr camperdown call eustace diamond family diamond said lord fawn what do consist of be worth will show to said lizzie jumping up hurrying out of room lord fawn when be alone rubbed hand over eye thought about must be very harsh measure on part of eustace family of mr camperdown to demand from surrender of trinket late husband might have given in manner have described be to thinking most improbable that eustace people lawyer must be harsh to widow bearing eustace name eustaces be by disposition lavish old mr camperdown be not one who must be strict in claiming little thing for rich client yet here be letter threatening widow of late baronet with legal proceeding for recovery of jewel have be given by sir florian to wife a keepsake perhaps sir florian have made mistake have caused to be set in ring brooch for bride jewel have thought to be own have in truth be heirloom if so jewel must of course be surrendered replaced by one of equal value be making out such solution when lizzie returned with morocco case in hand be manner in gave to said lizzie a opened clasp make value to lord fawn knew nothing about jewel even knew that if circle of stone saw with maltese cross appended to be constituted of real diamond thing must be of great value occurred to at once such necklace be not given by husband even to bride in manner described by lizzie ring brooch perhaps bracelet lover loving lord may bring in pocket ornament a on lord fawn be now looking be given in sort of way felt sure that be so even though be entirely ignorant of value of stone do know what be worth asked lizzie hesitated moment then remembered that frederic in present position in regard to herself might be glad to assist in maintaining possession of substantial property think say value be about ten thousand pound replied ten thousand pound lord fawn riveted eye upon be what be told by jeweller by what jeweller man have to come see about repair something of kind poor sir florian wished said so what be man name forget name said lizzie who be not quite sure whether acquaintance with mr benjamin must be considered respectable ten thousand pound keep in house do have iron case up stair for ever so heavy did sir florian give iron case lizzie hesitated for moment yes said be ordered to be made then came after be dead knew value then oh dear yes though never named sum told however that be very very valuable lord fawn did not immediately recognise falseness of word that woman said to because be slow must not think hear at same time be at once involved in painful maze of doubt almost of dismay action for recovery of jewel brought against lady whom be engaged to marry on behalf of family of late husband must not suit at to have hand quite clean to be above evil report to be respectable a be round be lord fawn special ambition be poor man greedy man must have abandoned official salary at moment notice rather than there must have fallen on breath of public opinion hinting that ought to be abandoned be especially timid lived in perpetual fear lest newspaper must say something hard of in matter of sawab have be very wretched because frank greystock have accused of being administrator of tyranny must have liked wife to have ten thousand pound worth of diamond very well must rather go without wife for ever without wife fortune than marry woman subject to action for claiming diamond not own think said at last that if be to put into mr camperdown hand into mr camperdown hand then let matter be settled by arbitration arbitration mean going to law no dearest mean not going to law diamond must be entrusted to mr camperdown then one must be appointed to decide whose property be be property said lizzie say belong to family will say anything said lizzie dearest girl there ca be more respectable man than mr camperdown must do something of kind know sha' do anything of kind said lizzie sir florian eustace gave to will keep did not look at lover a spoke looked at did not like change saw on countenance did not like circumstance in found placed why must mr camperdown interfere continued lizzie if belong to belong to son who have so good right to keep for a have belong to must not be kept in private house like at if be worth money if be to let go mr camperdown must get there be nothing must do to get oh frederic hope will stand to not see injured of course only want for darling child frederic face have become very long be much disturbed in mind must only suggest that must go see mr camperdown ascertain what ought to be done to last adhered to assurance that mr camperdown must do evil till lizzie in wrath asked whether believed mr camperdown word before hers think must understand matter of business better than said prudent lover want to rob said lizzie will look to to prevent when lord fawn took leave did not do till have counselled again again to leave matter in mr camperdown hand two be not in good accord together be fixed purpose a declared to to see mr camperdown be fixed purpose so at least declared to to keep diamond in spite of mr camperdown dear if be decided against said lord fawn gravely ca be decided against if stand by a ought to do can hing said lord fawn in tremor then lizzie looked at look be very eloquent called poltroon a plain a look must speak then parted sign of affection between be not satisfactory door be hardly closed behind before lizzie began to declare to herself that must escape be not yet twenty four hour since have be telling that did not like engagement must break off now be stamping little foot clenching little hand swearing to herself by god that wretched timid lordling must not get out of net did in truth despise because must not clutch jewel looked upon a mean paltry because be willing to submit to mr camperdown still be prompted to demand must be demanded from engagement because thought that perceived something in might produce in desire to be relieved from must not be relieved must marry must keep key of iron box with diamond must find what sort of noise must make if attempted to take from closed morocco case ascended with to bed room locked up in iron safe deposited little patent key in usual place round neck then seated at desk wrote letter to various friend making known to

be lady linlithgow reader will see two three of letter to countess will be first dear aunt when came to see other day can not say that be very kind to suppose care very much what becomes of think

to mr eustace be somewhat le acrid than written to aunt linlithgow dear mr eustace hope will be glad to hear from will not be sorry to hear news be going to be married again of course be not about to take step be in way so very important without thinking about great deal be sure will be better for darling little florian in way a for have felt for last two year how unfitted have be to manage everything have therefore accepted offer made to by lord fawn who be a know peer of parliament most distinguished member of majesty government be too nobleman of very great influence in respect have property in ireland extending over ever so many mile running up into mountain mansion there be called killmage be not sure that remember name quite rightly hope may see there day dear bishop look forward with delight to doing something to make dear irish happier idea of rambling up into own mountain charm for nothing suit disposition so well a kind of solitude of course lord fawn be not so rich man a sir florian have never looked to rich for happiness not what lord fawn have good income from irish estate then of course be paid for doing majesty government so there be fear that will have to live upon jointure of course must not be right pray tell dear bishop dear margaretta with love will be happy know to hear that little flo be quite well be already so fond of new papa lizzie turn for lying be exemplified in last statement for a happened lord fawn have never yet seen child believe to be always most affectionate niece eli eustace there be two other letter one to uncle dean other to cousin frank there be great doubt in mind a to expediency of writing to frank greystock at last decided that must do letter to dean need not be given in full a be very similar to written to bishop wife same mention be made of intended husband peerage same allusion to majesty government phrase have heard from lord fawn spoke of irish property in term le glowing than have used in writing to lady ended by asking for uncle congratulation blessing letter to frank be a follows doubtless a wrote there be present to mind remembrance of fact that might have offered to have have if must dear cousin a must rather that must hear news from myself than from one else write to tell that be going to be married to lord fawn of course know that there be certain matter a to lord fawn agree in politics mean

affectionate cousin eli eustace somebody in speaking on lady eustace behalf making best of virtue have declared that did not have lover hitherto have be true of mind have not le dwelt on delight of lover still thought of possible corsair who must be willing to give up vice for love for whose sake must be willing to share even be dream nevertheless pervaded fancy constantly lord fawn peer of parliament member of majesty government a be must not have be lover to might not be possible that there must exist something of romance between cousin frank be last woman in world to run away with man to endanger position by serious indiscretion there might perhaps be something between cousin liaison quite correct in fact secret understanding if nothing more mutual sympathy must be chiefly shown in abuse of friend in must indulge passion for romance poetry chapter xi lord fawn at office news be soon about london a lizzie have intended have made sudden resolve that lord fawn must not escape have gone to work after fashion have seen frank greystock have told john eustace john eustace have told mr camperdown before lord fawn in slow prosecution of purpose have consulted lawyer about necklace

mopus be be quite out of question lord fawn that wife must have anything to do with mowbray mopus word that mr camperdown said be gospel to lord fawn yet a reader will understand mr camperdown have by mean expressed real opinion in interview have spoken of widow in friendly term declaring that be simply mistaken in idea a to duration of interest in scotch property mistaken again about diamond whereas in truth regarded a dishonest lying evil minded harpy have lord fawn consulted simply a client not have come to engaged lover must have expressed opinion quite frankly be not business of lawyer to tell client evil thing of lady whom that client be engaged to marry in regard to property spoke truth spoke what believed to be truth when said that whole thing must doubt now be easily

toast while lydia came stood over of course be from whispered lydia lucy again nodded head while be crunching toast fact that mr greystock have proposed in form to lucy morris be soon known to family news certainly did take away something from importance must otherwise have be attached to lizzie departure there be not same awe of ceremony same dread of scene for frank greystock letter must have existed of course lord fawn future matrimonial prospect be to affair of more moment than of lucy lord fawn have gone have already quarrelled with lady before went there be at present nothing more to be done by in regard to lizzie than just to get rid of lucy good fortune so unexpected by so frankly owned a very best fortune in world must have befallen gave excitement to there must be lesson that morning for nina usual study of family be altogether interrupted lady fawn purred congratulated gave good advice declared that other home for lucy before marriage must now be quite out of question of course must do for to go even to clara said lady fawn who seemed to think that there still might be delay before frank greystock must be ready for wife know dear that be rich not for member of parliament suppose make good income have always heard that be little backward when began of course know nobody need be in hurry then lucy began to think that if frank must wish to postpone marriage say for three four year might even yet become burthen on friend be frightened continued lady fawn will never want home a long a have one to give will soon find out what be mr greystock idea unless be very unreasonable will make thing fit then there came message to lucy from lady eustace if please miss lady eustace will be glad to see for minute up in room before start so lucy be torn away from thought of own happiness taken up stair to lady eustace have heard that be going said lizzie yes heard be to go morning have heard why be sure will not deceive lucy where be to look for truth if not to old old friend like why must deceive lizzie why indeed only that people do world be so false so material so worldly one give out one heart get in return nothing dust ash nothing ash dust oh have be so disappointed in lady fawn know be dearest friend said lucy psha know that have worked for like slave that give bare pittance have be more like mother to than anything else said lucy angrily because have be tame doe not suit to be tame be not plan to be tame have heard cause of disagreement between lord fawn well tell truth lucy how dare tell to tell truth of course tell truth believe be something about property want to give back to somebody know more yes dear husband sir florian who understood whom idolized who seemed to have be made for gave present lord fawn be pleased to say that doe not approve of keeping gift from late lord considering that intends to live upon wealth sir florian be generous enough to bestow upon doe seem to be strange of course resented such interference must not have resented know said lucy who thought that must bring to comply with request made to by frank greystock woman who have spark of spirit must resent have resented have told lord fawn will on account part with rich present adored florian showered upon in generosity be not for richness that keep because be for sake so inexpressibly dear to if lord fawn chooses to be jealous of necklace must be jealous lucy who have in truth heard small fragment of story just so much of a lydia have learned from discreet amelia who have very hazy idea of fact did not quite know how much of tale a be now told to might be true how much false after certain fashion lizzie eustace called friend did not believe friend to be honest be aware that in matter friend must condescend to fib lizzie poetry romance high feeling have never have ring of true soundness in lucy ear imagination be not strong enough to soar to altitude of lie lizzie be now telling did believe that property lizzie be called upon to restore be held to be objectionable by lord fawn simply because have reached lizzie from hand of late husband what do think of such conduct a asked lady eustace wo do if lock up instead of wearing asked lucy have never dreamed of wearing understand about such thing said lucy determined not to impute blame to one of fawn family be tyranny sheer tyranny continued other will find be not woman to yield to for love must give up everything nothing from fear have told in so many word that doe not intend to go on with engagement have indeed intend that will if think that be going to be thrown over because take idea of kind into head be will know be not to be made plaything of like will tell what can do for lucy what can do for there be one in world trust more thoroughly than do said lizzie hardly one love so well think how long have known other may be sure of always have be always will be friend with cousin frank want anything of kind said lucy never did nobody have so much influence with frank a just do write to to morrow next day day after mere line know to tell how land lie here there must be nothing to tell yes there will ever so much will be talking about hour if will be true to lucy in business will make handsomest present ever saw in life will give hundred guinea brooch will indeed will have money buy what said lucy hundred guinea to do what please with mean thing said lucy did think there be woman so mean a in world be not surprised now at lord fawn pick up what hear send in letter then be paid money for why not be to do good how can have thought to ask to do thing how can bring to think so badly of people sooner cut hand off a for lizzie think be mean wicked to conceive thing now good bye so saying left room giving dear friend time for further argument lady eustace got away that morning not in time indeed for train at such hour a to make unnecessary that must appear at early dinner saying of farewell be very cold ceremonious of course there be word a to future visit word a to future event shook hand with special injunction be given to coachman to drive safely to station at ceremony lucy be not present lydia have asked to come down say good bye lucy refused saw in own room said lucy be very affectionate lydia asked well no be not affectionate at be that lucy said thus lady eustace completed visit to fawn court letter be taken away for post at eight o'clock in evening before time be necessary that lucy must write to lover lady fawn said in whisper may tell to come here certainly dear have better tell to call on of course will see too when come think 'd want to see said lucy be sure must want to see then wrote answer to frank letter allowed hour for happy task though letter when written be short hour hardly sufficed for writing of dear mr greystock there be matter for of great consideration before must get even so far a after biting pen for ten minute during pictured to herself how pleasant must be to call frank when must have told to do so have found upon repeated whispered trial that of name be pleasantest to pronounce decided upon refraining from writing now lady fawn have seen letter to dearest letter that ever be written say that may call upon must go away without seeing too then there be great difficulty a to word to be used by for actual rendering up to a future wife at last somewhat too spartan simplicity of nature prevailed word be written very plain very short love better than world will be wife will be happiness of life to try to deserve be with heart most affectionately own lucy when be written did not content hour be over letter must go suppose will do said to herself will know what mean so letter be sent chapter xvi certainly heirloom burden of position be so heavy on lord fawn mind on monday morning after leaving fawn court be hardly a true to affair of india a must have wished be resolved to do what be right if only must find out what must be right thing in present difficulty not to break word not to be unjust not to deviate by hair breadth from line of conduct must be described a honourable in circle to belonged not to give political enemy opportunity for calumny be in to young widow be very lovely very rich must have suited well to marry must still suit well to do so if must make amenable to reason law have assured that be very much in love with have already in imagination received distinguished head of party at portray castle must give up love income beauty castle without doubt rather than find in mess of having married wife who have stolen necklace who must not make restitution might marry insist on giving up afterwards foresaw terrible difficulty in way of such arrangement lady eustace be self willed have already told that did not intend to keep jewel in house in own what must do so that human being not most bigoted tory that ever expressed scorn for whig lord must be able to say that have done wrong be engaged to lady must not simply change mind give reason believed in mr camperdown must hardly plead that belief must hereafter be accused of heartless misconduct for aught knew lady eustace might bring action against for breach of promise obtain verdict damage annihilate a under secretary how must keep hand quite clean frank greystock be a far a knew lizzie nearest relative in dean be uncle then dean be down at bobsborough might be necessary for to go down to bobsborough in meantime must see frank greystock greystock be a bitter tory a in england greystock be very man who have attacked lord fawn in house of common respecting sawab making attack quite personal without shadow of cause within short straight groove of lord fawn intellect remembrance of supposed wrong be always running up down renewing own soreness regarded greystock a enemy who must lose opportunity of injuring in weakness littleness be quite unable to judge of other men by must not go hair breadth astray if knew because greystock have in debate called timid tyrannical believed that greystock must stop short of nothing might injure yet must appeal to greystock did appeal in answer to appeal frank came to at india house frank before saw lord fawn have a be fitting be with cousin nothing be decided at interview lord fawn became more than ever convinced that member for bobsborough be determined enemy frank be more convinced than ever that lord fawn be empty stiff necked self sufficient prig greystock of course took cousin part be there to do so really did not know whether lizzie be be not entitled to diamond lie have first fabricated for benefit of mr benjamin when have jewel valued have since told with different degree of precision to various people to lady linlithgow to mr camperdown to lucy to lord fawn now repeated with increased precision to cousin sir florian in putting trinket into hand have explained to that be very valuable that be to regard a own peculiar property if be heirloom must do frank have said with confidence of practising barrister made over a heirloom to said lizzie with plaintive tenderness be nonsense dear lizzie then smiled sweetly on patted back of hand with hers be very gentle with bore assumed superiority with pretty meekness must not make over a heirloom to if be to give must give be certainly be just what can not tell a yet what must be found out if diamond formed part of heirloom there be evidence that be so must give up sir florian must only give away what be own to give lord fawn have right to dictate certainly not said frank then made promise knew to be rash that must stand by pretty cousin in affair see why must assume that lady eustace be keeping property doe belong to said to lord fawn go by what camperdown tell said lord fawn mr camperdown be very excellent attorney most respectable man said greystock have nothing on earth to say against mr camperdown mr camperdown be law prophet yet can allow to be judge jury in such case a surely mr greystock must wish to go before jury understand lord fawn if claim be really made for jewel by mr john eustace on part of heir on behalf of estate statement have better be submitted to counsel family deed must be inspected doubt counsel must agree in telling cousin lady eustace what must what must not do in meantime understand that be engaged to marry be engaged to certainly said lord fawn can hardly mean to assert lord that intend to be untrue to promise to throw over own engagement because cousin have expressed wish to retain property belief to be own be said in tone made lord fawn surer than ever that greystock be enemy to knife personally be not coward knew enough of world to be quite sure that greystock must not attempt personal encounter morally lord fawn be coward did fear that man before must work bitter injury can not mean that continued frank will probably allow to assure cousin that misunderstood in matter 'd sooner see mr camperdown again before say anything can not understand lord fawn that gentleman must require attorney to tell what to do in case a be standing now lord fawn countenance be heavy troubled full of doubt said nothing be probably altogether unaware how eloquent be face cousin lady eustace continued frank must not be kept in suspense agree on behalf that title to trinket must be made subject of inquiry by person adequate to form judgment of course a relative will take part in inquiry a relative must demand from admission that engagement with can not in way be allowed to depend on fate of jewel have chosen to accept a future husband be bound to see that be treated with good faith honour fair observance frank made demand very well while lord fawn be looking like whipped dog of course said lordship want be that right thing must be done right thing will be done cousin wish to keep nothing be not own may tell then that will receive from assurance that have have intention of departing from word after lord fawn made attempt at stipulation that assurance to lizzie be to be founded on counter assurance given to that matter of diamond must be decided by proper legal authority frank must not submit to at last under secretary yielded engagement be to remain in force counsel be to be employed two lover be not to see other just at present when matter have be decided by lawyer lord fawn be to express regret for having suspected lady love be verbal agreement according to frank greystock view of lord fawn doubt must have declared that have never consented to latter stipulation about week after there be meeting at mr camperdown chamber greystock a cousin friend attended to hear what mr camperdown have to say in presence of lord fawn john eustace frank have in meantime be down to richmond have taken lucy to arm a future bride have be closeted with lady fawn a man who be doing duty by lucy morris be welcomed made much of by ladyship have be impossible to leave lizzie name altogether unmentioned frank have spoken a champion of cousin of course there have arisen something of ill feeling between two lady fawn have taught to hate lizzie be desirous that match must be over diamond diamond must not quite say to visitor showed feeling very plainly frank be courteous cold resolute in presuming pretending to presume that a matter of course marriage must take place lady fawn intended to be civil must not restrain feeling though did not dare to say that son must have nothing more to do with lizzie eustace showed very plainly that intended to work with object of course two did not part a cordial friend of course poor lucy perceived that be so before meeting took place mr camperdown have be at work looking over old deed be undoubtedly case thing often become complicated from greatness of importance must have be kept clear a running water diamond in question have be bought with other jewel by sir florian grandfather on occasion of marriage with daughter of certain duke on occasion old family jewel be said to have be heirloom be sold given in exchange a part value for then purchased grandfather who have also be sir florian in time have expressly stated in will that jewel be to be regarded a heirloom in family have a such left to eldest son to son eldest son must such child be born eldest son have possessed not that son son there be such eustace born have died before father younger son of old sir florian have then succeeded a sir thomas be father of florian who have married lizzie eustace that last sir florian have therefore be fourth in succession from old sir florian by whom will have be made who have directed that jewel must be regarded a heirloom in family two intermediate baronet have made allusion to diamond in deed executed by indeed sir florian father have died without will there be other jewel larger much le valuable than diamond still in hand of messrs garnett a to question be raised late sir florian have by will left property in house at portray to widow property elsewhere to heir be what mr camperdown have at last learned have be forced to admit to while learning that there be confusion be confident enough however that there be difficulty in matter messrs garnett be able to say that necklace have be in keeping with various other jewel still in possession from time of death of late lady eustace up to marriage of late sir florian son stated date on jewel be given up to be th of september be day after sir florian return from scotland with bride lizzie first statement have coincided with entry in messrs garnett book latterly have asserted that necklace have be given to in scotland when mr camperdown examined entry in jeweller book found figure to be so blotted that might represent th th september now th september have be day preceding sir florian marriage john eustace only knew that have seen necklace worn in scotland by mother bishop only knew that have often seen on neck of sister in law when a be very often case appeared in full blown society mr camperdown believed that have traced two story to lizzie one repeated more than once that diamond have be given to in london second made to that have be given to at portray believed that have never be in scotland since death of former lady eustace be quite confident that must trust altogether to disposition made of by old sir florian there must be no doubt a to being diamond there described although setting have be altered old mr garnett stated that must swear to if saw necklace can not suppose that lady eustace wish to keep anything be not own said frank greystock of course not said john eustace nobody imago said mr camperdown lord fawn who felt that ought not to be there who did not know whether might with better grace take lizzie part part against said nothing continued mr camperdown there be luckily no doubt a to fact diamond in question formed part of set of most valuable ornament settled in family by sir florian eustace in deed be drawn up by grandfather be now here know how be to have further proof will look at deed mr greystock at will frank suggested that a might probably be expedient to take advice on subject professionally have rather not look at deed anything might say on looking at document now must have weight why must advice be necessary said mr camperdown when matter be so clear dear sir said frank cousin lady eustace be strong in confidence that late husband intended to give to a own that must not have done without power of doing so now mr camperdown be quite sure that lizzie be lying in must therefore make adequate answer experience must probably have told continued frank that there be considerable difficulty in dealing with matter of heirloom never heard of such difficulty said mr camperdown people generally understand so clearly said lord fawn late sir florian doe not appear to have understood very clearly said frank let put into hand of indifferent person firm till matter be decided said mr camperdown will be much safer so than in keeping think be quite safe said frank be that took place at meeting a mr camperdown said to john eustace be manifest enough that meant to hang on to only hope lord fawn will not be fool enough to marry said mr camperdown lord fawn be of same way of thinking then how be to clear character of charge must be brought against how be to stand ground before frank greystock chapter xvii diamond be seen in public let not be supposed that lady eustace during summer week be living life of recluse london season be in full splendour be by mean recluse during first year of widowhood have be inch widow a far a crape must go quiet life at bobsborough portray castle during year child be born be in way thrown upon good behaviour living with bishop wife dean daughter two year of retreat from world be generally thought to be proper thing for widow lizzie have not quite accomplished two year before re opened campaign in mount street with very small remnant of weed with crape brought down to minimum be young rich world be aware that woman of twenty two can hardly afford to sacrifice two whole year in matter of widowhood lizzie did not encounter very much reproach be not shunned so ill spoken of a to have widely spread bad name among street square in carriage wheel rolled people called flirt held up hand in surprise at sir florian foolish generosity for account of lizzie wealth be greatly exaggerated said that of course must marry again general belief often seizes upon world in regard to special falsehood be very surprising everybody on sudden adopts idea that particular man be over head ear in debt so that can hardly leave house for fear of bailiff that ill fated woman be cruelly ill used by husband that eldest son have ruined father whereas man doe owe shilling woman never hears harsh word from lord eldest son in question have never succeeded in obtaining shilling beyond allowance one of lie about london season be founded on extent of lady eustace jointure indeed lie went on to state that jointure be more than jointure be believed that property in ayrshire be own to do what pleased with that property in ayrshire be taken at double value be matter of course have be declared at time of marriage that sir florian have be especially generous to penniless wife generosity be magnified in ordinary way doubt lizzie own diligence have done much to propagate story a to positive ownership of portray mr camperdown have be very busy denying john eustace have denied whenever occasion offered bishop in quiet way have denied lady linlithgow have denied lie have be set on foot have thriven there be hardly man about town who did know lady eustace have eight nine thousand year altogether at own disposal down in scotland of course woman so endowed so rich so beautiful so clever so young must marry again must marry well doubt added to there be feeling lizzie a be not uncommonly called by people who have hardly ever seen have something amiss with know where be be lame said that very clever man captain boodle who have lately reappeared among military friend at club go flat round have devil of temper doubt said lieutenant griggs mouth must say said boodle be thus that lizzie be talked about at club be asked to dinner ball gave little dinner to certain extent be fashion everybody have declared that of course must marry again now be known everywhere that be engaged to lord fawn poor dear lord fawn said lady glencora palliser to dear friend madame max goesler do remember how violently be in love with violet effingham two year ago two year be long time lady glencora violet effingham have chosen husband be fall for violet be sweetest girl out at one time really thought meant to take thought meant to take man whom did not take said madame goesler who have own recollection who be widow herself who at period to lady glencora be referring have thought that perhaps might cease to be widow not that have ever suggested to herself that lord fawn might be second husband poor lord fawn continued lady glencora suppose be terribly in want of money surely lady eustace be very pretty yes be very pretty nay more be quite lovely to look at be clever very be rich very well lady glencora what doe 'but ' mean who ever explains 'but be great deal too clever madame goesler to want explanation must explain can only say be sorry for poor lord fawn who be gentleman will never set thames on fire

at portray castle have taken possession of a property found in own house john eustace bishop have combined in demanding on behalf of heir lawsuit have then commenced diamond be most costly belonging to commoner in england have be valued at twenty four thousand pound lord fawn have retreated from engagement moment heard that doubt be thrown on lady eustace right to possession lady eustace have declared intention of bringing action against lord fawn have also secreted diamond reader will be aware that statement be by mean accurate history of difficulty a far a have a yet progressed be indeed absolutely false in detail sufficed to show that matter be becoming public mean to say that lord fawn be off asked madame goesler do said lady glencora poor lord fawn exclaimed lady chiltern really seems a though never must be settled think have courage enough for such conduct a said madame goesler besides lady eustace income be quite certain said lady chiltern poor dear lord fawn doe want money so badly be very disagreeable said lady glencora to believe that wife have got finest diamond in england then to find that have only stolen think lord fawn be right if man doe marry for money must have money wonder ever took there be doubt about beauty might have done better wo hear lord fawn be littled said lady chiltern done better said madame goesler how must have done better be peer son must be peer think must have done better lady glencora in time have wished to marry man who have sought for money lady chiltern in time have refused to be lady fawn madame goesler in time have

ignorance be so great did not know whether mr camperdown might not contrive to have taken by violence from neck even on lady glencora stair best security so thought must be in fact that mr camperdown must not know of purpose told one not even miss macnulty appeared before lady arrayed in glory just a be about to descend to carriage have got necklace on said miss macnulty why must not wear own

diamond be made to sparkle to be bright with outside garniture to shine glitter be rich in apparel only doubt might be whether paste diamond might not better suit character be not paste did shine glitter be very rich must not be brought a accusation against lady glencora guest that pressed round to look at necklace lady glencora guest knew better than to do there be slight ferment slight still felt by lord fawn by lady eustace eye be turned upon diamond there be whisper here there lizzie bore very well lord fawn be uncomfortable like for wearing said lady glencora to lady chiltern yes if

woman be a bitter a gall there be one else to stand up for must see that be ill used woman do hate other so virulently lady fawn hate future daughter in law lucy did not in least grudge lover

said word to of fawn understood too that a frank have declared purpose of supporting lizzie might be a well that must see just at present a little of lady fawn a possible not word however have lady

scrape will marry at last without doubt lady fawn be only making trouble for herself by trying to prevent ca do anything oh ca do anything when be here became at last quite disagreeable hardly spoke to be sure that even servant understood that there be quarrel did not say word of lizzie offer of brooch to herself of story by degree be reaching ear a to old debt diamond young bride conduct to lady linlithgow a soon a married grand husband sir florian did think badly of lizzie must not regret that own noble generous frank must have to expend time labour on friend unworthy of friendship there be shade of jealousy in feeling uttered word against lizzie more bitter than in declared that there be difference between people then there be something said a to own prospect in life lucy at once with vehemence declared that did not look for expect immediate marriage did not scruple to tell that knew well how difficult be task before that might be essential for interest that must remain a be for year two be astonished to find how completely understood position how thoroughly sympathised with interest there be only one thing must do for said what be one thing must give up almost thought ought

praiseworthy kiss with young barrister assured must have be on part act of self denial must to have be absolutely ruinous be agreed however between that lady fawn must be told that did not propose to marry till time in following year that must be formally asked to allow lucy to have home at fawn court in interval chapter xix a brother lord fawn have promised a put lizzie into carriage that must come to soon did not come soon fortnight passed did not show nothing further have be done in matter of diamond except mr camperdown have written to frank greystock explaining how impossible be that question of possession must be referred to arbitration according to belonged to heir a did estate one must have power of accepting arbitration respecting arbitration might separate from estate of infant be owner for life more than such arbitration must be accepted a to property of estate possession be nine point of law said frank to a put letter aside thinking at same time possession in hand of lizzie eustace included certainly one of nine point lizzie wore diamond again then again there may be question whether possession of necklace publicity of history however like many other history be most inaccurately told did not add something to reputation a lady of fashion in meantime lord fawn did not come to see so wrote to dear frederic have not better come to yours affectionately l go to north at end of month frank greystock did visit more than once on day after above letter be written came to be on sunday afternoon when july be more than half over found alone miss macnulty have gone

have pleased ear be always able to arouse for false enthusiasm on thing be utterly outside herself in life thought too must have travelled in search of holy sign have borne thing abandoned thing have persevered of certainty have be rewarded a for giving up string of diamond in common honesty be beyond wonder whether men ever be like said a allowed cousin to take book from hand let hope not oh frank be doubt a fanatic foolish a please if will read to end have read word of said lizzie enthusiastically then know that arthur did not go on search because have job of work to do by doing of people around might perhaps be somewhat benefited like launcelot better than arthur said lizzie so did queen replied frank useful practical man who attends vestry sits at board measure out gift to others by ounce never have heart have frank know what heart mean sometimes fancy that be talent for getting into debt running away with other men wife say that on purpose to make quarrel with run away with other men wife have heart get into debt unfortunately a for other men wife be not sure may not do even that day have lord fawn be here shook head written again shook head a did so long curl waved be very near to for be sitting close to sofa have raised so that might look into face speak to almost in whisper something must be settled lizzie before leave town wrote to yesterday one line desired to come expected here to day have come instead will say that be disappointed doubt be so oh frank how vain men be want to swear to must sooner have with than be not content with thinking unless tell that be so know that be so though be to be husband suppose will be husband spirit be not congenial to mine a be have not loved must not have accepted be to do frank what be to do think how desolate be how unfriended how much in want of one whom can call protector can not have always with care more for little finger of prim piece of propriety down at old dowager than do for sorrow be true frank did not say that be true lord fawn be at rate respectable at least thought be so when accepted offer be respectable enough just be nothing more blame for saying must be wife if do will unsay let cost what may be treating so badly that need not go far for excuse then looked into face with eagerness of gaze clearly implying that expected serious answer why do not answer frank what be to say be timid cautious man have frightened about trumpery necklace be behaving badly will make good husband be not spendthrift have rank people be respectable a lady fawn house in england will be open to be not rich together will be rich what be that without love doubt love when be own will love dearly ah yes a must horse picture be there anything of rapture of love in be that idea of love be so love miss demure call name lizzie will say what please of be to be friend may not speak will have such friendship be demure if like what harm be there in saying be not demure know that at least pretend to be other than be when becomes wife wonder whether will like way have not yet told that be to be wife did so tell now thought for moment that have better tell did not do so must said to add embarrassment to present position a marriage be to be postponed for year might be better perhaps for lucy that must not be declared openly be thus argued with yet doubt knew well that did not declare truth because must take away something of sweetness from friendship with cousin lizzie if ever do marry said hope will like wife way of course will not tell anything expect confidence from think man be ever able to work up to mark of true confidence with friend men together when like other talk of politics perhaps of money doubt whether ever really tell thought longing to other be woman more communicative yes certainly what be there must not tell if cared to hear thought have be open to if choose to read have feeling regarding must keep nothing back from oh frank if understood must save be going to say from unhappiness did so well that must have be more than man have not believed of be sitting almost upright now though foot be still on sofa be leaning over towards a though imploring for aid eye be full of tear lip be apart a though still eager with energy of expression hand be clasped together be very lovely very attractive almost invincible for one a frank greystock opposition to in present mood be impossible there be men by whom woman if have wit beauty conscience can not be withstood arm may be used against sort of battle waged against can raise shield from can retire into fortress in can parry blow man so weak so attacked may sometimes run even poor chance of running be often cut off from how unlike be to lucy believed in part yet be idea occurred to when lucy be much in earnest in eye too tear must sparkle smallest drop bright liquid diamond never fell face must be bright eloquent with feeling how unlike be two knew that difference be that between truth falsehood yet partly believed falsehood if knew how to save from hour uneasiness must do said murmured must not know then have nothing further to say suited to remain silent for moment while dried eye recovered composure prepared to carry on battle with smile must carry on battle using wile knew straining nerve to be victorious encountering danger yet have definite aim before did not know what must be at at period of career did not want to marry cousin having resolved that must be lady fawn did intend that cousin must be lover in ordinary sense of love be far too wary in pursuit of world good to sacrifice to such wish a did want to help about diamond such help a might have a knew well on much easier term there be probably anxiety in bosom to cause to be untrue to lucy morris guiding motive of conduct be desire to make thing seem to be other than be to be always acting part rather than living own life be to everything after must come to fact said after while suppose will be better that must marry lord fawn if wish nay can not have said in matter must rule by own judgment if be averse to shook head then will own that have better be so again shook head lizzie for sake own must declare that if have opinion in matter will have will never have to say that pressed into marriage debarred from marrying must not bear such accusation might tell ought to do certainly not think how young be by comparison how old be be eight year older than be remember after have gone through be twenty two at age other girl have friend to tell have one unless will tell have accepted yes suppose be not altogether indifferent to paused again shook head indeed know if mean do love a must love man whose heart be quite congenial to own certainly continued to shake head very sadly esteemed when asked say at once that having made up mind will go through with think that ought think so so be frank will frank will not give up property wish to do that must be weak now must not be sure that be own faith to must not depend on of course not be just what mean can have right to interfere when asked to be wife said nothing about if doe not come to what will do suppose have better see said frank slowly will will be so good of feel that can leave so safely in hand will go out of town know on thirtieth feel that will be better away be sick of noise glitter worldliness of london will come on twelfth not quite so soon a that said after pause will come yes about twentieth of course will see oh yes so may have one to guide can trust have brother frank do ever think of put out hand to clasped held tight in own then after while pulled towards in moment be on ground kneeling at foot arm be round shoulder hand be on back be embracing face be turned up to pressed lip upon forehead a brother said stretching back head looking up into face yes a brother be sitting rather acting little play together in back drawing room ordinary entrance to two room be from landing place into larger apartment of fact lizzie be probably aware when permitted to fall into position a to moment two might be wanted for recovery when therefore servant in livery opened door did a frank thought somewhat suddenly be able to be standing on leg before be caught quickness with sprung from position facility with composed not face only loose lock of hair person for reception of coming visitor be quite marvellous about there be none of look of having be found out be so very disagreeable to wearer of whereas frank when lord fawn be announced be aware that manner be awkward general appearance flurried lizzie be more flurried than if have stepped that moment from out of hand of tirewoman greeted lord fawn very prettily holding by hand long enough to show that have more claim to do so than must other woman then just murmured cousin name two men shook hand looked at other a men do who know that be not friend think that may live to be enemy lord fawn who rarely forgot anything have certainly not forgotten sawab frank be aware that might soon be called on to address lordship in anything friendly term said however few word about parliament weather desirability of escaping from london frank said lady eustace be coming down in august to shoot three annual grouse at portray must keep one for lord if thought must come for will promise lord fawn fair third at rate said frank can not visit portray august be afraid said lordship

be left alone with lizzie began lord said considering have passed between have be truant yes admit with lord fault admitted be fault forgiven then took old seat on sofa placed on chair frank greystock have occupied have not intended to own fault certainly not to accept forgiveness have be too quick for now must not find word by to express in truth continued must always rather remember one kindness than dozen omission on part of friend lady eustace have not willingly omitted anything so be will not give slightest excuse for saying that have heard reproach from have come at last be welcome be that enough for have much to say to about diamond when be entering room have not word to say to about anything else since subject have sprung up before whether be be not to regard a being at moment engaged to marry lady eustace be matter to of much doubt of be sure that if be engaged to a wife ought not to be entertaining cousin frank greystock down at portray castle unless have old lady not

persuaded by mother sister to wish that be not bound then matter must be affair of if however diamond be abandoned then engagement be to be continued in case be out of question that elected bride must entertain young man even though be widow young man be cousin of course must have spoken of diamond first other matter have obtruded upon be puzzled be mr greystock to accompany into scotland asked oh

join for day cousin friend must be sure come over to castle so that must not suffer from being left alone with miss macnulty at present be impossible said lord fawn then paused lady eustace position in stand to other be one not altogether free from trouble can not say that be of making said with smile once asked what men think favour from granted perhaps too easily know how greatly be indebted to

eustace be ready for journey there be there be train leaving london for carlisle at be by lizzie proposed to travel so that might sleep in city go on through dumfries to portray next morning be scheme there be part of scheme a to have felt much doubt must leave diamond must take with iron box in be kept be small so far portable that strong man might carry without much trouble indeed lizzie must

greystock might be induced to sympathise with hardly after fashion lizzie desired then sympathy in direction must be so dangerous must decide upon going on with fawn marriage for present have quarrelled with lord fawn very bitterness of quarrel decision with betrothed have declared intention of breaking off match made more resolute that must marry during journey to portray have again

motif in first place house in mount street be taken furnished by month servant be hired after same fashion horse jobbed lady eustace be already sufficiently intimate with account to know that must save two hundred pound by not remaining month three week in london sufficiently observant of own affair to have perceived that such saving be needed then appeared to that battle with lord fawn must be better fought from distance than at close quarter london too be becoming absolutely distasteful to there be many thing there that tended to make unhappy so few that must enjoy be afraid of mr camperdown ever on rack lest dreadful thing must come upon in respect of necklace horrible paper served upon from magistrate ordering appearance at newgate perhaps before lord chancellor visit from

containing shelley queen mab essayed to go down upon rock have actually breakfasted at nine be out on sloping ground below castle before ten having made boast to miss macnulty about morning air scrambled down not very far down little way beneath garden gate to spot on knob of rock cropped out from scanty herbage of incipient cliff fifty yard lower real rock began though real rock be not very rocky not precipitous even bold be partially covered with salt fed moss down almost to sea nevertheless justified in talking about rock bound shore shore be hers for life be rock bound knob have espied from window indeed have be thinking of for last week a place appropriate to solitude shelley have stood on before have stretched arm with enthusiasm towards just visible mountain of arran on

there be snail discomposed nevertheless must make best of darling queen mab must be read without coarse inappropriate day surroundings of drawing room be now manifest to that unless must get up much earlier in morning come out to reading after sunset knob of rock must not avail began reading resolved that must enjoy poetry in spite of narrow seat have often talked of queen mab perhaps thought have read however be in truth first attempt at work how wonderful be death death brother sleep then half closed volume thought that enjoyed idea death brother sleep did not know why must be more wonderful than action life thought word be of nature must enable to remember must be good for quoting sudden arose ianthe soul stood beautiful in naked purity name of ianthe suited exactly antithesis conveyed to mind by naked purity struck strongly determined to learn passage by heart eight nine line be printed separately like stanza labour must not be great task when done must be complete instinct with inexpressible beauty grace stain of earthliness have passed away reassumed native dignity stood immortal amid ruin be instinct with beauty stain soul did not stop to inquire may be excused for not understanding ah exclaimed to herself how true be how one feel how come home to one beudden arose ianthe soul ' then walked about garden repeating word to herself almost forgetting

liked idea of ruin almost a well a of immortality stain quite a well a purity a immortality must come a stain be instinct with grace why be afraid of ruin then if people go wrong at least woman be not asked out where beudden arose ianthe soul stood beautiful so piece be learned lizzie felt that have devoted hour to poetry in quite rapturous manner at rate have bit to quote though in truth did not understand exact bearing of image have so studied gesture so modulated voice that knew that must be effective did not then care to carry reading further returned with volume into house though passage about ianthe soul come very early in work be now quite familiar with poem when in after day spoke of a thing of beauty that have made own by long study actually did not know that be lying a grew older however quickly became wiser be aware that in learning one passage of poem be expedient to select one in middle at end world be so cruelly observant now day even men woman who have not read queen mab will know from what part of poem morsel be extracted will not give credit for page beyond from passage come after lunch lizzie invited miss macnulty to sit at open window of drawing room look out upon glittering wave in giving miss macnulty due must acknowledge that though owned actual cleverness have cultivated taste read little little of colourless kind thought nothing of hour that might get rid of live yet have certain power of insight must see thing lizzie eustace be utterly powerless to impose upon such a lizzie be miss macnulty be willing to put up with accept bread people whom have known have be either worthless a have be own father cruel like lady linlithgow false a be lady eustace miss macnulty knew that worthlessness cruelty falseness have to be endured by such a must bear without caring much about not condemning even within own heart very heavily be strangely deficient in that must not call quality by other name even to owner of be unable to pretend to believe lizzie rhapsody be hardly conscience grand spirit of truth that actuated a much a want of courage needed for lying have not have face to call old lady linlithgow kind therefore old lady linlithgow have turned out of house when lady eustace called on for sympathy have not courage enough to dare to attempt bit of acting must be necessary for sympathetic expression be like dog child be unable not to be true lizzie be longing for little mock sympathy be longing to show off shelley be very kind to miss macnulty when got poor lady into recess of window be nice be not said a spread hand out through open space towards wide expanse of glittering wave very nice only glare so said miss macnulty ah love full warmth of real summer with always seems that sun be needed to bring to true ripeness fruit of heart nevertheless have be much troubled by heat by midge when tried to sit on stone always think of few glorious day passed with darling florian at naples day too glorious because be so few now miss

gloriously worded have forgotten one word used wrong epithet sounded just a well primeval seemed to to be very poetical word to tell truth said miss macnulty never understand poetry when be quoted unless happen to know passage beforehand think will go away from for light be too much for poor old eye certainly miss macnulty have fallen into profession for be not suited chapter xxii lady eustace procures pony for use of cousin lady eustace must make nothing of miss macnulty in way of sympathy must not bear disappointment with patience be hardly to be expected that must do so paid great deal for miss macnulty in moment of rash generosity at time when hardly knew what money meant have promised miss macnulty seventy pound for first year seventy for second must arrangement last longer than

have set heart upon marrying heart said lizzie scornfully mind can have by simply sending diamond to jeweller may be wish in case will redeem word not for belongs to must be much be just pauper with name then loss will be so much le what right have to treat so did ever before hear of such thing why be to be allowed to go back without punishment more than what punishment must wish that must be beaten within inch of life if inch be not there must not complain be to do to absolute ruin to great injury think must almost do lizzie raised hand a though there be weapon in frank there must be something must have sit down bear world have be told of engagement there must be punishment must not wish to have action brought for breach of promise must wish to do must hurt most without hurting said lizzie wo give up necklace said frank certainly not said lizzie give up for sake man have always despised then have better let go will not let go what to be pointed at a woman that lord fawn have jilted never necklace must be nothing more to than ring drew from finger little circlet of gold with stone for have owed messrs harter benjamin five thirty pound till sir florian have settled that account for what cause can give for such treatment acknowledges that there be cause can state openly be to bear be that tell so oh frank let understand other lizzie will not fight be with pistol will attempt to thrash must be useless to argue whether public opinion be right wrong public opinion be now so much opposed to kind of thing that be out of question must injure position destroy own if mean to quarrel with on score have better say so perhaps at moment almost wished that must quarrel with be otherwise disposed oh frank said desert will not desert feel that be ill used frank do think that conduct be inexcusable there be to be punishment asked with strong indignation at injustice unjust always feel when be injured if carry well quietly with dignity world will punish believe bit of be not patient grizel who can content with heaping benefit on who injure then thinking that be coal of fire lucy morris be one of sort frank ought to have resented attack did not have such tame virtue will tell to face what be will lead life that will be sick of very name of necklace can not ask to marry will what not ask man to keep promise when be engaged to be not going to be such girl a do love then love hate always despised now hate yet must marry not for world frank because advised thought must do so yes did frank for must never have dreamed of taking know frank how be when told of must come to now again be sitting close to have hand upon arm frank even to please must not marry now will tell what will do will ask again in spite of idiot at richmond will kneel at foot necklace necklace then then will tell what think of marry must not touch with pair of tongs a said be holding cousin fast by hand chapter xxiv showing what frank greystock thought about marriage have not be much after noon when frank greystock reached portray castle be very nearly five when left of course have lunched with two lady a conversation before lunch have be long interesting did not sit down till near three then lizzie have taken out to show ground garden have clambered together down to sea beach leave here have said when insisted on going because of friend at cottage when suggested that must want help to climb back up rock to castle shook head a though heart be too full to admit of consideration so trifling thought flow more freely here with surge of water in ear than will with old woman droning to come here often know rock stone be not exactly true a have never be down once before mean to come again told that of course must come again will name day hour have nothing to take away if be not at castle will be at spot good bye frank took in arm kissed of course a brother then clambered up got on pony rode away dinna ken just what to mak ' o said gowran to wife may be be coosin coosins be nae that sib that weedow be to be hailed aboot jist ane a though be ony quean at fair from may be inferred that mr gowran have watched pair a be descending together towards shore frank have so much to think of riding back to cottage when came to gap instead of turning round along wall down valley took track right on across mountain lost way have meant to be back at cottage by three four yet have made visit to castle so long that without losing of way must not have be there before seven a be when hour arrived be up on top of hill must again see portray castle clustering down close upon sea thin belt of tree shining water beyond of road to cottage knew nothing for moment thought of returning to portray till have taught to perceive that distance be much greater than have be from spot at have first seen castle in morning then turned pony round descended on other side mind be very full of lizzie eustace full also of lucy morris if be to be asserted here that young man may be perfectly true to first young woman while be falling in love with second reader of story must probably be offended undoubtedly many men believe to be quite true while undergoing process many young woman expect nothing else from lover if only will come right at last be contented if come right at be way of world game have to be played over again lucy morris doubt have lived life too retired for learning of such useful forbearance frank greystock be quite proficient still considered to be true to lucy morris with truth seldom found in degenerate age with truth to intended to sacrifice of brightest hope of life with truth after much thought have generously preferred to ambition perhaps there be found shade of regret to tinge merit assumed on head in respect of bright thing must be necessary that must abandon if so feeling only assisted in defending present conduct from aspersion conscience might bring against intended to marry lucy morris without shilling without position girl who have earned bread a governess simply because loved be wonder to that lawyer man of world member of parliament one who have be steeped up to shoulder in way of world must still be so pure a to be capable of such sacrifice be so sacrifice must undoubtedly be made day must be absurd in one conscious of such high merit to be afraid of ordinary social incident of life be debauched broken drunkard who must become teetotaller not healthy hard working father of family who never drink drop of wine till dinner time need not be afraid of glass of champagne when on chance occasion go to picnic frank greystock be now going to picnic though meant to be true to lucy morris have enjoyed glass of champagne with lizzie eustace under rock be thinking good deal of champagne when lost way what wonderful woman be cousin lizzie so unlike other girl have ever seen how full be of energy how courageous then how beautiful doubt special treatment of be sheer flattery told that be so after flattery be agreeable that did like better than anybody else be probable must have feeling of injustice might do to heart of woman who at very moment that be expressing partiality for be also expressing anger that man must not consent to marry then woman who have have one husband already be not like young girl in respect to heart so at least thought frank greystock then remembered time at have intended to ask lizzie to be wife very day on must have done so have be able to get away from early division at house asked whether felt regret on score must have be very nice to come down to portray castle a to own mansion after work of court of session have lizzie become wife fortune must have helped to very highest step beneath throne at present be almost nobody because be so poor in debt be so undoubtedly what did matter in comparison with love of lucy morris man be bound to be true must be true only a matter of course lucy must wait when have first kissed cousin up in london suggested that kiss be given a by brother asserted that be accepted a by sister have not demurred having be allowed kiss nothing of kind have be said under rock to day then that fraternal arrangement when once made accepted remains doubt in force for long time did like cousin lizzie liked to feel that must be friend with power of domineering over also be fond of own way loved to domineer moment that suggested to that there might be quarrel be reduced to prayer that must not desert such friendship have charm for young man especially if lady be pretty a to lizzie prettiness man woman must entertain doubt have way of making most of be very hard to resist young woman when clamber over rock be awkward heavy unattractive troublesome lizzie have at one moment touched a fairy might have done have sprung at from stone to stone requiring help then on sudden have become so powerless that have be forced almost to carry in arm probably must have be moment induced mr gowran to liken to quean at fair undoubtedly there might be trouble frank be sufficiently experienced in way of world to know trouble must sometimes come from young lady who treat young men like brother when young men be engaged to other young lady other young lady be apt to disapprove of brother who be not brother by absolute right of birth knew also that circumstance of cousin position must make expedient that must marry second husband a must not be that second husband that matter be settled whether for good bad be not creating trouble for for then there arose in mind feeling very strange by mean uncommon prudence on part must be mean because by such prudence must be securing safety for a well a for what be doing be not only imprudent wrong also knew that be so lizzie eustace be pretty young woman when pretty young woman be in case man be bound to think of what be prudent of what be right such be perhaps instinct rather than theory for sake if not for own must have abstained be cousin be so placed in world a specially to require strong hand to help knew to be in truth heartless false greedy have so lived that even yet future life might be successful have called friend a well a cousin be bound to protect from evil if protection be possible be adding to difficulty because pretended to be in love with knew that be pretence yet because be pretty because be man must not save from doe do to be wiser than other men said to a looked round about on bare hill side in meantime have altogether lost way be between nine ten when reached cottage of course have dined said herriot not bit of left before five being sure must get here in hour half have be riding up down dreary hill for nearly five hour have dined there be neck of mutton chicken said neck of mutton must keep hot best so took chicken hope like lukewarm neck of mutton be hungry enough to eat anything not what have first rate luncheon what have done day stone toddy said herriot stick to if anything can pull through stone toddy will lived upon for two year stone toddy with little tobacco have be comfort began however by sleeping for few hour then went upon mountain did take gun took out of case did come right so left man came to said be keeper 'd have put gun right for be too bashful for persuaded wanted to go out alone see what bird there be at last induced to stay here with old woman be to be at cottage at nine to morrow hope be right in evening a smoked drank whiskey water probably supposing to be correct in ayrshire be led on by combined warmth of spirit tobacco friendship to talk about woman frank month six week since in moment of soft confidence have told friend of engagement with lucy morris of lizzie eustace have spoken only a of cousin whose interest be dear to engagement with lord fawn be known to london be therefore known to arthur herriot distant rumour however have reached that course of true love be not running quite smooth therefore on subject must not speak at rate till greystock must first mention how odd be to find two woman living alone in great house like frank have said because so few woman have mean to live in large house unless live with father husband truth be said frank that woman do well alone there be always savour of misfortune at least of melancholy about household have man to look after with generally old maid keep house widow marry again doubt be unconscious appreciation of feeling brought about burning of indian widow there be unfitness in woman for solitude female prometheus even without vulture must indicate cruelty worse even than jove woman must marry once twice thrice if necessary woman ca marry without men to marry frank greystock filled pipe a went on with lecture idea a to greater number of woman be nonsense of course be speaking of own kind of men woman disproportion of number in so small division of population amount to nothing have statistic to tell whether there be such disproportion in class where men die early from overwork more female be born than male be more than know a one of legislator of country be prepared to state that statistic be always false what have to do be to induce men to marry ca do by statute thank god yet by fashion fashion seems to be going other way said herriot can be only done by education conscience take men of forty round men of own class believe that married men be happier than unmarried want answer know just for sake of argument think married men be happier speak a fox who have lost tail at rate a fox in act of losing never mind tail if morality in life enlarged affection be conducive to happiness must be so short common unpaid bill be conducive to misery be what must say if wanted to oppose never came across man willing to speak truth who did not admit that in long run married men be happier a regard woman there be even ground for argument yet men marry ca mean there be food enough in world man fear that wo get enough of what there be for wife family labourer with twelve shilling week have such fear if did marry food must come be that man be unconscientious ignorant a to source of true happiness wo submit to cold mutton three clean shirt week not because dislike mutton dirty linen because world say be vulgar that be feeling keep from marrying herriot a for said herriot regard a so placed that dare to think of young woman of own rank except a creature must be foreign to can not make such one friend a must man because must be in love with at once dare to be in love because must not see wife child starve regard position a one of enforced monasticism a monk under cruellest compulsion often wish have be brought up a journeyman hatter why hatter be told be active sort of life be fast asleep be just now when be preaching 'd better go to bed nine o'clock for breakfast suppose chapter xxv mr dove opinion mr thomas dove familiarly known among club men attorney clerk perhaps even among judge when very far from seat of judgment a turtle dove be counsel learned in law

equally stubborn must be acknowledged that be seldom proved to be wrong consequently attorney believed in prospered be thin man over fifty year of age very full of scorn wrath impatient of fool

lived dove probably have circle of acquaintance mr dove domestic life forensic life be kept quite separate at present moment mr dove be interesting to solely a being learned counsel in whom mr camperdown trusted to whom mr camperdown be willing to trust for opinion in so grave matter a of eustace diamond case be made out submitted to mr dove immediately after scene on pavement in mount street at mr camperdown have endeavoured to induce lizzie to give up necklace following be opinion mr dove gave there be much error about heirloom many think that chattel may be made heirloom by owner of be not case law however doe recognise heirloom a to exors admors be excluded in favour of successor when there be such heirloom go to heir by special custom devise of heirloom be necessarily void for will take place after death heirloom be already vested in heir by custom have from littleton that law prefers custom to devise brooke say that best thing of sort may be heirloom such a best bed best table best pot pan coke say that heirloom be so by custom not by law spelman say in defining heirloom that may be omne utensil robustius must exclude necklace in termes de ley be defined a ascun parcel de ustensiles be told in coke upon littleton that crown jewel be heirloom decision a far a go denies right to other jewel certain chattel may undoubtedly be held claimed a being in nature of heirloom a sword pennon of honour garter collar of s s see case of earl of northumberland that of pusey horn pusey v pusey journal of house of lord delivered officially to peer may be so claimed see upton v lord ferrers devisor may clearly devise limit possession of chattel making inalienable by devisee in succession in such case will become absolute possession of first person seized in tail even though infant in case of death without will must go to exors such arrangement therefore can only hold good for life in existence for year afterwards chattel so secured must not be heirloom see carr v lord errol vesey rowland v morgan lord eldon remark that such chattel held in family be rather favourite of court be in ormonde case executor therefore even when setting aside claim a for heirloom ought not to apply such property in payment of debt unless obliged law allows of claim for paraphernalia for widow having adjusted such claim seems to show that claim may be limited if man deliver cloth to wife die will have though have not fashioned into garment intended pearl jewel even though only worn on state occasion may go to widow a paraphernalia with limit in case of lady douglas being daughter of irish earl widow of king sergeant temp car be held that l be not too much be allowed diamond pearl chain to value in lord keeper finch declared that must never allow paraphernalia except to widow of nobleman in lord macclesfield gave mistress tipping paraphernalia to value of l whether so persuaded by law precedent otherwise may be uncertain lord talbot allowed gold watch a paraphernalia lord hardwicke went much further decided that mr northey be entitled to wear jewel to value of l saying that value made difference seems to have limited nature of possession in jewel by declaring to be entitled to wear only when full dressed be think clear that eustace estate can not claim jewel a heirloom be last mentioned a far a know only mentioned a heirloom in will of great grandfather of present baronet if be diamond then named by a such must not have devised to present claimant a died in present claimant be not yet two year old whether widow must claim a paraphernalia be more doubtful know that lord hardwicke ruling must decide case if so must think be debarred from selling a limit use of jewel of lesser value than to wearing of when full dressed use being limited possession with power of alienation can not be intended lady claim to a gift from husband amount to nothing if be not hers by will seems that be not so can only hold a paraphernalia belonging to station presume to be capable of proof that diamond be not in scotland when sir florian made will when died former fact might be used a tending to show intention when will be made understand that did leave to widow by will chattel in portray castle j d august when mr camperdown have thrice read opinion sat in chair unhappy old man be undoubtedly case that have be lawyer for upwards of forty year have always believed that gentleman must make article of value heirloom in family title deed of vast estate have be confided to keeping have have much to do with property of kind now be told that in reference to property of certain description property by nature must only belong to such a who be client have be long without knowledge whatsoever have called necklace heirloom to john eustace above score of time now be told by mr dove not only that necklace be not heirloom that must have be heirloom be man who trusted much in barrister a be natural with attorney be now almost inclined to doubt mr dove be hardly more at ease in regard to other clause of opinion not only must not estate claim necklace a heirloom that greedy siren heartless snake that harpy of widow for be thus that mr camperdown in solitude spoke to of poor lizzie perhaps throwing in harder word two female swindler must claim a paraphernalia there be crumb of comfort for in thought that must force to claim privilege from decision of court of queen bench that greed must be exposed must do so must be prevented from selling diamond mr dove seemed to make quite clear then there came that other question a to inheritance of property under husband will sir florian have not intended that must inherit necklace mr camperdown be quite certain on point suffered doubt must be able to prove that diamond have never be in scotland since sir florian marriage have traced history from date with diligence must use thought that knew might be doubtful whether must prove lady eustace have first stated have so stated before have learned importance of other statement that sir florian have given diamond in london a passed through london from scotland to italy that have carried thence to naples where sir florian have died if be so must not have be at portray castle till took there a widow must undoubtedly be regarded a portion of property sir florian habitually kept in london that be so mr camperdown entertained doubt now widow alleged that sir florian have given necklace to in scotland whither have gone immediately after marriage that have brought up to london have be married on th of september by jeweller book be hard to tell whether trinket have be given up to sir florian on th th of september on th sir florian young bride have undoubtedly be in london mr camperdown anathematised carelessness of everybody connected with messrs garnett establishment sort of people have more idea of accuracy than than than have have of heirloom conscience whispered to filling up blank nevertheless thought must prove that necklace be first put into lizzie hand in london middle aged very discreet man at messrs garnett who have given up jewel case to sir florian be sure that have known sir florian to be married man when did so lady maid who have be in scotland with lady eustace who be now living in turin having married courier have given evidence before italian man of law stating that have never seen necklace till came to london there be moreover probability of case be likely that sir florian must take thing down in pocket to scotland there be statement a first made by lady eustace to cousin frank repeated by to john eustace not to be denied by one be very well for now to say that have forgotten must one believe that on subject must forget still whole thing be very uncomfortable mr dove opinion if seen by lady eustace friend must rather fortify than frighten be once to get hold of word paraphernalia must be a tower of strength to mr camperdown specially felt whereas have hitherto believed that respectable attorney must take up case a of lady eustace must not now confess to that lawyer seeing mr dove opinion must be justified in taking up yet be a certain a ever that woman be robbing estate be duty to guard must cease to be active in matter necklace must be broken up property sold scattered before year be out then woman must have got better of will find that have not done with yet said to a wrote line to john eustace john eustace be out of town a matter of course on next day mr camperdown went down joined wife family at little cottage have at dawlish necklace however interfered much with holiday chapter xxvi mr gowran be very funny frank greystock certainly went over to portray too often so often that pony be proved to be quite necessary miss macnulty held tongue be gloomy believing that lady eustace be still engaged to lord fawn feeling that in case there must not be so many visit to rock mr gowran be very attentive must tell on day to five minute how long two cousin be sitting together on sea shore arthur herriot who cared nothing for lady eustace who knew that friend have promised to marry lucy morris be inclined to be serious on subject a be always case with men be not willing to speak about once once only two men dined together at castle for doing of be necessary that gig must be hired way from prestwick herriot have not be anxious to go over alleging various excuse absence of dress clothes call of stone toddy bashfulness absurdity of paying fifteen shilling for gig went at last constrained by friend very dull evening passed lizzie be quite unlike usual self be silent grave solemnly courteous miss macnulty have not word to say for herself even frank be dull arthur herriot have not tried to exert dinner have be failure think much of cousin daresay said frank a be driving back be very pretty woman must say that doe not think much of probably not why on earth must speak to went on making speech to miss macnulty on purpose to give chance lizzie generally talk about a well a young woman know have not word to say to to because devoted to miss mac name be be nonsense said frank lizzie be more like brother sister than anything else have one else belonging to have to come to for advice sort of thing wanted to like never like people people never like there be old saying that must know man seven year before poke fire want to know person seven year before can ask how do to take out to dine in way be of thing most hopeless do dine out in london be different there be certain routine of conversation going one fall into at such affair a evening one have to be intimate be bore mean to say anything against lady eustace beauty be undeniable doubt cleverness be sometimes too clever said frank hope be not becoming too clever for have got to remember that be due elsewhere eh old fellow be first word that herriot have said on subject to word frank greystock made answer have effect a also did gloomy look of miss macnulty not unobserved presence of mr andy gowran on various occasion between shot more grouse so keeper swore than have ever be shot on mountain before herriot absolutely killed one two to own great delight frank who be fairly skilful must get four five in day there be excursion to be made air of hill be in treat to of though greystock be so often away at castle herriot did not find time hang heavily on hand be sorry when fortnight be over think will stay couple of day longer frank said when herriot spoke of return truth be must see lizzie again be bothered by business have to see about letter came morning need pull such long face there be nothing of kind be thinking of thought so much of what once said to about girl that hope at rate may never be in trouble hope never may on account said frank what trouble may have a life will be troublesome trust may share lessen on evening herriot went on next morning frank greystock again rode over to portray castle when be alone after herriot departure wrote letter to lucy morris have expressed hope that might never be cause of trouble to lucy morris knew that silence must trouble there must be human being le inclined to be suspicious than lucy morris of frank be sure there have be express stipulation with lady fawn that must be allowed to receive letter from must naturally be vexed when did not write to so wrote portray cottage sept dearest lucy have be here for fortnight shooting grouse wandering about mountain going to sleep on hill side will say that there never be time so fit for writing of letter will be because have not learned yet that idler people be more inclined be to be idle hear of lord chancellor writing letter to mother day of life men who have nothing on earth to do can not bring to face sheet of paper must promise that when be lord chancellor must write to day be not that when time come will hope to be always with in truth have have to pay constant visit to cousin who life in big castle on sea side ten mile from here over mountain who be in peck of trouble in spite of prosperity one of unhappiest woman must say that must meet anywhere know so much of affair that without breach of trust may say so much wish have father brother to manage matter for have none can not desert lord fawn be behaving badly to so a far a can see be people who manage eustace property lizzie a know be not most tractable of woman altogether have more to do in matter than like riding ten mile backwards forward so often over same route on little pony be not good fun be almost glad distance be not le otherwise might have be always there know quite like lizzie be to be pitied go up to london on friday will only be there for one two day be for one night go almost entirely on business must fear be here again at castle before can settle for work happiness on sunday night go down to bobsborough where indeed ought to have be earlier fear can not go to richmond on saturday on sunday lady fawn must hardly make welcome will be at bobsborough for about three week there if have command to give will obey may however tell truth at once though be truth must keep very much to yourself in position in now stand a to lord fawn being absolutely forced to quarrel with on lizzie behalf lady fawn must hardly receive with comfort to herself be best of woman a be dear friend nothing be further from than idea of quarrelling with of course take son part hardly know how allusion to subject must be avoided however dearest need ruffle feather between who love other better than love either fawn lizzies let find line at chamber to say that be so always will be so god bless own darling ever always own f g on following day rode over to castle have received letter from john eustace who have found forced to run up to london to meet mr camperdown lawyer have thought to postpone further consideration of whole matter till everybody else must be naturally in london till november might be perhaps even till after christmas mind be ill at ease knew that so much might be done with diamond in four month might even now be in hand of benjamin of harter might soon be beyond power of lawyer of policeman to trace therefore went up from dawlish persuaded john eustace to come from yorkshire be great nuisance eustace freely anathematised necklace if only one must steal so that might hear more of thing said a mr camperdown have frequently remarked value be too great for trifling eustace went up to london mr camperdown put into hand turtle dove opinion explaining that be by mean expedient that must be shown to other party

fawn walking in ground have be told that must probably be found walking in ground if be willing to tender to apology mind have be very full of subject not only in reference to lover a regarded own conduct one of elder fawn girl have assured under circumstance must lady be justified in telling gentleman that have spoken untruth be not quite sure that law so laid down be right then must not remember that gentleman in question be lord fawn that be lady fawn governess mr greystock be affianced lover first duty be to then granting that have be wrong in accusing lord fawn of untruth must not refrain from asking whether have not be much more wrong in saying in hearing that mr greystock be not gentleman offence have preceded offence have caused hardly knew whether did did not owe apology to lord fawn be quite sure that lord fawn owed apology to walked straight up to lord fawn met beneath tree be still black solemn be evidently brooding over grievance bowed to stood still a approached lord said be very sorry for what happened last night so be very sorry miss morris think know that be engaged to marry mr greystock can not allow that have anything to do with when think that must be dearer to than world will acknowledge must hear hard thing said of without speaking face became blacker than ever made reply wanted abject begging of unconditional pardon from little girl who loved enemy if be done must vouchsafe forgiveness be too small by nature to grant on other term of course continued lucy be bound to treat with special respect in lady fawn house looked almost beseechingly into face a paused for moment treated with especial disrespect said lord fawn how did treat lord fawn miss morris must be allowed in discussing matter with mother to express own opinion in such language a may think fit to use mr greystock conduct to be be be altogether most ungentlemanlike mr greystock be gentleman conduct be most offensive most most ungentlemanlike mr greystock disgraced be true said lucy lord fawn gave one start then walked off to house a quick a leg must carry chapter xxviii mr dove in chamber scene between lord fawn greystock have taken place in mr camperdown chamber john eustace have also be present lawyer have suffered considerable annoyance before arrival of two first named gentleman from reiterated assertion made by eustace that must take further trouble whatsoever about jewel mr camperdown have in vain pointed out to that plain duty lay upon a executor guardian to protect property on behalf of nephew eustace have asserted that though be comparatively poor man must sooner replace necklace out of own property than be subject to nuisance of continued quarrel dear john ten thousand pound mr camperdown have said be fortune for younger son boy be only two year old will have time enough to make fortune for own younger son if doe not squander everything if doe ten thousand pound will make difference justice of thing john justice may be purchased too dearly such harpy a be too pleaded lawyer then lord fawn have come in greystock have followed immediately afterwards may a well say at once said greystock that lady eustace be determined to maintain right to property that will not give up diamond till adequate court of law will have decided that be mistaken in view stop one moment mr camperdown feel bound to go further than express own opinion that be right can hardly understand such opinion a coming from said camperdown have changed mind at rate said john eustace not so eustace mr camperdown will be good enough to understand that opinion expressed here be that of friend not that of lawyer must understand eustace continued greystock that be speaking now of cousin right to property though value be great have advised to give up custody of for while till matter will be clearly decided that have still be advice to have in respect changed mind feel that be being cruelly used with woman spirit will not in such circumstance yield anything mr camperdown actually stopped carriage in street must not answer line that anybody wrote to said lawyer may say plainly for here know circumstance lady eustace feel strongest possible indignation at manner in be being treated by lord fawn have only asked to give up diamond till question must be settled said lord fawn backed request lord by threat cousin be naturally most indignant lord must allow to tell fully share feeling there be use in making quarrel about said eustace quarrel be already made replied greystock be here to tell lord fawn in presence in presence of mr camperdown that be behaving to lady with ill usage must not dare to exercise did not know that position save from legal punishment a do present usage of society from other consequence have behaved to with possible consideration said lord fawn be simple assertion said other have made one assertion have made world will have to judge between right have to take upon to decide whether thing belongs to lady eustace to one else when thing be talked about be obliged to have opinion said lord fawn who be still thinking of word in to reply to insult offered by greystock without injury to dignity a under secretary of state conduct sir have be altogether inexcusable then frank turned to attorney have be given to understand that be desirous of knowing where diamond necklace be at present be at lady eustace house in scotland at portray castle then shook hand with john eustace bowed to mr camperdown succeeded in leaving room before lord fawn have so far collected sens a to be able to frame anger into definite word will never willingly speak to man again said lord fawn a be not probable that greystock must greatly desire further conversation with lord fawn threat did not carry with powerful feeling of severity mr camperdown groaned over matter with thorough vexation of spirit seemed to a though harpy a called must really make good case against at rate must make seem to be good for so long time triumph of success must be hers knew that be already in debt gave credit for propensity to fast living almost did injustice of course jewel must be sold for value harpy must triumph of what use to to estate must be decision of court in favour when diamond must have be broken up scattered to wind of heaven ten thousand pound be to mr camperdown mind thing quite terrible that in country boast of law of execution of law such impostor a be widow must be able to lay dirty grasping finger on so great amount of property that there must be mean of punishing that lizzie eustace have stolen diamond a pickpocket steal watch be fact a to mr camperdown have in mind shadow of doubt a reader know be right have stolen mr camperdown knew that have stolen be wretched man from first moment of late sir florian infatuation about woman have worked woe for mr camperdown mr camperdown have striven hard to great almost permanent offence of sir florian to save portray from present condition of degradation have striven in vain portray belonged to harpy for life moreover have be forced to be instrumental in paying over to harpy large sum of eustace money almost immediately on becoming widow then have come affair of diamond affair of ten thousand pound a mr camperdown must exclaim to throwing eye up to ceiling now seemed that be to get better of even in although there must not be shadow of doubt a to falsehood fraudulent dishonesty luck in matter be so bad john eustace have backbone spirit proper feeling a to own family lord fawn be a weak a water almost disgraced cause by accident of adherence to greystock who must have be tower of strength have turned against be now prepared to maintain that harpy be right mr camperdown knew that harpy be wrong that be harpy must not abandon cause difficulty in way be great annoyance to be subjected be excessive wife daughter be still at dawlish be up in town in september simply because harpy have present possession of diamond mr camperdown be man turned sixty handsome grey haired healthy somewhat florid carrying in face person external sign of prosperity that kind of self assertion prosperity always produce who knew best be aware that did not bear trouble well in trouble such a be about necklace there must come over face look of weakness betrayed want of real inner strength how many face one see in ordinary circumstance be comfortable self asserting sufficient even bold line of under difficulty collapse become mean spiritless insignificant there be face in usual form seem to bluster with prosperity loss of dozen point at whist will reduce to currish aspect reminds one of dog whip mr camperdown countenance when lord fawn mr eustace left have fallen away into meanness of appearance no longer carried a man owning dog whip rather a hound feared better attorney for purpose to life be devoted did not exist in london than mr camperdown to say that be honest be nothing to describe simply a zealous must be to fall very short of merit interest of client be own interest legal right of property of have legal charge be a dear to a own blood must not be said of that be learned lawyer perhaps in branch of solicitor profession in have be called upon to work experience go further than learning may be doubted indeed whether be not so in branch of profession might perhaps have be better for mr camperdown have devoted more hour of youth to reading book on conveyancing be now too old for such study must trust only to reading of other people reading however of other people be always at command client be rich men who did not mind paying for opinion to have opinion from mr dove other learned gentleman be day practice of life when obtained a often did little coign of legal vantage subtle definition a to property be comfortable to must rejoice to think that must always have dove at hand to tell exactly how far be justified in going in defence of client interest now there have come to comfort from corner of legal knowledge mr dove have taken extraordinary pain in matter have simply succeeded in throwing over employer necklace ca be heirloom said mr camperdown to telling off on finger dozen instance in have known have heard that head of family have so arranged future possession of family jewel then again read mr dove opinion actually took law book off shelf with view of testing correctness of barrister in reference to special assertion pot pan might be heirloom not necklace mr camperdown must hardly bring to believe that be law then a to paraphernalia up to moment though have be called upon to arrange great dealing in reference to widow have never a yet heard of claim made by widow for paraphernalia then widow with whom have be called upon to deal have be lady quite content to accept good thing settled upon by liberal prudence of friend husband not greedy blood sucking harpy such a lady eustace be quite terrible to mr camperdown that one of client must have fallen into such pit mors omnibus est communis to have left widow behind one john said opening door john be son partner john came to having be summoned by clerk from room just shut door have have scene here lord fawn mr greystock almost coming to blow about horrid woman upper house must have got worst of a usually doe said younger attorney there be john eustace care more what becomes of property than if have nothing to do with absolutely talk of replacing diamond out of own pocket man whose personal interest in estate be by mean equal to own must do know said camperdown junior who did not know family be just what must do said father who did there be nothing must give away when once idea take think of woman having whole portray estate perhaps for next sixty year nearly fee simple of property just because made eye to sir florian be done gone father here be dove tell that necklace ca be heirloom unless belongs to crown say 'd better take word for be not so sure of that ca be will tell what will do will go over see can file bill in chancery doubt prove that property belongs to family must go by will will sell before can get custody of perhaps have done that already greystock say be at portray believe be be wearing in london only in july day two before saw a be leaving town if anybody like jeweller have be down at castle must have heard of have sold yet will must do just same if be heirloom john think not must have acted much more quickly have frightened if be father 'd drop matter altogether let john eustace replace if plea know that must never be called on to do anything of kind be sort of business not ten thousand pound said camperdown senior to whom magnitude of larceny almost ennobled otherwise mean duty of catching thief then mr camperdown rose slowly walked across new square lincoln inn under low archway by entrance to old court in lord eldon used to sit to old square in turtle dove have built legal nest on first floor close to old gateway mr dove be gentleman who spent very great portion of life in somewhat gloomy abode of learning be not now term time most of brother be absent from london recruiting strength among alp drinking in vigour for fresh campaign with salt sea breeze of kent sussex perhaps shooting deer in scotland catching fish in connemara mr dove be man of iron who wanted such recreation to be absent from law book black littered ink stained old table on be wont to write opinion be to to be wretched only exercise necessary to be that of putting on wig going into one of court be close to chamber even be almost distasteful to preferred sitting in old arm chair turning over old book in search of old case producing opinion must be prepared to back against world of lincoln inn mr camperdown have known other intimately for many year though rank of two men in profession differed much be able to discus question of law without appreciation of difference among one man knew much other little one be not only learned possessed also of great gift while other be simply ordinary clear headed man of business have sympathy in common made friend be honest unwilling to sell service to dishonest customer equally entertained deep rooted contempt for portion of mankind who thought that property must be managed protected without intervention of lawyer outside world to be world of pretty laughing ignorant child lawyer be parent guardian pastor master by whom child must be protected from evil incident to childishness yes sir be here said turtle dove clerk be talking of going away wo go be told can have week know that like to leave mr dove child be down at ramsgate be here night have be out for so long that when wanted to go a far a temple yesterday must find hat then clerk opened door ushered mr camperdown into room mr dove be younger man by five six year hair be still black mr camperdown be nearer white than grey nevertheless mr camperdown looked a though be younger man mr dove be long thin man with stoop in shoulder with deep set hollow eye lanthorn cheek sallow complexion with long thin hand who seemed to acknowledge by movement of body tone of voice that old age be creeping on whereas attorney step be still elastic speech brisk mr camperdown wore blue frock coat coloured cravat light waistcoat with mr dove visible article of raiment be black except shirt have that peculiar blackness man achieves when wear dress coat over high black waistcoat in morning did make much fear of what sent about heirloom said mr dove divining purport of mr camperdown visit great deal more than wanted can assure mr dove there be common error about heirloom very common indeed must say god bless soul when one know how often word occurs in family deed doe startle one to be told that there be such thing think said quite so much a indeed be careful to point out that law doe acknowledge heirloom not diamond said attorney doubt whether went quite so far a that only crown diamond think ever debarred other diamond diamond in star of honour might form part of heirloom think that diamond must be heirloom if in star of honour why not in necklace argued mr camperdown almost triumphantly because star of honour unless tampered with by fraud must naturally be maintained in original form setting of necklace will probably be altered from generation to generation one like picture precious piece of furniture pot pan said mr camperdown with sarcasm pot pan may be precious too replied mr dove such thing can be traced can be held a heirloom without imposing too great difficulty on guardian law be generally very wise prudent mr camperdown much more so often than be who attempt to improve quite agree with there mr dove must law do service do think if lent authority to special preservation in special hand of trinket only to be used for vanity ornament be that kind of property over owner must have power of disposition more lasting more autocratic than be given even in regard to land land at rate can be traced be thing fixed known string of pearl be not only alterable constantly altered can not easily be traced property of such enormous value must at rate be protected said mr camperdown indignantly property be protected mr camperdown although a know too well such protection can never be perfect system of heirloom if there can be said to be such system be not devised for what mean when talk of protection of property must have said that be just what be devised for think not be devised with more picturesque idea of maintaining chivalric association heirloom have become so not that future owner of may be assured of so much wealth whatever value of thing so settled may be that son grandson descendant may enjoy satisfaction be derived from saying father grandfather ancestor sat in chair looked a now look in picture be graced by wearing on breast that very ornament now see lying beneath glass crown jewel be heirloom in same way a representing not possession of sovereign time honoured dignity of crown law in general concern with property life liberty have in matter bowed gracefully to spirit of chivalry have lent aid to romance certainly did not do so to enable discordant heir of rich man to settle simple dirty question of money with ordinary prudence rich man must have settled before died turtle dove have spoken with emphasis have spoken well mr camperdown have not ventured to interrupt while be speaking be sitting far back on chair with neck bent with head forward rubbing long thin hand slowly over other with deep bright eye firmly fixed on companion face mr camperdown have not unfrequently heard speak in same fashion before be accustomed to manner of unravelling mystery searching into cause of law with spirit almost lent poetry to subject when mr dove must do so mr camperdown must not quite understand word spoken must listen to with undoubting reverence did understand in part be conscious of infusion of certain amount of poetic spirit into own bosom must think of speech afterwards must entertain high somewhat cloudy idea of beauty majesty of law mr dove speech did mr camperdown good helped to preserve from worst of disease low idea of humanity think then have better not claim a heirloom asked think have better not think that must claim a paraphernalia that question have hardly be put to though allowed to wander into for intimacy with must hardly have ventured to stray so far need hardly say how much obliged be will submit one two other case to be inclined to think court must not allow to a paraphernalia seeing that value be excessive a compared with income degree if did must do so in fashion must guard from alienation must sell under rose then must be guilty of stealing must hardly attempt even if not restrained by honesty knowing a must know that greatness of value must almost assuredly lead to detection same feeling must prevent buyer from purchasing say know that be given to absolutely must like to know circumstance yes of course must be disposed to think that in equity allegation by receiver of such gift unsubstantiated by evidence by deed must be allowed to stand gentleman left behind will regular settlement must think that possession of diamond not presume touched on in settlement oh dear not word about must think then subject to claim for paraphernalia possession of diamond must be ruled by will mr camperdown be rushing into further difficulty of chattel in scotland in england when turtle dove stopped declaring that must not venture to discus matter a to knew none of fact of course not of course not said mr camperdown will have case prepared 'd apologise for coming at only that get so much from few word be always delighted to see mr camperdown said turtle dove bowing chapter xxix have better go away when lord fawn gave sudden jump stalked away towards house on sunday morning before breakfast lucy morris be very unhappy girl have second time accused lord fawn of speaking untruth did not quite understand usage of world in matter did know that one offence gentleman be supposed never to commit be that of speaking untruth offence may be one committed oftener than other by gentleman a also by other people nevertheless be regarded by usage of society a being one thing gentleman never doe of lucy understood something word lie knew to be utterly abominable that lizzie eustace be little liar have be acknowledged between fawn girl very often to have told lady eustace that word spoken by be lie must have be worse crime than lie to have brought accusation in term against lord fawn must have be to degrade herself for ever be there difference between lie untruth one must be that other need not be intentional did feel felt also that le offensive word have come to mean lie world having be driven so to use because world did not dare to talk about lie word bearing meaning in common parlance have twice applied to lord fawn yet a be well aware lord fawn have told

said lucy lord fawn did tell mother lady fawn be perplexed in extreme be divided in judgment feeling between privilege due to lucy a girl possessed of authorised lover privilege doubt existed be not

marry then be lord always go for something be sorry must have so much trouble said mr greystock in truth mother be not sorry did not declare to herself that must be good thing that son must be false to lucy morris in order that might marry rich cousin did feel to be advantage that must be on term of intimacy with so large income a belonging to lady eustace doa thou marry for munny goa where munny be mr greystock must have repudiated idea of mercenary marriage in ordinary conversation must have be severe on gentleman who be false to young lady be so hard to bring one general principle to bear on one own conduct in one own family then greystocks be so peculiar people when son told that must go down to scotland again very shortly reconciled to loss have left bobsborough for sake of being near lucy at richmond must have felt very keenly day passed by nothing be said about poor lucy mr greystock have made up mind that must say nothing on subject lucy have behaved badly in allowing to be loved by man who ought to have loved money mr greystock have resolved that must show feeling by silence dean have formed no fixed determination have thought that might be perhaps a well to drop subject frank be unhappy about from morning to evening from day to day allowed to pas by without word knew that must not be so that such silence be in truth treachery to lucy be silent what have meant when a left lizzie eustace among rock at portray in last moment have assured that must be true to what have be lizzie meaning be more sure of lizzie meaning than be of own be very rough world to live in said to in day a thought of difficulty when have be nearly week at deanery when day of going be so near a to be matter of concern sister did at last venture to say word about lucy suppose there be nothing settled about own marriage frank nothing at will be for while will be for while said in tone felt to be ill humoured almost petulant felt also that such ill humour on subject be unkind not to sister to lucy seemed to imply that matter of marriage be distasteful to truth be said that nothing can be fixed lucy understands that a well a do be not in position at once to marry girl who have nothing be pity perhaps that one ca train one self to like girl best have got money a have there must be delay be to stay where be at rate for twelvemonth mean to see well yes hardly know how can see a have quarrelled to knife with lord fawn lord fawn be recognised by mother sister a one living jupiter upon earth like for said ellinor only prevents going to richmond poor fawn be such indifferent jupiter be be said about lucy at bobsborough till there came letter from lucy to lover acquainting with circumstance of unfortunate position at richmond did not tell quite circumstance did not repeat strong expression lord fawn have used did clearly explain how wrathful have be lord fawn have be here said there have be ever so much unpleasantness be very angry with about lady eustace of course lady fawn take part need not tell whose part take so there have be what servant call 'just few word be very dreadful be after lady fawn have be a kind a possible upshot of be that be not to stay here must suppose be to be turned out at twelve hour notice be to stay till arrangement have be made everybody will be kind to what have better do will try get situation at once if think best only suppose must have to explain how long must stay lady fawn know that be writing to to ask what think best on receipt of greystock be very much puzzled what little fool lucy have be yet what dear little fool who cared for lord fawn hard word of course lord fawn must say manner of evil thing of must crow valiantly in own farm yard must have be so much wiser on lucy part to have put up with crowing to have disregarded altogether word of man so weak insignificant evil be done must make arrangement for poor lucy comfort have known exactly how matter stood that proposition a to lucy departure have come wholly from herself at present time lady at fawn court of course in absence of lord fawn be quite disposed to forgive lucy if lucy must only be forgiven hide when lord fawn must come have frank known might perhaps have counselled to remain at richmond believed that lady fawn have insisted on lucy departure of course in such case lucy must depart showed letter to sister asked for advice how very unfortunate said ellinor yes be not wonder what said to lord fawn must speak out very plainly suppose have spoken out plainly otherwise must never have told to go away seems so unlike what have always heard of lady fawn lucy can be very headstrong if plea said lucy lover what on earth have better do for suppose can get place must suit if be to be wife think must go into place if be quite fixed said then looked into brother face well what then if be sure mean of course mean then have better come here a for going out a governess telling people that be to be wife in few month be out of question must think be equally so that must go into house not tell truth of course must be place for be at last decided that ellinor must discus matter with mother when whole matter be unfolded to mr greystock that lady be more troubled than ever if lucy be to come to deanery must come a frank affianced bride must be treated a such by bobsborough dean must be giving express sanction to marriage so must mr greystock knew well that have power of refusing sanction frank must do a pleased about marrying be lucy once wife of course must be made welcome to best deanery must give there be doubt about lucy being a good a gold only that real gold vile a be be one thing frank so much needed mother thought that have discovered in son something seemed to indicate possibility that very imprudent match might at last be abandoned if there be such possibility surely lucy ought not now to be brought to deanery nevertheless if frank be to insist upon coming must come mr greystock have plan oh mamma said ellinor when plan be proposed to think must be cruel cruel dear certainly not cruel be such virago think that because lizzie eustace have said so know that be virago at believe to be very good sort of woman do remember mamma what admiral used to say of admiral dear tried to borrow money a did everybody when must give then said severe thing poor admiral be never to be trusted in such matter think frank must like said ellinor plan be lady linlithgow who through brother in law late admiral greystock be connected with dean family have made known desire to have new companion for six month lady be to be treated like lady be to have salary travelling expense be to be paid for duty be to be expected from except of talking listening to countess really think be very thing for said mr greystock be not like being governess be not to have salary know whether make better mamma must just be visit to lady linlithgow be that make difference dear ellinor felt sure that brother must not hear of such engagement did hear of after various objection gave sort of sanction to be not to be pressed upon lucy if lucy disliked lady linlithgow be to be made to understand lucy might leave whenever pleased be to be invitation lucy might accept if be so minded lucy position a honourable guest be to be assured to be thought better that lady linlithgow must not be told of lucy engagement unless asked question unless lucy must choose to tell precaution be to be taken then frank gave sanction must understand said that might be inexpedient that lucy must come at once to deanery a be to do so must remain there till marriage let time be ever so long might be two year said mother hardly so long a said son think must be quite fair to papa said mother be well that argument be used behind dean back a have be made in hearing dean must have upset at once dean be so short sighted imprudent that must have professed delight at idea of having lucy morris a resident at deanery frank acceded to argument be ashamed of for acceding ellinor did not accede did sister be necessary that must yield mr greystock at once wrote to lady linlithgow frank wrote by same post to lucy morris a there must be year delay wrote here think best that visit to must be postponed for while if object to linlithgow plan say so at once will be asked to hing disagreeable found letter very difficult to write knew that ought to have be welcomed at once to bobsborough knew too reason on mother objection be founded might be two year before must possibly marry lucy morris might be three must be proper that must be desired to make deanery home for so long so indefinite time when engagement be for so long must be well that everybody must know a everybody must if lucy be to take up residence permanently at deanery consideration certainly be due to father moreover be absolutely necessary that lizzie eustace must understand other a to mutual pledge of truth have passed between in meantime received following

people go to scotland in autumn when have autumn holiday in hand to dispose of there be nothing more aristocratic that can do than go to scotland duke be more plentiful there than in pall mall will meet earl at least lord on mountain of course if merely travel about from inn to inn have moor of own stay with great friend quite enjoy cream of to go to scotland in august stay there perhaps till end of september be about most certain step can take towards autumnal fashion switzerland tyrol even italy be redolent of mr cook in beautiful land become subject at least to suspicion by person be duty of adhering to best side of society more clearly appreciated than by mr mr hittaway of warwick square mr hittaway be chairman of board of civil appeal be man who quite understood that there be chairman chairman must name to three four men holding responsible permanent official position quite a good a that filled in regard to salary a often said of own be mere nothing just poor two thousand pound year not a much a grocer must make in decent business be simply head clerk nothing more nobody knew anything of have name did not meet anywhere cabinet minister never heard of nobody out of own office ever consulted there be others mr hittaway felt greatly conscious that be one of who move altogether in different sphere one minister of state must ask whether hittaway have be consulted on on measure so at least hittawayites be in habit of reporting name of mr mr hittaway be constantly in paper be invited to evening gathering at house of alternate prime minister be to be seen at fashionable gathering up river attended concert at buckingham palace once year gave dinner party be inserted in morning post on such occasion at least one cabinet minister always graced board in fact mr hittaway a chairman of board of civil appeal be somebody mr hittaway a wife a sister to peer be somebody also reader will remember that mr hittaway have be fawn before married there be drawback upon happy condition mr hittaway have achieved that demand certain expenditure let nobody dream that can be somebody without having to pay for honour unless indeed be clergyman when go to concert at buckingham palace pay nothing be true for ticket cabinet minister dining with doe not eat drink more than old friend jones attorney in insidious unforeseen manner in way can only be understood after much experience luxury of fashion do make heavy pull on modest income mr hittaway knew thoroughly having much experience did make fight bravely for mr hittaway income be more than modest few thousand pound have of own when married clara have brought to unpretending sum of fifteen hundred beyond that poor official salary be le than what decent grocer must make be house in warwick square have prudently purchased on marriage when house in warwick square be cheaper than be now there carried on battle certainly with success two thousand year doe not go very far in warwick square even though sit rent free if have family absolutely must keep carriage therefore resulted that when mr mr hittaway went to scotland must endeavour to do year be very important that must accomplish aristocratic holiday a visitor at house of aristocratic friend so well have played card in respect that seldom failed altogether in one year have be guest of great marquis quite in north have be very glorious year to talk of stackallan be indeed thing of beauty in year mr hittaway have made very useful in london since that have be at delicious shooting lodge in ross inverness shire have visited millionaire at palace amidst argyle mountain have be feted in western island have be bored by dundee dowager put up with lothian laird thing have be almost always done hittaways be known a people went to scotland must handle gun be clever enough never to shoot keeper must read aloud must act little must talk hold tongue let host be who must a mighty a please never caused trouble by seeming to be out of circle on account requiring peculiar attention on occasion mr mr hittaway be guest of old lady pierrepoint in dumfries there be nothing special to recommend lady pierrepoint except have large house good income that liked to have people with of whom everybody knew something so far be lady pierrepoint from being high in hittaway world mr hittaway felt called upon to explain to friend that be forced to go to dumdum house by duty of old friendship dear old lady pierrepoint have be insisting on for last ten year there be advantage that dumfriesshire be next to ayrshire dumdum be not very far twenty thirty mile from portray that might learn something about lizzie eustace in country house be nearly end of august when hittaways left london to stay entire month with lady pierrepoint mr hittaway have very frequently explained defalcation a to fashion in be remaining in london for three week after parliament have broken up by peculiar exigency of board of appeal in year to one two very intimate friend mr hittaway have hinted that everything must be made to give way to horrid business of fawn marriage whatever happens at cost must be stopped have ventured to say to lady glencora palliser who however must hardly be called one of very intimate friend see at said lady glencora think lady eustace be very nice why must marry lord fawn if be engaged to have heard of necklace lady glencora yes have heard of wish anybody must come to try get diamond must hear what must say mr hittaway greatly admired lady glencora not le be determined to persevere have lord fawn be altogether candid open with family at time trouble might have be saved for have almost altogether resolved that let consequence be what might must not marry lizzie eustace be afraid to say even to own sister have promised to marry woman must walk very warily objurgation of world must be too many for must depend altogether on conduct clara have said when last sister have persecuted on subject be not however sorry to have opportunity of learning something of lady doings mr hittaway have more than once called on mr camperdown yes mr camperdown have said in answer to question from lord fawn brother in law must play old gooseberry with property if have one to look after there be fellow named gowran who have lived there life depend very much upon be certainly true that a to many point of conduct woman be le nice than men mr hittaway must not probably have condescended to employ espionage mr hittaway be le scrupulous actually went down to troon have interview with mr gowran using freely name of mr camperdown of lord fawn ten day afterwards mr gowran travelled a far a dumfries dumdum have interview with mr hittaway result of of further inquiry will be shown by following letter from mr hittaway to sister amelia dumdum th september dear amelia here be here have to remain to end of month of course suit be awfully dull richmond for time of year be paradise to a for coming to scotland autumn be sick of only what be one to do if one life in london if be for orlando child 'd brazen out let people say what pleased a for health be never so well a at home do like having own thing about have literally nothing to do here there be shooting except pheasant doe begin till october be very glad have come a to frederic more so a have learned truth a to mr greystock lady eustace be bad creature in way still pretend that be engaged to frederic tell everybody that marriage be not broken off yet have cousin with making love to in most indecent way people used to say in favour that at rate never flirted never quite know what people mean when talk of flirting may take word for that allows cousin to embrace embrace must not say if must not prove be horrible to think of when one remembers that be almost justified in saying that frederic be engaged to doubt be engaged to be great misfortune thank god be not yet past remedy have foolish feeling of what call honour a if man can be bound in honour to marry woman who have deceived in point still stick to diamond if have not sold a believe have mr camperdown be going to bring action against in high court of chancery still frederic will not absolutely declare thing off feel therefore that be duty to let know what have learned must be last to stir in such matter unless be sure must prove quite like to write to frederic will mamma see tell what say of course will show letter to mamma if not must postpone till be in town think must come better from mamma mamma may be sure that be bad woman now what do think of mr greystock a sure a be here be seen with arm round cousin waist sitting out of door kissing be never taken in by story of marrying lucy morris be last man in world to marry governess be over head ear in debt if marries at must marry one with money really think that mamma of have be soft about girl believe have be good governess be good after mamma easy fashion for moment suppose that be doing anything underhand governess with lover never doe suit be sure wo suit in case if be must tell think must be best charity whether mean to marry ca tell mr greystock be woman ought to mean be let know at once whether mamma will see frederic speak to openly be quite at liberty to use name only nobody mamma must see letter love to most affectionate sister clara hittaway in writing to amelia instead of to mother mr hittaway be sure that be communicating idea to at least two person at fawn court therefore there must be discussion have written to mother mother might probably have held peace done nothing chapter xxxiii wo be true mr greystock in making proposition respecting lady linlithgow wrote to lady fawn by same post frank wrote to lucy before letter reached fawn court there have come that other dreadful letter from mr hittaway consternation caused at fawn court in respect to mr greystock treachery almost robbed of importance suggestion made a to lord fawn must be possible that man who have so openly in so manly manner engaged to lucy morris must now be proposing to marriage with rich cousin lady fawn did not believe that be possible clara have not seen horrid thing with own eye other people might be liar amelia shook head amelia evidently believed that manner of iniquity be possible to man see mamma sacrifice be making be so very great made pleaded lady fawn mamma said must make men do thing be very horrid think do more now than used to seems to that nobody care now what doe if be not to be put into prison be resolved between two wise one that nothing at present must be said to lucy to one of family must wait awhile in meantime attempted a far a be possible to make attempt without express word to let lucy understand that might remain at fawn court if pleased while be going on lord fawn did come down once again on occasion lucy simply absented from dinner table from family circle for evening be coming in have got to go to prison again nina said to with kiss matter to mr hittaway letter more specially alluded be debated between mother daughter at great length indeed be le brave le energetic than be married daughter of family a saw lord fawn more frequently knew better than mr hittaway real state of case felt sure that be already sufficiently embittered against lady eustace thought that therefore peculiarly unpleasant task assigned to lady fawn need not be performed lady fawn have not advantage of living so much in world a daughter be oppressed by perhaps squeamish delicacy really must not tell about sitting kissing man must dear must said amelia clara must to tell truth continued lady fawn must care bit about if be not for poor lucy what will become of if man be untrue to nothing on earth must make believe unless came from said amelia who really did know something of lucy character till tell till know that be married will never believe then after few day there came other letter from bobsborough one from dean wife other from frank matter there proposed be necessary that must discus with lucy a suggestion have reached lucy a well a at once came to lady fawn with lover letter with gentle merry laughing face declared that thing must do very well be sure must get on with must know that must be for long said lucy truth be want to go at said lady fawn oh must said lucy in sharp decided tone must go be bound to wait till heard from mr greystock because be first duty to obey of course can not stay here after what have passed a nina say be simply going to prison when lord fawn come here nina be impertinent little chit said amelia be dearest little friend in world said lucy always tell exact truth do go to prison when come feel that ought to go to prison of course must go away what doe matter lady linlithgow wo be exactly like put little hand upon lady fawn fat arm caressingly sha' have to spoil will be simply waiting till come everything now must be no more than waiting till come if be to be that must never come be very dreadful amelia clearly thought that must never come lady fawn be apt to think daughter wiser than if mr greystock be such a mr hittaway have described to be if there be to be such coming a for lucy fondly waited then there must be reason ten fold strong why must not leave fawn court go to lady linlithgow in such case when blow must fall lucy must require very different treatment than might be expected for from hand of lady linlithgow must fade fall to earth like flower with insect at root must be like wounded branch into sap must run with such misfortune wretchedness possibly before lady fawn must not endure idea that lucy must be turned out to encounter beneath cold shade of lady linlithgow indifference dear said let bygone be bygone come down meet lord fawn nobody will say anything after be provoked very much there have be quite enough about from lady fawn be almost miraculous from lady fawn to whom son have ever be highest of human being lucy have told tale to lover lover approved of going perhaps there be acting upon mind feeling of be hardly conscious that a long a remained at fawn court must not see lover have told that must make supremely happy in simple knowledge that loved know how far such declaration must be taken a true of course be longing to see if must only pas by road must say to herself so that might peep at through gate have formed idea in own mind that must be able to see must go to lady linlithgow still there must be chance of altered life must tell lady linlithgow truth why must lady linlithgow refuse so rational pleasure there be of course reason why frank must not come to fawn court house in bruton street need not be closed to hardly know how to love enough said to lady fawn indeed must go do so hope time may come when mr greystock may be friend of course will come will not who can look into future said wise amelia of course if be husband will love said le wise lady fawn be to be husband said lucy springing up what do mean do mean anything lady fawn who be not at wise protested that meant nothing what be to do on special day merely stipulated that there must be day delay before lady fawn answered mr greystock letter so that might sleep upon sleeping on meant that further discussion be to take place between lady fawn second daughter in ladyship bed room night during period general discomfort of fawn court be increased by certain sullenness on part of augusta elder daughter who knew that letter have come that consultation be being held who be not admitted to consultation since day on poor augusta have be handed over to lizzie eustace a peculiar friend in family there have always existed feeling that by position be debarred from sympathising in general desire to be quit of lizzie then too poor augusta be never thoroughly trusted by great guide of family mr hittaway must keep to herself if 'd give gold to do mr hittaway must say consequently augusta be sullen conscious of ill usage have fixed upon anything said to lucy that evening not quite only be to go away see why must go away at frederic doe come here so very often when doe come doe say much to one suppose be amelia doing nobody want to go only feel that ought mr greystock think best suppose be going to quarrel with dear think want to quarrel with one above must not quarrel with lord fawn have quarrelled with be misfortune just for present where be going nothing have be settled yet be talking of lady linlithgow if will take lady linlithgow oh dear wo do say be most dreadful old woman in london lady eustace told such story about do know think will rather like thing be very different with next morning discussion in lady fawn room be protracted till midnight then be decided that just word must be said to lucy so that if possible might be induced to remain at fawn court lady fawn be to say word on following morning be closeted with lucy dear began want to do particular favour a said held lucy by hand one looking at must have thought that lucy be governess that lady fawn be employer dear lady fawn indeed be better must go stay just one month must do because then chance of home must be gone of course ca wait month before let mr greystock know must write to of course then see mr greystock wish lady fawn knew that lucy must be very firm have hardly hoped that anything must be done by simple persuasion have long be accustomed among to call obstinate knew that even in act of obedience have way of obeying after own fashion be a well therefore that thing to be said must be said at once dear lucy have ever occurred to that there may be slip between cup lip what do mean lady fawn sometimes engagement take place never become more than engagement look at lord fawn lady eustace mr greystock be not like said lucy proudly such thing be very dreadful lucy do happen do mean anything anything real lady fawn have so strong reliance on good sense will tell just what do mean rumour have reached that mr greystock be paying more attention than ought to do to lady eustace own cousin people marry cousin lucy to whom have always be just like brother do think be cruellest thing because sacrifice time money holiday to go look after affair be to be said of have human being to look after therefore be obliged to do of course have told about do think lady fawn do think be greatest shame ever heard if must be true be true just for sake of showing lucy if be to be true wo be true surely may speak to a friend lucy need be so abrupt with will listen to lucy of course will listen only nothing that anybody on earth must say about must make believe word of very well now just let go on if be to be so oh h lady fawn be foolish lucy will say what have got to say if if let see where be mean just have better remain here till thing be little more settled even if be only rumour be sure believe be anything more have better hear about with with friend round than with perfect stranger like lady linlithgow if anything be to go wrong there must know where to go for comfort if anything be wrong with here must come to a though be mother must now indeed indeed must will always will lady fawn love dear darling girl better than world except mr greystock if anything like be to happen think must creep here ask to die in house wo just now will be better must go away be found at last that lucy must have way letter be written to mr greystock to frank requesting that suggested overture might at once be made to lady linlithgow lucy in letter to lover be more than ordinarily cheerful jocose have good deal to say about lady linlithgow be really droll not word to say indicative of slightest fear in direction of lady eustace spoke of poor lizzie declared conviction that marriage never must come off now must be angry when say that ca break heart for for never did think that be very much in love a for lord fawn of course be enemy wrote word in big letter a for lizzie be cousin be ever so pretty be a rich a croesus think will break own heart must break mine only only only will understand rest if must come to pas wonder whether 'the duchess must ever let poor creature see friend of hers in bruton street frank have once called lady

hittaway who now declared that be already understood about portray that lady eustace intended to marry cousin be described a terrible crime on part of lizzie though antagonistic crime of remaining

feeling that frank be born to set greystocks once more upon leg when man can say what like with certainty word will be reported can speak to around a one manifestly superior always loom large when conservative must return to proper place at head of affair there must be doubt that frank greystock must be made solicitor general there be not wanting even ardent admirer who conceived that with such claim such talent a ordinary step in political promotion must not be needed that must become attorney general at once men began to say good thing to dean to mr greystock seemed that woolsack at least queen bench with peerage be hardly uncertainty then there must be marriage with penniless governess if must only marry cousin one might say that woolsack be won then came be letter pretty dear joking

being a be pearl among men then must break heart be what lucy meant must not have be much clearer understood perfectly be very nice to walk about one own borough be voted unanimously worthy of confidence be great man if be scoundrel not used to being scoundrel black care be apt to sit very close behind a go caracoling along street lucy letter required answer how must answer certainly did not wish to tell lady linlithgow of engagement lucy clearly wished to be allowed to tell on what ground must enjoin to be silent knew thought knew that till answered letter must not tell secret therefore from day to day put off answer man doe not write love letter easily when be in doubt whether doe doe not mean to be scoundrel then there came letter to dame greystock from lady linlithgow filled with amazement dear madam began letter seeing that son be engaged to marry miss morris at least say so ought not to have sent here without telling about say know of match say that can write to if please of course can do without leave seems to that if know about approve marriage house not mine must be proper place for be told that mr greystock be great man lady being with a companion ca be great woman perhaps wanted to break off else must have told will stay here six month then must go yours truly susanna linlithgow be considered absolutely necessary that letter must be shown to frank see said mother told old lady at once see why must nevertheless frank be annoyed having asked for permission lucy must at least have waited for reply well know said mr greystock be generally considered that young lady be more reticent about such thing have blurted out boasted about at once thought girl always told of engagement said frank ca for life of see that there be boasting in then be silent for moment truth be be of treating lucy very badly can not say that see said mother ought to have have here for how long frank for a long a home be needed by have demanded frank must have come of course father must have have pleasure in receiving a future wife say that can not be for two year at least said one year think frank said two know that marriage must be ruinous to how must make welcome can see way to having house for to live in within twelve month why not house must have house to morrow house a must suit in position frank must be kindness to marry then let find that be in debt believe 'd care if have nothing crust to eat ought to care frank think said dean to son on next day that in class of life imprudent marriage be one thing must be avoided marriage have be very happy god know have always be poor man feel now when be quite unable to help yet mother have fortune nobody think care le for wealth than do be content almost with nothing nothing with dean have hitherto be contented have always included comfort of life well kept table good wine new book canonical habiliment with gloss still on a bobsborough tradesman have through agency of mr greystock always supplied with thing a though came from cloud really did believe that have never asked for anything be content almost with nothing do feel that marriage can not be adopted a ordinary form of life by men in class a can be by rich by poor for instance be called upon to live with rich be not rich that can only be done by wary walking be hardly consistent with wife child men in position do marry sir after certain age else marry lady with money see frank there be not many men who go into parliament with mean so moderate a yours who do perhaps have stricter idea of economy dean did not say word about lucy morris dealt entirely with generality in compliance with son advice almost command mr greystock did not answer lady linlithgow letter be going back to london must give personally by letter written there what answer might be necessary will then see miss morris asked mother will certainly see lucy something must be settled there be tone in voice a said gave comfort to mother

by art nature courteous man one who paid compliment to lady be true however that sometimes startled hearer by thing might have be considered to border on coarseness if have not be said by clergyman lizzie have idea that intended to marry miss macnulty miss macnulty certainly received attention with pleasure in circumstance prolonged stay at castle be not questioned when towards end of november lord george sir griffin took departure be obliged to return to flock on great subject of diamond lizzie have spoken mind freely to mr carbuncle early in day of friendship immediately be after

prove that be heirloom perhaps be be cousin frank who know more about law than other man in london say that ca make necklace heirloom if be brooch ring must be different quite understand be so be pity sir florian did say something about in will suggested mr carbuncle did at least not just about necklace then lady eustace explained nature of late husband will a far a regarded chattel to be found in

bill in chancery hostile proceeding be in truth effected by unaided energy of mr camperdown although mr camperdown put forward simply a instrument used by trustee of eustace property within eight day be to enter appearance go through preliminary ceremony towards showing why must not surrender diamond to lord chancellor to one of satrap of vice chancellor to other terrible myrmidon mr camperdown in letter explained that service of document upon in scotland must amount to nothing even be to send down by messenger that doubt must send to attorney who must see expedience of avoiding exposure by accepting service of explanation lizzie did not understand one word messrs camperdowns letter document contained did frighten considerably although matter have be discussed so often that have accustomed to declare that such bugbear a must have influence on have asked frank whether in event of such missile reaching might send to have told that must be at once placed in hand of attorney consequently now sent to messrs mowbray mopus with very short note from lady eustace present compliment to messrs mowbray mopus encloses paper have received about diamond be own diamond given to by late husband please do what be proper mr camperdown ought to be made to pay expense have doubt allowed to hope that further step must be taken in matter very name of vice chancellor did for few hour chill blood at heart in few hour almost longed to throw necklace into sea feeling sure that if diamond be absolutely lost there must be altogether end of matter by degree courage returned to a remembered that cousin have told that a far a must see necklace be legally own cousin have of course be deceived by lie have repeated to lie have be efficacious with might be efficacious with others who must prove that sir florian have not taken diamond to scotland given to there in very house be now own told mr carbuncle of missile have be hurled at from london court of law mr carbuncle evidently thought that diamond be a good a gone then suppose ca sell said yes must must sell to morrow what be to hinder suppose took to jeweller in paris jeweller must think have stolen did steal

be nothing mr carbuncle must not endure from sir griffin just at present on behalf of mr carbuncle even lizzie be long suffering can not however be said that petruchio have a yet tamed own peculiar

arising from estate even though must be held in possession only for single life hitherto in very chequered career have escaped trammel of matrimony among many mode of life have hardly even suggested to expediency of taking wife with fortune then settling down for future if submissively still comfortably to say that have never looked forward to such marriage a possible future arrangement must probably be incorrect to men such a lord george be too easy result of career to be altogether banished from mind attempt have ever yet be made have special lady ever be so far honoured in thought a to be connected in with vague idea might have formed on subject now did occur to that portray castle be place in must pas two three month annually without ennui that if be to marry little lizzie eustace must do a well a other woman with money whom might chance to meet did not say to anybody therefore can not be accused of vanity be last man in world to speak on subject to one a lizzie certainly bestowed upon many of smile much of poetry of confidence can not be said that be not justified in view then be such infernal little liar lord george be quite able to discover so much of doe lie certainly said mr carbuncle then who doe on morning of departure box with diamond be brought down into hall just a be about to depart tall london footman again brought down deposited on one of oak hall chair a though be thing so heavy that must hardly stagger along with how lizzie did hate man a watched regret that have not attempted to carry down have be with diamond that morning have seen out of box into few day passed on did not handle gaze at mr carbuncle have suggested that box with diamond in might be stolen from a thought of heart almost sank within when have once again in london must take step to relieve from embarrassment of carrying about with so great burthen of care man with vehement show of exertion deposited box on chair then groaned aloud lizzie knew very well that must lift box by own unaided exertion that groan be at rate unnecessary supposing somebody be to steal that on way said lord george to not in pleasantest tone suggest anything so horrible said lizzie trying to laugh must like at said lord george think must make bit unhappy have heard about there never be such persecution often say must be well pleased to take bauble fling into ocean wave must like

annoy there be further change between kilmarnock carlisle managed to make very comfortable lunch have be provided for mr carbuncle be woman who cared for such thing lord george also liked glass of champagne in middle of day lizzie professed to be perfectly indifferent on such matter nevertheless enjoyed lunch allowed lord george to press upon second perhaps portion of third glass of wine even lucinda be roused up from general state of apathy permitted to forget sir griffin for while during journey to carlisle lizzie eustace almost made up mind that lord george be very corsair have be expecting ever since have mastered lord byron great poem have way of doing thing of saying thing of proclaiming to be master at same time of making thoroughly agreeable to dependant especially to one dependant whom most honoured at time exactly suited lizzie idea of what man must be then possessed that utter indifference to convention law be great prerogative of corsair have reverence for aught divine human be great thing queen parliament bench of bishop even police be to just so many fungi parasite noxious vapour false hypocrite such be name by ventured to call bugbear of world be so delightful to live with man who have title of own who must speak of duke marquis a being quite despicable by reason of absurd position a became gay free after luncheon expressed almost a much contempt for honesty a for duke showed clearly that regarded matrimony marquis to be equally vain useless how dare say such thing in hearing exclaimed mr carbuncle assert that if men woman be really true vow must be needed if vow then marriage vow do believe such vow be kept yes said mr carbuncle enthusiastically said lucinda said corsair who can believe that woman will always love husband because swears will oath be false on face of woman must marry said lizzie corsair declared freely that did not see such necessity then though must hardly be said that corsair be handsome man still have fine corsair eye full of expression determination eye must look love bloodshed almost at same time then have manly property power bigness apparent boldness belong to corsair to be hurried about world by such man treated sometimes with crushing severity at others with tenderest love not to be spoken to for one fortnight then to be embraced perpetually for to be cast now then into abyss of despair by rashness then raised to pinnacle of human joy by courage thought lizzie must be kind of life must suit poetical temperament then how must be with if corsair be to take to hurrying about world without carrying with be to do so always at expense perhaps might hurry about world take somebody else with medora if lizzie remembered rightly have have jointure private fortune yet woman must risk something if spirit of poetry be to be allowed play at now weary diamond again said lord george a carriage be stopped against carlisle platform suppose must go into bedroom lady eustace wish 'd let man put box in yours just for night said lizzie not if know said lord george then explained such property must be quite a liable to be stolen when in custody a must in hers if stolen while in must entail upon grievous vexation must by mean lessen effect of loss did not understand finding that be quite in earnest directed that box must be again taken to own chamber lord george suggested that must be entrusted to landlord for moment two lizzie submitted to idea stood for moment thinking of then decided that box must go to own room there be knowing what that mr camperdown might do whispered to lord

of course out of question for be not married woman have not be for accident mr carbuncle really thought that must have given heart to lord george lucinda declared that always regarded a kind of supplementary father suppose be year two older than sir griffin said lizzie lady eustace why must make unhappy said lucinda then mr carbuncle explained that whereas sir griffin be not yet thirty lord george be over forty can say be doe look urged lady eustace enthusiastically sort of men never do said mr carbuncle lord george when returned be greeted with allusion to angel wing must have be good deal spoilt among be in nature of such article to receive injury a soon a clock have struck ten lady went away to bed lizzie when be in own room of course found maid waiting for be necessarily part of religion of such woman a lizzie eustace that must not go to bed change clothes get up in morning without assistance of own young woman must not like to have thought that must stick pin into own belonging without such assistance nevertheless be often case with that be anxious to get rid of girl attendance have be so on morning before dinner be so now again be secret in movement always have recess in box bag dressing apparatus to did not choose that miss patience crabstick must have access be careful about letter very careful about money then a to iron box in diamond be kept patience crabstick have never yet seen inside of moreover may be said on lizzie behalf to discredit a reader may be pleased to take that be quite able to dress to brush own hair to take off own clothes that be not either by nature education incapable young woman that honour glory demanded must almost a lief have have patience crabstick to pry into most private matter crabstick knew must often declare missus to be of missus most slyest least come at able on present night be very soon despatched to own chamber lizzie however took one careful look at iron box before girl be sent away crabstick on occasion have not far to go to seek own couch alongside of lizzie larger chamber there be small room dressing room with bed in for night be devoted to crabstick accommodation of course departed from attendance on mistress by door opened from one room to other have sooner be closed than crabstick descended to complete amusement of evening lizzie when be alone bolted door on inside then quickly retired to rest short prayer said with knee close to iron box then put certain article of property under pillow watch chain ring from finger packet have drawn from travelling desk be soon in bed thinking that a fell away to sleep must revolve in mind that question of corsair must be good to trust belonging to one who might perhaps take belonging away leave behind subject be not unpleasant while be considering fell asleep be perhaps about two in morning when man very efficient at trade be then following knelt outside lady eustace door with delicately made saw aided probably by other equally well finished tool absolutely cut out that portion of bedroom door on bolt be fastened must have known spot exactly for did not doubt moment a commenced work yet there be nothing on exterior of door to show where bolt be placed bit be cut out without slightest noise then when door be opened be placed just inside upon floor man then with perfectly noiseless step entered room knelt again just where poor lizzie have knelt a said prayer so that might more easily raise iron box without struggle left room with in arm without disturbing lovely sleeper then descended stair passed into coffee room at bottom of handed box through open window to man who be crouching on outside in dark then followed box pulled down window put on pair of boot friend have ready for two after lingering few moment in shade of dark wall retreated with prize round corner night be almost pitch dark very wet be a nearly black with darkness a night can be so far enterprising adventurer have be successful will now leave in chosen retreat engaged on longer operation of forcing open iron safe for have be arranged between that iron safe must be opened then there though weight to who have taken out of lizzie room have not be oppressive a have oppressed tall serving man might still have be encumbrance to gentleman intending to travel by railway with a little observation a possible be however well supplied with tool will leave at work on next morning lizzie be awakened earlier than have expected found not only patience crabstick in bedroom also chambermaid wife of manager of hotel story be soon told to room have be broken open treasure be gone party have intended to breakfast at leisure proceed to london by train leaving carlisle in middle of day be soon disturbed from rest lady eustace have hardly time to get slipper on foot to wrap in dressing gown to get rid of dishevelled nightcap make herself just fit for public view before manager of hotel lord george tall footman boot be in bedroom be too plainly manifest to that diamond be gone superintendent of carlisle police be there almost a soon a others following very quickly came important gentleman who be head of constabulary of county lizzie when first heard news be awe struck rather than outwardly demonstrative of grief there have be regular plot said lord george captain fitzmaurice gallant chief nodded head plot enough said superintendent who did not mean to confide thought to man to exempt human being from suspicion manager of hotel be very angry at first did not restrain anger did not everybody know that if article of value be brought into hotel must be handed over to safe keeping of manager almost seemed to think that lizzie have stolen own box of diamond dear fellow said lord george nobody be saying word against house lord lady eustace be not blaming blame anybody else said lord george let police do what be right at last men retreated lizzie be left with patience mr carbuncle even then did not give way to grief sat upon bed awe struck mute perhaps have better get dressed said at last feared how might be said mr carbuncle holding lizzie hand affectionately yes said so prize be so great always be telling lady began crabstick hold tongue said lizzie angrily suppose police will do best can mr carbuncle oh yes so will lord george think will lie down again for little while said lizzie feel so sick hardly know what to do if be to lie down for little must be better with much difficulty got to leave then before again undressed bolted door still have bolt turned lock in other having done took out from under pillow little parcel have be in desk untying perceived that dear diamond necklace be perfect quite safe enterprising adventurer have indeed stolen iron case have stolen nothing else reader must not suppose that because lizzie have preserved jewel be therefore consenting party to abstraction of box theft have be genuine theft planned with great skill carried out with much ingenuity one in perpetration of money have be spent theft for while baffled police of england be supposed to be very creditable to who have be engaged in box nothing box have fallen into hand of thief lizzie silence when abstraction of box be made known to silence a to fact that necklace be at moment within grasp of own finger be not at first effect of deliberate fraud be ashamed to tell that brought box empty from portray having diamond in own keeping because have feared that box might be stolen then occurred to quick a thought must flash that might be well that mr camperdown must be made to believe that have be stolen so kept secret reflection of next half hour told how very great must now be difficulty a have not disclosed truth at first must hardly disclose now chapter xlv journey to london when left lady eustace alone in bedroom at carlisle hotel after discovery of robbery have very many care upon mind necklace be indeed safe under pillow in bed when people be around own friend police who be concerned with inn have not told that be so have allowed to leave with belief that diamond have gone with box even at moment a knew well step be being taken to discover thief to make public circumstance of robbery already doubt fact that chamber have be entered in night jewel box withdrawn be known to london police officer in such circumstance how must now tell truth might be that already have thief be taken in case must not truth be known even though must not tell then thought for while that must get rid of diamond altogether so that one must know aught of if must only think of place fit for such purpose must so hide that human ingenuity must discover let thief say what might word must in such case be better than of thief must declare that jewel have be in box when box be taken thief must swear that box have be empty must appeal to absence of diamond thief who must be known a thief must be supposed even by own friend associate to have disposed of diamond before have be taken there must be mystery in cunning cleverness idea of have in certain charm for lizzie eustace must have world at loss mr camperdown must hing further to harass must have be so far overcome must be saved from feeling of public defeat in affair of necklace must be very dreadful to lord fawn might probably be again at foot in fuss rumour affair must make in london there must be nothing of need be ashamed liked idea have grown to be very sick of necklace what must do with be at moment between finger beneath pillow if be minded thought be so minded to get rid of altogether sea must be place must make up mind absolutely to destroy so large property must be best for to have recourse to own broad wave a called even to herself be within friendly depth of own rock girt ocean that must find grave for great trouble now back be to sea must hardly insist on returning to portray without exciting suspicion might be fatal to then might not be possible to get altogether quit of diamond yet to retain power of future possession knew that be running into debt that money must day be much needed acquaintance with mr benjamin jeweller be fact often present to mind might not be able to get ten thousand pound from mr benjamin if must get eight six even five how pleasant must be if must put away diamond for three four year if must so hide that human eye must see till must again produce to light surely after so long interval might be made available where must be found such hiding place understood well how great be peril while necklace be in own immediate keeping accident might discover if slightest suspicion be aroused police must come upon with violence discover surely there must be such hiding place if only must think of then mind reverted to story have ever heard of mysterious villanies there must be way of accomplishing thing if must only bring mind to work upon exclusively hole dug deep into ground must not that be place then where must hole be dug in what spot must trust earth if anywhere must be at portray now be going from portray to london seemed to to be certain that must dig hole in london must be secret to herself must trust during hour two remained to to find such hole in carlisle what wanted be friend one that must trust have such friend must not dare to give jewel up to lord george so tempted must not corsair appropriate treasure if a might be possible be mistaken about be corsair then must betray to police thought of dearest friend frank greystock mr carbuncle lucinda miss macnulty even of patience crabstick there be friend whom must trust did must do alone began to fear that load of thought required must be more than must bear one thing however be certain to must not now venture to tell that necklace be in possession that stolen box have be empty thinking of went to sleep still holding packet tight between finger in position be awakened at about ten by knock at door from friend mr carbuncle lizzie jumped out of bed admitted friend admitting also patience crabstick have better get up now dear said mr carbuncle be going to breakfast lizzie declared to be so fluttered that must have breakfast up stair one be to wait for crabstick must go down fetch for cup of tea just morsel of something to eat ca be surprised must be quite said lizzie mr carbuncle surprise did not run at in direction mr carbuncle lord george have be astonished to find how well bore loss lord george gave credit for real bravery mr carbuncle suggested in whisper that perhaps regarded theft a easy way out of lawsuit suppose know george must have got from then lord george whistled in whisper declared that if little adventure have be arranged by lady eustace with view of getting better of mr camperdown respect for lady must be very greatly raised if said lord george turn out that have have couple of bravo in pay like old italian marquis will think very highly of indeed have occurred before mr carbuncle came up to lizzie room of for moment suspected that necklace be still within hotel box have be found portion of fragment be brought into room while party be still at breakfast lizzie be not in room news be at once taken up to by crabstick together with pheasant wing buttered toast in recess beneath archway running under railroad not distant from hotel above hundred fifty yard iron box have be found have be forced open so said sergeant of police with tool of finest steel peculiarly made for such purpose sergeant of police be quite sure that thing have be done by london men who be at very top of trade be manifest that nothing have be spared motion of party must have be known to probably one of adventurer have travelled in same train with very door of bedroom in hotel have be measured by man who have cut out bolt sergeant of police be almost lost in admiration superintendent of police whom lord george saw more than once be discreet silent to superintendent of police be by mean sure that lord george might not be fond of diamond of suspicion flying so delightfully high a breathed word to one simply suggested that must like to retain companionship of one of party if lady eustace must dispense with service of tall footman tall footman might be found useful at carlisle be arranged therefore that tall footman must remain tall footman did remain though not with own consent whole party including lady eustace patience crabstick be called upon to give evidence to carlisle magistrate before must proceed to london lizzie did having necklace at moment locked up in desk at inn diamond be supposed to be worth ten thousand pound there be to be lawsuit about did not for moment doubt that be property have be very careful about diamond because of lawsuit fearing that mr camperdown might wrest from possession have caused iron box to be made have last seen diamond on evening before departure from portray have then locked up now produced key lock be still so far uninjured that key must turn be evidence crabstick with good deal of reticence supported mistress have seen diamond doubt have not seen often have seen down at portray not for ever so long crabstick have very little to say about clever superintendent be by mean sure that crabstick did not know more than said mr carbuncle lord george have also seen diamond at portray there be doubt whatever a to diamond having be in iron box be there said lord george doubt that special necklace have acquired so much public notice from fact of threatened lawsuit a might make circumstance value known to london thief tall footman be not examined be detained by police under remand given by magistrate much information a to what have be done oozed out in spite of precaution of discreet superintendent wire have be put into operation in direction have be discovered that one man whom nobody knew have left down mail train at annan at dumfries men have taken ticket by train leaving carlisle between four five be be supposed to have be two thief have be nearly seven before theft have be discovered by time not only have men reached town named have have time to make way back again farther on into scotland at rate for present trace of be lost sergeant of police did not doubt that one of men be making way up to london with necklace in pocket be told to lizzie by lord george though be awe struck by danger of situation nevertheless did feel satisfaction in remembering that only held key of mystery then a to poor thief what must have be consternation when found after labour peril of night that box contained diamond that treasure be not there that be nevertheless bound to save by flight stratagem from hand of police lizzie a thought of almost pitied poor thief what consternation there must be among camperdowns garnetts among mopuses benjamin when news be heard in london lizzie almost enjoyed a mind went on making fresh scheme on subject morbid desire of increasing mystery took possession of be quite sure that nobody knew secret nobody a yet must even guess there be great danger there might be delight even profit if must safely dispose of jewel before suspicion against must be aroused must understand that rumour must get to police that box have be empty even if thief be not taken such rumour must avail nothing if must only dispose of diamond a first thought of only plan hitherto suggested to herself must require immediate return to portray if be at portray must find spot in must bury necklace be obliged to allow now to be hurried up to london when got into train little parcel be in desk key of desk be fastened round neck have secured compartment for from carlisle to london of course filled four seat a be alive said lord george a soon a train have left station that head policeman think that be thief mr carbuncle laughed lizzie protested that be absurd lucinda declared that suspicion must be vastly amusing be fact continued lord george can see in fellow eye feel to be compliment be so very 'cute that delight in suspicion remember when altar plate be stolen from barchester cathedral year ago splendid idea occurred to one of police that bishop have taken really asked lizzie oh yes really doubt that there be already belief in of mind that have stolen own diamond for sake of getting better of mr camperdown what must do with if have asked lizzie sell of course there be always market for such good who must buy if have be so clever lady eustace will find purchaser for one must have to go good distance to do there must be expense thing must be done vienna must think must be about place very well then said lizzie wo be surprised if ask to take journey for then laughed be very much amused be quite agreed among lizzie bore loss very well must care least for losing said lizzie only that florian gave to have be vexation to that to be without will be comfort desk have be brought into carriage be now used a foot stool in place of box be gone arrived at mr carbuncle house in hertford

grosvenor hotel necklace have be stolen come to early to morrow at mr carbuncle house hertford street did come before lizzie be up crabstick brought mistress word that mr greystock be in parlour soon after nine o'clock lizzie again hurried on clothes so that might see cousin taking care a did so that though toilet might betray haste must not be other than charming a dressed endeavoured to come to conclusion must not be best for that must tell everything to cousin throw upon mercy trusting to ingenuity to extricate from difficulty have be thinking of position almost through entire night have remembered that at carlisle have committed perjury have sworn that diamond have be left by in box must be found with might be that must put in gaol for stealing little mercy must expect from mr camperdown must fall into gentleman hand frank if must even yet tell everything honestly might probably save what be about diamond asked a soon a saw have flown almost into arm a though carried there by excitement of moment really mean that have be stolen do frank on journey yes frank at inn at carlisle box then told whole story not true story story a be believed by world found to be impossible to tell true story box be broken open left in street under archway said lizzie do police think know what think lord george say that believe be thief knew of said frank a though imagined that suggestion be not altogether absurd oh yes knew of what be to be done know have sent for to tell then frank averred that information must be immediately given to mr camperdown must call on mr camperdown must also see head of london police did not doubt that circumstance be already known in london at police office might be well that must see officer be acquainted with gentleman might perhaps learn something lizzie at once acceded frank went direct to mr camperdown office if have lost ten thousand pound in way said mr carbuncle think must have broken heart lizzie felt that heart be bursting

trouble to unhappy friend chapter xlvii matching priory before end of january everybody in london have heard of great robbery at carlisle most people have heard also that there be something very peculiar in matter something more than robbery various rumour be afloat have become widely known that diamond be to be subject of litigation between young widow trustee of eustace estate be known also that lord fawn have engaged to marry widow have then retreated from engagement simply on account of litigation there be strong party formed in matter whom may call lizzieites anti lizzieites lizzieites be of opinion that poor lady eustace be being very ill treated that diamond did probably belong to that lord fawn at rate clearly ought to be own be worthy of remark that lizzieites be of conservative frank greystock have probably set party on foot be natural that political opponent must believe that noble young under secretary of state on liberal side such a lord fawn have misbehaved when matter at last became of such importance a to demand leading article in newspaper journal have devoted to upholding conservative politician of day be very heavy indeed upon lord fawn whole force of government however be anti lizzieite a controversy advanced good liberal became aware that there be nothing so wicked so rapacious so bold so cunning lady eustace might have done caused to be done without delay without difficulty without scruple lady glencora palliser for while endeavoured to defend lizzie in liberal circle from generosity rather than from real belief instigated perhaps by feeling that woman in society who be capable of doing anything extraordinary ought to be defended even lady glencora be forced to abandon generosity to confess on behalf of party that lizzie eustace be very wicked young woman indeed doubt grew out of diamond chiefly arose from robbery there have be enough of notoriety attached to lizzie before affair at carlisle to make people fancy that have understood character long before that party assembled at matching priory country house belonging to mr palliser in lady glencora took much delight be not large because mr palliser uncle duke of omnium who be with be now very old man one who did not like very large gathering of people lord lady chiltern be there that lord chiltern who have be known so long so well in hunting county of england that lady chiltern who have be so popular in london a beautiful violet effingham mr mr grey be there very particular friend of mr palliser mr grey be now sitting for borough of silverbridge in duke of omnium be still presumed to have controlling influence in spite of reform bill mr grey be in distant way connected with lady glencora madame max goesler be there lady whose society be still much affected by old duke mr mr bonteen who have be brought there not perhaps altogether because be greatly loved in order that gentleman service might be made available by mr palliser in reference to great reform about to be introduced in monetary matter mr palliser who be now chancellor of exchequer be intending to alter value of penny unless work must be too much for must die before have accomplished self imposed task future penny be to be made under auspex to contain five farthing shilling ten penny be thought that if must be accomplished arithmetic of whole world must be so simplified that henceforward name of palliser must be blessed by schoolboy clerk shopkeeper financier difficulty be so great that mr palliser hair be already grey from toil shoulder bent by burthen imposed upon mr bonteen with two private secretary from treasury be now at matching to assist mr palliser be thought that mr mr bonteen be near to madness under pressure of five farthing penny mr bonteen have remarked to many of political friend that two extra farthing must not be made to go into shilling must put into cold grave before world must know what have done have rewarded for with handle to name pension lord fawn be also at matching suggestion having be made to lady glencora by leading liberal that must be supported in difficulty by hospitality mind of mr palliser be too deeply engaged to admit of being interested in great necklace affair of others assembled there be not one who did not listen anxiously for news on subject a regarded old duke have be found to be quite godsend from post to post a fact reached matching be communicated to indeed there be there who must not wait for post have news about poor lizzie diamond down by wire matter be of greatest moment to lord fawn lady glencora be perhaps justified on behalf in demanding preference for affair over message be continually passing between matching treasury respecting two ill conditioned farthing duke said entering rather abruptly small warm luxurious room in husband uncle be passing morning duke say now that after diamond be not in box when be taken out of room at carlisle duke be reclining in easy chair with head leaning forward on breast madame goesler be reading to be now three o'clock old man have be brought down to room after breakfast madame goesler be reading last famous new novel duke be dozing that probably be fault of reader of novelist a duke be wont to doze in day lady glencora tidings awakened completely have telegram in hand so that must perceive that very latest news be brought to diamond not in box said pushing head little more forward in eagerness sitting with extended finger of two hand touching other barrington erle say that major mackintosh be almost sure diamond be not there major mackintosh be officer very high in police force whom everybody trusted implicitly a to whom outward world believed that must discover perpetrator of iniquity if must only take trouble to look into such be pressing nature of duty that found compelled in one way to give up about sixteen hour day to outer world accused of idleness there be nothing must find out only must not give trouble to find out thing happened two three newspaper have already be very hard upon in regard to eustace diamond such mystery a said ought to have unravelled long ago that have not unravelled yet be quite certain diamond not in box said duke then must have known said madame goesler doe quite follow madame max said lady glencora why must diamond have be in box asked duke a be first intimation given to lady glencora of suspicion that diamond have not be taken with box a have be received by telegraph must not answer duke question with clear exposition of own put up hand shook head what doe plantagenet think about asked duke plantagenet palliser be full name of duke nephew heir duke mind be evidently much disturbed doe think that box diamond be ever worth five farthing said lady glencora diamond not in box repeated duke madame max do believe that diamond be not in box madame goesler shrugged shoulder made answer shrugging of shoulder be quite satisfactory to duke who always thought that madame goesler did everything better than anybody else lady glencora stayed with uncle for best part of hour word spoken be devoted to lizzie necklace a new idea have be broached a have other information than conveyed in telegram very little light must be thrown upon on next morning there came letter from barrington erle to lady glencora told so much hinted so much more that will be well to give to reader traveller jan dear lady glencora hope got telegram yesterday have just seen mackintosh on whose behalf however must say that told a little a possibly must be leaking out however on side that police believe that when box be taken out of room at carlisle diamond be not in a far a can learn ground suspicion on fact that can not trace stone say that if lot of diamond have be through thief market in london must have left track behind a far a can judge mackintosh think that lord george have that ladyship gave to that little game of robbery at carlisle be planned to put john eustace lawyer off scent if must turn out that box be opened before left portray that door of ladyship room be cut by ladyship self by lordship with ladyship aid that fragment of box be carried out of hotel by lordship in person will altogether have be so delightful plot that concerned in ought to be canonised at least allowed to keep plunder one of old detective told that opening of box under arch of railway in exposed place must hardly have be executed so neatly a be done that thief so situated must have given time necessary to that if there have be thief at at work must have be traced against there be certain fact a have heard from various men engaged in inquiry certain person among community of thief be very much at loggerhead with other higher creative department in thiefdom accusing lower mechanical department of gross treachery in having appropriated to own sole profit plunder for taking of have undertaken to receive certain stipulated price then may be case that lordship ladyship have set rumour abroad for sake of putting police off scent upon whole little mystery be quite delightful have put ballot poor mr palliser five farthinged penny quite out of joint nobody now care for anything except eustace diamond lord george be told have offered to fight everybody anybody beginning with lord fawn ending with major mackintosh must be innocent of course be possible thing must be annoying must not at wonder if must turn out that ladyship left in scotland place there however have be searched in compliance with order from police by ladyship consent let mr palliser quite kill hope bonteen plan answer never knew man who must find more farthing in shilling than mr bonteen remember very kindly to duke pray enable poor fawn to keep up spirit if like to arrange meeting with lord george will be only too happy to be friend remember last duel chiltern be with can put fawn up to proper way of getting over to flanders of returning must chance to escape always most faithfully barrington erle of course will keep posted in everything respecting necklace till come to town whole of letter lady glencora read to duke to lady chiltern to madame goesler principal content of repeated to entire company be certainly general belief at matching that lord george have diamond in possession with without assistance of late fair possessor duke be struck with awe when thought of circumstance brother of marquis said to nephew wife be such disgrace to peerage a for duke said lady glencora peerage be used to by time never heard of such affair a before see why brother of marquis must turn thief a well a anybody else say have got anything of own suppose be what make men steal other people property peer go into trade peeress gamble on stock exchange peer become bankrupt son of peer run away just like other men see why enterprise must not be open to to think of little purring cat lady eustace having be so very very clever make quite envious took place in morning be about two o'clock after dinner subject became general there might be little reticence in regard to lord fawn feeling be not sufficient to banish subject so interesting from mind lip of company tewett marriage be to come off after said mr bonteen have letter from dear mr rutter telling so a fact wonder whether miss roanoke will be allowed to wear one two of diamond at wedding suggested one of private secretary nobody will dare to wear diamond at next season said lady glencora a for own sha' think of having out must always feel be being inspected unless unravel mystery said madame goesler hope wo do said lady glencora play be too good to come to end so soon if hear that lord george be engaged to lady eustace nothing suppose can be done to stop marriage why must marry if plea asked mr palliser have not slightest objection to being married hope will with heart certainly think must have husband after buying at price suppose lord fawn wo forbid banns last word be only whispered to next neighbour lord chiltern poor lord fawn saw whisper be aware that must have have reference to condition on next morning there came further news police have asked permission from occupant to search room in lived lady eustace lord george in case permission have be refused so said barrington erle in letter to lady glencora lord george have told applicant very roughly that nobody must touch article belonging to without search warrant if magistrate must dare to give such warrant let do be told that lord george act indignant madman uncommonly well said barrington erle in letter a for poor lizzie have fainted when proposition be made to request be renewed a soon a have be brought to then refused on advice a said of cousin mr greystock barrington erle went on to say that police be very much blamed be believed that information must be laid before magistrate sufficient to justify search warrant in such circumstance search must have be attempted such be public verdict a declared in barrington erle last letter to lady glencora mr palliser be of opinion that attempt to search lady house be iniquitous mr bonteen shook head rather thought that if be home secretary must have have search made lady chiltern said that if policeman came to might search everything have in world mr grey reminded that really knew of unfortunate woman be that jewel box have be stolen out of bedroom at hotel madame goesler be of opinion that lady who must carry box about country with deserved to have stolen lord fawn felt obliged to confess that agreed altogether with madame goesler unfortunately have be acquainted with lady now be constrained to say that conduct have be such a to justify suspicion of police of course suspect said lady glencora of course suspect lord george too mr carbuncle miss roanoke then know if be to lose diamond people must suspect just same perhaps plantagenet be so delightful to think that woman have stolen own property put police into state of ferment lord chiltern declared to be heartily sick of whole subject mr grey who be very just man suggested that evidence a yet against anybody be very slight of course be slight said lady glencora if be more than slight must be just like other robbery there must be nothing in on same morning mr bonteen received second letter from friend mr rutter tewett marriage have be certainly broken off sir griffin have be very violent misbehaving grossly in mr carbuncle house miss roanoke have declared that under circumstance must ever speak to again be mr rutter opinion however that violence have be put on by sir griffin who be desirous of escaping from marriage because of affair of diamond be very much bound up with lord george said mr rutter be afraid that may be implicated in opinion be quite right said lord fawn matter be told to duke by lady glencora madame goesler in recess of grace private room for duke be now infirm did not dine in company unless day be very auspicious to in evening must creep into drawing room on occasion have word to say about eustace diamond to one in room be admitted by that robbery have be godsend in way of amusing duke must have box searched know said duke look uncommonly suspicious perhaps lady chiltern will hear to morrow morning something more about poor dear duke said lady chiltern to husband doting old idiot replied chapter xlviii lizzie condition when man a barrington erle undertakes to send information to correspondent a lady glencora in reference to matter a lady eustace diamond be bound to be full rather than accurate may say indeed that perfect accuracy must be detrimental rather than otherwise must tend to disperse that feeling of mystery be so gratifying suggestion have in truth be made to lord george de bruce carruthers a to searching of lordship box desk very eminent detective officer mr bunfit have however called upon lord george more than once lord george have declared very plainly that did not like if will have kindness to explain to what be want will be much obliged to lord george have said to mr bunfit well lord said bunfit what want be diamond do believe that have got man in situation lord never belief anything have to suspect never belief suspect that stole lord did say that thing be very queer be immediate object of mr bunfit visit on morning have be to ascertain from lord george whether be true that lordship have be with messrs harter benjamin jeweller on morning after arrival in town one from police have a yet seen harter benjamin in connexion with robbery may not be too much to say that argus eye of major mackintosh be upon messrs harter benjamin whole establishment be believed that if jewel be in london be locked up in box within house be thought more than probable by major mackintosh myrmidon that jewel be already at hamburg by time a major have explained to mr camperdown one of might have be reset even recut be known that lord george have be at house of messrs harter benjamin early on morning after return to town ingenuous mr bunfit who by reason of situation never believed anything only suspected have expressed very strong opinion to major mackintosh that necklace have in truth be transferred to jew on morning that there be nothing too hot too heavy for messrs harter benjamin be quite creed with police of west end of london might not be well to ask lord george what have to say about visit must lord george deny visit such denial must go far to confirm mr bunfit question be asked lord george did not deny visit unfortunately hold acceptance of mine said lord george be often there know a have lordship name to paper said mr bunfit thanking lord george however for courtesy may be understood that must be unpleasant to lord george that must be indignant almost to madness mr erle information though certainly defective in regard to lord george de bruce carruthers have be more correct when spoke of lady interview be very terrible to poor lizzie did take place between mr bunfit in mr carbuncle house on tuesday th of january there have be many interview between lizzie various member of police force in reference to diamond question put to have always be asked on supposition that might have mislaid necklace be not possible that might have thought that locked up have omitted to place in box a long a question have reference to possible oversight in scotland to carelessness might have committed on night before left home lizzie upon whole seemed rather to like idea certainly be possible believed thoroughly that diamond have be locked by in box acknowledged that might be case that have be left on one side have happened when police first began to suspect that necklace have not be in box when be carried out of carlisle hotel before have occurred to that lord george have be concerned in robbery possibly lady eustace men have be sent down from london of course at considerable expense portray castle have be searched with consent of owner from weathercock to foundation stone much to consternation of miss macnulty to delight of andy gowran trace of diamond be found lizzie have so far fraternised with police when mr bunfit called upon perhaps for fifth sixth time suggested that must be allowed with assistance of female whom have left behind in hall to search ladyship box drawer press receptacle in thing took very different aspect see lady said mr bunfit excusing peculiar nature of request may have got anywhere among ladyship thing unbeknownst lady eustace mr carbuncle be at time sitting together mr carbuncle be first to protest if mr bunfit thought that be going to search thing mr bunfit be very much mistaken what have suffered about necklace man woman knew meant that there must be end of be opinion that police must have discovered stone of day day ago at rate house be own gave mr bunfit to understand that repeated visit be not agreeable to when mr bunfit without showing slightest displeasure at evil thing said of suggested that search must be confined to room used exclusively by lady eustace mr carbuncle absolutely changed view recommended that must be allowed to have way at moment condition of poor lizzie eustace be very sad who recount detail have scorned to have secret between reader diamond be at moment locked up within lizzie desk for last three week have be there if may not be more truly said that be lying heavily on heart for three week have mind with constant stretch be working on point whither must take diamond what must do with certain very wonderful strength did posse must not have endured weight of so terrible anxiety from day to day thing became worse worse with a gradually perceived that suspicion be attached to herself must confide secret to lord george to mr carbuncle to frank greystock thought must have borne if only one must have borne with when moment came in such confidence might be made courage failed lord george saw frequently be unsympathetic almost rough with knew that also be suspected be almost disposed to think that have planned robbery if be so if robbery have be handiwork be not singular that must be unsympathetic with owner probable holder of prey have missed nevertheless lizzie thought that if must have be soft with like dear good genuine corsair for hour must have told placed necklace in hand there be moment in almost resolved to tell secret to mr carbuncle have stolen nothing so averred to herself have intended only to defend save own property even lie that have told telling of be continued from day to day have in measure be forced upon by circumstance thought that mr carbuncle must sympathise with in feeling have prevented from speaking truth when first fact of robbery be made known to herself in own bedroom mr carbuncle be lady who told many lie a lizzie knew well surely must not be horrified at lie told in such circumstance be not in lizzie nature to trust woman mr carbuncle must tell lord george must destroy everything when thought of confiding everything to cousin be always in absence idea became dreadful to a soon a be present must not dare to own to that have sworn falsely to magistrate at carlisle so burthen have to be borne increasing hour in weight poor creature back be not broad enough to bear thought of necklace waking minute dreamed of when slept must not keep from unlocking desk looking at twenty time day although knew peril of such nervous solicitude if must only rid herself of altogether be sure now that must do so must throw into ocean fathom deep if only must find alone upon ocean felt that let go where might must be watched might declare to morrow intention of going to ireland for matter to america be to do so horrid policeman must be on track iron box have be terrible nuisance to iron box have be a nothing compared to necklace locked up in desk from day to day meditated plan of taking thing out into street dropping in dark be sure that be to do so one must have watched while dropped be unwilling to trust old friend mr benjamin in day favourite scheme be to offer diamond for sale to at very low price if must help might surely be got out of present hiding place into hand man must be powerful to help if there be man whom must trust in furtherance of scheme went so far a to break brooch favourite brooch of own in order that might have excuse for calling at jeweller even postponed from day to day circumstance a have occurred have taught to believe that police must not insist on breaking open desk unless evidence must be brought against there be evidence desk be so far safe same circumstance have made understand that be already suspected of intrigue with reference to diamond though of what be suspected did not clearly perceive a far a must divine thought of enemy did not seem to suppose that diamond be in possession seemed to be believed by enemy that have passed into hand of lord george a long a enemy be on scent so false might not be best that must remain quiet ingenuity concentrated force trained experience of police of london must surely be too great powerful for in long run must not hope to keep secret diamond till must acknowledge to be baffled then be aware of morbid desire on own part to tell secret of desire amounted almost to disease must soon burst bosom open unless must share knowledge with one yet a thought of told that have friend so fast true a to justify such confidence be ill with anxiety worse than mr carbuncle knew that be ill be acknowledged between that affair of necklace be so terrible a to make woman ill mr carbuncle at present have be gracious enough to admit so much a might not be probable that mr carbuncle must come to suspect that did not know whole secret mr carbuncle have already on more than one occasion said little word two have be unpleasant such be lizzie condition when mr bunfit came with authoritative request to be allowed to inspect lizzie box when mr carbuncle having secured own privacy expressed opinion that mr bunfit must be allowed to do a desired chapter xlix bunfit gager a soon a word be out of mr carbuncle mouth ill natured word in expressed assent to mr bunfit proposition that search must be made after diamond among possession of lady eustace be now lodged in own house poor lizzie courage deserted entirely have be very courageous for though power of endurance have sometimes nearly deserted though heart have often failed still have gone on have endured be silent to endure to be silent in position did require great courage be alone in misery must see way out of diamond be heavy a load of lead within bosom yet have persevered now a heard mr carbuncle word courage failed there came obstruction in throat so that must not speak felt a though heart be breaking put out hand must not draw back again knew that be betraying by weakness must just hear man explaining that search be merely thing of ceremony just to satisfy everybody that there be mistake then fainted so far barrington erle be correct in information given by to lady glencora pressed one hand against heart gasped for breath then fell back upon sofa perhaps must have done nothing better have fainting be counterfeit measure must have shown ability fainting be altogether true mr carbuncle first then mr bunfit hurried from seat to help to of did occur for moment that fit be false whole thing have be too much for said mr carbuncle severely ringing bell at same time for further aid doubt mum doubt have to see deal of sort of thing just little air if please mum a much water a 'd go to christen babby be always best mum if will have kindness to stand on one side said mr carbuncle a stretched lizzie on sofa certainly mum said bunfit standing erect by wall not showing slightest disposition to leave room have better go said mr carbuncle loudly very severely will just stay see come to mum wo do morsel of harm mum sometimes faint at very fust sight of such a have to bear little more air if must mum just dash water on in drop like feel drop more than must bucketful then when come to have to change theirselves bunfit advice founded on much experience be good lizzie gradually came to herself opened eye immediately clutched at breast feeling for key found unmoved before finger have recognised touch quick mind have told how wrong movement have be have be lost upon mr carbuncle not on mr bunfit did not at once think that have diamond in desk felt almost sure that there be something in possession probably document if found must place on track of diamond must not compel search ladyship will soon be better said bunfit graciously lizzie endeavoured to smile a expressed assent to proposition a be saying to elder lady saying to who sir exclaimed mr carbuncle rising up in wrath elder indeed a be venturing to explain fit of fainting come often in way thief mum be regular mind bit woman be more hardeneder than men when have to speak to lady be so often that go off like have known do just at being looked at think sir that 'd better leave now said mr carbuncle indeed have said lizzie be fit for nothing just at present wo disturb ladyship least in life said mr bunfit if will only just let have key servant can be with wo move one tittle of anything lizzie though be still suffering that ineffable sickness always accompanies follows real fainting fit must not surrender key already have excuse for not doing so occurred to for while seemed to hesitate demand lady eustace said mr bunfit if will allow to say so do think will look better for ladyship can take step without consulting cousin mr greystock said lizzie having thought of adhered to detective supplied with many reason for giving up key alleging that must do harm that refusal must create infinite suspicion lizzie have formed answer stuck to always consulted cousin always acted upon advice have already cautioned not to take step without sanction must hing till consented if mr bunfit must see mr greystock if mr greystock must come to tell to submit must submit ill a be must be obstinate bunfit left house without having be able to finger that key felt sure that lady eustace carried somewhere on person a walked back to own quarter in scotland yard bunfit be by mean dissatisfied with morning work have not expected to find anything with lady eustace when fainted have not hoped to be allowed to search be now sure that ladyship be possessed at rate of guilty knowledge bunfit be one of who almost from first have believed that box be empty when taken out of hotel stone like must turn up more le be bunfit great argument that police must already have found stone be not perhaps probable have ordinary thief have in hand must not have be passed on without leaving trace behind be opinion that box have be opened door cut by instrumentality concurrence of lord george de bruce carruthers with assistance of well skilled mechanical thief nothing must be made out of tall footman indeed tall footman have already be set at liberty although be known to have evil associate tall footman be now loud in demanding compensation for injury done to many believed that tall footman have be concerned in matter many be among experienced craftsman of police force bunfit thought otherwise bunfit believed that diamond be now either in possession of lord george of harter benjamin that have be handed over to lord george to save from messrs camperdown lawsuit that lord george lady be lover lady conduct at last interview fit of fainting clutching for key confirmed bunfit in opinion unfortunately for bunfit be almost alone in opinion there be men in force high in profession a detective who avowed that certainly two very experienced well known thief have be concerned in business that certain mr smiler have be there gentleman for whom whole police of london entertained feeling approached to veneration that most diminutive of full grown thief billy cann most diminutive at same time most expert be not doubted by mind be apt to doubt till conviction have become certainty traveller who have left scotch train at dumfries have be very small man be known fact that mr smiler have left london by train from euston square station on day before on lizzie party have reached carlisle if be so if mr smiler billy cann have be at work at hotel then so argued who opposed bunfit theory be hardly conceivable that robbery must have be arranged by lord george according to bunfit theory only thing needed by conspirator have be that diamond must be handed over by lady eustace to lord george in such way a to escape suspicion that such transfer have be made might have be done with very little trouble by simply leaving box empty with key in door of bedroom have be opened by skilful professional men box have be forced by use of tool none professional gentleman must posse be probable that lord george must have committed with such men incurred very heavy expense of paying for service when be according to bunfit theory able to get at diamond without such trouble danger expenditure there be young detective in force very clever almost too clever certainly little too fast gager by name who declared that bunfit theory war on card according to gager information smiler be at moment broken hearted man ranging between mad indignation suicidal despondency because have be treated with treachery in direction mr gager be a fully convinced a bunfit that diamond have not be in box there be bitter raging heart breaking disappointment about diamond in more quarter than one there have be double robbery gager be quite sure rather robbery in two set of thief have be concerned in one set have be duped by other set in affair mr smiler poor little billy cann have be dupe so far gager mind have arrived at certainty then how have be duped who have duped who have employed robbery must hardly have be arranged executed except on commission even mr smiler must not have burthened with such diamond without knowing what to do with what must get for that be intended ultimately for hand of messrs harter benjamin gager almost believed gager be inclined to think that messrs harter benjamin rather mr benjamin for mr harter be almost too old for work requiring so very great mental activity that mr benjamin fearing honesty of executive officer mr smiler have be splendidly treacherous to subordinate gager have not quite completed theory be very firm on one great point that thief at carlisle have be genuine thief thinking that be stealing diamond finding mistake out when box have be opened by under bridge who have 'em then asked bunfit of younger brother in disparaging whisper well yes who 'ave 'em be easy to say who 'ave suppose ' e 'ave 'em alluded to by gager be lord george de bruce carruthers law bunfit be gone week ago know bunfit have occurred before intended search among poor lizzie box bunfit theory have not be shaken bunfit must see round own theory be whole motif a well a operation of person concerned be explained by gager theory only went to show what have not be done offered explanation of accomplished scheme then bunfit went little further in theory not disdaining to accept something from gager perhaps lord george have engaged men have afterwards found practicable to get diamond without assistance on one great point concerned in inquiry be in unison that diamond have not be in box when be carried out of bedroom at carlisle great point of difference consisted in whereas gager be sure that robbery when committed have be genuine bunfit be of opinion that box have be first opened then taken out of hotel in order that police might be put on wrong track matter be becoming very important two three of leading newspaper have first hinted at then openly condemned incompetence slowness of police such censure a know be very common in nine case out of ten be unjust who write probably know little of circumstance in speaking of failure here failure there make reference to numerous success be so customary a to partake of nature of routine be same in regard to public matter army matter navy matter poor law matter post office matter day after day almost day one meet censure be felt to be unjust general result of injustice be increased efficiency coach doe go faster because of whip in coachman hand though horse driven may never have deserved thong in matter of eustace diamond police have be very active have be unsuccessful have consequently be abused robbery be now more than three week old property to amount of ten thousand pound have be abstracted a yet police have not even formed assured opinion on subject have same thing occurred in new york paris diamond must by time have be traced such be assertion made police be instigated to new exertion bunfit must have jeopardised right hand gager life to get at secret even major mackintosh be anxious fact of claim made by mr camperdown of bill have be filed in chancery for recovery of diamond be of course widely known added much to general interest complexity be averred that mr camperdown determination to get diamond have be very energetic lady eustace determination to keep equally so wonderful story be told of lizzie courage energy resolution there be hardly lawyer of repute took up question have opinion a to lizzie right to necklace attorney solicitor general be dead against asserting that diamond certainly did not pas to under will must not have become hers by gift be member of liberal government of course anti lizzieite gentleman who be equal to in learning who have held office equally high be distinctly of different opinion lady eustace might probably claim jewel a paraphernalia properly appertaining to rank in claim bestowal of by husband must doubt assist to gentleman who be lizzieites of course conservative in politics be by mean clear that diamond did not pas to by will if must be shown that diamond have be lately kept in scotland ex attorney general thought that must so pas question now that jewel have be lost be discussed openly added greatly to anxiety of police lizzieites anti lizzieites be disposed to think that lizzie be very clever frank greystock in day took up cousin part altogether in good faith entertained not slightest suspicion that be deceiving in regard to diamond that robbery have be bona fide robbery that lizzie have lost treasure be to beyond doubt have gradually convinced that mr camperdown be wrong in claim be strongly of opinion that lord fawn have disgraced by conduct to lady when now heard a did hear that undefined suspicion be attached to cousin when heard also a unfortunately did hear that lord fawn have encouraged that suspicion be very irate said grievous thing of lord fawn seemed to to be extremity of cruelty that suspicion must be attached to cousin because have be robbed of jewel be among who be most severe in denunciation of police be more so because have heard asserted that necklace have not in truth be stolen busied very much in matter even interrogated john eustace a to intention dear fellow said eustace if hated diamond a much a do must never mention again greystock declared that expression of aversion to subject might be very well for mr eustace that found bound to defend cousin can not defend against said eustace for attack have never said word against went down to portray when asked a far a be concerned be perfectly welcome to wear necklace if can get back again will not make meddle in matter one way other frank after went to mr camperdown must get satisfaction from attorney mr camperdown must only say that have duty to do that must do on matter of robbery refused to give opinion be in hand of police must diamond be recovered must of course claim on behalf of estate in opinion whether diamond be recovered not lady eustace be responsible to estate for value in opposition first to entreaty then to demand of late husband family have insisted on absurdly carrying about with enormous amount of property did not belong to mr camperdown opined that must pay for lost diamond out of jointure frank in huff declared that a far a must see diamond belonged to cousin in answer to mr camperdown suggested that question be one for decision of vice chancellor frank greystock found that must hing with mr camperdown felt that must wreak vengeance only on lord fawn bunfit when returned from mr carbuncle house to scotland yard have interview with major mackintosh well bunfit have seen lady yes did see sir what came of fainted away sir

absurd know said lizzie that pig headed provincial fool must have taken for midnight thief did not disturb much think be very easily annoyed by what other people think of fellow suppose be sent here by head of metropolitan police everybody know that have be sent because be civil enough to woman to look after coming up to town because one of be careless enough to lose jewel be to be talked about over london a man who took be not spoken with much courtesy to lady present lord george have dropped that customary chivalry of manner in ordinary life make to be quite out of question that man will be uncivil to woman have escaped from conventional usage into rough truthful speech under stress from extremity of hardship to have be subjected woman understood appreciated liked rather than otherwise to lizzie seemed fitting that corsair so circumstanced must be a uncivil a pleased mr carbuncle have long be accustomed to friend mood ca really think said mr carbuncle somebody think be told that particular friend lord fawn said specially addressing lizzie have expressed strong opinion that carry about necklace always in pocket trust to have opportunity of wringing neck day do so wish must said lizzie will not lose chance if can get before occurred must have said of that nothing of kind must put out think there be man in world care le what people say of than do be a indifferent to ordinary tittle tattle a rhinoceros by george when come to stealing ten thousand pound worth of diamond delicate attention of metropolitan police one begin to feel that one be vulnerable when get up in morning half feel that will be locked up before night can see in eye of man meet that take for prince of burglar be fault said lizzie wish diamond have be thrown into sea said mr carbuncle what do think about asked lucinda know what to think be at dead loss know that man mr benjamin lady eustace lizzie with little start answered that did that have have dealing with

subject must be quite compliment feel yet trouble know that greasy israelitish smile of lady eustace lizzie nodded head tried to smile when asked yesterday about diamond leered at rubbed hand 'it be pretty little game ai lord george ' said told that thought very bad game hoped police must have thief necklace soon 'it be managed deal too well for lord george think so ' lord george mimicked jew a repeated word lady of course laughed poor lizzie attempt at laughter be very sorry told to face thought have among treasure 'no lord george ' said seemed quite to enjoy joke if be got ca think have if have not doubt belief have will tell person who suspect what fool be said lizzie know how may be sir griffin lucinda be at sure what have in pocket can believe anything of said lucinda seems can believe anything of will begin to think soon that did take at rate ought to have done so wonder what three woman think of if do think have got scruple to say so be quite used to wo hurt further lady again laughed must have suspicion continued suppose of london thief did get said mr carbuncle police say box be empty said lord george how can police know asked lucinda be there to see of course thief must say that did take what do think lady eustace know what to think perhaps mr camperdown did lord chancellor said lord george one be just a likely a other wish must get at what really think whole

creeping over have sort of conviction growing upon that will be taken up tried that jury will find guilty dream about if a be probable drive mad be sure that will accuse in madness there be fascination about ca explain escape go on thinking how must have done if did do spend hour in calculating how much must have realised where must have found market must keep from asking other day how much must be worth to what did say asked lizzie who sat gazing upon corsair who be now fascinated lord george be walking about room then sitting for moment in one chair again in after while leaning on mantelpiece in speaking addressed almost exclusively to lizzie who must not keep eye from grinned greasily said corsair told have already be offered to once before by be false said lizzie very likely then said that doubt 'd fall into hand day 'must be game lord george ' said 'if after must be no more than paste ' made think have got that 'd get paste diamond put into same setting then give up with story of own making 'd know whether be paste not must lord george ' asked corsair a repeated mr benjamin word imitated jew manner so well that made lizzie shudder while be there detective named gager came in same man who came here perhaps suggested mr carbuncle think not seemed to be quite intimate with mr benjamin went on at once about diamond benjamin said that 'd made way over to paris that 'd heard of found getting quite intimate with mr gager who seemed hardly to scruple at showing that thought that benjamin be confederate mr camperdown have offered four hundred pound reward for jewel to be paid on surrender to hand of mr garnett jeweller gager declared that if ordinary thief have must be given up at once for sum be true suppose said mr carbuncle how must ordinary thief get money without being detected who must dare to walk into garnett shop with diamond in hand ask for four hundred pound besides have be sold to one a believe to dear friend mr benjamin suppose ai going

be so much upset by bare suspicion what must be condition jewel be in desk up stair police have be with also be even now probably looking after watching how much more difficult must be for to deal with diamond than must have be for man presently mr carbuncle left room lucinda followed lizzie saw go did not dare to go with felt a though limb must not have carried to door be now alone with

prevailing fact of life gone from for ever nevertheless be not that sorrow that regret have so nearly overpowered in dining parlour at moment hardly knew have hardly thought whether diamond have have not be taken feeling came upon at once that own disgrace be hour being brought nearer to secret be no longer quite own one man knew have talked to of perjury of five year imprisonment patience must have known too now one else also knew police of course must find out then horrid word must be used against hardly knew what perjury be sounded like forgery burglary to stand up before judge be tried then to be locked up for five year in prison what end must be to glorious success what evil have done to merit terrible punishment when came to in bedroom at carlisle have simply be too much frightened to tell that necklace be at moment under pillow tried to think of to form idea in mind of what might be truth of course patience crabstick have known secret how long have girl known how have girl discovered be almost certain from certain circumstance from word girl have spoken from sign have observed that patience have not even suspected that necklace have be brought with from carlisle to london of course coming of bunfit woman must have set girl mind to work in direction then bunfit woman have only be there on morning corsair knew fact one corsair that corsair be corsair suspicion of police have proved to have offered necklace to corsair when so offered have refused to take must understand that must see danger of accepting diamond from hand yet must be desirous of having might not have thought that must best relieve from burthen of custody in manner felt anger against corsair a weighed probability of having taken in fashion corsair must be corsair be to come to confess deed must almost like better for admiring skill enterprise how very clever must have be how brave have known doubt that three lady be going to theatre in how short time have got rid of other woman availed of service of patience crabstick in what way must conduct when police must come to on following morning police other people who must crowd to house how must receive cousin frank how must look when coincidence of double robbery must be spoken of in hearing how must bear when a of course must be case must again be taken before magistrate made to swear a to loss of property must commit more perjury with certainty various people must know that oath be false world must suspect world must soon know truth might not be possible that diamond be at moment in hand of messrs camperdown that must be produced before eye a soon a second false oath have be registered against yet how must tell truth must corsair think of corsair who must know everything made one resolution during night must not be taken into court magistrate people might come to must not go before when morning came said that be ill refused to leave bed policeman knew be in house early at about nine mr carbuncle lucinda be up in room excitement of affair have taken from bed must not stir if be absolutely necessary said men must come into room have be so overset by what have occurred on previous night that must not leave room appealed to lucinda a to fact of illness trouble of robbery be so great upon that heart be almost broken if deposition must be taken must make in bed in course of day magistrate did come into room deposition be taken forty three pound have be taken from desk certain jewel described from dressing case a far a be aware other property of hers be missing said in answer to direct question from magistrate a thought be asked with stern voice searching eye so second time have sworn falsely at least be gained that lord george de bruce carruthers be not looking at a swore lord george be in house for great part of day did not ask to be admitted to lizzie room did ask to see frank greystock be there late in afternoon went up at once to cousin moment that saw stretched out arm to burst into tear poor girl said what be meaning of know think will kill want to kill how can bear robber be here last night magistrate policeman people have be here day then fell into fit of sobbing wailing be in truth hysterical for if reader think of poor woman have great deal to bear frank into whose mind glimmer of suspicion against cousin have yet entered who firmly believed that have be made victim because of value of diamond who have theory of own about robbery at carlisle to circumstance of be now at pain to make latter circumstance adhere be very tender with cousin remained in house for more than hour oh frank what have better do asked must leave london if be yes of course will oh yes will if fear cold of scotland fear nothing nothing being where policeman can come to then shuddered be again hysterical be acting condition a remembered magistrate detective policeman in uniform reflected that might probably see much more of before game be played out thought crowded on be almost more than must bear child be there be own house go there till pass by whereupon promised that a soon a be well enough must at once go to scotland in meantime eustace diamond be locked up in small safe fixed into wall at back of small cellar beneath establishment of messrs harter benjamin in minto lane in city messrs harter benjamin always kept second place of business great shop be at west end have accommodation in city chronicler state at once a scorn to keep from reader secret be known to chapter liii lizzie sick room when hertford street robbery be three day old be still talk of town lizzie eustace be really ill have promised to go down to scotland in compliance with advice given to by cousin frank at moment of promising must have be willing enough to be transported at once to portray have that be possible so a to be beyond visit of policeman authority of lawyer magistrate a hour passed over head a presence of mind returned to remembered that even at portray must not be out of danger that must hing in furtherance of plan if once immured there lord george be in london frank greystock be in london lord fawn be in london be more than ever necessary to that must find husband among husband who must not be le husband when truth of business at carlisle must be known to world have in fact stolen nothing endeavoured to comfort by repeating to herself over over again that assurance have stolen nothing still thought that if must obtain support of strong arm on to lean might escape punishment for false oath have sworn husband might take abroad whole thing must die away if must succeed with lord george of course must take abroad there must be need for speedy return might roam among island in pleasant warm sun dream of youth might be realised income be still own must not touch that so thought at least oppressed by slight want of assurance in respect be to go at once to scotland must for present give up game altogether if frank must pledge to become husband in three four even in six month must go at once have more confidence in frank than even in lord george a for love must sometimes tell that be violently in love hardly knew with lord george be certainly best representative of perfect corsair dream have represented to in regard to working life thought that liked cousin frank better than have ever yet liked other human being in truth be now in condition a acknowledged to herself that be hardly entitled to choose lord fawn have promised to marry to a husband conceived that still have right nothing have a yet be proved against must justify in repudiating engagement have doubt asserted with vehemence to cousin that consideration must now induce to give hand to lord fawn when making assurance have be after nature sincere circumstance be changed since have not much hope that lord fawn might be made to succumb though evidence have reached before last robbery induced to believe that did not consider to be quite secure in circumstance be unwilling to leave london though have promised be hardly sorry to find excuse in recognised illness be ill though mind be again at work with scheme on must not have busied without hope yet have not recovered from actual bodily prostration to have be compelled to give way when first told of robbery on return from theatre there have be moment then in thought that heart must have broken moment in that power of speech be wanting must have told everything to lucinda roanoke when mr carbuncle be marching up stair with policeman at heel must have willingly sold hope portray castle lover necklace income beauty for assurance of humblest security with quickness of intellect be peculiar gift have soon understood in midst of suffering that necklace have be taken by thief whose robbery might assist for while in keeping secret rather than lead to immediate divulging of camperdown bunfit have be at work among box secret have be discovered doubt by patience crabstick diamond be gone money also be taken world need not know that diamond have be there lord george knew then there arose to question have diamond be taken in consequence of revelation to lord george be not surprising that in midst of lizzie must be really ill be most anxious to see lord george if what mr carbuncle said to be true lord george refused to see did not believe mr carbuncle be therefore quite in dark about corsair a must only communicate with through mr carbuncle might well be case that must have be told that must not have access to of course there be difficulty that cousin frank must see in bedroom cousin frank with whom be essentially necessary that must hold counsel a to present great difficulty be matter of course there be hesitation about fresh nightcap clean pocket handkerchief with bit of lace round perhaps pretty covering to shoulder if be to be required to sit up in bed thing be arranged might have spent best part of day in bedroom if must have spared time corsair be not cousin a yet acknowledged lover there be difficulty even in framing reason for request when made to mr carbuncle very reason gave be handed back to a corsair reason for not coming to desired to see because have be so much mixed up in matter of terrible robbery mr carbuncle declared to that lord george must not come to because name have be so frequently mentioned in connexion with diamond see dear said mr carbuncle there can be real reason for seeing up in bedroom if there have be anything between a once thought there must there be something in tone of mr carbuncle voice grated on lizzie ear something seemed to imply that prospect be over of course said lizzie querulously be very anxious to know what think care more about opinion than anybody else a to name being mixed up in be joke have be joke to can assure said mr carbuncle lizzie must not press request of course knew more about than did mr carbuncle secret be in own bosom secret a to midnight robbery at carlisle that secret have told to lord george a to robbery in london knew nothing except that have be perpetrated through treachery of patience crabstick did lord george know more about than knew if so be now deterred by knowledge from visiting see dear said mr carbuncle that gentleman visiting lady with whom have connexion in bedroom be in something very peculiar lizzie made motion of impatience under bedclothes such argument be trash to knew that be trash to mr carbuncle also what be one man in bedroom more than must see dozen doctor if pleased if so why not man whose real power of doctoring must be so much more efficacious must want to see alone too continued mr carbuncle of course police must hear of be not at surprised that must stay away lizzie condition did not admit of much argument on side only showed opposition to mr carbuncle by being cross querulous frank greystock came to with great constancy almost day from did hear about robbery that knew heard when three day have passed when six day even when ten day be gone nobody have be a yet arrested police according to frank be much on alert be very secret must not must not tell anything to two robbery at carlisle last affair in hertford street be of course distinct there be who believed that hertford street thief carlisle thief be not only same that have be in quest of same plunder have at last succeeded frank be not one of never for moment doubted that diamond have be taken at carlisle explained second robbery by supposition that patience crabstick have be emboldened by success iron box have doubt be taken by assistance familiarity with thief then established have led to second robbery lizzie loss in second robbery have amounted to hundred pound be frank greystock theory of course be one very comfortable to lizzie seem to think that diamond be at paris said to one day if only knew how little care about seems a though have almost forgotten in after trouble mr camperdown care about be told say that can make pay for out of jointure must be very terrible of course said lizzie to whose mind there be something consolatory in idea that whole affair of robbery might perhaps remain so mysterious a to remove from danger of other punishment than feel sure that must do said frank think will try john eustace must not let must be persecution mr camperdown have always chosen to persecute said lizzie can understand that must like loss of diamond think lizzie ever realised true value suppose not after necklace be only necklace cared nothing for except must not bear idea that man must dictate to must have given up at once at slightest word from did not care to remind then a lay in bed that have be very urgent in advice to to abandon diamond not le urgent because have thought that demand for be unjust told often continued be tempted to throw among wave be true quite true offered to give to must have be delighted to have be relieved from be of course simply impossible know be impossible on part must have be delighted of what use be to wore twice because man meaning lord fawn disputed right to before never even looked at do think have pleasure in wearing pleasure in looking at never be only trouble to be point of honour with to keep because be attacked be glad be gone thoroughly glad be very well be not without effect on frank greystock be hardly expected of woman in such condition with so many trouble on mind who have be so persecuted that word uttered by must be strictly true lizzie with fresh nightcap laced handkerchief pale with eye just glittering with tear be very pretty did somebody once give one garment scorched up when wore woman who sent because loved man so much shirt mean dejanira sent to hercules yes hercules be good deal scorched that necklace husband gave because loved so well have scorched horribly have nearly killed have be like white elephant eastern king give to subject when mean to ruin only poor florian did mean to hurt gave in love if people bring lawsuit against frank must manage for there will be lawsuit brother in law will stop wonder who will really get diamond after frank be very valuable only think that ten thousand pound must disappear in such way subject be very dangerous one there be fascination about made impossible for to refrain from dishonest dealer in diamond will probably realise plunder after year there must be something very alluring in theft of article of great value be not that when got at once become almost valueless by difficulty of dealing with supposing have necklace wish have frank must hing with ten sovereign must go further with ten shilling burthen of possessing must in be almost more than must bear knowledge have thing might be discovered in having must drive mad by own weakness must be compelled to tell secret to one then must never sleep for fear partner in matter must turn against how well understood how probable be that lord george must turn against how exact be frank description of burthen of secret so heavy that can not be borne alone little reflection continued frank soon convinces man rough downright stealing be awkward foolish trade therefore fall into hand of who want education for higher effort of dishonesty to get into bank at midnight steal what little there may be in till even armful of bank note with probability of policeman catching a creep out of chimney through hole be clumsy work to walk in amidst smile bow of admiring manager draw out money over counter by thousand ten of thousand have never put in can never repay when be done have only borrowed be great feat do really think so courage ingenuity self confidence needed be certainly admirable then there be cringing almost contemptible littleness about honesty hardly allows to assert really honest man can never say word to make who know of honesty believe that be there have one foot in grave before neighbour have learned that be possessed of article for use of must so willingly have paid must have be made to see that be there dishonest man almost doubt whether in dishonesty be dishonest let be practised ever so widely honest man almost doubt whether honesty be honest unless be kept hidden let two unknown men be competitor for place with nothing to guide judge own word own look who can doubt dishonest man must be chosen rather than honest honesty go about with hang dog look about a though knowing that can not be trusted till be proved dishonesty carry eye high assumes that question respecting must be considered to be unnecessary oh frank what philosopher be well yes meditating about diamond have brought philosophy out when do think will go to scotland be hardly strong enough for journey yet fear cold so much must not find cold there by sea side to tell truth lizzie want to get out of house mean to say word against mr carbuncle after have occurred must be better that must be away people talk about lord george how can help frank by going away be if may presume one thing want to pry into secret have none from unless there be truth in assertion that be engaged to marry lord george carruthers there be truth in wish to stay here in order that there may be engagement be obliged to ask home question lizzie a must not otherwise advise do indeed ask home question will desist at once if be disagreeable frank be false to a said rose in bed sat with eye fixed upon thin hand stretched out upon bedclothes know can not wish to be engaged to to other man know better almost than can know how heart stand there have at rate be hypocrisy with in regard to everything have be told to at what cost will not now say honest woman fear fare worse even than honest man of whom spoke think admitted that must be appreciated at last to dying day must pay penalty of transgression honesty in woman world never forgives when have done speaking sat silent by bedside almost unconsciously stretched out left hand took right hand in for few second admitted lay there with hand clasped then with start drew back arm retreated a be from touch how dare said press hand when know that such pressure from be treacherous damnable damnable lizzie yes damnable will not pick word for coming from doe such pressure mean affection yes of what sort be wicked enough to feed love by such token when know that mean to return frank frank will give back heart what be that promised when sat together upon rock at portray be inexpressibly difficult for man to refuse tender of woman love may almost say that man must do so a matter of course that thing so offered becomes absolutely valueless by offer that woman who can make have put out of court by own abandonment of privilege due to a woman stern rebuke even expressed contempt be justified by such conduct that fairest beauty most alluring charm of feminine grace must lose attraction when thus tendered openly in market doubt such be theory a to love love making action to be taken by in matter a to plainest theory prevails for guidance of practice depends so frequently on accompanying circumstance correlative issue that theory a often a not fall to ground frank must not despise woman must not be stern to must not bring to tell boldly that must have nothing to say to in way of love made excuse for persuaded that there be peculiar circumstance in position justifying unwomanly conduct although have examined on subject must have found difficult to say what circumstance be be rich beautiful clever be flattered nevertheless knew that must not marry knew also that much a liked did not love lizzie said think hardly understand position yes do little girl have cozened out of promise if be so must not have break yes must if think be not fit to be wife be man such a be to be tied by leg for life have ambition clipped high hope shipwrecked because girl have be clever enough to extract word from be not true that be in debt what of at rate lizzie want help from be so like man pride do not know that in such career a have marked out for wealth at rate easy income be necessary do think that can not put two two together do believe so meanly of a to imagine must have said to what have said if did not know must help man believe can not understand that love induces woman to sacrifice pride simply for advantage want to see prosper want to see great man lord know that can not become so without income ah wish must give have got save from encumbrance be attached to might be that must then have told of engagement to lucy of resolution to adhere to promise have not mr carbuncle at moment entered room frank have be there for above hour a lizzie be still invalid to extent under care of mr carbuncle be natural that lady must interfere know dear must not exhaust altogether mr emilius be to come to afternoon mr emilius said greystock clergyman remember at portray dark man with eye close together used to be very wicked say that be once jew boy in street lizzie a spoke of spiritual guide be evidently not desirous of doing much honour remember well enough made sheep eye at miss macnulty drank great deal of wine at dinner poor macnulty believe word about wine a for macnulty see why must not be converted a well a be coming here to read to hope object not in least if like one doe have solemn thought sometimes frank especially when one be ill oh yes well ill one doe have solemn thought ghost a be will appear be mr emilius good at laying such apparition be clergyman mr greystock said mr carbuncle with something of rebuke in voice so tell be not present at ordination daresay be done according to rule when one reflects what deal of harm bishop may do one wish that there be surer way of getting bishop do know anything against mr emilius asked lizzie nothing at look manner voice unless be that preaches popular sermon

little shawl over lizzie shoulder mr emilius first said prayer kneeling at lizzie bedside then read chapter in bible after that read first half of fourth canto of childe harold so well that lizzie felt for moment that after poetry be life life be poetry chapter liv suppose may say word second robbery to lady eustace have be subjected by mean decreased interest be attached to concern in fashionable world parliament have now met party at matching priory lady glencora palliser party in country have be to extent broken up gentleman who be engaged in service of majesty government have necessarily gone to london who have wife at matching have taken wife with mr mr bonteen have seen last of holiday mr palliser be of course at post private secretary be with public secretary on scene of action on th of february mr palliser made first great statement in parliament on matter of five farthinged penny pledged to do very best to carry stupendous measure through parliament in present session city men who be in house night director of bank of england be in gallery chairman of great banking company baring rothschild if there be baring rothschild who have not be returned by constituency have not seat in house by right agreed in declaring that job in hand be too much for one member one session said that measure never must be passed because unfinished work of one session must not be used in lessening labour of next everything must be recommenced therefore so said hopeless one penny with five farthing penny of hundred must make ten shilling halcyon penny must make future pecuniary calculation easy to meanest british capacity must never become law of land others more hopeful be willing to believe that gradually thing must so sink into mind of member of parliament of writer of leading article of active public generally a to admit of certain established axiom being taken a established placed a be beyond procrastinating power of debate might for instance at last be taken for granted that decimal system be desirable so that month two of spring need not be consumed on preliminary question period have not a yet be reached be thought by entire city mr palliser be much too sanguine be so probable many said that might kill by labour must be herculean in success that financier after must venture to face task behoved lady glencora to see that hercules did not kill in state of affair lady glencora into whose hand custody of mr palliser uncle duke have now altogether fallen have divided duty between matching london when member of parliament went up to london went there also leaving half dozen friend whom must trust to amuse duke soon returned knowing that there might be danger in long absence duke though old be own master much affected company of madame goesler that lady kindness to be considerate incessant there might still be danger lady glencora felt that be responsible that old nobleman must hing in feebleness of age to derogate from splendour of past life what if day grace must be off to paris insist on making madame goesler duchess in chapel of embassy madame goesler have hitherto behaved very well must probably continue to behave well lady glencora really loved madame goesler then interest at stake be very great so circumstanced lady glencora found compelled to be often on road between matching london though be burthened with great care lady glencora by mean dropped interest in eustace diamond when learned that on top of great carlisle robbery second robbery have be superadded that have be achieved while london police be yet astray about former operation solicitude be of course enhanced duke too took matter up so strongly that almost wanted to be carried up to london with view a be supposed by lady who be so good to of seeing lady eustace personally be out of question dear lady glencora said to madame goesler when duke fancy be first mentioned to by lady told that trouble must be too much for of course must be too much said lady glencora be quite out of question then after moment added in whisper who know what 'd insist on marrying be woman can resist temptation madame goesler smiled shook head made answer to lady glencora suggestion lady glencora assured uncle that everything must be told to must write about daily send latest news by wire if post must be too slow ah yes said duke like telegram best think know that lord george carruthers have have something to do with madame goesler have long be evident that duke be anxious that one of own order must be proved to have be thief a plunder taken be so lordly in regard to lizzie lady glencora on return to london took into head to make diversion in heroine favour have hitherto be matter of faith with liberal party that lady eustace have have something to do with stealing own diamond that esprit de corp be glorious characteristic of english statesman have caused whole government to support lord fawn lord fawn must only be supported on supposition that lizzie eustace have be wicked culprit lady glencora though very true a politician be apt to have opinion of own to take certain flight in chose that others of party must follow now expressed opinion that lady eustace be victim mr bonteens with even of mr bonteens found compelled to agree with stood too high among set to be subject to obedience restrained others too high also for others to resist leading a member of party be erratic dangerous from position peculiar temperament be powerful when declared that poor lady eustace be victim others be obliged to say so too be particularly hard upon lord fawn more so a lady glencora took upon to assert that lord fawn have right to jilt young woman lady glencora have to support view that for last week past indeed ever since deposition have be taken after robbery in hertford street police have expressed no fresh suspicion in regard to lizzie eustace heard daily from barrington erle that major mackintosh bunfit gager be a active a ever in inquiry that scotland yard be determined to unravel mystery that there be emissary at work tracking diamond at hamburg paris vienna new york have be whispered to mr erle that whereabouts of patience crabstick have be discovered that many of leading thief in london be assisting police nothing more be done in way of fixing guilt upon lizzie eustace upon word be beginning to think that have be more sinned against than sinning be said to lady glencora on morning after mr palliser great speech about five farthing by barrington erle who a seemed have be specially told off by party to watch investigation be sure have have nothing to do with have thought so ever since last robbery sir simon slope told yesterday afternoon mr camperdown have given up altogether sir simon

glencora palliser be shown up to lizzie chamber lizzie be found with nicest nightcap prettiest handkerchief with volume of tennyson poetry scent bottle knew that behoved to be very clever at interview instinct told that first greeting must show more of surprise than of gratification accordingly in pretty feminine almost childish way be very much surprised be doing strangest thing in world know lady

of diamond think bear wonderfully said lady glencora if must imagine how little care about said lizzie with enthusiasm have lost delight used to feel in a present from husband people have talked about have be threatened because chose to keep what knew to be own of course must not give up must have given up lady glencora certainly not must when once have begun became irrepressible burthen to often

that others be not treated with so much open candour reader know much more of lizzie eustace than did cousin frank indeed be not quite in love with lizzie to be pretty graceful young woman to whom be bound by many tie who have be cruelly injured dangerous be doubtless perhaps little artificial to have have married to lord fawn must have be good thing must still be good thing according to rule known in such matter lord fawn be bound to marry have become engaged to lizzie have done nothing to forfeit engagement a to necklace plea made for jilting on ground be disgraceful pretext everybody be beginning to perceive mr camperdown must never have succeeded in getting diamond from even if have not be stolen be preposterous a frank said over over again to friend herriot that man when be engaged to lady must take upon to judge conduct a lord fawn have done then ride out of engagement on verdict found by frank have therefore willingly displayed alacrity in persecuting lordship have not be altogether without hope that might drive two into marriage yet in spite of protestation made by lizzie at portray lord fawn have certainly not spent happy winter between mr hittaway on one side frank

hinted to that nothing be too bad to believe of lizzie eustace that calamity must be so great a by must be overwhelmed be still to allow to be forced into marriage must be better mr hittaway have said to retire to ireland at once cultivate demesne in tipperary be grievous sentence one have greatly excited brother wrath have shown how very strong be sister opinion against lady to whom have unfortunately offered hand then there came to letter from mr greystock in be asked for written explanation if there be proceeding official man dislike worse than be demand for written explanation be

cloud upon brow be at first very angry with lady glencora even position gave no right to meddle with most private affair a have done must resent must quarrel with lady glencora what right must have to advise to call upon woman by degree wrath died away gave place to fear qualm inward question too have found change in general opinion about diamond when have taken upon with high hand to dissolve own engagement everybody have a thought acknowledged that lizzie eustace be keeping property did not belong to now people talked of loss a though diamond have be undoubtedly own on next morning lord fawn took opportunity of seeing mr camperdown dear lord said mr camperdown will wash hand of matter altogether diamond be gone question now be who stole where be in business ca meddle with such question a will drop bill in chancery then what good can bill do when diamond be gone if lady eustace have anything to do with robbery suspect then lord can not say have right to say that indeed be not lady

trustee have decided that will hing more hand be tied if minor when come of age claim property from will prefer to replace be very likely be what say if be heirloom suggested lord fawn going back to old claim be exploded said mr camperdown mr dove be quite clear about be end of filing of bill in chancery a to mr camperdown have be so very enthusiastic now certainly be case poor lord fawn in conduct towards lizzie have trusted greatly to support of mr camperdown legal proceeding world must hardly have expected to marry woman against whom bill in chancery be being carried on for recovery of diamond did not belong to that support be now altogether withdrawn from be acknowledged that necklace be not heirloom clearly acknowledged by mr camperdown even mr camperdown must not express opinion that lady have stolen own diamond how must go with if after be to marry bone of contention between have at rate be made to vanish income be still there lady glencora palliser have promised

sure know what be to do thank hittaway for coming over will do for present just leave ruffian letter will think about be considered by mr hittaway to be very bad state of thing there be great consternation in warwick square when mr hittaway told wife new story of brother weakness be not going to be weak did not intend to withdraw opposition to marriage be not going to be frightened by lizzie eustace frank greystock knowing a did that be lover very improper lover too of course stole said mr hittaway doubt stole own money afterwards there be nothing must do 'd sooner see frederic in

of course must keep chapter lvii humpty dumpty robbery at house in hertford street took place on th of january on morning of th of february bunfit gager be sitting together in melancholy dark little room in scotland yard discussing circumstance of nefarious act month have gone by nobody be yet in custody month have passed since second robbery nearly eight week have passed since robbery at carlisle even be still mystery newspaper have be loud in condemnation of police have be asserted over over again that in other civilised country in world must so great amount of property have passed through hand of thief without leaving clue by police must have made way to truth major mackintosh have be declared to be altogether incompetent bunfits gagers of force have be spoken of a drone mole ostrich be idle blind so stupid a to think that when saw nothing others saw le major who be broad shouldered philosophical man bore a though be of necessity part of burthen of profession bunfits gagers be very angry at wit end did not occur to to feel animosity against newspaper abused thief who must not be caught be great enemy there be common to conviction that men so obstinate a thief men to whom large amount of grace liberty for indulgence have accrued must be treated with uncommon severity when be caught there be excuse always on lip have be affair simply of thief such a thief ordinarily be everything must have be discovered long since when lord lady with title come to be mixed up with affair folk in whose house policeman ca have will at searching brow beating how be detective to detect anything bunfit gager have be driven to recast theory a to great carlisle affair by circumstance of later affair in hertford street thought that lord george have be concerned in robbery indeed have now become general opinion of world at large be man of doubtful character with large expense with recognised mean of living have formed great intimacy with lady eustace at period in be known to be carrying diamond about with have be staying with at portray castle when diamond be there have be companion on journey during diamond be stolen only men in london supposed to be capable of dealing advantageously with such property be harter benjamin a to whom be known that be conversant with existence of diamond known also that be in habit of having dealing with lord george be moreover known that lord george have be closeted with mr benjamin on morning after arrival in london thing put together made almost certainty lord george have be concerned in matter bunfit have always be sure of gager though differing much from bunfit a to detail have never be unwilling to suspect lord george fact known must not be got to dovetail pleasantly if lord george have possessed of diamond at carlisle with lizzie connivance before reached carlisle then why have there be second robbery bunfit who be very profound in theory suggested that second robbery be additional plant got up with view of throwing more dust into eye of police patience crabstick have of course be one of gang throughout have now be allowed to go off with mistress money lesser trinket so that world of scotland yard might be thrown more more into mire of ignorance darkness of doubt to view gager be altogether opposed be inclined to think that lord george have taken diamond at carlisle with lizzie connivance that have restored in london to keeping finding suspicion against too heavy to admit of dealing with now have stolen second time again with lizzie connivance in latter point gager did not pretend to assurance of conviction gager at present moment have achieved triumph in matter be not at disposed to share with elder officer perhaps on whole more power be lost than gained by habit of secrecy to be discreet be fine thing especially for policeman when discretion be carried to such length in direction of self confidence a to produce belief that aid be wanted for achievement of great result will often militate against achievement have scotland yard be le discreet more confidential mystery might perhaps have be sooner unravelled gager at very moment have reason to believe that man whom knew must must if operated upon duly communicate to gager secret of present whereabouts of patience crabstick that belief be great possession much too important a gager thought to be shared lightly with such one a mr bunfit thick headed sort of man in gager opinion although doubt have by mean of industry be successful in difficult case lordship ai stirred said bunfit how do mean stirred mr bunfit ai moved nowhere out of london what must move out of london for what must get by cutting there ai nothing so bad when anything up against one a letting on one want to bolt know that will stand ground wo bolt suppose a will gager be rum go ai rummest a ever see remark have be made so often by mr bunfit that gager have become almost weary of hearing oh rum rum be b what be use of from what governor told morning there be shadow of doubt where diamond be in paris of course said bunfit never went to paris be taken from here to hamburg in commercial man kit fellow a travel in knife scissors then be recut say cutting be quickest bit of work ever done by one man in hamburg now be in new york be what have come of diamond benjamin in course said bunfit in low whisper just taking

name gager got at carlisle what took smiler down to carlisle just to put face on said bunfit who cut door billy cann did said bunfit who forced box two did said bunfit to put face on yes just uncommon good face did put on between best a ever see right said gager so far so good agree with mr bunfit because thing when be done must be worth money lord love must have cost what be to prevent lady lord george together taking diamond to benjamin getting price never doe to be too clever mr bunfit when be done why did lady go get robbed again say what be clever man in way mr bunfit have not got hold of thing here why be smiler going about like mad dog only that found took in maybe expected something else in box more than necklace a be to come to suggested bunfit gammon see why say gammon gager ai polite be gammon running away with idea like just a if be one of public when two opened that box at carlisle did a certain a sit there believed a diamond be there be not there think a be said bunfit very well where be just walk up to mr bunfit making ground good a go two men cut door took box opened when 'd opened did get swag where be swag lord george said bunfit again very well lord george like enough come to benjamin two men of have laid out for robbery now mr bunfit whether lord george benjamin be together in first affair whether be ca see way just at present know a can see yours not

there be back again mr bunfit not making ground good a go smiler cann did job according to order precious sore heart have when 'd got box open fellow at carlisle just like provincial went to work open mouthed before party have left carlisle be known that lord george be suspected ca trust fellow way said mr bunfit well what happens next lord george go to benjamin be goin ' to take diamond with have

benjamin be to have have 'em before benjamin have spent goodish bit of money have be thrown over rather daresay benjamin be a bad a smiler worse doubt benjamin let on to smiler thought a smiler be too many for daresay there be few word between smiler must wonder if smiler did threaten to punch benjamin head well must do if there be few playful remark between about penal servitude for life see mr bunfit must have be pleasant for of 'em they'd have split said bunfit did not downright well there be diamond be with lady lord george have done lord george lady eustace be keeping company doubt after own fashion be robbing of have to do pretty much a be bid diamond be with lady lord george be pretty well afraid to look at after be being done there be much to wonder at in then come second robbery

though mr hittaway shrunk shivered under strong action with mr gowran garnished strong word still be sure of excellence of purpose believing useful aid might still be obtained from andy gowran perhaps prudently anxious to get value in return for cost of journey up from ayrshire made man promise to return to on following morning chapter lx let be a though have never be between son married daughter lucy morris poor lady fawn life have become burthen to everything be astray there be happiness tranquillity at fawn court of simply human creed strongest existing creed for present in mind of fawn lady be that have reference to general iniquity of lizzie eustace have be cause of sorrow be hated so much more because have not be proved to be iniquitous before world there have be time when seemed to be admitted that be so wicked in keeping diamond in opposition to continued demand made for by mr camperdown that people must be justified in dropping lord fawn among number since two robbery public opinion have veered round three four point in lizzie favour people be beginning to say that have be ill used then have come mr hittaway evidence a to lizzie wicked doings down in scotland wicked doings andy gowran have described with vehemence so terribly moral have be at first a be added to diamond a supplementary weight thrown into scale so lizzie iniquity might bring absolutely to ground have gradually assumed position of being first charge against lady fawn have felt aversion to discussing diamond when lizzie be called thief robber swindler by one of lady of family who in using strong term whispered word a lady be wont to do when desire to lessen impropriety of strength of language by gentleness of tone in word be spoken when lizzie be thus described in lady fawn hearing in own house have felt repugnance to be well that fact must be known so that everybody might be aware that son be doing right in refusing to marry so wicked lady when other thing be added to when story be told of what mr gowran have seen among rock when gradually became special crime be to justify son in dropping lady acquaintance then lady fawn became very unhappy found subject to be a mr hittaway have described very distasteful trouble hit lucy morris a hard a did lord fawn if lizzie eustace be unfit to marry lord fawn because of thing then be frank greystock not only unfit to marry lucy most unlikely to do so whether fit unfit for week two lady fawn have allowed to share lucy joy to believe that mr greystock must prove true to girl whose heart have made own have soon learned to distrust young member of parliament who be always behaving insolently to son who spent holiday down with lizzie eustace who never visited rarely wrote to girl have promised to marry a to whom world agreed in saying that be far too much in debt to marry woman who have not mean to help be sorrow vexation together yet when married daughter must press subject upon demand co operation have power of escaping mamma mr hittaway have said lady glencora palliser have be with everybody be taking up if conduct down in scotland be proved frederic will be made to marry what can do dear lady fawn have asked almost in tear insist that frederic will know whole truth replied mr hittaway with energy of course be very disagreeable nobody can feel more than do be horrible to have to talk about such thing to think of indeed be clara very horrible anything mamma be better than frederic must be allowed to marry woman a that must be proved to how unfit be to be wife with view of carrying out intention mr hittaway have a have seen received andy gowran at own house with same view took andy gowran following morning down to richmond mr hittaway mother andy be closeted together for hour lady fawn suffered grievously lord fawn have found that must hear story have not heard have be strong enough to escape have upon whole got best of in slight skirmish have taken place between scotchman poor old lady fawn must not escape andy be allowed to be eloquent whole story be told to though must almost sooner have be flogged at cart tail than have heard then rafrashments be administered to andy of nature made prefer fawn court to warwick square be told that might go back to portray a soon a pleased when be gone mr hittaway opened mind to mother altogether truth be mamma that frederic will marry why thought that have declared that must give up thought that have said so to herself what of if retracts what said be so weak lady glencora palliser have made promise to go see be to go to day be there now probably at very moment if have be firm thing be done after have taken place nobody must ever have supposed that engagement need go for anything what can say to now that be with except just do mischief over again call quite wicked in woman interfering do indeed be nasty insolent impertinent creature be what be after trouble have taken come undoes with one word what can do clara well do believe that if frederic must be made to act a ought to do just for while must marry cousin mr greystock then there must be end of altogether really think that like best from can hear must take now if frederic must only keep out of way a for of course be doing very best to get have not one shilling to rub against be over head ear in debt poor lucy ejaculated lady fawn well yes really be matter of course always thought mamma that amelia be little wrong to coax up in belief dear man proposed for in plainest possible manner saw letter doubt men do propose know that be sure know what get by suppose amuses there used to be sort of feeling that if man behaved badly something must be done to be over now man may propose to whom like if chooses to say afterwards that doe mean anything there be nothing in world to bring to book be very hard said elder lady of whom everybody said that did not understand world a well a daughter girl know that be so suppose come to same thing in long run men have to marry what one girl loses girl get will kill lucy girl ai killed so easy mamma not now day saying that will kill wo change man nature be to be expected that man a frank greystock in debt in parliament going to best house must marry governess what be to get by be what want to know suppose loved law mamma how antediluvian be doubt did like after fashion though what saw in never must tell think miss morris must make very nice wife for country clergyman who did care how poor thing be have style a far a can see have beauty why must such man a frank greystock tie by leg for ever to such girl a mamma doe mean to marry lucy morris must have be going on in way with cousin down in scotland have meant mean nothing of kind mean to marry lady eustace income if can get must marry before summer if only must keep frederic away from mr hittaway demanded from mother that in season out of season must be urgent with lord fawn impressing upon necessity of waiting in order that might see how false lady eustace be to also that must teach lucy morris how vain be hope if lucy morris must withdraw claim altogether thing might probably be more quickly more surely managed if lucy must be induced to tell frank that withdrew claim that saw how impossible be that must ever be man wife then so argued mr hittaway frank must at once throw at cousin foot difficulty must be over abominable unjustifiable insolent interference of lady glencora just at present moment must be mean of undoing good have be done unless must be neutralised by such activity a necklace have absolutely faded away into nothing sly creature be almost becoming heroine on strength of necklace very mystery with robbery be pervaded be acting in favour lord fawn must absolutely be made to marry forced into by lady glencora set unless love affair between cousin of andy gowran be able to give such sufficient testimony must in way be made available to prevent theory of life system on social matter must be managed a displayed by married daughter be very painful to poor old lady fawn when be told that under new order of thing promise from gentleman be not to be looked upon a binding that love be to go for nothing girl be to be made contented by being told that when one lover be lost must be found be very unhappy must not disbelieve throw back upon faith in virtue constancy honesty rather thought that thing have changed for worse since be young that promise be not now a binding a used to be have married into liberal family have liberal son must have called liberal must not fail to hear from others neighbour that english manner english principle english society be going to destruction in consequence of so called liberality of age gentleman thought certainly did do thing gentleman must not have done forty year ago a for lady doubtless be changed altogether most assuredly must not have brought andy gowran to mother to tell such tale in joint presence a man have told mr hittaway have ridiculed for saying poor lucy must die when forced to give up lover mr hittaway have spoken of necessity of breaking up engagement without word of anger against frank greystock according to mr hittaway view frank greystock have amused in most natural way in world when asked lucy to be wife governess like lucy have be quite foolish to expect such man a greystock be in earnest of course must give up lover if there must be blame must blame for folly nevertheless lady fawn be so soft hearted that believed that sorrow must crush lucy even if did not kill not le be duty to tell lucy what thought to be truth story of what have occurred among rock at portray be very disagreeable believed to be true man have be making love to cousin after engagement to lucy then be not quite manifest that be neglecting poor lucy in way have not seen for nearly six month have intended to marry must not have found home for at deanery did in respect treat a must treat girl whom intended to marry putting thing together lady fawn thought that saw that lucy case be hopeless so thinking wrote to following letter fawn court rd march dearest lucy have so much to say to that did think of getting lady linlithgow to let come to here for day believe will perhaps be better must write think leave lady linlithgow after first week in april be quite necessary that must come to fixed arrangement a to future if be there need not be trouble a will come here of course indeed be natural home a feel must say that have missed most terribly since went not only for cecilia nina for of know must write at if be for something else must be said sooner later because a to coming here in april be so much matter of course only mistake be that must ever have gone away so will expect here on day may arrange with lady linlithgow a to leaving poor dear lady went on repeating affectionate invitation because of difficulty encountered in finding word with to give cruel counsel thought that be duty to offer now dearest lucy must say what believe to be truth about mr greystock think that must teach to forget at rate that must teach to forget offer made to last autumn whether be be not in earnest then think that have now determined to forget fear there be doubt that have be making love to cousin lady eustace well know must not mention such thing if have not strongest possible ground to convince ought to do so independent of conduct to during last six month have be such a to make feel sure that engagement be distasteful to have probably found so placed that can not marry without money have wanted firmness perhaps will say hardness of heart to say so openly be sure of so be amelia that will be better for to give matter up altogether to come here recover blow among friend who will be a kind to a possible know that will feel have fullest sympathy even such sorrow a be cured by time by mercy of god be not only infinite powerful most affectionate friend c fawn lady fawn when have written letter discussed with amelia two together agreed that lucy must never surmount ill effect of blow be thus prophesied a to saying will kill mamma said amelia believe in if be to break leg

conscious of necessity of earning bread by exercise of most precarious profession while elated by hope though have loved man have be hopeless be happy now surely of maiden of woman be most forlorn having once acceded to truth of lady fawn view abandoned hope everybody said so be so there be word from side to encourage thing be done over must never mention name again must simply beg of fawn that allusion might be made to in presence must never blame certainly must never praise a far a must rule tongue must never have name upon lip again thought for time that must send letter have already written other letter must not bring to write even to think of be agony to to communicate thought to be worse than agony must be almost madness what need be there for letter if thing be done be done perhaps there remained with staying by without own knowledge faint spark of hope that even yet might return to at last resolved that there must be letter destroyed that have written did write note to lady fawn in gratefully accepted old friend kindness till such time a must find place a to that other subject said know that be right please let all be a though have never be chapter lxi lizzie great friend saturday morning came at last for lord fawn have made appointment with lizzie very important day be in hertford street chiefly on account of lordship visit also in respect to other event crowded into day in telling of tale have gone little in advance of a be not till subsequent monday that lady linlithgow read in newspaper told lucy how man have be arrested on account of robbery early on saturday morning sir griffin tewett be in hertford street a lizzie afterwards understood there be terrible scene between lucinda mr carbuncle saw nothing of mr carbuncle brought tidings for last few day mr carbuncle have be very affectionate in manner to lizzie thereby showing great change for during nearly whole of february lady who in fact owned house have hardly be courteous to remunerative guest expressing more than once hint that arrangement have brought together have better come to end see lady eustace mr carbuncle have once said trouble about robbery be almost too much for lizzie who be ill at time still trembling with constant fear on account of lost diamond have taken advantage of sick condition declined to argue question of removal now be supposed to be convalescent mr carbuncle have returned to former way of affection doubt there be cause for cause be patent to lizzie lady glencora palliser have called thing alone be felt by lizzie to alter position altogether then though diamond be gone though thief who have stolen be undoubtedly aware of secret a to first robbery though have told that secret to lord george whom have not seen since have done so in spite of cause for trouble have of late gradually found to be emerging from state of despondency into have fallen while diamond be in own custody knew that be regaining ascendancy therefore when mr carbuncle came to tell of grievous thing have be said down stair between sir griffin mistress to consult a to future lizzie be not surprised suppose meaning of be that match must be off said lizzie oh dear pray say anything so horrid after have gone through suggest anything of kind to lucinda surely after what have told now will never come here again oh yes will there be danger about coming back be only sort of way have very disagreeable way said lizzie doubt lady eustace then know ca have sweet there must be thing disagreeable a far a can learn property will be right after few year be absolutely indispensable that lucinda must do something have accepted must go on with seems to to be very unhappy mr carbuncle be always way be never gay cheery like other girl have never known once to be what must call happy like hunting yes because can gallop away out of herself have done can for must go on with marriage now a for going back be out of question truth be must afford then must keep in better humour be not so much afraid about dear lady eustace want to help little how can help can certainly must lend two hundred fifty pound just for six week lizzie face fell eye became very serious in aspect two hundred fifty pound know must have ample security need not give lucinda present till have paid will be forty five pound thirty five said lizzie with angry decision thought agreed upon forty five when settled about servant livery then can let man at stable know that be to pay for carriage horse must be out of money hardly above week so might be salvation of lucinda just at present why ask lord george ask lord george have got be much more likely that must ask know what be come to lord george last month past did believe that be to come together think two robbery have upset altogether dear lizzie can let have ca lizzie did not at like idea of lending money by mean appreciated security now offered to might be very well for to tell man at stable mr carbuncle must pay bill how must be with if mr carbuncle did not pay bill a for present to lucinda be to have be present regarded by future lady tewett a voluntary offering of good will affection be altogether averse to having disposed of in fashion yet did not like to make enemy of mr carbuncle never be so poor in life before not since be married said lizzie ca be poor dear lady eustace took money out of desk know ever so much forty three pound said mr carbuncle who be of course well instructed in detail of robbery suppose can guess what autumn cost at portray bill be only coming in now really sometimes so frighten that know what will do indeed have got money to spare will have penny of back in six week said mr carbuncle upon whose face glow of anger be settling down quite intended to make very disagreeable to dear lady eustace dear lizzie if did not get what wanted knew very well how to do must be owned that lizzie be afraid of woman be almost impossible for not to be afraid of people with whom lived there be so many thing against so many source of fear be quite sure wo refuse such trifling favour a said mr carbuncle with glow of anger reddening more more upon brow think have so much at banker said lizzie will let overdraw just a much a please if cheque come back will be look out lizzie have tried that game before knew that banker must allow to overdraw come be good friend do at once said mr carbuncle perhaps can manage hundred fifty said lizzie trembling mr carbuncle fought hard for greater sum at last consented to take le cheque be written of course wo interfere with lucinda present said mr carbuncle a can make right by horse carriage account to proposition however lady eustace made answer soon after lunch at meal miss roanoke did not show lady glencora palliser be announced sat for about ten minute in drawing room have come said especially to give duke of omnium compliment to lady eustace to express wish on part of duke that lost diamond might be recovered doubt said lady glencora whether there be one in england except professed jeweller who know so much about diamond a grace who have so many said mr carbuncle smiling graciously know about suppose there be family diamond though have never seen sympathises with completely lady eustace suppose there be hardly hope now of recovering lizzie smiled shook head be odd that never must have discovered thief be told have at given up only unfortunately will never get back necklace sat there for about quarter of hour then a took leave whispered few word to lizzie be to come see be lizzie assented with smile without word hope will be right said lady glencora then went lizzie liked friendship from lady glencora amazingly perhaps after nothing more must ever be known about diamond must simply be remembered a having added peculiar not injurious mystery to life lord george knew then trusted that benevolent true hearted corsair such a be lord george must never tell story against thief knew surely if not detected must never tell if story be told by thief even by corsair at rate world must not believe what have feared have feared till dread have nearly overcome be public exposure at hand of police if must escape that world might still be bright before interest taken in by such person a duke of omnium lady glencora be evidence not only that have escaped hitherto also that be in fair way to escape altogether three week ago must have given up half income to have be able to steal out of london without leaving trace behind three week ago mr carbuncle be treating with discourtesy be left alone nearly whole day in sick bedroom thing be going better with now be recovering position mr camperdown who have be first to attack be so to say nowhere have acknowledged beaten lord fawn whose treatment to have be so great injury be coming to see very day cousin frank though have never offered to marry be more affectionate to than ever mr carbuncle have be at foot that morning borrowing money lady glencora palliser very leading star of fashion have called upon twice why must succumb have income of four thousand pound year thought that must remember that aunt lady linlithgow have seven hundred pound lady fawn with daughter have not near so much a have be beautiful too young perfectly free to do what pleased doubt last eighteen month of life have be made wretched by horrid diamond be gone have fair reason to hope that very knowledge of be gone also in condition must be expedient for to accept lord fawn when came must not of course be sure that renewed offer must be result of visit thought probable that with care might bring to why must come to if have such intention mind be quite made up on point that must be made to renew offer whether must renew acceptance be quite question have sworn to cousin frank that must never do so have sworn also that must be revenged on wretched lord now must be opportunity of accomplishing revenge of proving to frank that have be in earnest positively disliked man probably did not go for much went for something even with lizzie eustace cousin did like lord george hardly knew be real love though doubt gave preference greatly to cousin because must trust then lord fawn be very poor other two men be poor also poverty be not so objectionable in lizzie eye a be respectable close fisted economy of lord fawn lord fawn doubt have assured income real peerage must make peeress a thought of acknowledged that there be great deal to be said on side that necessity of making up mind then there be heavy burthen upon exactly at hour named lord fawn came lizzie be of course found alone have be carefully provided be shown up received very gracefully be sitting rose from chair put out hand for to take spoke word of greeting looked at with pleasant smile stood for few second with hand in be awkward much embarrassed certainly have intention of lessening embarrassment hope be better than have be said at last be getting better lord fawn will not sit down then seated placing hat beside on floor at moment must not find word to speak have be very ill have be so sorry to hear there have be much to make ill have there not about robbery mean about many thing robbery have be by mean worst though doubt frightened much there be two robbery lord fawn yes know that be very terrible then have be threatened with lawsuit have heard that too yes have heard believe have given that up now understand from cousin mr greystock who have be truest friend in trouble that stupid people have found out at last that have not leg to stand on daresay have heard that lord fawn lord fawn certainly have heard in doubtful way gist of mr dove opinion namely that necklace must not be claimed from holder of a heirloom attached to eustace family have heard at same time that mr camperdown be a confident a ever that must recover property by claiming after fashion whether claim have be altogether abandoned have be allowed to fall into abeyance because of absence of diamond did not know did one know mr camperdown having come to decision on subject lord fawn have be aware that sister have of late shifted ground of inveterate enmity to lizzie eustace making use of scene mr gowran have witnessed in lieu of lady rapacity in regard to necklace might therefore be assumed lord fawn thought feared that strong ground in regard to necklace have be cut from under foot still did not behove to confess that cause have always alleged a ground for retreat from engagement be cause at might go hard with must attempt be made to force to name cause knew that must lack courage to tell lady that have heard from sister that one andy gowran have witnessed terrible scene down among rock at portray so sat silent made answer to lizzie first assertion respecting diamond necklace be strong point did not intend that must escape subject if remember right lord fawn saw that wretched old attorney once twice on subject did see mr camperdown certainly be own family lawyer be kind enough to interest about diamond be not asked a question then waited for reply be not so yes lady eustace be so be of great value be natural continued lizzie of course interested mr camperdown be full of awful threat against be not know what be not going to do stopped in street a be driving to station in own carriage when diamond be with be very strong measure think wrote ever so many oh such horrid letter went about telling everybody that be heirloom did know that lord fawn know that wanted to recover did tell that went to real lawyer somebody who really knew about mr turbot turtle such name a real lawyer told that be wrong that necklace must be heirloom at because belonged to that have better drop lawsuit altogether did hear that did not hear that ah lord fawn dropped inquiry just at wrong place doubt have too many thing to do in parliament government to go on with if have gone on must have learned that mr camperdown have just to give up because have be wrong from beginning to end lizzie word fell from with extreme rapidity have become almost out of breath from effect of own energy lord fawn felt strongly necessity of clinging to diamond a one great sufficient justification thought said that mr camperdown have abandoned action for present because jewel have be stolen not bit of said lizzie rising suddenly to leg who say so who dare to say so whoever say so be be storyteller understand about that action must go on just same must be made to pay for necklace out of own income if have be own be sure lord fawn clever man a one who have always be in government in parliament can see will anybody believe that enemy a mr camperdown have be to persecuting in possible way telling lie about to everybody who tried to prevent dear darling husband from marrying that must go on with if must mr camperdown be very respectable man lady eustace respectable talk to of respectable after that have made suffer a be so fond of making inquiry lord fawn ought to have gone on with never must believe what cousin said cousin always behaved very badly to cousin who be brother rather than cousin have known how to protect from injury done to rather have known how to take part when have be injured lord a have be unwilling to believe why have not gone to gentleman who a say be real lawyer know lord that need have concerned at a began surely must have gone on with think so be still standing up small a be stature be almost menacing unfortunate under secretary of state who be still seated in chair lord continued lizzie have have great wrong done do mean by yes by who else have done think have done wrong to one be obliged to say must not recognise diamond a property of wife what right have to say so have diamond when asked to be wife did not know did know have little ring upon finger be fit that that man must turn round upon lady say to that word be to be broken that be to be exposed before friend because have taken fancy to dislike ring brooch say lord fawn be business of yours even after be engaged to what jewel might have not have be concern of yours till after have become wife go ask world if be not so say that cousin affront because take part like brother ask one else ask lady may know let name one to decide between of have be wrong lady glencora palliser be friend of yours husband be in government will name be true indeed that uncle duke of omnium grandest greatest of english nobleman be specially interested on behalf be very fine in lizzie duke of omnium have never seen name have be mentioned to by lady glencora be quick to use can admit of reference to one said lord fawn then what be to do be to be thrown over simply because lordship chooses to throw over lordship will admit reference to one lordship make inquiry a long a attorney tell story against drop at once when attorney be made to understand that be wrong tell sir can justify in own heart unfortunately for lord fawn be not sure that must justify diamond be gone action be laid aside general opinion have prevailed month two since lizzie have be disreputably concerned in stealing own necklace seemed to have be laid aside lady glencora duke went for almost a much with lord fawn a did with lizzie doubt misbehaviour down among rock be left to have that only on evidence of andy gowran even andy gowran evidence have declined to receive otherwise than second hand lizzie too be prepared with answer to charge answer have already made more than once though charge be not positively brought against consisted in assertion frank greystock be brother rather than cousin such brotherhood be not altogether satisfactory to lord fawn when came once more to regard lizzie eustace a possible future wife still assertion be answer one that must not altogether reject certainly be case that have again begun to think what must be result of marriage with lady eustace must sever altogether from mr hittaway must relax closeness of relation with fawn court must have wife respecting whom have spread evil tidings man whom most hated in world must be wife favourite cousin so to say brother must after fashion be connected with mr carbuncle lord george de bruce carruthers sir griffin tewett of whom regarded a thoroughly disreputable moreover at own country house at portray a in such case must be own bailiff steward must be man who have seen what have seen be great objection how be to avoid marrying be engaged to how at rate be to escape from renewal of engagement at moment have more than once positively stated that be deterred from marrying only by possession of diamond diamond be now gone lizzie be still standing waiting for answer to question can justify in own heart having paused for second repeated question in stronger more personal form have be sister lord fawn have man behaved to a have now done must say that have behaved well that have ground for complaint can bring to answer question honestly hope will answer question dishonestly answer then can not answer because must condemn now lord fawn what do mean to do have thought lady eustace that regard might ever have entertained for well what have thought of regard that have be dissipated have told so have one come to from with message have not received attention from one else attention what attention have received plenty of attention most flattering attention be honoured even morning by most gratifying attention on part of grace duke of omnium did not mean that what do mean then be not going to marry duke of omnium because of attention one else if mean sir after other inquiry have done honour to make to throw in face now have have in way rendered unworthy of position of wife because people have be civil kind to in sorrow be greater dastard than took to be tell at once sir whom mean be hardly too much to say that man quailed before certainly be not too much to say that have lizzie eustace be trained a actress must have become favourite with town when there came to fair scope for acting be perfect in ordinary scene of ordinary life such a befell during visit to fawn court must not acquit well there be reality about want of be strangely plain to most unobservant eye give part to play required exaggerated strong action hardly ever failed even in terrible moment when on return from theatre thought that police have discovered secret about diamond though nearly sank through fear still carried on acting in presence of lucinda roanoke when have found herself constrained to tell truth to lord george carruthers power to personify poor weak injured creature be not wanting to reader will not think that position in society at present moment be very well established will feel probably that must still have known to be on brink of social ruin have now fully worked up to necessity of occasion be a able to play part a well a actress that ever walked board have called dastard now stood looking in face did mean anybody in particular said lord fawn then what right can have to ask whether have received attention have not be for affectionate attention of cousin mr greystock must have died beneath load of sorrow have heaped upon said quite boldly yet man named be of whom andy gowran told horrid story whose love making to lizzie have in mr hittaway opinion be sufficient to atone for falling off of strength in matter of diamond rumour reached said lord fawn plucking up courage that be engaged to marry cousin then rumour lied lord who repeated rumour to lied also who repeat again will go on with lie lord fawn brow became very black word lie be offensive to offensive even though might not be applied directly to still quailed be unable to express indignation a have done to poor lucy morris mother governess now let ask lord fawn on what ground stand together when friend lady glencora asked only morning whether engagement with be still existing fact brought kindest possible message on same subject from uncle duke hardly knew what answer to make be not surprising that lizzie in difficulty must use new friend perhaps over did friendship little told that be engaged that lordship conduct to have be so strange that hardly knew how to speak of among friend thought explained to cousin cousin certainly did not understand explanation lord fawn be certain that greystock have understood well greystock have in return insulted because engagement be broken off be impossible to argue on fact with woman who have be ill used after have passed perhaps have better part said lord fawn then will put matter into hand of duke of omnium said lizzie boldly will not have whole life ruined good name blasted have not said word to injure good name on what plea then have dared to take upon to put end to engagement be made at own pressing request be of course made at own request on what ground do justify such conduct be liberal lord fawn everybody regard duke of omnium a head of liberal nobility in england be friend will put matter into hand be probably from cousin frank that lizzie have learned that lord fawn be more afraid of leader of own party than of other tribunal upon earth perhaps elsewhere lord fawn felt absurdity of threat yet have effect upon knew that duke of omnium be worn out old debauchee with one foot in grave who be looked after by two three woman who be only anxious that must not disgrace by absurdity before died nevertheless duke of omnium duke name be power in nation lady glencora be certainly very powerful lady glencora husband be chancellor of exchequer did not suppose that duke cared in least whether lizzie eustace be be not married lady glencora have certainly interested about lizzie might make london almost too hot to hold if chose to go about everywhere saying that ought to marry lady in addition to prospective grief there be trouble of present moment be in lizzie own room fool that have be to come there must get out a best must lady eustace said be most anxious not to behave badly in matter be behaving badly very badly with leave will tell must suggest will submit to in writing opinion on matter lord fawn have be life submitting opinion in writing thought that be rather good hand at work will then endeavour to explain to reason make think that will be better for that engagement must be at end if after reading will disagree with still insist on right gave when asked to become wife will then perform promise certainly made to most foolish proposal on part lizzie of course acquiesced acquiesced bade farewell with sweetest smile be now manifest to that must have husband revenge just a might prefer have be day of triumph to be talking of in evening triumphantly to mr carbuncle when be told that policeman wanted to see down stair oh wretched police again blood rushed to head nearly killed descended slowly be then informed by man not dressed like bunfit in plain clothes with paraphernalia of policeman uniform that late servant patience crabstick have given up a queen evidence be now in custody in scotland yard have be thought right that must be so far informed man be able to tell nothing further chapter lxii know where heart be on sunday following frank a usual be in hertford street have become almost favourite with mr carbuncle have so far ingratiated even with lucinda roanoke according to lizzie report might if so inclined rob sir griffin of prize without much difficulty on occasion be unhappy in low spirit when questioned on subject made secret of fact that be harassed for money truth be have overdrawn banker by five hundred pound have a say ventured to remind of wish be not venturesome quite so often for reminded of same fact about fortnight ago what do do with money mr greystock asked mr carbuncle laughing muddle away paying bill with according to very very old story fact be live in detestable man land between respectability insolvency have none of pleasure of be fair game for creditor a be supposed to pay way yet never can pay way just like poor dear father said lizzie not exactly lizzie managed much better never paid anybody if must only land on terra firma one side other must much care a be have recklessness none of carelessness of hopelessly insolvent man be so hard with attorney owe large sum of money ca dun very well have lot of money due to from rich men who pay simply because think that matter talk to grandly look big a though money be last thing thought of when be longing to touch hat ask a great favour to settle little bill time lizzie be full of matter must impart to cousin must impart to only in privacy be absolutely necessary that must tell what have heard of patience crabstick in heart of heart wished that patience crabstick have gone off safely with plunder to antipode have wish to get back what have be lost either in matter of diamond of smaller thing taken have sincerely wished that police might fail in endeavour that thief might enjoy perfect security with booty did not even begrudge mr benjamin diamond lord george if in truth lord george have be last thief robbery have enabled to get better of mr camperdown apparently of lord fawn have freed from custody of property have learned to hate have be very good robbery now wretched police have found patience crabstick must disturb again of course must tell cousin must hear news must be better that must hear from than from others be sunday thought must be sure to know truth on following monday in be right for on monday old lady linlithgow saw stated in newspaper that arrest have be made have something to tell said a soon a have succeeded in finding alone with anything about diamond well no not exactly about diamond though perhaps be first frank want to say something else to not about diamond oh not at be must let lend that five hundred pound want indeed will do such thing must not have mentioned to if have not thought that be one of insolvent be in debt when last talked about money so be that horrid woman mr carbuncle have made lend one hundred fifty pound be so different with frank yes need be greater than hers what be to while be everything thing ca be so bad with what can raise five hundred pound after be not really in debt for person with income if be still first duty must be to help if want help be generous first just afterwards be be lizzie indeed under circumstance must take penny of money there be person from whom man can borrow from whom can not be clearly one of from whom can not borrow why not ah one ca explain thing simply be so mr carbuncle be quite natural person to borrow money seems that have complied with nature jew who want thirty per cent be natural person for thing be arranged be of use disturbing arrangement getting out of course will pull through now let know own news police have taken patience have have then at last will know about diamond be gall to poor lizzie where did get ah know that who told policeman came here last night said so be going to turn against thief tell that know nasty mean creature thief be nasty mean creature generally will get out now a to what happened at carlisle what happened here do know that everybody belief up to moment that dear friend lord george de bruce sold diamond to mr benjamin jeweller lizzie must only shrug shoulder among many doubt be upon whole disposed to think a everybody thought did believe a far a believed anything in matter that corsair have determined to become possessed of prize from moment that saw in scotland that corsair arranged robbery in carlisle again arranged robbery in london house a soon a learned from lizzie where diamond be placed to mind have be most ready solution of mystery when found that other people almost regarded a thief doubt became belief did not in least despise dislike condemn for what have done be to come to confess telling story in such manner a to make seem to be safe for future must congratulate accept at once a own dear expected corsair if so must not have bungled thing must have managed subordinate better than to have one of turn evidence against must have be able to get rid of poor weak female like patience crabstick why have not sent to new york anywhere if lizzie be to hear that lord george have taken patience out to sea in yacht somewhere among bright island of thought so much dropped girl overboard tied up in bag must regard a proper corsair arrangement now be angry with lord george because trouble be coming back upon frank have suggested that lord george be robber in chief lizzie merely shrugged shoulder will know about now said triumphantly know want to know more about have be so tortured about wretched diamond never wish to hear mentioned again care who have got enemy used to think

attention frank greystock of course remembered scene among rock mr gowran wagging head watchful eye at time have felt certain that use must be made of andy vigilance though have not traced connexion between man mr hittaway if lord fawn have heard of little scene there might doubtless be cause for to talk of attention what did matter to asked frank be insolent as a have told once will have to tell

eustace house in hertford street doubt same person be concerned in robbery of ladyship jewel at carlisle on night of th of january mystery have so long enveloped two affair have be so discreditable to metropolitan police will now probably be cleared up there be not word about patience crabstick in a lizzie observed news brought by policeman on saturday night referred only to patience said nothing of arrest of burglar lady in hertford street scanned sentence with greatest care mr carbuncle be very angry because house be said to be be house be doing said policeman came to about did say word to man did want to come hope will be found out now said lucinda wish be clean forgotten said lizzie ought to be found out said mr carbuncle police must be more careful in what say suppose will have to go before magistrate again poor lizzie felt that fresh trouble be certainly coming upon have learned now that crime for might be prosecuted punished be that of perjury that even if everything be known must not be accused of stealing that if must only get out of way till wrath of magistrate policeman must have evaporated might possibly escape altogether at rate must not take income away from how must get out of way how must endure to be cross examined looked at inquired into by who must be concerned in matter thought that if only must have arranged matrimonial affair before bad day came upon

endeavoured to sell necklace to mr benjamin who certainly be intimate with lord george be very fond of talking about diamond have once suggested to lordship be to become lordship by marriage benjamin might be willing to treat with lordship in regard to treating with ladyship mr benjamin acknowledged that thought must be too hazardous then came robbery of box lord george be astray mr benjamin be for while equally astray friend believed in other friend innocence that lord george must suspect mr benjamin be quite natural mr benjamin hardly knew what to think hardly gave lord george credit for necessary courage skill energy at last a began to put two two together divined truth be enabled to set docile patience on watch over mistress belonging so have be with mr benjamin who at last be able to satisfy mr smiler mr cann that have be no party to cruel disappointment at carlisle how lord george have learned truth have be told truth a to lizzie hiding necklace under pillow bringing up to london in desk of fact of second robbery knew nothing up to morning almost suspected that lizzie have again be at work be afraid of have promised that must take care of have perhaps said enough to make believe that day must marry hardly remembered what have said be afraid of be so wonderfully clever that if did not take care must get into mess from must be unable to extricate have never whispered secret to one have still be at loss about second robbery when too saw paragraph in newspaper went direct to scotland yard made inquiry there name have be so often used in affair that such inquiry from be justified well lord yes have found out something said bunfit mr benjamin be off know benjamin off cut painter lord started what be good now have wire who be thief ah lord be telling

be because be poor said to herself for know well that love chapter lxv tribute lizzie put off journey to scotland from day to day though cousin frank continually urged upon expediency of going there be various reason said why must go child be there be proper that must be with child be living at present with people whose reputation did not stand high a to whom manner of evil report be flying about town be generally thought so said frank that lord george de bruce carruthers have assisted mr benjamin in stealing diamond frank did not hesitate to express belief in accusation oh can not be said lizzie trembling though rejected supposition did not reject very firmly then know continued lizzie never see have actually only set eye on once since second robbery then just for minute of course used to know down at portray now be stranger frank went on with objection declared that manner in mr carbuncle have got up match between lucinda roanoke sir griffin be shameful world be declaring that be shameful that have not penny that girl be adventurer that sir griffin be obstinate pig headed ruined idiot be expedient on account lizzie must take away from lot answer that lizzie desired to make be very simple let go a betrothed bride will start to morrow to scotland elsewhere a may direct let little affair be settled will be quite a willing to get out of london a can be to send be in such peck of trouble that something must be settled a seems that after police be still astray about necklace perhaps need run away from for little while even yet did not say did not even in so many word make first proposition did endeavour to make frank understand that must obey dictation if must earn right to dictate either did not must not understand then became angry with pretended to be angry really frank said be hardly fair to in what way be unfair come here abuse friend tell to go here go there just a though be child what lizzie know what mean be one thing one day one hope miss lucy morris be quite well when last heard from have right to speak to of lucy at least not in disparagement be treating very badly know that be then why give up why let have chance to do what can with know very well that ca marry know that ought not to have asked talk of miss roanoke sir griffin tewett there be people quite a bad a sir griffin mr carbuncle suppose be speaking for have given up that idle fancy long ago will never marry second time have made up mind to have suffered too much already then burst into tear dried tear comforted forgave injurious thing have said of be almost impossible for man man under forty unmarried who be not philosopher to have familiar affectionate intercourse with beautiful young woman carry on a might do with friend of other sex in very heart greystock despised woman have told over over again that be there lucy in case must not marry that be affected unreal in fact liar in word look motion came from with premeditation judging not from own account from circumstance a saw such evidence a have reached did not condemn in reference to diamond have never for moment conceived that have secreted acquitted altogether from special charge have be widely circulated against nevertheless knew to be heartless bad have told dozen time that must be well for that must be married taken out of hand yet loved after fashion be prone to sit near be fool enough to be flattered by caress when must lay hand on arm thrill of pleasure went through yet must willingly have seen decent man take marry making bargain that must never see again young old men be apt to become merlin when encounter viviens on occasion left disgusted indeed not having told that be disgusted come again frank to morrow wo said made no promise a went have expected have left quite abruptly other day now went away almost in same fashion be not surprised understood that task have in hand be one very difficult to be accomplished did perceive in dark way good a acting be be not quite good enough lucy held ground because be real may knock about diamond not even scratch whereas paste in rough usage betrays lizzie with self assuring protestation knew that be paste knew that lucy be real stone why must not force to act little better so that paste might be a good a stone might at least seem to be a good if despises now what will say when find out asked a for frank greystock though have quite made up mind about lizzie eustace be still in doubt about other girl at present moment be making over two thousand pound year yet be more in debt now than have be year ago when attempted to look at affair must not even remember what have become of money did not gamble have little yacht costing about six hundred year kept one horse in london one only have house when must spare time from work be generally entertained at house of friend yet from day to day condition seemed to become worse worse be true that never thought of sovereign that in calling for wine at club be never influenced by cost that seemed to quite rational to keep cab waiting for day that in going coming never calculated expense that in giving order to tailor never dreamed of anything beyond own comfort nevertheless when recounted with pride great economy reminding that successful man with large income family kept hunter yacht moor that did not gamble did think very hard that must be embarrassed be embarrassed in condition must be right for to marry girl without shilling in day mr carbuncle be very urgent with friend not to leave london till after marriage lizzie have given no promise have only be induced to promise that loan of one hundred fifty pound must not be held to have bearing on wedding present to be made to lucinda must be got on credit from messrs harter benjamin for though mr benjamin be absent on little tour through europe in search of precious stone in cheap market old mr harter suggested business went on same a ever there be good deal of consultation about present mr carbuncle at last decided doubt with concurrence of miss roanoke that must consist simply of silver fork spoon real silver a far a money must go mr carbuncle went with friend to select article a to perhaps will do injustice in saying that ready sale must such lamentable occurrence ever become necessary be one of object have in view mr carbuncle investigation a to quality of metal quite won mr harter respect will probably be thought that exacted more than justice seeing that thing have become matter of bargain in demanding that thirty five pound must be stretched to fifty because thing be bought on long credit dear lizzie mr carbuncle said dear girl wo have ounce more than must have got have gone into sort of shop with thirty five sovereign in hand lizzie growled mr carbuncle final argument be conclusive will tell what will do said will take thirty pound down in ready money there be answer to be made to so reasonable proposition present to be made to lucinda be very much thought of in hertford street at time lizzie independently of feeling that might have a to own contribution did must to assist collection of tribute be quite understood that a girl can only be married once for widow chance in such matter amount to little everything must be done to gather toll from tax payer of society be quite fair on such occasion that men must be given to understand that something worth having be expected trumpery thirty shilling piece of crockery insignificant glass bottle fantastic paper knife of real value got up just to put money into tradesman hand to one two elderly gentleman upon whom mr carbuncle have smiled ventured to suggest in plain word that cheque be most convenient cadeau what do say to couple of sovereign one sarcastic old gentleman replied upon whom probably mr carbuncle have not smiled enough laughed congratulated sarcastic friend upon joke two sovereign be left upon table went to swell spoil must do something handsome for lucinda lizzie said to cousin what do call handsome be bachelor member of parliament say fifteen pound will be if do said frank who be beginning to be very much disgusted with house in hertford street there be five pound note may do what please with gave over five pound note identical bit of paper have come from frank mr carbuncle doubt did do what pleased with there be almost quarrel because lizzie after much consideration declared that did not see way to get present from duke of omnium have talked so much to mr carbuncle about duke mr carbuncle be almost justified in making demand be value know said mr carbuncle lucinda must think of must look so well to have dear duke name on something lizzie declared that duke be unapproachable on such subject there be wrong said mr carbuncle happen to know there be nothing grace like so much a giving wedding present be harder upon lizzie a actually did succeed in saying such kind thing about lucinda that lady glencora sent miss roanoke prettiest smelling bottle in world mean to say have given present to future lady tewett said madame max goesler to friend why not sir griffin ca hurt when one begin to be good natured why must one be good natured round madame max remarked that might perhaps be preferable to put end to good nature altogether there daresay be right dear said lady glencora have long felt that making present mean nothing only if one have lot of money people like why must one have made so many to people hardly ever saw that one more to lady tewett ca hurt perhaps most wonderful affair in campaign be spirited attack mr carbuncle made on certain mr hanbury smith who for last six seven year have not be among mr carbuncle more intimate friend mr hanbury smith lived with husband in paris before marriage have known mr carbuncle in london father mr bunbury jones have from certain cause chosen to show certain civility to mr carbuncle just at period of daughter marriage mr carbuncle being perhaps at moment well supplied with ready money have presented marriage present from to present day mr carbuncle have seen nothing of mr hanbury smith of mr bunbury jones be not woman to waste return value of such transaction present so given be seed sown in earth seed indeed must not be expected to give back twenty fold even ten fold still seed from crop must be expected so wrote to mr hanbury smith explaining that darling niece lucinda be about to be married to sir griffin tewett that a have child of own lucinda be same to a daughter then lest there might be want of comprehension expressed own assurance that friend must be glad to have opportunity of reciprocating feeling have be evinced on occasion of own marriage be good mincing matter now day mr carbuncle must have said have friend pointed out to that be taking strong measure in exaction of toll people have come to understand that spade be spade l l must have said have mr hanbury smith not noticed application there might perhaps have be end of be silly enough to send over from paris little trumpery bit of finery bought in palais royal for ten franc whereupon mr carbuncle wrote following letter dear mr hanbury smith lucinda have received little brooch be much obliged to for thinking of must remember that when be married sent bracelet cost l if have daughter of own must of course expect that must reap benefit of on marriage niece be same to a daughter think that be quite understood now among people in society lucinda will be disappointed much if send what think have right to expect of course can deduct brooch if please yours very sincerely jane carbuncle mr hanbury smith be something of wag caused wife to write back a follows dear mr carbuncle quite acknowledge reciprocity system think extends to descendant certainly not to niece acknowledge too present quoted at l thought have be l s nasty mean creature said mr carbuncle when showing correspondence to lizzie must have be to tradesman to inquire price named be l got l l off for ready money at second marriage will do what be needful can assure have recognised niece with of friend yours very truly caroline hanbury smith correspondence be carried further for not even can mr carbuncle exact payment of such debt in established court inveighed bitterly against meanness of mr smith telling story openly never feeling that told against in set be generally thought that have done quite right managed better with old mr cabob who have certainly received many of mr carbuncle smile who be very rich mr cabob did a be desired sent cheque cheque for l added message that hoped miss roanoke must buy with little thing that liked miss roanoke aunt for liked thirty guinea ring bought having bill for balance sent in to mr cabob mr cabob who probably knew that must pay well for smile never said anything about lady eustace went into work absolutely liking have felt nothing of anger even a regarded own contribution much a have struggled to reduce amount people felt ought to be sharp be nice to look at pretty thing to be cunning about must have applied to duke of omnium have dared be very triumphant when got smelling bottle from lady glencora lucinda took part whatever in thing nothing that mr carbuncle must say must induce to take interest in even in trousseau without reference to expense be being supplied chiefly on very indifferent credit of sir griffin what lucinda have to say about matter be said solely to aunt lady eustace lord george even maid who dressed heard of complaint complain did that with terrible energy what be use of aunt jane will never have house to put into what nonsense dear why must have house a well a others if have must never care for hate doe lady glencora palliser lord fawn care for even lord fawn have be put under requisition have sent little box full of stationery be worth money lucinda when girl marries always get yes when come from people who love who pour into lap with kiss because have given to man love then must be nice oh if be marrying poor man poor friend have given gridiron to help to cook husband dinner how must have valued know that like poor thing poor people better than anybody else said aunt jane like anything anybody said lucinda have better take good thing come to then not grumble how have worked to get arranged for now what thanks have will find have worked for very little aunt jane will never marry man yet however have be said so often that aunt jane thought nothing of threat chapter lxvi aspiration of mr emilius be acknowledged by mr carbuncle very freely that in matter of tribute one behaved better than mr emilius fashionable foreign ci devant jew preacher who still drew great congregation in neighbourhood of mr carbuncle house mr carbuncle doubt attended regularly at mr emilius church have taken sitting for thirteen sunday at something like ten shilling sunday have not a yet paid money mr emilius be well aware that if ticket be not paid for in advance there must be considerable defalcation in income be a rule very particular a to such payment must not allow name to be put on sitting till money have reached pocket with mr carbuncle have descended to such commercial accuracy mr carbuncle have seat for three for one of lady eustace paid share in advance in midst of very best pew in most conspicuous part of house hardly word have be said to about money now there came to from mr emilius prettiest little gold salver that ever be seen send messrs clerico docket wrote mr emilius a miss roanoke may like to know quality of metal ah said mr carbuncle inspecting little dish putting two two together be got cheap doubt at place where commissioned to buy plate candlestick for church at l s d gold be worth nearly twenty pound mr emilius doubt have have outing in autumn through instrumentality of mr carbuncle kindness be past gone such lavish gratitude for past favour must hardly be expected from mr emilius will be hanged if be after portray castle said mr carbuncle to herself mr emilius be after portray castle have be after portray castle in silent not very confident yet not altogether hopeless manner ever since have seen glory of place learned something of truth a to widow income mr carbuncle be led to conclusion not simply by wedding present in part also by diligence displayed by mr emilius in removing doubt have got abroad respecting condition in life assured mr carbuncle that have never be married shortly after ordination have be effected under hand of great good man late bishop of jerusalem have taken to live with lady who be mr carbuncle did not quite recollect who lady be remembered that be connected in way with step mother of mr emilius who lived in bohemia lady have for awhile kept house for mr emilius ill natured thing have be said mr emilius having respect to cloth have sent poor lady back to bohemia consequence be that now lived in solitude be absolute a mr emilius added somewhat melancholy mr emilius explained very fully not to lizzie to mr carbuncle if lady eustace chose to entertain such suitor why must not come be nothing to mr carbuncle lizzie laughed when be told that might add reverend gentleman to list of admirer remember said how used to chaff miss macnulty about knew better than replied mr carbuncle there be saying what man may be after said lizzie did know what might have thought that macnulty connexion must increase congregation be after dear income can manage congregation for lizzie be very civil to must be unjust to to say that gave encouragement be quite proper thing for lady to be on intimate even on affectionate term with favourite clergyman lizzie certainly have intercourse with clergyman who be greater favourite with than mr emilius have dean for uncle bishop for uncle in law be at pain to hide contempt for old fogy of church preach now then in cathedral said to mr emilius everybody take opportunity of going to sleep mr emilius be very much amused at description of eloquence of dignitary be quite natural to that people must go to sleep in church who take trouble in seeking eloquent preacher ah said church in england be church church love be beautiful be a maiden glorious with fine raiment ala be mute doe not sing have melody time cometh in will sing be poor singer in great choir in saying mr emilius doubt intended to allude to eloquence a preacher be man who must listen a well a sing be very careful to hear well that be being said in public about lady eustace diamond have learned thoroughly what be condition in reference to portray estate be rejoiced rather than otherwise to find that enjoyed only life interest in property have thing be better than be must have be further removed from reach in same way when rumour reached prejudicial to lizzie in respect of diamond perceived that such prejudice might work weal for gentleman once on ordering mackerel for dinner be told that fresh mackerel must come to shilling must have stale mackerel for sixpence then bring stale mackerel said gentleman mr emilius coveted fish be aware that position did not justify in expecting best fish on market lord fawn frank greystocks of world must be le likely to covet lizzie must by little indiscretion have placed under temporary cloud mr emilius have carefully observed heaven knew how quickly such cloud will disperse when be tinged with gold there be nothing lizzie have done must be likely to do must materially affect income might indeed be possible that eustaces must make pay for necklace even in case there must be quite enough left for modest unambitious comfort mr emilius desired be by preaching not by wealth that must make known in world for preacher to have pretty wife with title good income castle in scotland what elysium must be in such condition must envy dean bishop no archbishop thought great deal about saw positive bar to success told that be going to scotland not immediately exclaimed little boy be there said why must not little boy be here surely for people who can choose great centre of world offer attraction can not be found in secluded spot love seclusion said lizzie with rapture ah yes can believe that mr emilius have witnessed seclusion of portray castle have heard when there many story of ayrshire hunting be nature dear lady eustace will allow to say that nature be implanted in in accordance with fall do mean to say that be wicked to like to be in scotland better than in giddy town say nothing about wicked lady eustace do say that nature alone will not lead always aright be good to be at portray part of year no doubt be there not blessing in such congregation of humanity a london can not find at portray can hear preach mr emilius certainly hope be something too lady eustace otherwise great many people who kindly come to hear must sadly waste time example to world around be not more serviceable amidst crowd of london than in solitude of scotland there be more good to be done lady eustace by living among fellow creature than by deserting therefore think must not go to scotland before august must have little boy brought to here air of native mountain be everything to child said child have in fact be born at bobsborough that probably must make real difference can not wonder must plead for stay said mr emilius throwing soul into eye how dark must everything be to if missed from seat in house of praise prayer lizzie eustace like other lady who ought to be more appreciative be altogether deficient in what may perhaps be called good taste in reference to men though be clever though in spite of ignorance at once knew intelligent man from fool did not know difference between gentleman cad be in estimation something against mr emilius that be clergyman something against that have nothing what earned something against that be supposed to be renegade jew that nobody knew whence came who be deficiency drawback lizzie recognised be nothing against in judgment that be greasy fawning pawing creeping black browed rascal who must not look full in face whose word sounded like lie there be twang in voice ought to have told that be utterly untrustworthy there be oily pretence at earnestness in manner ought to have told that be not fit to associate with gentleman there be foulness of demeanour about ought to have given to a woman at rate brought up among lady abhorrence of society lizzie did not feel ridiculed to mr carbuncle idea of preacher courtship still thought that in teeth of misfortune must do better with than marry mr emilius conceived that man must be impertinent if mr carbuncle assertion be true be neither angry disgusted allowed to talk to even to make love to after nasty pseudo clerical fashion must surely still do better with than marry mr emilius be now twentieth of march fortnight have gone since intimation have be sent to from headquarters of police patience crabstick be in hand nothing further have occurred might be that patience crabstick have told tale against must not bring to believe that patience have tale to tell might be patience though be in hand of police must find to interest to tell tale against late mistress at rate there be silence quiet affair of diamond seemed almost to be passing out of people mind greystock have twice called in scotland yard have be able to learn nothing be feared said that people really engaged in robbery have got away scot free frank did not quite believe must learn nothing from thus encouraged lizzie determined that must remain in london till after lucinda marriage till after must have received promised letter from lord fawn a to though be so long in coming did not doubt that must come at last must hing with frank who be fool must hing with lord george who be brute lord fawn must still be within reach if only secret about diamond must be kept secret till after must have become wife about time lucinda spoke to respecting proposed journey be talking of going to scotland week ago lady eustace be still talking of aunt jane say that be waiting for wedding be very kind of pray do must think of going now till after marriage only want ten twelve day count know how many day want may want more than that ca put off now must think said lizzie a have ordered dress for occasion will certainly stay wear be very sorry for dress be very sorry for do know sometimes think will murder lucinda how can say anything so horrible see be only joking there did come ghastly smile over beautiful face be so seldom lighted up by expression of mirth good humour wish must not say such horrible thing must serve right if be to murder must serve right know that detest yet go on with have told so score of time nothing will make give up be not that love think that will be triumph why give up if make unhappy ought to come from ought not see why said lizzie be not bound to anybody a be bound to aunt one can have exacted oath from lady eustace quite understand how be situated

taken so that might be viewed by guest with name of donor attached to a of money given have be very much wanted indeed so that actual cheque must not be conveniently spared just at moment to pay for present ought to have be bought few very pretty thing be hired a to when donor must see name attached to must surely think that money given have be laid out to great advantage chapter lxvii eye of public took lord fawn long time to write letter at last wrote delay must not be taken a throwing slur on character a correspondent man of business for many irritating cause sprang up sufficient to justify in pleading that arose from circumstance beyond own control be moreover felt by that time may fairly be taken in performance of task depends not on amount of work on performance of when done man be not expected to write cheque for couple of thousand pound a readily a must one for five unless be man to whom couple of thousand pound be mere nothing to lord fawn writing of letter be everything have told lizzie with much exactness what must put into must again offer hand acknowledging bound to do so by former offer must give reason why must not accept if anything must occur in meantime must in opinion justify in again repudiating must of course take advantage of such circumstance if asked what be prevailing motive in that did intended to do must have declared that be above thing necessary that must put right in eye of british public be not able to do without interference from judgment of others mr mr hittaway interfered must not prevent from listening to believing though must contradict said snub theory frank greystock also continued to interfere lady glencora palliser even john eustace have be worked upon to write to lord fawn stating opinion a trustee for late brother property that eustace family did not think that there be ground of complaint against lady eustace in reference to diamond have be stolen be terrible blow to lord fawn have come no doubt from general agreement among eustace faction including bishop john eustace even mr camperdown that must be good thing to get widow married placed under decent control lady glencora absolutely have effrontery to ask whether marriage be not going to take place when day must be fixed gathered up courage to give ladyship rebuke private affair do seem to be uncommonly interesting said why yes lord fawn said lady glencora whom nothing must abash most interesting see dear lady eustace be so very popular that want to know what be to be fate regret to say can not answer ladyship question with precision said lord fawn hittaway persecution be by far worst have seen frederic said sister yes have have made promise dear clara be matter in must use own judgment family frederic think that member of family have just right to complain of conduct since have have honour of being head have endeavoured so to live that action must encounter private public censure if fail to meet with approbation will grieve can not on account act otherwise than in accordance with own judgment mr hittaway knew brother well be not afraid of be very well be sure know frederic how proud be of woman be nasty low scheming ill conducted dishonest little wretch if make wife will be miserable life nothing must make orlando so unhappy a to quarrel with know that be so to last minute will say so why ask to face about man down in scotland dear clara perhaps know what to ask what not to ask better than can tell brother in law be quite a bad fawn said in matter of lady eustace think ought to put conduct into hand of friend what do mean by think be affair in man must have so much comfort in being able to say that be guided by advice of course people want to marry now if must just tell that whole thing be in hand of say other friend must be relieved know of so much responsibility might hammer away at ever so long must care twopence if there be to be hammering can not be borne vicariously said lord fawn a said be quite pleased by own sharpness wit have indeed put beyond protection by vicarious endurance of hammering when promised to write to lady eustace explaining own conduct giving reason have anything turned up in scotland yard must have justified in saying even in thinking that lizzie have stolen own diamond must have sent word to that must abstain from communication till that matter have be cleared up since appearance of mysterious paragraph in newspaper nothing have be heard of robbery public opinion certainly seemed to be in favour of lizzie innocence did think that eustace faction be betraying a must not remember how eager mr camperdown have be in asserting that widow be keeping enormous amount of property claiming a own whereas in truth have not slightest title to be in great measure in consequence of assertion of eustace faction almost in obedience to advice that have resolved to break off match now turned upon john eustace absolutely went out of way to write letter be clearly meant to imply that lord fawn be bound to marry woman to whom have once engaged lord fawn felt that be ill used that man might have to undergo great deal of bad treatment who must strive to put right in eye of public at last wrote letter on wednesday with have something of comfort of half holiday a on day be not required to attend parliament india office th march dear lady eustace in accordance with promise made to when did honour of waiting upon in hertford street take up pen with view of communicating to result of deliberation respecting engagement of marriage doubt did exist between last summer since time have doubt taken upon to say that engagement be over be free to admit did so without assent agreement on part to effect such conduct doubt requires valid strong defence defence be a follows learned that be in possession of large amount of property vested in diamond be claimed by executor under late husband will a belonging to estate a to declared in most positive manner that have right title to consulted friend consulted lawyer be led to conviction that property certainly did not belong to have married in circumstance must not have become participator in lawsuit be assured must be commenced must not be participator with because believed to be in wrong certainly must not participate with who must in such case be attacking own wife in condition of thing requested a must think own with deference good feeling to give up actual possession of property to place diamond in neutral hand lord fawn be often called upon to be neutral in reference to condition of outlying indian principality till law must have decided a to ownership a regard neither coveted rejected possession of wealth for future wife desired simply to be free from embarrassment must have overwhelmed declined request not only positively perhaps may add peremptorily then be bound to adhere to decision have communicated to since time property have be stolen a believe dissipated lawsuit against have be withdrawn bone of contention so to say be no longer existing be no longer justified in declining to keep engagement because of prejudice to must have be subjected by possession of diamond therefore a far a go withdraw withdrawal lord fawn thought be rather happy phrase read aloud to more than once now there arises question whether in interest marriage must go on whether may not be more conducive to happiness to mine that must be annulled for cause altogether irrespective of diamond in matter so serious a marriage happiness of two party be that requires graver thought than other consideration there have doubt sprung up between feeling of mutual distrust have led to recrimination be hardly compatible with perfect confidence must exist between man wife first arose doubt from different view took a to property of have spoken a to judgment may possibly have be better than mine on head will add nothing to what have already said feeling have arisen fear can not be so perfectly allayed a to admit of reciprocal trust without must not live happily together confess that for own part now desire union be once great object of ambition must not go to altar with without fear trembling a to own feeling best know what be bring charge against if have ceased to love think must cease to wish to be wife that must not insist upon marriage simply because by doing so must triumph over former objection before finished paragraph thought much of andy gowran of scene among rock of have heard must not speak of have found unable to examine witness who have be brought to have honestly told that must not take charge a proved andy gowran might have lied in heart believed that andy gowran have lied matter be distasteful to must not touch yet knew that woman did not love

rob of acknowledge wish to dissuade a believe that must not make other happy a however do consider be bound to keep engagement to if demand that will do so leave matter in hand for decision be will remain sincere friend fawn read letter copied gave great credit for composition thought that be impossible that woman after reading must express wish to become wife of man who wrote yet so believed man woman must find fault with for writing there certainly be one view of case be very distressing how must be with if after must say that must marry after having given choice having put in writing

crabstick police must again interfere with prosperity chapter lxviii major lady eustace did not intend to take a much time in answering lord fawn letter a have taken in writing even found that subject be one demanded good deal of thought mr carbuncle have very freely recommended to take man supporting advice by argument lizzie felt to be valid then mr carbuncle did not know circumstance mr carbuncle have not actually seen lordship letter though great part of letter formal repetition namely of writer offer of marriage have be truly told to still a reader will have perceived have be kept in dark a to of detail lizzie did sit at desk with object of putting few word together in order that might see how looked found that there be difficulty dear lord fawn a have be engaged to marry other a friend have be told think that thing have better go on after various attempt be thought best letter that must send if must make up mind to be lady fawn on morning of th of march have not sent letter have told that must take two day to think of reply on friday morning few word have prepared be still lying in desk what be to get by marrying man absolutely disliked that also absolutely disliked be not matter much in thought man must not ill treat because disliked might perhaps be juster to say that ill treatment might fairly anticipate must not be of nature must much affect comfort grievously must not beat rob lock up starve must either neglect preach sermon to for first must console by attention of others must preach perhaps must preach too a sharply if not a lengthily a lordship at rate be not afraid of what must gain be very well to have rock a mr carbuncle have said rock be not everything did not know whether cared much for living upon rock even stability may be purchased at too high price there be not grain of poetry in whole composition of lord fawn poetry be what very soul craved poetry together with house champagne jewel admiration income be still own did not quite see that rock be so absolutely necessary to then wrote note to lord fawn specimen of note so that might have opportunity of comparing two note took much longer than one first written lord know how to acknowledge with sufficient humility condescension great kindness of lordship letter perhaps manly generosity be more conspicuous than truth be lord want to escape from engagement be too much afraid of consequence to dare to do so by act of own therefore throw upon be quite successful think ever read poetry perhaps may understand two following line be constrained to say lordship scullion must sooner be husband than see through despise thoroughly e eustace be comparing two answer together very much in doubt a to must be sent when there came message to by man whom knew to be policeman though did not announce a such be dressed in plain clothes major mackintosh sent compliment to must wait upon afternoon at three o'clock if must have kindness to receive at first moment of seeing man felt that after rock be what wanted mr carbuncle be right have have trouble might have more rock be thing then more certainly did become convinced of by presence of major messenger more clearly did see difficulty of attaining security rock offered if public exposure must fall upon lord fawn renewed offer a knew well must stand for nothing if once be known that have kept necklace own necklace under pillow at carlisle must want further justification in repudiating be for tenth time be very uncivil to messenger more so because found that man bore rudeness without turning upon rending when declared that police have behaved very badly that major mackintosh be inexcusable in troubling again that have ceased to care twopence about necklace man made remonstrance to petulance owned that trouble be very great police very inefficient almost owned that major be inexcusable did not care what owned so that achieved object when lizzie said that must not see major mackintosh at three objected equally to two four five then courteous messenger from scotland yard did say word to make understand that there must be meeting hinted also that major be doing most unusually good natured thing in coming to hertford street of course lizzie made appointment if major chose to come must be at home at three a soon a policeman be gone sat alone with manner very much changed from have worn since arrival of lord fawn letter with fresh weight of care upon greater perhaps than have ever hitherto borne have have bad moment when for instance have be taken before magistrate at carlisle when found police in house on return from theatre when lord george have forced secret from at of period hope have come renewed before despair have crushed her now seemed to that thing be done that game be over chief man of london police doubt knew whole story if must only already have climbed upon rock so that there might be man bound to defend man at rate bound to put forward on behalf do might be done in defence might have endured what must do now at minute looked at watch found that be already past one mr carbuncle a knew be closeted up stair with lucinda whose wedding be fixed for following monday be now friday be to call upon mr carbuncle for aid aid must be forthcoming unless be to tell whole truth almost thought that must do so then how great must have be indiscretion if after when major must come must discover that did not know truth that mr carbuncle must keep secret did not for moment think longed for comfort of friend counsel found at last that must not purchase by telling everything to woman might not be possible that must still run away did not know much of law thought that must not punish for breaking appointment even with man so high in authority a major mackintosh must leave note saying that pressing business called out whither must go thought of taking cab to house of common finding cousin telling everything must be so much better that must see major then again might be that must be mistaken a to amount of major information after while almost determined to fly off at once to scotland leaving word that be obliged to go instantly to child there be direct train to scotland before eight nine in evening during intervening hour police must have ample time to find what indeed must do with during intervening hour ah if have rock now so that need not be dependent altogether on exercise of own intellect gradually minute passed by became aware that must face major well what have done have stolen nothing have taken person property have indeed be wickedly robbed police have done nothing to get back for property a be bound to have done must take care to tell major what thought about negligence of police major must not have talk to if have not be for one word with lord george have stunned ear must still have borne well have told lie perhaps two three lie knew that have lied then people lie day must not have minded much if be simply to be called liar have told that must be accused of perjury there be something frightful to in name there be knew not what dreadful penalty attached to lord george have told that might be put in prison whether have said for year for month have forgotten thought have heard of people property being confiscated to crown when have be made out to be guilty of certain great offence oh how wished that have rock when three o'clock came have not started for scotland elsewhere at last received major must have thoroughly trusted servant must have denied at last moment feared that might be betrayed thought that position must be rendered even worse than be at present by futile attempt be sitting alone pale haggard trembling when major mackintosh be shown into room may be a well explained at once at moment major knew thought that knew circumstance of two robbery that surmise be in respect right miss crabstick mr cann be in comfortable quarter be prepared to tell that must tell mr smiler be in durance mr benjamin be at vienna in hand of austrian police who be prepared to give up to who desired society in england on completion of certain legal formality mr benjamin mr smiler must be prosecuted latter for robbery former for conspiracy to rob for receiving stolen good be matter of course what be to be done with lady eustace at present moment be prevailing trouble with police during last three week precaution have be taken to keep matter secret be hardly too much to say that lizzie interest be handled not only with consideration with tenderness lady eustace said major be very sorry to trouble doubt man who called on morning explained to who be oh yes know who be quite well lizzie made great effort to speak without betraying consternation be nearly prostrated major however hardly observed be by mean at ease in effort to save from unnecessary annoyance be tall thin gaunt man of about forty with large good natured eye be not till interview be half over lizzie took courage to look even into face just so be come know about robbery took place here other robbery at carlisle have be so troubled about horrid robbery sometimes think will be death of think lady eustace have found out whole truth oh daresay wonder why have be so long finding out have have very clever people to deal with lady eustace fear that even now will never get back property care about property sir although be own nobody have lost anything really see why thing must not die out a care about whoever be may have now be bound to get to bottom of if must think that have at last perhaps a say ought to have done sooner oh care have two person in custody lady eustace whom will use a witness be afraid will have to call upon also a witness occurred to lizzie that must not lock up in prison make witness too said nothing then major continued speech asked question be in fact alone material of course lady eustace be not bound to say anything to unless like must understand that by mean wish to criminate know what mean if yourself have done anything wrong want to ask to confess have have diamond stolen if mean that perhaps be wrong to have diamond to come to question suppose may take for granted that diamond be in desk when thief made entrance into house broke desk open stole money out of lizzie breathed so hardly that be quite unable to speak man voice be very gentle very kind then how must admit that one fact depended on one fact woman crabstick said major have confessed will state on oath that saw necklace in hand in hertford street that saw placed in desk then gave information of to benjamin a have before given information a to journey up from scotland be introduced to two men whom let into house one of indeed who will also give evidence for have before met at carlisle then be present when necklace be taken out of desk man who opened desk took out who also cut door at carlisle will give evidence to same effect man who carried necklace out of house who broke open box at carlisle will be tried a will also benjamin who disposed of diamond have told whole story a have be told to by woman crabstick of course will deny truth of if be untrue lizzie sat with eye fixed upon floor said nothing must not speak if will allow lady eustace to give advice really friendly advice oh pray do have better admit truth of story if be true be own whispered at rate believed that be there can be doubt think a to that one supposes that robbery at carlisle be arranged on behalf oh have taken out of box before went to bed at inn not then have taken did in morning before started from scotland frightened by saying box must be stolen exactly then put into desk here in house yes sir must tell lady eustace have not doubt about before came here for time past have thought that must be so latterly confession of two of accomplice have made certain to one of housebreaker jeweller will be tried for felony be afraid that must undergo annoyance of being one of witness what will do to major mackintosh lizzie now for first time looked up into eye felt that be kind must be rock did not speak to like enemy then too must know better than man alive how might best escape from trouble will ask to tell truth indeed will do said lizzie not aware that after so many lie might be difficult to tell truth will probably be asked to repeat way that in manner will be troublesome to see that here in london at carlisle have given incorrect version know have necklace be own there be nothing dishonest be there major mackintosh when came to at carlisle be so confused that hardly knew what to tell when have once given incorrect version know did know how to go back major be not so well acquainted with lizzie a be reader pitied can understand that said how much kinder be than lord george have be when confessed truth to here must be rock handsome man a be too not exactly corsair a be great in authority over london police powerful fine fellow who must know what to do with sword pistol a well a corsair one too doubt who must understand poetry such dream however be altogether unavailing a major have wife at home seven child if will only tell what to do will do said looking up into face with entreaty pressing hand together in supplication then at great length with much patience explained to what must have do thought that if be summoned used a witness there must be attempt to prosecute for incorrect version of have undoubtedly be guilty probability be that must receive assurance to effect before must be asked to give evidence preparatory to committal of benjamin smiler must not assure that must be so have doubt of in order however thing might be made to run a smooth a possible recommended very strongly to go at once to mr camperdown make clean breast of to whole family must be told said major will be better for that must know from than from when hesitated explained to that matter must no longer be kept a secret that evidence must certainly appear in paper proposed that must be summoned for day week must be friday after lucinda marriage suggested that must go to mr camperdown on morrow what to morrow exclaimed lizzie in dismay dear lady eustace said major sooner get back into straight running sooner will be comfortable then promised that must go on tuesday day after marriage if learns in meantime must not be surprised said major tell one thing major mackintosh said a gave hand at parting ca take away from anything be own can think can said major escaping rather quickly from room chapter lxix can not do saturday sunday lizzie passed in outward tranquillity though doubtless mind be greatly disturbed said nothing of what have passed between major mackintosh explaining that visit have be made solely with object of informing that mr benjamin be to be sent home from vienna that diamond be gone for ever have a declared to herself agreed with major mackintosh that must not go to mr camperdown till tuesday justifying delay by solicitude in reference to miss

when first heard that diamond have be stolen at carlisle be eager with mr eustace in contending that widow liability in regard to property be not at le because have managed to lose through own pig headed obstinacy consulted trusted friend mr dove on occasion making out case for barrister mr dove have opined that if must be first proved that diamond be property of estate not of lady eustace afterwards proved that have be stolen through laches then must eustace estate recover value from estate a have carried diamond about with in absurd manner responsibility might probably be established non existence of ownership by must be first declared by vice chancellor with probability of appeal to lord justice to house of lord bill in chancery must be filed in first place to have question of ownership settled then must estate be at length declared owner restitution of property have be lost through lady fault must be sought at common law have be opinion of turtle dove mr camperdown have at once submitted to law of great legal mentor john eustace have positively declared when heard that more money must be thrown away in looking after property must require two lawsuit to establish when

consented to be present be suggested to mr dove that might on so peculiar occasion a venture to depart from established rule visit attorney on own quarter deck smiled explained that though be altogether superior to such prejudice a must not object at to call on friend mr camperdown must good effect arise from doing so considered that be to be present on occasion must simply assist in

have seated at once began to talk about misfortune of unaccomplished marriage in very low voice hinted that from beginning to end there have be something wrong have always feared that alliance based on footing be so openly pecuniary declared that word pecuniary expressed meaning better than other epithet must not lead to matrimonial happiness know said that dear friend mr carbuncle have view of own quite distinct from niece happiness have greatest possible respect for mr carbuncle may say esteem be impossible to live long in degree of intimacy with mr carbuncle without seeing that be mercenary mercenary indeed be said lizzie have observed oh yes be so cast shadow over character otherwise have so much to charm be most insolent most ungrateful woman that ever heard of exclaimed lizzie with energy mr emilius opened eye did not contradict assertion a have mentioned name mr emilius must tell have done everything for woman know how treated down in scotland with splendid hospitality said mr emilius of course did not pay for anything there oh idea of one being called upon to pay for what one ate drank at friend house be peculiarly painful to mr emilius have paid for everything here be to say have made arrangement very much in favour have borrowed large sum of money from be not at surprised at said mr emilius when unfortunate girl niece be to be married to poor sir griffin tewett gave whole service of plate what unparalleled generosity must believe have taken whole for own base purpose then what do think have done dear lady eustace hardly anything must astonish lizzie suddenly found difficulty in describing to friend fact that mr carbuncle be endeavouring to turn out of house without also alluding to own trouble about robbery have actually told continued that must leave house without day warning believe truth be that have run so much into debt that can not remain know that be very much in debt lady eustace owed civility instead of have treated with nothing insolence why do think be because must not allow to take poor insane young woman to portray castle mean that asked to go there did though never heard such impertinence in life never said mr emilius again opening eye shaking head proposed must ask down to portray for for of course must have be almost for ever know how must have got rid of that poor young woman be mad know

must be nothing to one so enamoured a be mr emilius must not scruple to show at castle door without invitation whatever may have be deficiency mr emilius did not lack courage needed to carry enterprise a to happy conclusion a far a pluck courage might serve man be well served by own gift must without blush quiver in voice have asked duchess to marry with ten time lizzie income have now considered deeply whether with view of prevailing must be better that must allude to lady trespass in regard to diamond that must pretend to be in ignorance have determined that ultimate success might with most probability be achieved by bold declaration of truth know how desperately must be in want of one to help through trouble know also that grand lover will avoid because of what have done therefore have better take at once take will bring through everything refuse will help to crush such be argument mr emilius have determined to use language of course with modification be now

together between knee be dark hookey nosed well made man with exuberance of greasy hair who must have be considered handsome by many woman have there not be something almost amounting to squint amiss with one of eye when be preaching must hardly be seen in closeness of private conversation be disagreeable oh indeed said lizzie with look of astonishment perfectly well assumed have already begun to consider whether after mr emilius must do yes lady eustace be so have known other now for many month have received most unaffected pleasure from acquaintance may not say from intimacy have sprung up between lizzie did not forbid use of pleasant word merely bowed think that a devoted friend clergyman will not be thought to be intruding on private ground in saying that circumstance have made aware

prosecution then be turned over to very learned very acute gentleman whom mr benjamin have hired for defence rather to show cause why must not be sent for trial must be owned that poor lizzie did receive from hand of punishment certainly deserved acute learned gentleman seemed to posse for occasion blandest most dulcet voice that ever be bestowed upon english barrister addressed lady eustace

value of diamond dear dear husband have given from freeholder of parish in robbery have taken place feared that health did not admit of necessary exertion be otherwise must leave stone unturned to recover value of property not on account of value because have be so ill treated by mr camperdown police then added postscript to say that be quite out of question that must take journey for next six month reader need hardly be told that greystock did not believe word of what said felt sure that be not ill there be energy in letter hardly compatible with illness must not make come certainly did

must be enough to bring to speedy end if so much a thought of making journey up to london certificate to effect be got in triplicate one copy sent to attorney one to frank one kept matter be very pressing indeed be considered that trial must not be postponed till next sitting at criminal court because certain witness in respect to diamond have be procured from hamburg vienna at very great cost be actually on way to london when lizzie second letter be received mr camperdown have resolved to have diamond still with hope that might be restored to keeping of messrs garnett there to lie hidden unused at rate for next twenty year diamond have be traced first to hamburg then to vienna be to be proved that be now adorning bosom of certain enormously rich russian princess from grasp of russian princess be found impossible to rescue witness who a be hoped might have aided mr camperdown in effort be to be examined at trial confidential clerk be sent down to portray confidential clerk altogether failed in making way into lizzie presence word be brought to that nothing force must take lady eustace from bed chamber that force used to effect might take out dead certainly not alive

though be true a gospel clerk reported when got back to london to belief lady eustace be enjoying excellent state of health that be perfectly certain that must not appear a witness at trial anger felt by many person a to lizzie fraudulent obstinacy be intense mr camperdown thought that ought to be dragged up to london by cart rope attorney engaged for prosecution be almost beside did send down

prosecuted for perjury into bargain be firm wrote one scrap of note to doctor who came from london will not live to satisfy rabid vengeance even frank greystock felt almost more annoyed than gratified that must be able thus to escape people who have heard of inquiry before magistrate have postponed excitement interest on occasion because knew that day of trial must be great day when heard that be to be robbed of pleasure of lady eustace cross examination there arose almost public feeling of wrath that justice must be thus outraged doctor who have given certificate be vilified in newspaper long article be written a to impotence of law lizzie be successful trial went on without appeared that though evidence be very desirable be not absolutely essential a in consequence of certified illness statement have made at police court must be brought up used against prisoner fact of robbery be moreover proved by patience crabstick billy cann transfer of diamond by mr benjamin to man who recut at hamburg be also proved many other morsel of collateral evidence have also be picked up by police so that there be possible doubt a to detail of affair in hertford street there be rumour mr benjamin intended to plead guilty might perhaps have done so have not be for absence of lady eustace a be thought to give possible chance of escape stood ground lizzie absence be great disappointment to sight seer of london nevertheless court be crowded be understood that learned serjeant who be retained on occasion to defend mr benjamin who be assisted by acute gentleman who have appeared before magistrate must be rather severe upon lady eustace even in absence that must ground demand for acquittal on combined fact of retention of diamond perjury of obstinate refusal to come forward on present occasion a be known that must be very severe many came to hear be not disappointed reader will see portion of address to jury hope may have have salutary effect on lizzie a read in retreat at portray looking out upon own blue wave now gentleman of jury let recapitulate to history of lady a far a relates to diamond a to client be now in jeopardy have heard on testimony of mr camperdown that be not hers at at rate be not supposed to be hers by in whose hand be left administration of husband estate that when be first supposed to have be stolen at inn at carlisle have already commenced legal step for recovery of from clutch bill in chancery have be filed because have obstinately refused to allow to pas out of hand have be proved to by lord fawn though be engaged to marry broke engagement because supposed possession of diamond to be fraudulent dishonest examination have be terrible to unfortunate under secretary have absolutely driven away from india board from parliament for month have be proved to that when diamond be supposed to have vanished at carlisle there committed perjury that did so stated on oath in evidence gave before magistrate when client be committed have a maintain improperly illegally be used against client at trial here judge looked over spectacle admonished learned serjeant that argument on subject have already be heard matter decided true lord conviction of duty to client compels to revert to lady eustace committed perjury at carlisle having diamond in pocket at very moment in swore that have be stolen from if justice have really be done in case gentleman be lady eustace who must now be on trial before not unfortunate client well what be next that hear of seems that brought diamond up to london how long kept there nobody know be however necessary to account for robbery be got up between young woman who seems to have be confidential friend rather than maid of lady eustace that other witness whom have heard testifying against who be of informer ever came into hand most flippant most hardened least conscientious least credible that two be engaged in conspiracy can not doubt that lady eustace be engaged with will not say will ask to consider whether such may not probably have be case at rate then perjures again give list of article stolen from omits diamond perjures second time else diamond in regard to client be in jeopardy be not in house at must not then have be stolen may very probably have be so nothing more probable mr camperdown manager of eustace estate have gradually come to belief that carlisle robbery be hoax therefore robbery be necessary to account for diamond robbery be arranged young beautiful widow a bold a brass again go before magistrate swears diamond be not stolen else again commits second perjury now gentleman be not here be sick forsooth at own castle in scotland sends to medical certificate gentleman who be carrying on prosecution know witness believe word of sickness have feeling of woman in bosom ought indeed to be sick unto death know better send down doctor of own have heard evidence yet wonderful lady be not before say again that ought to be here in dock in dock in spite of fortune in dock in spite of title in dock in spite of castle rich beauty great relative most wonderful woman indeed be widow eustace be whom public opinion will convict a guilty one in marvellous mass of conspiracy intrigue in absence after what have done can convict man of stealing of disposing of diamond vigour attitude indignant tone of man be more even than word nevertheless jury did find benjamin smiler guilty judge did sentence to penal servitude for fifteen year be end of eustace diamond a far a anything be ever known of in england mr camperdown altogether failed even in attempt to buy back at something le than value be ashamed to look at figure when found how much money have wasted for client in pursuit in discussing matter afterwards with mr dove excused by asserting inability to see so gross robbery perpetrated by little minx under very eye without interfering with plunder knew what be said from moment of sir florian unfortunate marriage have brought little harpy into family be obliged to declare war against mr dove seemed to be of opinion that ultimate loss of diamond be upon whole desirable a regarded whole community must like to have have case settled a to right of possession said because there be in one two point of interest none of know for instance what man can what man can not give away by mere word such word be ever spoken said mr camperdown in wrath such evidence a there be must have gone to show that have be spoken very existence of such property so to be disposed of so not to be disposed of be in evil thus have have to fight for six month about lot of stone hardly so useful a flag in street then vanish from leaving nothing to repay for labour mr camperdown did not quite understand mr dove must be paid for labour a to however mr camperdown knew well that human being be more indifferent than mr dove there be much sorrow too among police have doubt succeeded in sending two scoundrel out of social world probably for life have succeeded in avoiding reproach great robbery unaccounted for always entail upon be sad to that property must altogether have be lost sad also that must have be constrained to allow billy cann to escape out of hand perhaps sadness may have be lessened to certain degree in breast of great mr gager by charm grace of patience crabstick to whom kept word by making wife fact rather prospect of fact a then be have also come to knowledge of learned serjeant in hand have served to add interest to trial mr gager when examined on subject did not attempt to deny impeachment expressed strong opinion that though miss crabstick have given way to temptation under wile of jew must make honest excellent wife in expectation let trust that may not be deceived amusement have indeed be expected from other source failed mr

become more so mr emilius lady eustace must thought sound very well must surely make way in society man have grasping ambition about capacity too combined must enable to preach into notoriety then in marrying mr emilius must determine to do so might be sure almost sure of dictating own term a to settlement with lord fawn with lord george even with cousin frank there must have be much difficulty thought that with mr emilius might obtain undisputed command of own income did not quite make up mind must see hear what have to say income be own must refuse mr emilius other suitor must doubt come

reader first knew have begun to use little colouring in arrangement of face now in honour of sickness be very pale indeed still through paleness there be faintest possible tinge of pink colour shining through translucent pearl powder one who knew lizzie must be sure that when did paint must paint well conversation be at first of course confined to lady health thought that be perhaps getting better though a doctor have told reassuring symptom might too probably only be too fallacious must eat nothing literally nothing few grape out of hothouse have supported for last week statement be foolish on lizzie part a mr emilius be man of inquiring nature there be not grape in garden only delight be in reading in child society sometimes thought that must pas away with boy in arm favourite volume of shelley in hand mr emilius expressed hope that must not pas away yet for ever so many year oh friend said lizzie what be life that one must desire mr emilius of course reminded that though life might be nothing to herself be very much indeed to who loved yes to boy said lizzie mr emilius informed with confidence that be not only boy that loved there be others at rate one other might be sure of one faithful heart if cared for lizzie only smiled threw from taper finger little paper pellet into middle of room probably with view of showing at what value priced heart of mr emilius be speaking trial have occupied two day monday tuesday be now wednesday result have be telegraphed to mr emilius of course without record of serjeant bitter speech suitor now gave news to lady love two horrid men have at last be found guilty punished with severity of law poor fellow said lady eustace poor mr benjamin ill starred jewel have be almost a unkind to a to will never come back alive of course said mr emilius will kill will kill too said lizzie have something here tell that will never recover nobody will ever believe what have suffered about paltry diamond coveted never coveted mr emilius though clung to because be darling husband last gift to mr emilius assured that quite understood fact appreciated feeling now a thought have come time for pressing suit with widow have be told wooing must be brisk have already once asked to be wife of course knew motive of journey to scotland dearest lady eustace said suddenly may be allowed to renew petition be once bold enough to make to in london petition exclaimed lizzie ah yes can well understand that indifference must enable to forget lady eustace did venture to tell that loved mr emilius so many men have told that can well believe have told so perhaps from base mercenary motif be very complimentary sir will never pay compliment lady eustace may be future intercourse in life will only hear word of truth from lip have told so from mercenary motif mr emilius repeated word with severity then paused to hear whether must dare to argue with a be silent changed voice went on with sweet oily tone have made fortune for doubt have spoken from inner depth of heart none lady eustace have spoken with such adamantine truth with so intense anxiety with so personal solicitude for welfare in world next a must rather say glow within bosom lizzie be certainly pleased by manner in addressed thought that man ought to dare to speak out that on occasion a must venture to do so with enthusiasm poetry considered that men generally be afraid of expressing be a dumb a dog from want of becoming spirit mr emilius gesticulated struck breast brought out word a though meant be easy to say mr emilius replied saying of be hard enough lady eustace can never know how hard be to speak from full heart to feel will not say be easy only to not to feel be impossible lady eustace heart be devoted to heart seek comrade be sick with love will not be stayed force from word word will return upon with bitterness of gall if be not accepted by a faithful ay of great value know well value of such heart a yours mr emilius accept then dearest one love will not always go by command mr emilius indeed at command will stay away do think have not tried that do believe that for man can be pleasant to be rebuffed that for one who up to day have always walked on triumphant over obstacle who have conquered nay have obstructed path can have le of bitterness than bitterness of death to encounter from lip of woman poor woman must be nothing to mr emilius be everything to death destruction annihilation unless can overcome darling of heart queen of soul empress presiding over very spirit of being say will overcome now have never be made love to after fashion before knew half knew that man be scheming hypocrite craving money following in hour of trouble because might then have best chance of success have belief whatever in love yet liked approved proceeding liked lie thinking to be more beautiful than truth to lie readily cleverly recklessly yet successfully be according to lesson have learned necessity in woman added grace in man there be that wretched macnulty who must never lie be result be unfit even for poor condition of life pretended to fill when poor macnulty have heard that mr emilius be coming to castle have not even mentioned name again when have be announced on very morning unfortunate woman have be unable to control absurd disappointment mr emilius lizzie said throwing back upon couch press very hard must press harder still to gain glory covet made motion with arm a though have already got tight within grasp take advantage of illness in attacking fortress besieger take advantage dear lady eustace allow to return to london with right of protecting name at moment in false thoughtless be attacking need defender now can defend from attack know that one can hurt god forbid that must be hurt heaven forbid even wind of heaven must blow too harshly on beloved beloved be subject to malice of world beloved be flower beautiful within without one whose stalk be weak whose petal be too delicate whose soft bloom be evanescent let be strong staff against beloved may blow in safety vague idea came across lizzie mind that glowing language have taste of bible about that therefore be in degree impersonal intended to be pious did not relish piety at crisis a be therefore for moment inclined to be cold liked being called flower be not quite sure whether remembered bible rightly word struck ear a familiar might have come from juan haidee if so nothing must be more opportune do expect to give answer now mr emilius yes now stood before in calm dignity with arm crossed upon breast did give answer then there first turned face to wall rather to back of sofa burst into flood of tear be delicious moment to that in be weeping sobbed forth something about child something about sorrow something a to wretchedness of lot in life something of widowed heart something also of duty to others must compel to keep income in own hand then yielded to entreaty that evening thought proper to tell miss macnulty what have occurred be great preacher of gospel said know position in world more worthy of woman fondest admiration miss macnulty be unable to answer word must not congratulate successful rival even though bread depended on crept slowly out of room went up stair wept early in month of june lady eustace be led to hymeneal altar by clerical bridegroom wedding took place at episcopal church at ayr far from eye of curious londoner need only be further said that mr emilius must be persuaded to agree to settlement prejudicial to marital supremacy must be attached to husband that lizzie when moment came knowing that betrothal have be made public to world did not dare to recede from engagement may be that mr emilius will suit a well a husband that must find unless will be found that previous career have be too adventurous after certain fashion will perhaps be tender to will have own way in everything be whit afraid when be about to die in agony of tear before eye writer of present story may however declare that future fate of lady will not be left altogether in obscurity chapter lxxx what be said about at matching whitsuntide holiday be late year not taking place till

matching lady whose society always gave gratification to duke mr palliser be also there taking rest be so needful to by must be understood that after having worked day be able to eat dinner then only write few letter before going to bed instead of attending house of common till two three o'clock in morning mind be still deep in quint semitenths great measure be even now in committee hundred second clause have be carried with only nine division against of consequence seven of most material clause have doubt be postponed great bone of contention a to two superfluous farthing still remained before nevertheless fondly hoped that must be able to send bill complete to house of lord before end of july what might be done in way of amendment there have hitherto refused to consider if peer choose to put in opposition to whole nation on purely commercial question responsibility of evil may follow must be at door have said a commoner year two at farthest more probably few month must make peer then doubt must look at matter in wholly different light worked at great measure with diligence at rate deserved success now have with whole bevy of secretary private secretary chief clerk accountant of whom lady glencora captivated by flattering way laughed at behind back mr bonteen be there with wife repeatedly declaring to friend that england must achieve glory of decimal coinage by blood over

escape whom did specially want to catch asked lady glencora lady eustace lord george de bruce carruthers a call quite agree with mr bonteen that must be very nice to send brother of marquis to botany bay wherever go now that must do deal of good to have widow of baronet locked up in penitentiary see if did happen to be guilty must be almost shame to punish for sake of example ought to have be guilty said barrington erle be guilty protested mr bonteen mr palliser be enjoying ten minute of recreation before went back to letter ca say attended to case very closely observed perhaps therefore be not entitled to speak about if people only spoke about what attended to how very little there must be to say eh mr bonteen observation came of course from lady glencora a far a must hear continued mr palliser lord george carruthers can not possibly have have anything to do with be stupid mistake on part of police be not quite so sure mr palliser said bonteen know coldfoot told so now sir harry

god send what must have done without lady glencora said almost to a prepared to join duke duke have only one more observation to make before retired for night be afraid know that friend have what call
