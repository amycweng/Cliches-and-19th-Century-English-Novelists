steamer though must not swear that have seen seven put into small boat mr greene said lady standing in middle of remaining treasure of be now open be worth nothing when travelling be not behind mr greene mind be full did not answer have be stolen before very eye continued nonsense mamma said sophonisba if ever came out of steamer certainly came into house saw out of steamer said mr greene certainly be not in house mr robinson may trouble to send for policeat once if please sir have be at bellaggio twice before nevertheless be ignorant of system of police then again did not know what be italian for word will speak to landlord said if will have goodness to send for police at once will be obliged to a thus reiterated command stamped with foot upon floor there be police at bellaggio said sophonisba what on earth will do for money to go on with said mr greene looking piteously up to ceiling shaking hand now whole house be in uproar including not only landlord wife daughter servant also other visitor at hotel mr greene be not lady who hid glory grief under bushel though spoke only in english soon made protestation sufficiently audible protested loudly that have be robbed that have be robbed since left steamer box have come on shore of be quite certain if landlord have regard either for own character for of house must ascertain before hour be over where be who have be thief must give hour then sat down in two minute be up again vociferating wrong a loudly a ever be filtered through sophonisba to waiter in french from waiter to landlord lady gesture required translation

what be to do for money said have not shilling to go on with still looked up at ceiling must send to england said sophonisba will take month replied mr robinson will let have what want at present added sophonisba now certainly have said so have meant at time whole travelling store did not exceed forty fifty pound with be going on to venice then back to england through tyrol waiting month for mr greene money from england might be even more inconvenient to than to then occurred to that want of greene family must be numerous expensive that small stock must go little way among so many what also if there have be money jewel in accursed box confess at moment such idea did strike mind one hears of sharper on side committing depredation by mean of most singular intrigue contrivance might not be possible that whole batch of greene belonged to order of society be base idea own confess entertained for moment retired to own room for while might think over circumstance there certainly have be seven box one have have hole in canvas seven have certainly be on board steamer to so much felt that might safely swear have not counted seven into small boat on leaving larger vessel have looked about deck to see that none of greene trapping be forgotten if left on steamer have be so left through intent on part of one there employed be quite possible that content of box have be ascertained through imprudence of mr greene that have be conveyed away so that might be rifled at como a to mr greene assertion that box have be put into small boat thought nothing of people at bellaggio must not have known box to steal have there be time to concoct plan in carrying box up to hotel came at last to conclusion that missing trunk have be purloined carried on to comoin case must be necessary to lose time in going after that have be put out of sight in uncommonly clever way by greene a excuse for borrowing a much money a must raise living without payment of bill with reference to latter hypothesis declared to myself that greene did not look like swindler a to mr greene confess did not feel so confident in regard to charity begin at home so proceeded to make comfortable in room feeling almost certain must not be able to leave bellaggio on following morning have opened portmanteau when first arrived leaving open on floor a be wont people be always being robbed be always

landlord hour to find box during time landlord landlady three daughter servant in house certainly did exert to utmost half dozen time came to door be luxuriating in washing tub making up for four oclock start from chiavenna assured however that box be not there so search passed by at end of hour went back to greene according to promise having resolved that one must be sent on to como to look after missing article there be necessity to knock at sitting room door for be wide open walked in found mr greene still engaged in attacking landlord while porter who have carried luggage up to house be standing round voice be loud above others luckily for be speaking english landlord saw be becoming sulky spoke in italian none of understood gathered that be declining to do anything further box be certain have never come out of steamer boot stood by interpreting into french acting a second interpreter put into english mr greene who be seated on sofa groaned audibly said nothing sophonisba who be sitting by beat upon floor with foot do hear mr greene said turning to do mean to allow vast amount of property to be lost without effort be prepared to replace jewel jewel said sophonisba looking up into face papa have to pay bill for stitch have when married last word be so spoken a to be audible only by first exclamation be loud enough be people for whom must be worth while to delay journey put to serious inconvenience with reference to money few minute afterwards found with greene on terrace before house what ought to do said go to como said look after box will remain here go on board return steamer may perhaps be there cant speak word of italian said take boot said cant speak word of french then ended in undertaking to go to como swear that thought struck might a well take
