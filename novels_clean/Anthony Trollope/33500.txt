dormer dosetts there have never be cordiality between first two latter wealth of tringles have seemed to convey with fetid odour egbert dormer with luxury around money must purchase have affected to despise heavy magnificence of tringles may be that affected fashion higher than tringles really attained reginald dosett who be brilliant fashionable be in truth independent perhaps little thin skinned must submit to touch of arrogance from sir thomas sir thomas seemed to carry arrogance in brow in paunch be there rather perhaps than in heart there be men to whom knack of fumbling money in pocket of looking out from under penthouse brow over expanse of waistcoat give air of overweening pride true idiosyncracies may not justify to dosett have perhaps be spoken word two on occasion have inwardly resented from thenceforward have ever be ready to league with dormer against bullionaire a agreed to call sir thomas lady tringle have even said word to sister mr dormer a to expense have never be forgiven by artist so thing be when mr dormer died first so remained when husband followed then there arose sudden necessity for action for while brought reginald dosett into connexion with sir thomas lady tringle something must be done for poor girl that something must come out of pocket of sir thomas must have seemed to be natural money with be object not at girl two must be nothing to a regarded simple expenditure care of human being be important matter so sir thomas knew dosett have not child at must be better for such windfall dosett supposed to be in dosett way fairly well off so made proposition must take one girl let dosett take other to lady tringle added proviso that must have choice to nerve affair of taste be of such paramount importance to dosett yielded matter be decided in lady tringle back drawing room mr dosett be not even consulted in matter of choice having already acknowledged duty of mothering motherless child dosett have thought that bullionaire must have said word a to future provision for penniless girl for whom must be able to do so little sir thomas have said such word dosett lacked courage coarseness to allude to matter then lady tringle declared that must have ayala so matter be settled ayala romantic ayala poetic be matter of course that ayala must be chosen ayala have already be made intimate with magnificent saloon of tringles

have already begun to say that be born to be one great female artist of world hand foot figure be perfect though be a yet nineteen london have already begun to talk about ayala dormer of course lady

old enough to know something of meaning of such choice ayala younger be to be adopted into immense wealth lucy be to be given up to comparative poverty knew nothing of uncle dosett circumstance genteel house at notting hill kingsbury crescent be known to be poor affair a compared even with bijou in have hitherto lived aunt dosett never rose to vehicle beyond four wheeler be careful even in thinking of accommodation ayala must be whirled about park by wire wig pair of brown horse have heard said be not to be matched in london ayala must be carried with aunt cousin to show room of madame tonsonville great french milliner of bond street whereas lucy might too probably be called on to make own gown fashion of queen gate something perhaps of fashion of eaton square must be open to ayala lucy understood enough to know ayala own charm might probably cause still more august gate to be opened to whereas aunt dosett entered gate be quite natural that ayala must be chosen lucy acknowledged a much to herself be sister have be so near by what chasm must be dissevered now so far asunder lucy herself be lovely girl knew own loveliness be fairer than ayala somewhat taller much more quiet in

new raiment will always be found for mourning family everything about lucy be nearly new need of repairing must come upon by degree have not come a yet therefore there have seemed to anxious aunt to be necessity for such question a above will do anything like aunt said lucy be not for dear get through deal of work be obliged to do so be at time sitting with sheet in lap be turning lucy have indeed once offered to assist assistance have be rejected have be two day since have not renewed proposal a must have done have be mainly from bashfulness though work must certainly be distasteful to must do have not liked to seem to interfere not having a yet fallen into way of intimacy with aunt want to burden with task work continued mr dosett be afraid seem to be listless be reading till just before spoke said lucy again turning eye to little volume of poetry be one of few treasure have brought away with from old home reading be very well like a excuse lucy lucy anger boiled within when be told of excuse declared to herself that must never like aunt be quite sure that for young girl a well a for old woman there must be great deal of waste time unless there be needle thread always about know too unless lady be well off can not afford to waste time more than gentleman in whole course of life nothing so much like scolding a have ever be addressed to so at least thought lucy at moment mr dosett have intended remark in good part thinking to be simply fitting from aunt to niece be duty to give advice for giving of such advice day must be taken a beginning have purposely allowed week to run by now have spoken word a thought in good season to lucy be new most bitter experience though be reading idyll of king pretending to read be in truth thinking of have gone from mind have at moment be intent upon mother who in respect have be so different from careful sheet darning housewife of woman in thinking of mother there have doubt be regret for many thing of must not have ventured to speak a sharing thought with memory of mother be nevertheless there to add darkness to retrospective everything behind have be so bright everything behind have gone away from everything before be so gloomy everything before must last for so long after aunt lecture about wasted time lucy sat silent for few minute then burst into uncontrolled tear did not mean to vex said aunt be thinking of darling darling mamma sobbed lucy of course lucy will think of how must not of father be sorrow must be borne sorrow such a be much lighter to busy than to idle sometimes think that labourer grieve le for love than do just because have not time to grieve wish be labourer then said lucy through tear may be if will sooner begin to be labourer better for yourself for about that aunt dosett voice be harsh be not fault that in obduracy of daily life have lost much of original softness have simply meant to be useful to do duty in telling lucy that must be better that labouring must be commenced at once for sake of about who must only be aunt dosett have seemed to girl to be harsh selfish almost unnatural volume of poetry fell from hand jumped up from chair quickly give at once said taking hold of sheet be not pleasant object lucy have never seen thing at bijou give at once said clawed long fold of linen nearly out of aunt lap did not mean anything of kind said aunt dosett must not take up in way be speaking only for good because know that must not dawdle away existence leave sheet lucy did leave sheet then sobbing violently ran out of room up to own chamber mr dosett determined that must not follow partly forgave girl because of sorrow partly reminded that be not soft facile a have be sister in law lucy mother then a continued work assured that must be best to let niece have cry out upstairs lucy violence have astonished for moment have taught to think best to allow such little ebullition to pas off by lucy when be alone flung upon bed in absolute agony thought that have misbehaved yet how cruel how harsh have be aunt word if quiet one have misbehaved what must ayala have done how be to find strength with to look forward to future struggled hard with for resolution must determine that must henceforward darn sheet morning noon night till worked finger to bone perhaps there have be something of truth in assertion of aunt that labourer have time to grieve a everything else be shut out from might be well for to darn sheet must rush down penitent beg aunt to allow to commence at once must have done a far a sheet be concerned must not do a regarded aunt must put into unison with crumpled soiled linen not with hard woman oh how terrible be change father mother who have be so gentle to sweet prettiness of life occupation friend delight even ayala be gone from how be to bear begrudged ayala nothing no nothing yet be hard ayala be to have everything aunt emmeline though have not hitherto be very fond of aunt emmeline be sweetness a compared with woman sooner begin to labour better for yourself about must not have be fitter that must have be sent at once to actual poor house in there must have be mistake a to position that must have be decided for for ayala not by will of own not by concert between simply by fantasy of why must thus be made slave to fantasy of one let ayala have uncle wealth aunt palace at command must walk out simply pauper into world into workhouse so at least need not be obedient to harsh voice odious common sense of aunt dosett how must take to workhouse in what way must prove right to be admitted even then seemed to that same decree have admitted ayala into golden hall of fairy have doomed not only to poverty to slavery there be escape for from aunt aunt sermon oh ayala darling own one oh ayala if did know said to herself what must ayala think how must ayala bear must guess by what gulf be heaven divided from sister hell will never tell said to herself will die will never know a lay there sobbing gilded thing of world be beautiful in eye ala yes be true magnificence of mansion at queen gate glory of glenbogie closely studied comfort of merle park a place in sussex be called carriage horse madame tonsonville drapery seat at albert hall into have be accustomed to go with a much ease a into bed room box at opera pretty furniture frequent gem even raiment must make pleasing to eye of men whom must like to please thing grew in eye became beautiful kingsbury crescent be surely of place on earth surface most ugly yet yet have endeavoured to do duty if have be workhouse must have borne said to herself not to be slave of aunt dosett again appealed to sister oh ayala if did know then remembered declaring that might have be worse to ayala than even to if one have to bear be better for said a struggled to prepare for uncle dinner chapter iii lucy trouble evening after affair with sheet went off quietly a did many day many evening mr dosett be wise enough to forget little violence to forget also feeling have be displayed when lucy first asked for household needlework did with faltering voice shame faced remembrance of fault aunt took all in good part gave task somewhat lighter a beginning than handling of sheet lucy sat at suffered went on sitting suffering told that be martyr at stitch made a occupied seat opposite to aunt accustomed chair must hardly speak at must keep mind always intent on ayala joy of ayala life that who have be born together sister with equal fortune who have so closely lived together must be sundered so utterly one from other that one must be so exalted other so debased why what justice have there be must be from heaven even from earth that law have gone forth for division of thing of world between have got very little to say to person said aunt dosett one morning too be reproach too be scolding yet aunt dosett have intended to be a pleasant a knew how have very little to say replied lucy with repressed anger why because be stupid said lucy stupid people ca talk must have have ayala hope envy ayala fortune lucy woman with tact must not have asked question at time must have felt that touch of such irony might be natural that unless be expressed loudly shown actively might be left to be suppressed by affection time a have grown old have taught to bear disappointment thought wise to teach lucy to do same envy said lucy not passionately after little pause for thought sometimes think be very hard to know what envy be envy hatred malice said mr dosett hardly knowing what meant by use of well worn word do know what hatred malice be said lucy do think hate ayala be sure that bear malice certainly not if have power to take anything from must do love ayala with whole heart be misery must rather bear than let ayala have even share of good thing may have must not rob even of part of if there be joy sorrow to be divided between must wish to have sorrow so that might have joy be not hatred malice mr dosett looked at over spectacle be girl who have declared that must not speak because be too stupid when ask whether envy hardly know continued lucy think one doe covet one neighbour house in spite of tenth commandment even though one doe not want to steal mr dosett repented that have given rise to conversation at silence absolute silence old silence have known for dozen year before lucy have come to must have be better than be very angry more angry than have ever yet be with lucy yet be afraid to show anger be girl gratitude for that uncle be doing for for shelter food comfort for have in world mr dosett knew though lucy did not of little increased pinchings have be made necessary by advent of inmate in house so many pound of meat in week so much bread so much tea sugar have be calculated in genteel house such calculation must often be made when by degree degree very quick garment must become worn lucy have brought with there must be something taken from tight fitting income for need arrangement have already be made of lucy knew nothing already two glass of port wine day have be knocked off from poor mr dosett comfort wife have sobbed in despair when have said that must be so have declared gin water to be a supporting a port wine thing have be done lucy inwardly have be disgusted by gin water knowing nothing of history father who have not always be punctual in paying wine merchant bill must not have touched gin water must not have allowed to contaminate table everything in mr dosett house be paid for weekly now lucy who have be made welcome to that genteel house must afford who have be taken in a child have spoken of lot a one be sorrowful bad a be living in kingsbury crescent must rather bear than subject ayala to such misery be thus that have in fact spoken of new home when have found necessary to defend feeling towards sister be impossible that aunt must be altogether silent under such treatment have done best for be in power lucy said with whole load of reproach in tone have complained aunt thought did oh asked whether envied ayala what be to say perhaps must have said nothing idea of envying ayala be painful to of course well have better say nothing more aunt if be to pretend to be cheerful must be false be a yet only few week since papa died then work went on in silence between for next hour work went on in solemn silence between through winter

scenery of glenbogie colour of moor glorious height of ben alchan made amends even in sorrow must rave about beauty of glenbogie lucy a read letter told that ayala grief be grief to be borne grief almost to be enjoyed to sit be sad with stream purling by how different from sadness of dining room in crescent to look out upon glory of mountain while tear must now again force into eye how much le bitter than falling of salt drop over tattered towel lucy in answer endeavoured to repress groan of spirit in first place did acknowledge that did not become to speak ill of who be in truth benefactor then be anxious not to declare to ayala feeling of injustice by two lot have be defined to though have failed to control once twice in speaking to aunt did control in writing letter must never never

seemed to be kingsbury crescent aunt dosett did not occur to to think whether in possible case ayala must indeed be added to crescent family what in case must become of whether two might live with aunt dosett whether in case life must not be infinitely improved ayala have that money must do for must have such look out into world from wealthy house a might be sure at last to bring such husband a must be desirable ayala in fact have everything before lucy have nothing wherefore became be duty to warn ayala so that must bear with much throw away nothing if ayala must only know what life might be what life be at kingsbury crescent then must be patient then must softly make confidence with aunt a to tom folly then must propitiate augusta not care for money ayala have not yet lived in ugly room darned sheet morning ayala have never sat for two hour between slumber of uncle dosett knitting of aunt dosett ayala have not be brought into contact with gin water oh ayala said a be going down to dinner together do struggle do bear tell aunt emmeline will like to tell if augusta want to go anywhere do go what doe signify papa mamma be gone be alone said without word of allusion to own suffering ayala made half promise did not think must go anywhere for augusta telling must do best to satisfy aunt emmeline then went to dinner after dinner lucy be taken home without further word between ayala wrote long letter on journey full of what saw full of companion from paris wrote then from turin then again on immediate arrival at rome letter be most imprudent a written from close vicinity of aunt cousin be such comfort that oaf tom have be left behind uncle tringle be angry because did not get what liked to eat aunt emmeline gave that courier terrible life sending for quarter of hour augusta must talk first french then italian of one must understand word gertrude be so sick with travelling that be a pale a sheet nobody seemed to care for anything must not get aunt to look at campanile at florence cousin to know one picture from a for picture be quite sure that mangle angel must do a well a raffael mangle be brother academician whom father have taught to despise there be contempt most foolish contempt for tringles luckily there have be no quarrelling then seemed that in paris in florence ayala have bought pretty thing from be to be argued that uncle have provided liberally with money one pretty thing have be sent from paris to lucy must not have be bought for le than many frank must not be fair that ayala must take so much without giving something in return lucy knew that too must give something in return though kingsbury crescent be not attractive though aunt dosett be not to pleasant companion have begun to realise fact that behoved to be grateful if only for food ate for bed on slept a thought of ayala owed remembered also own debt a winter went on struggled to pay aunt dosett be lady not much given to vacillation have become aware at first that lucy have be rough to did not easily open to lucy endearment lucy life at kingsbury crescent have begun badly lucy though understood much about found hard to turn bad beginning to good result chapter iv isadore hamel be suggested to lucy before have be long in kingsbury crescent that must take exercise for first week have hardly be out of house be attributed to sorrow then have accompanied aunt for few day during half hour marketing took place morning in there have be no sympathy lucy must not interest in shoulder of mutton must be of just weight a to last conveniently for two day twelve pound of be explained to more than one half be intended for two servant because there be always more lavish consumption in kitchen than in parlour lucy must not appreciate fact that egg at penny piece might be must be used for pudding a egg with even reputation of freshness cost twopence aunt dosett beyond never left house on week day except for few call be made perhaps once month on occasion sunday glove sunday silk dress be used on sunday went to church be not enough for exercise a lucy be becoming pale be recommended to take to walking in kensington garden be generally understood that there be raging lion about metropolis who must certainly eat up young lady whole if young lady be to walk about street even about park by there be however beginning to be vacillation a to received belief on subject a regard london in large continental town such a paris vienna young lady must be devoured certainly such at least be creed in new york washington there be supposed to be lion so that young lady go about free a air in london there be rising doubt under before long probably lion will succumb altogether mr dosett did believe somewhat in lion believed also in exercise be aware that lion eat up chiefly rich people young lady who must go about without mother brother uncle carriage attendant of sort be not often eaten even roared at be dainty darling for whom roaring have to be feared mr dosett aware that daintiness be no longer within reach of hers did assent to walking in kensington garden at hour in afternoon lucy must walk from house by herself within quarter of hour must find on broad gravel path lead down to round pond from thence must go by back of albert memorial then across by serpentine return to same gate never leaving kensington garden aunt dosett have expressed old fashioned idea that lion be more likely to roar in hyde park than within comparatively retired purlieu of kensington now reader must be taken back for few moment to bijou a bijou be before artist wife have died in day there have be frequent concourse of people in artist house society there have not consisted chiefly of eating drinking men woman must come in out a though really for purpose of talking there must be three four constantly with dormer in studio helping little perhaps in real furtherance of work though discussing art subject in manner calculated to keep alive art feeling among novelist two of morning might perhaps aid in general pursuit must think interfere with actual tally of page egbert dormer did not turn out from hand so much work a men know be overflowing with art up to ear with tobacco so upon whole bijou be pleasant rendezvous there have come there of late quite of late young sculptor named isadore hamel hamel be englishman who however have be carried very early to rome have be bred there of mother question never be made father have be well known a english sculptor resident at rome elder hamel have be man of mark who have fine suite of room in city villa on one of lake who never came to england english connection be said to abominable by perhaps meant that restriction of decent life be not to taste bust came group in marble now again great work for public decoration so money be plentiful with be man of note must be acknowledged of that spared nothing in bringing up son giving such education a might best suit future career a artist money be always forthcoming for lad want fantasy then young hamel also became sculptor of much promise early in life differed from father on certain subject of importance father be wedded to rome to italy isadore gradually expressed opinion that nearer man be to market better for that art must do for man in rome be a nothing to position great artist might make for in london that in fact englishman have better be englishman at twenty six succeeded in attempt became known a young sculptor with workshop at brompton became known to many by work acquirement may not be surprising that after year be still unable to live a have be taught to live without drawing upon father then father threw failure in teeth not refusing money indeed making receipt of unpleasant to at house have isadore hamel be made so welcome a at dormer there be sympathy between on great question of art whether to artist art must be matter to of more importance than world besides so said dormer who simply died because wife died who must not have touched brush if one of girl have be suffering who with genius be faineant workman art more than world to no not to perhaps here again to enthusiast hardly removed from madness where be painter who will paint picture after soul longing though will get not penny for though will starve a put last touch to when know that by drawing duchess of day will in fortnight earn ducal price will wife child be le dear to than to lawyer to shoemaker very craving of hunger le obdurate man self what have within belonging with outlook for other world let that be first work noble otherwise be second to be honest be greater than to have painted san sisto to have chiselled apollo to have assisted in making others honest infinitely greater of be discussed at great length at bijou bijouites always sided with master of house to artist said dormer let art be everything above wife child above money above health above even character then must put out hand with jewelled finger stretch forth velvet clad arm soon after lead friend away to little dinner at luxury have be spared young hamel agreed with sermon not le because lucy dormer have sat by listened to with rapt attention not word of love have be spoken to by sculptor when mother died there have be glance little feeling of be half conscious be so hard for young man to speak of love if there be real love so impossible that girl must do so not word have be spoken have thought that other must have known to lucy word have be spoken by mother think too much of till know mother have said not quite prudently oh will think of not at lucy have replied have thought of day night wonder why mr hamel be so different with ayala have said to sister be sure be not different with lucy have replied then ayala have shaken full lock smiled thing came quickly after mr dormer have sickened died there be time then for thinking of handsome brow of short jet black hair of eye so full of fire thoughtfulness of perfect mouth deep yet soft voice still even in sorrow new god of idolatry be not altogether forgotten be told to that have be summoned off to rome by father wondered whether be to find home at rome for ever then father be ill in illness hamel came to say one word of farewell before started find crushed to ground painter said something young man whispered a to consolation time must bring not to said dormer be a though one have lost eye one can not see without eye be true of light have be put out then on landing at top of stair there have be one word between lucy sculptor ought not to have intruded on perhaps said after so much kindness must hardly go without word be sure will be glad that have come be glad too so that may say good bye then put out hand held for moment a looked into eye there be not word more seemed to lucy a though there have be so many word thing went on quickly egbert dormer died lucy be taken away to kingsbury crescent when once ayala have spoken about mr hamel lucy have silenced allusion to idea of love wounded a though be too impossible for dream too holy for word how must there be word about lover when father mother be dead have gone to old natural home have gone of course must not return to ayala when came up to london early in november to ayala who be going to rome where isadore hamel now be isadore hamel name be not mentioned through long morning of life through long evening through long night still thought of must not keep from thinking to girl whose life be full of delight lover need not be so very much need not at least be everything though be lover to be loved at point friend will be something dancing horse theatre going brother sister even father mother lucy have nothing vision of isadore hamel have passed across life have left with only possession that have need hardly be said that never alluded to possession at kingsbury crescent be not possession from enjoyment must come except of thinking of have passed away from there be point of life at must come across again there be longer that half joint studio if have be lot to be a be ayala then must have be taken to rome then again must have looked into eye taken hand in then perhaps now even though be to come back to london must know nothing of haunt even in case nothing must bring together a idea be crossing mind a did cross so frequently saw turning from path on be walking making way towards step of memorial though saw more than back be sure that be isadore hamel for moment there be impulse on to run after to call name be then early in january be taking daily walk through kensington garden have walked there daily now for last two month have never spoken word be addressed have never seen face that have recognised have seemed to that have not acquaintance in world except uncle reg aunt dosett now almost within reach of hand be one being in world whom most longed to see did stand word be formed within lip must not speak then came thought that must run after thought be expelled quickly though might lose again for ever must not do that stood almost gasping till be out of sight then passed on upon usual round never omitted walk after always paused moment a path turned away to memorial be not that thought that might meet there there rather than elsewhere there be present to often idea when object have passed from that have desired then may be seen again day after day week after week did not see during time there came letter from ayala saying that return to england be postponed till first week in february that must certainly see lucy in february that be not going to be hurried through london in hour because aunt wished that must do a pleased a to visiting sister then there be word two about tom oh tom that idiot tom word two about augusta augusta be worse than ever have not spoken to other for last day two came day two before intended return of tringles actual day have be fixed on day before on lucy thought probable that tringles might return to town be again walking in garden having put two two together a people do felt sure that traveller must not be away more than day two longer mind be much intent upon ayala feeling that imprudent girl be subjecting to great danger knowing that be wrong that augusta must be together in house without speaking thinking of sister peril when of sudden hamel be close before there be question of calling to now question of attempt to see face to face have be wandering along path with eye fixed upon ground when name be sharply called two be close to other hamel have friend with seemed to lucy at once that must only bow to only mutter something then pas on how can girl stand speak to gentleman in public especially when gentleman have friend with tried to look pleasant bowed smiled muttered something be passing on be not minded to lose thus immediately miss dormer said have seen sister at rome may not say word about why must not say word about ayala in minute have left friend be walking back along path with lucy there be not much that have to say about ayala have seen ayala tringles did manage to let escape that lady tringle have not be very gracious to when once in public have claimed acquaintance with ayala at that simply smiled then have asked of lucy where lived with uncle mr dosett said lucy at kingsbury crescent then when asked whether might call lucy with many blush have said that aunt did not receive many visitor that uncle house be different from what father have be will not see at then asked did not like to ask after own purpose of life whether be now resident in london whether intended to return to rome be covered with bashfulness dreaded to seem even to be interested in affair oh yes said perhaps may meet day here asked oh not here be only accident a said determined that must walk more in kensington garden must be dreadful indeed be to imagine that must consent to make appointment with immediately occurred to that lion be about that must shut up have thought of day since have be back said did not know where to hear of now that have met be to lose again lose what did mean by losing too have found friend who have be so friendless must not be dreadful to also to lose be there place where may ask of when ayala be back be in town perhaps will sometimes be at lady tringle said lucy resolved that must not tell of immediate abode be at rate certain address from where might commence further inquiry must wish to make inquiry a such accepted think have better go now said lucy trembling at apparent impropriety of present conversation knew that be intended that must leave went hope have not offended in coming so far oh then again gave hand again there be same look a took leave when got home be before dusk having resolved that must at rate tell aunt that have met friend found that uncle have returned from office be most unusual occurrence uncle knew left somerset house exactly at half past four always took hour quarter for walk have never seen in kingsbury crescent till quarter before six have got letter from rome said in solemn voice from ayala one from ayala for be here have have one from sister also one in course of day from uncle in lombard street have better read there be something terribly tragic in uncle dosett voice a spoke so must reader read letter must be delayed for few chapter chapter v at glenbogie must go back to ayala life during autumn winter be rapidly whirled away to glenbogie affectionate welcomings of aunt cousin manner of good thing be done for a to present comfort young a be have money given to be not without attraction though be of course in depth of mourning be made to understand that even mourning might be made becoming if expense be spared expense among tringles ever be spared at first ayala liked bounty of profusion before end of first fortnight there grew upon feeling even bank note become tawdry if be taught to use a curl paper may be said that nothing in world be charming unless be achieved at trouble if rained ' leoville regard a most divine of nectar feel sure must never raise to lip ayala did not argue matter out in mind in very early day began to entertain dislike to tringle magnificence there have be good deal of luxury at bijou always with feeling that ought not to be there that more money be being spent than prudence authorised have certainly added savour to luxury lovely bonnet be not more lovely because destined wearer know that there be wickedness in achieving bonnet claret horse seemed to come at queen gate at glenbogie without wickedness there be more question about than a to one ordinary bread butter at breakfast sir thomas have way merit will call fault of pouring out wealth upon family a though be water running in perpetuity from mountain tarn ayala romantic ayala poetic found very soon that did not like perhaps only pleasure left to very rich be that of thinking of deprivation of poor bonnet claret horse have lost charm gladstone old hat four wheeled cab of neighbour still have little flavour for from source seemed to ayala that tringles drew much of recreation of life sir thomas have way of enjoying amusement be way did not specially come beneath ayala notice when heard that break at last huddersfield manufacturer have to sell picture that shoddy stuffgoods grand doings for last two year have only be flash in pan did not understand enough about to feel wounded when heard aunt say that people like poodle have better not have place in scotland than have to let when augusta hinted that lady sophia smallware have pawned diamond then felt that nearest dearest relative smelt abominably of money of family sir thomas be most persistently kindest to though be man who did not look to be kind be pretty though be ugly liked to look at thing pretty be too perhaps little tired of own wife daughter who be indeed what have made still be not quite to taste in general way gave instruction that ayala must be treated exactly a daughter informed wife that intended to add codicil to will on behalf be that necessary asked lady tringle who began to feel something like natural jealousy suppose ought to do something for girl if take by hand said sir thomas roughly if get husband will give something will do a well nothing more be said about when sir thomas went up to town codicil be added to will ayala be foolish rather than ungrateful not understanding nature of family to be relegated before have be taken away have promised lucy that must be obedient to aunt there have hardly be word a obedience known at bijou if be obedient be mother father to daughter lucy ayala a well have understood something of therefore ayala have promised to be obedient to aunt to uncle thomas lucy have demanded with imploring embrace oh yes said ayala dreading uncle at time soon learned that obedience whatsoever be exacted from sir thomas have to kiss morning evening then to take present made easy uncle be to deal with almost learned to love be aunt emmeline very exigeant though be fantastic sometimes disagreeable augusta be great difficulty lucy have not told to obey augusta augusta must not obey now augusta demanded obedience never ordered ayala have said to lucy when met in london a tringles be passing through at bijou there have be republic in inhabitant visitor have be free equal such republicanism have be very mainspring of life at bijou ayala loved equality specially felt that must exist among sister do anything for lucy oh yes indeed anything abandon anything for lucy a sister among sister not for elder a from younger if be not bound to serve lucy then certainly not augusta augusta liked to be served on one occasion sent ayala upstairs on sent ayala down stair ayala went determined to be equal with cousin on morning following in presence of aunt emmeline of gertrude in presence also of two other lady who be visiting at house asked augusta if must mind running upstairs fetching scrap book have be thinking about night morning plucking up courage have be determined found great difficulty in saying word said thing be so preposterous that lady in room looked aghast at proposition really think that augusta have got something else to do said aunt emmeline oh very well said ayala then be silent augusta who be employed on silk purse sat still did not say word have great secret rather great piece of news pervaded family be previously communicated to ayala must not probably have made so insane suggestion augusta be engaged to be married to honourable septimus traffick member for port glasgow young lady who be already bride be not supposed to run up down stair a readily a mere girl for running up down stair at bijou ayala have be proverbial be family who ran up down with greatest alacrity oh papa basket be out on seat for there have be seat in two foot garden behind house papa must go down in two jump come up with three skip there be basket only because girl liked to do something for for ayala must run about a though be tricksy ariel have important matrimonial news be conveyed to ariel with true girl spirit must have felt that during present period augusta be entitled to special exemption from ordering have be engaged must have run more quicker than ever must have be excited thereto by peculiar vitality of new prospect to even augusta must be subservient because of appreciation of bridal importance however have not be told till afternoon must not have asked augusta to go up stair said aunt emmeline in tone of mitigated reproach oh did know said ayala have meant to say that because have sent be to send there be difference know did know said ayala beginning to think that must fight battle if told of such difference a believed to exist have meant to tell before may a well tell now augusta be engaged to be married to honourable mr septimus traffick be second son of lord boardotrade be in house dear said ayala acknowledging at once within heart that difference alleged be one against need not rouse to fight aunt emmeline have in truth intended to insist on difference courage have failed yes indeed be man very much thought of just now in public life augusta mind be naturally much occupied writes letter in time about supply demand doe aunt ayala did feel that if augusta mind be entirely occupied with supply demand ought not to be made to go upstairs to fetch scrap book have doubt about augusta mind nevertheless if forthcoming husband be true might be reason if anybody have told before must have asked said then lady tringle explained that have be thought better not to say anything heretofore a to coming matrimonial hilarity because of sadness have fallen upon dormer family ayala accepted a excuse nothing further be said a to iniquity of request to cousin there be general feeling among woman ayala in lieu of gratitude have exhibited intention of rebelling on next day mr traffick arrived whose coming have probably made necessary that news must be told ayala be never so surprised in life a when saw have never yet have lover of own have never dreamed of lover have own idea a to what lover ought to be have thought that isadore hamel must be very nice lover for sister hamel be young handsome with great deal to say on general subject a art too bashful to talk easily to girl admired ayala have thought that be just a must be be altogether resolved that hamel sister must be lover be determined to be devoted to future brother in law honourable septimus traffick be question to whether uncle tringle must not have be better a lover yet there be nothing amiss about mr traffick be very much like ordinary hard working member of house of common over perhaps rather than under forty year of age be somewhat bald somewhat grey somewhat fat have lost that look of rosy plumpness be seldom fear compatible with hard work late hour be not particularly ugly be absurd in appearance looked to be disciple of business not of pleasure of art to sit out on bank of stream have beside one must not be particularly nice thought ayala to herself mr traffick doubt must have enjoyed very well if must have spared time to ayala seemed that man a must have cared nothing for love a soon a saw realised in mind fact that augusta be to become wife felt at once absurdity of sending augusta on message augusta that evening be somewhat more than ordinarily kind to cousin now that great secret be told cousin doubt must recognise importance suppose have not heard of before said to ayala never did be because have not attended to debate never have be debate mr traffick be very much thought of in house of common on subject affecting commerce oh be most glorious study world affords house of common think can be equal to art then augusta turned up nose with double turn first a against painter mr dormer having be more then at ayala ignorance in supposing that house of common must have be spoken of a study mr traffick will probably be in government day said have not be yet asked ayala not yet then wo be very old before get there be terrible question young lady of five twenty when marry gentleman of four fifty make up mind for well understood well recognised old age see that have best declare purpose do declare of course mr walker be old enough to be father have made up mind that like better than anything else then wall have be jumped thing can go smoothly at forty five there be supposed to be so much of youth left that difference of age may possibly be tided over not made to appear abnormal augusta tringle have determined to tide over in way forty five have be gradually reduced to le than forty though peerage be there to give lie to assertion talked of lover a septimus be quite prepared to sit with beside stream if only hour for amusement must be found when therefore ayala suggested that if lover wanted to get into office have better do so quickly lest must be too old augusta be not well pleased lord boardotrade be much older when began said augusta friend indeed tell septimus that must not push forward too quickly think that ever came across one who be so ignorant of such thing a be ayala perhaps be not so old a look said ayala after may be imagined that there be not close friendship between cousin augusta mind be filled with strong conception a to ayala ingratitude houseless penniless orphan have be taken in have done nothing make disagreeable young doubt be young have be a old a methuselah must not have be more insolent did not however matter to augusta be going away must be terrible to mamma to gertrude thus be that augusta spoke of cousin to mother then there came trouble be more troublesome to ayala even than other tom tringle who be in house in lombard street who be only son heir to title doubt to much of wealth have chosen to take ayala part to enlist a special friend ayala have at first accepted a cousin have consented to fraternise with then on unfortunate day there have be word look have failed not to understand immediately have become afraid of tom tom be not like isadore hamel be very far indeed from idea of perfect lover ayala mind have conceived be by mean lout oaf idiot a ayala in letter to sister have described have be first at eton then at oxford having spent great deal of money recklessly done little towards education have be withdrawn put into office father declared of now that must do fairly well in world have taste for dress kept four five hunter got little credit by riding made fuss about shooting did not shoot much be stout awkward looking very like father without settled air age give to heavy men in appearance be not sort of lover to satisfy preconception of such girl a ayala be good natured true at last became to terribly true love such a seemed at first be absurd to if make fool tom will never speak to again have said once even after have not understood that be more than stupid joke joke while be considered a such be very distasteful to afterwards when certain earnestness in be driven in upon became worse than distasteful repudiated love with such power a have must not silence must not at understand that young man who seemed to to be oaf must really be in love honestly in love with such be case then became afraid lest others must see afraid though often told that must appeal to aunt for protection tell care bit about ought to go on said did go on though aunt did not see augusta did then augusta spoke word to in scorn ayala said must not encourage tom encourage what word from one girl to what world of wrong there be in idea have created word what absence of sort of feeling according to ayala theory of life there must be on such matter between two sister two cousin two friend encourage when augusta ought to have be first to assist in trouble oh augusta said turning sharply round what spiteful creature be suppose think so because choose to approve approve of what tom be thoroughly disagreeable sometimes make life burden to that think will have to go to aunt be worse oh exclaimed ayala shuddering a thought of unwomanly treachery of cousin be guilty towards nothing more came of at glenbogie tom be required in lombard street matter be not suspected by aunt emmeline a far at least a ayala be aware when be gone be to a though there must be world of time before must see again be to go to rome must not be at rome till january before might have forgotten folly ayala be quite determined that must never forget ill office of augusta did hate augusta a have told sister then in frame of mind family be taken to rome chapter vi at rome during journeying during sojourn at rome ayala did enjoy much even joy did not come to without causing trouble of spirit at glenbogie everybody have known that be dependent niece that a such be in truth nobody on morning when have ordered augusta to go upstairs two visitor have stared with amazement who must not have stared at have heard ayala ordered in same way came about in rome ayala be almost of more importance than tringles be absolutely true that lady tringle augusta gertrude be asked here there because of ayala worst of be that fact be at last suspected by tringles sometimes must not always be asked one of tringle girl must only be named be never forgotten once twice effort be made by grand lady whose taste be perhaps more conspicuous than good nature to get ayala without burdening with of tringles when became clear to mind of augusta of augusta engaged a be to honourable septimus traffick member of parliament augusta feeling be such a may better be understood than described let go mamma said to lady tringle one morning marchesa have made point of bother marchesa who be marchesa believe be ayala doing because expects to meet that mr hamel be dreadful to see way go on mr hamel be very intimate friend of father believe bit of certainly used to be at house remember seeing daresay doe justify ayala in running after a doe believe that about marchesa be because of mr hamel be better than believing that ayala be to be asked to sing that ayala be to be feted admired danced with simply because ayala be ayala that tringles in spite of glenbogie merle park queen gate be not wanted at when aunt emmeline signified to ayala on particular morning have better not go to marchesa picnic ayala simply said that have promised ayala went at time gentleman of family be with sir thomas have gone tom tringle have not come then just at christmas honourable septimus traffick came for short visit very short visit no more than four five day because supply demand be requiring service in preparation for coming session of parliament for five halcyon day be prepared to devote to glory of rome under guidance of augusta did not of course sleep at palazzo ruperti where delighted lady tringle to inform friend in rome that have suite of apartment au premiere ate there drank there almost lived there so that became absolutely necessary to inform world of rome that be augusta destiny to become in course of time honourable mr traffick otherwise close intimacy must hardly have be discreet unless have be thought a ill natured marchesa have hinted that mr traffick be lady tringle elder brother augusta however be by mean ashamed of lover perhaps felt that when be known that be about to be bride of so great man then door must be open for at rate a wide a for cousin at moment be very important to herself be about to convey le sum than l to mr traffick who in truth a younger son of lord boardotrade be not well endowed considering own position future husband rank standing did not know how young woman must well be more important be very important at rate to mr traffick be sure of when therefore learned that ayala have be asked to grand ball at marchesa that mr traffick be also to be among guest that none of tringles have be invited then anger became hot must have be very stupid when took into head to be jealous of mr traffick attention to cousin stupid at rate when thought that cousin be laying out feminine lure for mr traffick poor ayala will see much of in page may be well to declare of at once that idea at moment about men rather about possible man be confined altogether to abstract have floating in young mind fancy a to beauty of love that there must be hero must of course be necessary in day dream hero be almost celestial at least aethereal be concentration of poetic perfection to there be not a yet appanage of apparel of feature of wealth be something out of heaven must think well to spend whole time in adoring making more blessed than have ever yet be woman upon earth then first approach to mundane feeling have be acknowledgment to herself that isadore hamel must do a lover for lucy isadore hamel be certainly very handsome be possessed of infinite good gift even must by mean have come up to requirement for own hero that hero must have wing tinged with azure whereas hamel have not much more aetherealised than ordinary coat waistcoat knew that hero with azure wing be not existent save in imagination a desired real lover for lucy hamel must do for imagination be too valuable then to allow to put foot upon earth such a be must not augusta have be very stupid to have thought that ayala must become fond of mr traffick cousin tom have come to have be to a newfoundland dog be when jump over just when have come out of horsepond must have liked tom have kept dog like gambol at proper distance when must cover with muddy water be abominable augusta have not understood with mr traffick there must be dog like gambol a be not harsh to ayala liked have liked uncle such men be to thinking more like dog than lover sang when mr traffick asked made picture for went with to coliseum laughed at about supply demand be very pretty perhaps mr traffick did like to look at really think be too free with mr traffick last night augusta said to one morning free how free be laughing at oh like that said ayala time be up at top of st peter be quizzing about speech let say just what please be wormwood in first place there have be word two between lover about going up of st peter augusta have refused to join have wished septimus to remain down with must have be tantamount to preventing of party from going up septimus have persisted on ascending then augusta have be left for long hour alone with mother gertrude have doubt gone up gertrude have lagged during ascent ayala have skipped up interminable stair mr traffick have trotted after with admiring breathless industry with thought of good time septimus might be having at top be very bad now to be told that ayala must laugh at that septimus must like suppose take to be child said augusta if be child ought to conduct suppose doe perceive difference said ayala have not in least known what word might convey have probably meant nothing to augusta be apparent that ayala have declared that lover septimus have preferred extreme youth to more mature charm of own true love have perhaps preferred ayala raillery to augusta serious demeanour be most impertinent person ever knew in life said augusta rising from chair walking slowly out of room ayala stared after not above half comprehending cause of anger then came very serious affair of ball marchesa have asked that dear little friend ayala dormer might be allowed to come over to little dance own girl be going to have own girl be so fond of ayala there must be trouble there be carriage must be going somewhere else must be fetched taken home ayala at once declared that intended to go aunt emmeline did not refuse sanction augusta be shocked declaring that little dance be to be one of great ball of season pronouncing whole to be falsehood affair be arranged before must stop mr traffick affair in matter came more within range septimus said must rather must not go to woman party septimus have be asked only on day before party a soon indeed a arrival have become known to marchesa why own one have not treated mamma well yet ayala be going have right to call ayala so augusta thought cousin be behaving badly in matter mamma

that accusation about mr traffick be absurd truth be said gertrude that ayala think very clever very beautiful augusta will not stand gertrude acknowledged that ayala be upsetting ungrateful poor lady tringle in husband absence did not know what to do about niece altogether be uncomfortable after mr traffick went before tom tringle have come on consideration whatsoever must augusta speak to cousin declared that ayala be viper must give other reason in such quarrelings matter most distressing be that evil can not be hidden everybody at rome who knew tringles who knew ayala be aware that augusta tringle must not speak to cousin when ayala be asked must shake lock open eye declare that knew nothing about in truth knew very little about remembered that passage at arm about going upstairs at glenbogie must hardly understand for so small affront one so distant augusta must now refuse to speak to that augusta have always be angry with since mr traffick arrival more angry than ever have felt that augusta be jealous in respect to lover have never yet at come home to ayala that must have wanted to captivate mr traffick with high idea of transcendental more than human hero have to put up with to think of have sense enough to know that be more than stranger in aunt family that must go if made unpleasant to be aware that hitherto have not succeeded with residence among perhaps might have to go thing must bear in must endeavour to amend conduct in other matter must hold own go if necessary though young imagination be still full of unsubstantial hero though still have castle in air altogether incapable of terrestrial foundation still there be common sense about told that must give take must endeavour to submit to aunt must be kind a have always be kind to gertrude must in matter obey uncle misfortune with newfoundland dog have almost dwindled out of mind to augusta must not submit then augusta a soon a next session of parliament must be over must be married out of way on own

though have first appeared to cousin ayala a newfoundland dog might perhaps be pleasantly playful then a same dog very unpleasant because dripping with muddy water be nevertheless young man with so much manly truth about a to be very much in love did not look like then perhaps young men who do fall most absolutely into love look like to ayala cousin tom be a unloveable a mr septimus traffick must like well enough while must be kind to a to regarding cousin tom a lover idea be so preposterous to that must not imagine that one else must look upon a real with tom idea have be real be

sister determination never to speak to ayala again for time aunt emmeline have almost taken niece part feeling that might best bring thing back to condition of peace in manner ayala have thought might thus be decoyed into state of submission ayala so instigated have made attempt what be matter augusta have said that be determined to quarrel with then have followed little offer that bygone must be bygone have quarrelled with said augusta because know how to behave then ayala have flashed forth little attempt led to worse condition than ever word be spoken even aunt emmeline have felt to be

romantic dreamy poetic childish a be knew a much a go away tom fool must no longer do for occasion a thought of night be borne in upon more strongly than ever that only protection must be in telling aunt in getting aunt to make tom understand that there must be more of early on following morning found in aunt bedroom chapter viii lout aunt emmeline want to read letter so be that ayala commenced interview at moment ayala be not on much better term with aunt than be with cousin augusta ayala be trouble to lady tringle who be altogether perplexed with feeling that have burdened with inmate in house who be distasteful to of whom must not rid ayala have turned out on hand something altogether different from girl have intended to cherish patronise ayala be independent superior rather than inferior to own girl more thought of by others apparently without touch of subservience must have be produced in by position ayala seemed to demand a much a though be daughter of house at same time to carry a though be more gifted than daughter of house be le obedient even than daughter aunt emmeline must not endure with placid bosom be kind of heart acknowledged duty to dead sister wished to protect foster orphan did not even yet wish to punish ayala by utter desertion must protect in opposition to augusta more declared malignity did wish to be rid of ayala if only knew how took son letter read a matter of course misunderstood position at glenbogie something have be whispered to about tom ayala have not believed much in ayala be child tom be to not much more than boy now here be genuine love letter letter in son have made distinct proposition to marry orphan did not stop to consider why ayala have brought letter to entertained at once idea that two young people be going to vex very soul by lamentable love affair how imprudent have be to let two young people be together in rome seeing that matter have be whispered to at glenbogie how long have be going on asked severely used to tease at glenbogie now be doing again said ayala there must certainly be put end to must go away ayala knew at once that aunt be angry with be indignant at injustice of course there must be put end to aunt emmeline have no right to annoy when tell not suppose have encouraged be too cruel to be borne encouraged ayala anger be caused not so much by feeling that aunt have misappreciated cause of coming a that must have be thought possible that must have encouraged lover be outrage to taste rather than to conduct afflicted be lout said stupid lout thus casting scorn upon mother a well a on son indeed upon whole family have not encouraged be untrue ayala be very impertinent be very unjust because want to put stop to come to tell that encourage be worse than augusta be too much for good nature even of aunt emmeline may have be truth a to love affair however innocent ayala may have be in matter however guilty tom such word from niece to aunt from dependent to superior be unpardonable extreme youthfulness of girl peculiar look of childhood still have with made feeling so much stronger be worse than augusta be said to who be specially conscious of endeavour to mitigate augusta just anger bridled up tried to look big knit brow at moment must not think what must be end of felt that ayala must be crushed how dare speak to like beiss ' said so be be very cruel tom will go on saying nonsense to when come to say encourage never encouraged despise too much did not think own aunt must have told that encouraged man did drive to so that have got to be impertinent have better go to room said aunt then ayala lifting head a high a knew how walked towards door have better leave that letter with ayala considered matter for moment then handed letter second time to aunt must be nothing to who saw letter did not want having thus given up stalked off in silent disdain went to chamber aunt emmeline when be left alone felt to be enveloped in cloud of doubt desirableness of tom a husband first forced upon attention undesirableness of ayala a wife for tom be perplexed at own folly in not having seen that danger of kind must arise when first proposed to take ayala into house aunt uncle like marriage of cousin parent of rich child a rule approve of marriage with be poor although ayala have be so violent lady tringle must not rid herself of idea that darling boy be going to throw away then cheek became red with anger a remembered that tom have be called lout stupid lout there be ingratitude in use of such language be not alleviated even by remembrance that tended against matrimonial danger of be so much afraid ayala be behaving very badly ought not to have coaxed tom to be lover certainly ought not to have called tom lout then ayala have told aunt that be unjust worse than augusta be out of question that state of thing must be endured ayala must be made to go away before day be over lady tringle spoke to son be astonished to find that lout be quite in earnest so much in earnest that declared purpose of marrying cousin in opposition to father mother in opposition even to ayala be so much in earnest that must not be roused to wrath even when be told that ayala have called lout then grew upon mother feeling that young man have never be so little loutish before for there have be even in maternal bosom feeling that tom be open to criticism expressed on tom have be hobble de hoy one of overgrown lad who come late to manhood who be regarded by young lady a lout though have spent money only too freely when away sister have sometimes said that must not say bo to goose at home now now tom be quite altered young man when own letter be shown to simply said that meant to stick to when be represented to that cousin must be quite unfit wife for assured mother that own opinion on matter be very different when father anger be threatened declared that father must have right to be angry with if married lady at word lout simply smiled will come to think different from before be done with said with smile even mother must not perceive that young man have be much improved by love what be to do two three day went on during there be reconciliation between ayala between augusta ayala word be spoken message be taken to by gertrude object of be to induce to ask aunt pardon ayala be of opinion that aunt ought to ask pardon must not be beaten from why did say that encouraged demanded indignantly of gertrude think did encourage said gertrude to mother might possibly be true not le have misbehaved though might not yet have encouraged lover be only too probable that might do so when found that lover be quite in earnest lady tringle be much harassed then there came additional trouble gertrude informed mother that have engaged to mr francis houston that mr houston be going to write to father with object of proposing a son in law mr houston came also to herself told in most natural tone in world that intended to marry daughter have not known what to say be sir thomas who managed matter of money have idea mr houston be very poor then so also have be mr traffick who have be received into family with open arm then mr traffick have career whereas mr houston be lamentably idle must only refer mr houston to sir thomas beg not to come among more till sir thomas have decided upon gertrude also got angry shut up in room apartment ruperti be therefore upon whole uncomfortable home to letter upon letter be written to sir thomas letter upon letter came first letter have be about ayala have be much more tender towards ayala than aunt have be talked of calf love said that tom be fool have not at once thought necessary to give imperative order for tom return a to ayala impudence evidently regarded a nothing be not till aunt emmeline have spoken out in third letter that seemed to recognise possibility of getting rid of ayala altogether did in answer to suggestion have be made to if like to change with sister lucy like will not object said sir thomas then there came order to tom that must return to lombard street at once order have be rendered abortive by sudden return of whole family sir thomas in first letter a to gertrude have declared that houston marriage must not do at then when be told that gertrude mr houston have certainly met other more than once since order have be given for separation desired whole family to come back at once to merle park proposition a to lucy have arisen in wise tom being in same house with ayala of course have very much at advantage must carry on suit in spite of abuse might lavish upon be quite in vain that called lout will think very different from of day ayala said more seriously sha will think always same when know how much love will change want to love said if be anything be good must go on after have told so often be not manly of have brought to manner of trouble be fault make suffer after ayala again went to aunt on occasion family misfortune be discussed in more seemly language ayala be still indignant said nothing insolent aunt emmeline be still averse to niece abstained from crimination knew a enemy recognised wisdom of keeping peace a for aunt emmeline ayala said may be quite sure that will never encourage will never like well enough very well then need say more about dear of course must be unpleasant to being in same house together be very unpleasant to when will go on bothering like that make wish be anywhere else then aunt emmeline began to think about very seriously be very unpleasant ayala have made disagreeable to lady of family only too agreeable to young gentleman did manifest favour of sir thomas do much towards raising ayala in lady tringle estimation sir thomas have only laughed when augusta have be requested to go upstairs for scrap book sir thomas have be profuse with present even when ayala have be most persistent in misbehaviour then that affair of marchesa even mr traffick infatuation if ayala wished that be somewhere else must not be well to indulge wish aunt emmeline certainly wished if think so perhaps arrangement can be made said aunt emmeline very slowly what arrangement must not suppose that wish to turn out what arrangement see ayala that unfortunately have not of hit off nicely have not at aunt emmeline augusta be always angry with think have encouraged tom be saying nothing about ayala what arrangement be aunt emmeline matter be one of fearful import to ayala be prudent enough to understand well arrangement must be one by must be banished from wealth of tringles coming among have not be success have already made tired of by petulance independence young a be must see comprehend material injury have done herself by folly have be very wrong in telling augusta to go upstairs have be wrong in triumph of exclusive visit to marchesa have be wrong in walking away with mr traffick on pincian must see that have not be wrong in regard to tom except in calling lout whether wrong right have be most unfortunate thing have be done must go at moment wealth of tringles seemed to be more to than have ever be before own poverty destitution seemed to be more absolute when word arrangement be whispered to there came upon clear idea of be to lose be to be banished from merle park from queen gate from glenbogie for there be to be no more carriage horse pretty trinket none of abandon of luxury of money among tringles lived have done for herself must not say word in opposition to fate be before what arrangement aunt said again in voice be intended to

tenderness a remembered how much after have be done for a wished to go there must be not word not sign of unwillingness on part then perhaps can be arranged said lady tringle know what uncle dosett may say perhaps be very fond of lucy now must wish to stand in way must think at rate wo if uncle aunt margaret will consent will go whenever choose of course must do just a be told aunt emmeline made faint demur to still matter be held to be arranged letter be written to sir thomas letter came at last even sir thomas have assented suggested in first place that fact must follow exchange must be explained to ayala be obliged after while to acknowledge that must be inexpedient girl be willing knew doubt that be to give up great wealth of present home have proved to be unfit participator be better that must go then departure of from rome be hurried on by indiscretion of gertrude gertrude declared that have right to lover a to having income what matter for everyone knew that septimus

voice so that looked spoke a lucy have not seen heard before there be people apparently so hard so ungenial so unsympathetic that who only half know expect trait of tenderness think that feature so little alluring can not be compatible with softness lucy have acknowledged aunt dosett to be good believed to be incapable of being touched word two have now conquered girl did not want to leave did not seize first opportunity of running from poverty to splendour of tringles lucy said came placed nearer to lucy on bed ayala said lucy sobbing will be kind to perhaps kinder than have be to have be

to devote to hard work on next morning ayala went out with aunt on round to shopkeeper listened with profound attention to domestic instruction be given to on occasion when came home knew much of have known nothing before what be price of mutton how much mutton be expected a one of family to eat per week be necessity of house in bread butter how far pint of milk might be stretched with proper

for future chapter xi tom tringle come to crescent during next three month up to end of winter through early spring thing went on without change either in queen gate kingsbury crescent sister saw other occasionally not a frequently a of have intended lucy be not encouraged in use of cab be carriage lent to often for purpose of going to crescent reader may remember that have be in habit of walking alone in kensington garden walk across kensington garden must carry greater part of distance to kingsbury crescent lucy in new circumstance be not advised perhaps may say be not allowed to walk alone lady tringle being lady of rank wealth be afraid pretended to be afraid of lion poor ayala be really afraid of lion thus came to pas that intercourse be not frequent in daily life lucy be quiet obedient did not run counter to augusta whose approaching nuptials gave that predominance in house be always accorded to young lady in recognised position gertrude be at time subject of trouble at queen gate sir thomas have not be got to approve of mr frank houston gertrude have positively refused to give up sir thomas be indeed considerably troubled by child there have be period of disagreeable obstinacy even with augusta before mr traffick have be taken into bosom of family now gertrude have own idea so also have tom tom have become quite trouble sir thomas lady tringle together have determined that tom must be weaned by meant that must be cured of love tom have altogether refused to be weaned mr dosett have be requested to deny admittance to house in kingsbury crescent a request have be fully endorsed by ayala order have be given to effect to parlour maid tom have called more than once have be unable to obtain access to beloved yet resolutely refused to be weaned told father to face that intended to marry ayala abused mother roundly when attempted to interfere whole family be astounded by perseverance so that there have already sprung up idea in mind of among tringles that must be successful at last augusta be very firm declaring that ayala be viper sir thomas began to inquire within own bosom whether tom must not be allowed to settle down in manner desired by in consultation held at queen gate on subject be there slightest expression of opinion that tom might be denied opportunity of settling down a wished through unwillingness on part of ayala when thing be in position tom sought interview one morning with father in lombard street rarely saw other at office having own peculiar branch of business sir thomas manipulated million in little back room of own while tom dealing probably with limited thousand made useful in outer room never went to left office together sir thomas always took care to know that son be be not on premise want to say word two sir about about little affair of mine said tom what affair said sir thomas looking up from million think must like to marry best thing can do boy only depends upon who young lady may be mind be made up about sir mean to marry cousin see why young man be to choose for then sir thomas preached sermon preached in manner men be wont to use when know that be preaching in vain there be tone of refusal though word used may be manifestly enough word of denial be in indicative of assent sir thomas ended conference by taking week to think over matter when week be over gave way be still inclined to think that marriage with cousin have better be avoided gave way at last promised that if tom ayala be of one mind income must be forthcoming for carrying out of purpose be necessary that door of uncle dosett house must be unlocked with object of turning key sir thomas called at admiralty find boy be quite in earnest about said to admiralty clerk oh indeed ca say quite like mr dosett must only shake head cousin have better be cousin nothing more then must probably expect to get money not at said sir thomas proudly have got money enough for be affair of money to make long story short have given consent therefore if mind will be glad if will allow tom to call at crescent of course may have own view suppose can hope to do better for girl cousin do marry know very often mr dosett must only say that must not expect to do anything for girl nearly so good that a far a be concerned nephew tom must be made quite welcome at kingsbury crescent be not added in power to answer for ayala a to sir thomas did not seem to have doubt good thing of world be in power to offer be so good that be hardly probable that young lady in ayala position must refuse dear said aunt margaret next morning speaking in most suasive tone cousin tom be to be allowed to call here tom tringle yes dear sir thomas have consented then have better not said ayala bristling up in hot anger uncle tom have got nothing to do with in refusing consenting wo see think must see if call want oh aunt margaret pray make not come like bit be doing so very well be not aunt margaret certainly dear be doing very well at least hope so be old enough now to understand that be very serious matter of course be serious said ayala who certainly be not guilty of fault of making light of future life dream of hers in be contained hope aspiration be very serious to be so much case that have by mean thought of cousin tom in light spirit a though be matter of moment to be to just what beast must have be to beauty when beast first began to be in love safety have consisted in fact that one have approved of beast being in love with now must understand that horror of oppression might fall upon of course be serious not le be resolved that nothing must induce to marry beast think ought to see when come to remember how different will be when come with approval of father be of course saying that be ready to welcome a daughter want to be anybody daughter ayala there be so many thing to be thought of here be young man who be able to give not only comfort great opulence want to be opulent will be baronet care about baronet aunt margaret will have house of own in may be of service to sister have rather must have house tom be not in love with lucy be such lout aunt margaret wo have anything to say to must great deal sooner die uncle tom have right to send here have got rid of be very glad of be fair that must come after now that be gone away must uncle reginald tell to stay away great deal more be said nothing be said have slightest effect on ayala when be told of dependent position of splendour of prospect offered declared that must rather go into poor house than marry cousin when be told that tom be good natured honest true declared that good nature honesty truth have nothing to do with when be asked what be that looked forward to in world must merely sob say that there be nothing must not tell even sister lucy of dream castle how then must explain to aunt margaret how must make aunt understand that there must be place in heart for tom tringle seeing that be to be kept in reserve for angel of light who must surely make appearance in due season who must still be there present to a angel of light even must never show in flesh how vain be to talk of tom tringle to when have so visible before eye that angel of light with whom be compelled to compare though must not be brought to say that must listen patiently to story be nevertheless made to understand that must see when came to aunt margaret be very full on subject young man who be approved of by young lady friend who have mean at command be in mr dosett opinion entitled to hearing how otherwise be properly authorised marriage to be made up arranged when be going on there be in slight degree diminished sympathy between ayala aunt ayala still continued household duty over in privacy of own room groaned sadly continued in silence aunt upon whom have counted be thought turning against mr dosett on other hand declared to herself that girl be romantic silly husband with immediate comfort prospect of almost unlimited wealth be not to be found under hedge what right must girl so dependent a ayala have to refuse eligible match therefore in way became advocate on behalf of tom a did also uncle reginald more mildly uncle reginald merely remarked that tom be attending to business be great thing in young man be not much showed ayala that in matter uncle be enemy in terrible crisis have not friend unless might be lucy then day be fixed on tom be to come made matter more terrible by anticipation what can be good ayala said to aunt when hour named for interview be told a can tell everything just a well without coming at have be settled aunt margaret have repeated over over again that excellent young man a tom with such admirable intention be entitled to hearing from young lady in reply to ayala simply made grimace be intended to signify utter contempt in held cousin tom with wealth tom tringle in spite of ring certain dash of vulgarity be perhaps not altogether own fault be not bad fellow having taken into heart that be very much in love be very much in love pictured to happiness of wholesome cleanly kind to have girl a own to caress foster expend in making happy to exalt so a to have acknowledged that be at rate a important a augusta to learn something from so that too might become romantic in degree poetical have come home to in not ignoble manner have not come home to that ayala might probably refuse hitherto ayala have be very persistent in refusal then hitherto there have existed opposition of family now have overcome that felt therefore that be entitled to ask to receive on day fixed at hour fixed came in plenitude of ring poor tom be pity that must have have one to advise a to apparel ayala hated jewelry be not quite distinct in mind a to raiment must be worn by angel of light when must come be sure that must not be chiefly conspicuous for heavy gilding tom moreover have waistcoat must of have be suicidal such a be however be shown up into drawing room where found ayala alone be certainly misfortune to that preliminary conversation be possible ayala have be instructed to be there with express object of listening to offer of marriage work have to be done must be done must not admit of other ordinary courtesy be very angry with looked anger why must be subjected to terrible annoyance have sense enough to perceive that there be place for preliminary courtesy therefore rushed away at once to matter in hand ayala exclaimed coming standing before a sat upon sofa tom said looking boldly up into face ayala love better than anything else in world what be good of of course be different when told so before meant to stick to be determined that governor must give way must know that mother girl be against be against said ayala be against being married so squeezed out a be be why have be sent to place understand now know what be about have given consent governor have promised to be liberal when say thing will do there will be lot of money care bit about money said ayala fiercely more do except only that be comfortable must do to marry without money must must do very well if anybody cared for anybody angel of light generally appeared in forma pauperis though there be always about tinge of bright azure be hardly compatible with draggle tailed hue of everyday poverty income be good thing governor will come down like brick governor have nothing to do with told before that be nonsense if will only go away say nothing about will always think very good natured wo go away said tom speaking out boldly mean to stick to ayala believe understand that be thoroughly in earnest why must be in earnest too love ayala have set heart upon know how well love have quite made up mind about have made up mind ayala now tenor of face changed something of look of despairing lover took place of offensive triumph have at first sat upon brow suppose care for other fellow yet there be angel of light even though might be most anxious to explain to that suit be altogether impracticable must say nothing to about angel though be sure that angel must come be not certain that must ever give altogether even to angel celestial castle be ever being built in imagination be a yet very much complicated have be ever so clear must have be quite impossible to explain anything of to cousin tom have nothing to do with said if knew how love came from with sob a sobbed went down before on knee be fool tom pray if wo get up will go away must go away have heard that there be to hear told that there be use in coming ayala with there be veritable sob then why give up let be good friend ca give up wo give up when fellow mean a do never give up nothing on earth will make give up ayala have got to do so tell nobody can make said ayala nodding head somewhat tamed by unexpected passion of young man then wo say one kind word to ca say anything kinder very well then will go away come again constantly till do mean to have when come to know how very much love do think will give way at last with picked up from ground hurried out of house without saying word chapter xii must scene described in last chapter took place in march for three day afterwards there be quiescence in kingsbury crescent then there came letter from tom to ayala very pressing full of love resolution offering to wait time even month if wished still persisting in declared intention of marrying sooner later not by mean bad letter have there not be about little touch of bombast made odious to ayala sensitive appreciation to ayala wrote reply in following word when tell wo ought to go on be manly ayala pray write again for will never answer of said nothing to mr dosett though arrival of tom letter must have be known to lady posted own epistle without word a to what be doing wrote again again to lucy imploring sister to come to urging that a circumstance now be must not show at house in queen gate to lucy always replied did not reply by coming hardly made intelligible why did not come aunt emmeline hoped said that ayala must very soon be able to be at queen gate then there be difficulty about carriage one must walk across with except tom walking by herself be forbidden aunt emmeline did not like cab then there came third fourth letter in lucy be more explanatory yet not sufficiently so during easter recess must take place in middle of april augusta mr traffick must be married happy couple be to be blessed with divided honeymoon interval between easter whitsuntide must require mr traffick presence in house bride with bridegroom be to return to queen gate then must depart again for second holiday when be so gone aunt emmeline hoped that ayala must come to for visit quite understand said lucy that will not do to have augusta together be not at what ayala wanted wo at do to have together said ayala to herself alluding of course to tom tringle why did not lucy come over to lucy who knew so well that sister did not want to see one of tringles who must have be sure that visit to queen gate must have be impossible ought to have come to to whom else must say word in trouble be thus that ayala argued with declaring to herself that must soon die in misery unless indeed that angel of light might come to assistance very quickly have trouble of own in reference to family at queen gate did in fact make almost impossible to visit sister for week sir thomas have given unwilling frank consent to son marriage then expected simply to be told that must take place at such such time when money must be required lady tringle have given consent not quite frankly still must fain have forbidden banns have power of forbidding remained in hand augusta be still hot against marriage still resolute to prevent proposed journey upstairs after scrap book at glenbogie real journey up to top of st peter still rankled in heart that tom must make ayala future baronet wife that tom must endow ayala with greatest share of tringle wealth that ayala must become powerful in queen gate dominant probably at merle park glenbogie be wormwood to be conscious that ayala be pretty witty though must affect to despise wit prettiness by instigating mother by inducing mr traffick to interfere when mr traffick must be member of family thought that might prevail with mother did in part prevail future husband be at present too much engaged with supply demand to be able to give thought to tom affair there must soon be time when naturally must be compelled to divide thought then there be gertrude gertrude own affair have not a yet be smiled upon want of smile attributed very much to augusta why must augusta have way not gertrude brother tom therefore leagued with tom declared quite prepared to receive ayala into house in way family be very much divided when lucy first made petition for carriage expressing desire to see ayala uncle aunt be in room objection be made frivolous objection by lady tringle who did not in truth care to maintain much connection between queen gate crescent then sir thomas in burly authoritative way have said that ayala have better come to that same evening have settled intended to settle with wife let ayala come a soon a trafficks a then must be must have gone to lady tringle have assented knowing more than husband a to ayala feeling thinking that in way breach might be made between ayala have be great trouble to be beginning to be almost sick of dormer connection altogether be thus that lucy be hindered from seeing sister for six week after first formal declaration of love made by tom to ayala tom have still persevered have forced way more than once into ayala presence ayala answer have be always same be great shame have right to treat in way then came traffick marriage with great eclat there be le than four traffick bridesmaid of doubt noble none of very young gertrude lucy be bridesmaid two of augusta friend ayala of course be not of party tom be gorgeous in apparel not in least depressed by numerous repulse quite confident of ultimate success proud of position a lover with so beautiful girl talked of affair to friend seemed to think that even on wedding day part be a conspicuous a of sister because of affair with beautiful cousin augusta doe hit off with said to one of friend who asked why ayala be not at wedding augusta be biggest fool out know be proud of husband because be son of lord must change ayala for daughter of duchess in europe thus showing that regarded ayala a being almost own already lord boardotrade be there making semi jocose speech quite in approved way for cognate paterfamilias perhaps there be something of thorn in to sir thomas a have become apparent at last that mr traffick did not purpose to add anything from own resource to income on intended to live with wife lord boardotrade have be obliged to do so much for eldest son that there appeared to be nothing left for member for port glasgow sir thomas be prepared with l did not perhaps mind very much man when pay money like to have return for did not quite like tone with old nobleman not possessed of very old standing in peerage seemed to imply that like noble old providence have enveloped whole tringle family in mantle of noble blood combined jocose paternal in manner appropriate to such occasion there did run through sir thomas mind a heard idea that l be sufficient sum to pay that might be necessary to make mr traffick understand that out of income thenceforth coming must provide house for wife have be already arranged that be to return to queen gate with wife for period between easter whitsuntide have lately quite lately be hinted to sir thomas that married pair must run up again after second holiday mr septimus traffick have once spoken of glenbogie a almost own augusta have in father hearing said word intended to be very affectionate about dear merle park sir thomas be father over with father feeling even father doe not like to be done mr traffick doubt be member of parliament son of peer there might be question whether even mr traffick have not be purchased at quite full value nevertheless marriage be pronounced to have be success immediately after early indeed on following morning sir thomas inquired when ayala be coming to queen gate be necessary that must come quite at present asked lady tringle thought be settled said sir thomas angrily have be said in privacy of own dressing room downstairs at breakfast table in presence of gertrude lucy returned to subject tom who did not live in house be not there suppose might a well have ayala now said addressing chiefly to lucy do go manage with there be not word more said sir thomas did not always have own way in family what man be ever happy

trouble in privacy of own chamber be thoroughly convinced that be being ill used one have right to tell that man be too good for unless must make pretension to man be insult to even to connect name with of man unless have done something to connect in own estimation cousin tom be infinitely beneath world beneath denizen of altogether inferior race such a beast be to beauty not that ayala have ever boasted to herself of own face form be not in respect that likened to beauty when thought of tom a beast assumed superiority existed in certain intellectual rather artistic aesthetic gift certain celestial gift a have boasted of to one a have never said that cousin be pole asunder in taste pole asunder in feeling pole asunder in intelligence be not very very cruel that must be told first that encouraged then that be not good enough for cinderella did not ask to have prince for husband when have own image of one must rob be content with why must treat in cruel way be afraid be having great deal of trouble with said lady tringle to mr dosett indeed of course be romantic be very objectionable quite detestable said lady tringle have be brought up like so that be not fault now endeavour to do best be so upsetting be angry because cousin persecutes persecutes indeed tom be in position to ask girl to be wife can give home of own good income ought to be proud of offer instead of speaking

by daughter to make ayala happy there be not very much of going into grand society that difficulty about dress solved a do other difficulty there came few present with entreaty from ayala that present of kind might not be made present be of course accepted girl be a prettily arrayed if not a richly a best around at first there be evening at opera then theatre diversion be easy ayala after six dull month in kingsbury crescent found well pleased to be taken to easy amusement carriage in park be delightful to delightful visit be made to by lucy for tringle carriage must be spared for visit in

attempt certainly be not successful elderly gentleman be brought up to gentleman whom afterwards declared to be hundred who be in truth over forty with manoeuvred gently through quadrille asked two three question to be able to answer only in monosyllable then ceased question manoeuvre be carried on in perfect silence poor ayala did not attribute blame to man be because have be six month in kingsbury crescent of course aged gentleman if wanted to dance must have partner chosen for out of kingsbury crescent conversation be not to be expected from gentleman who be made to stand up with kingsbury crescent power of talking that have ever belonged to herself have of course evaporated amidst gloom of kingsbury crescent after be returned speedily to wing of marchesa during next dance sat in undisturbed peace then suddenly when marchesa have for moment left when nina have just be taken away to join set saw man of silence coming to from distance with evident intention of asking to stand up again be in eye in toe a came bowing forward have evidently learned to suppose that two outcast might lessen misery by joining together be to dance with because one else must ask have plucked up

a though be rogue declare that lady have be thrown out of window week after be married nothing must be more unlike angel of light than colonel stubbs unless perhaps be tom tringle colonel stubbs however be completely unangelic so much so that marvel be that must yet be so pleasant have horror of colonel stubbs at must go anywhere with colonel stubbs feel to be quite safe hoped might meet again very often be a be genius of comedy without touch of life must be very dull angel of light must have something tragic in composition must verge at rate on tragedy ayala did not know beautiful description of sallow sublime sort of werther faced man fear that in creating angel of light drew picture in imagination of man of kind day went on till last day of ayala visit have come be necessary that must go back to kingsbury crescent be now august everybody be leaving town marchesa nina be going to relation alburys at stalham must not of course take ayala with dosetts must remain in town for

interesting when come to think of fear never have come to think of said marchesa during time ayala never said word sat looking at cousin remembering how much better colonel jonathan stubbs must have talked if have be there then after pause tom got up took leave having to content with simply squeezing cousin hand a left room be lout said ayala a soon a knew that door be closed behind see anything loutish at said marchesa be just like most other young men said nina be not at like colonel stubbs said ayala then marchesa preached little sermon colonel stubbs dear said happens to have be thrown good deal about world have thus be able to pick up easy mode of talking young lady like perhaps because mean nothing cousin be man of business will probably have amassed large fortune when poor nephew will be hing old general on half pay chatter will not then have availed quite so much a cousin habit of business mamma said nina jonathan will have money of own never mind dear like to hear young man called lout because be more like man of business than man of pleasure ayala felt to be snubbed be not whit le sure that tom be lout colonel agreeable partner to dance with at same time remembered that one other be to be spoken of in same breath thought of in same spirit a angel of light when be dressed just going to dinner ugly man with red head be announced declared purpose of going with to

performance ayala thoroughly enjoyed thought that in experience play 'd seen have ever be so delightful on return home two girl be told to go to bed in marchesa good natured authoritative tone

lout that colonel jonathan be not believe be falling in love with colonel jonathan said nina must a soon think of falling in love with wild bear be not lout therefore like chapter xvii lucy be very firm be just before tringles have returned from rome during winter lucy dormer have met mr hamel in kensington garden for second time have walked there with perhaps for hour have then returned home with conviction that have done wicked thing have other conviction also be perhaps stronger now that have met be to lose again have said what must mean by losing except that be one thing desired to find have not seen since heard word of whereabouts although a so well remembered have given address at aunt emmeline not knowing then that must be fate to become resident in aunt emmeline house have told that ayala must live there that perhaps might sometimes be found visiting ayala now be filling ayala place might so easily have be found knew nothing of man who have once asked whether be to lose again own feeling about isadore hamel be clear enough to herself now ayala in hot humour have asked whether must give hand heart to one a cousin tom have found herself constrained to say that must not do so because be not free not quite free to do a pleased with hand heart have striven hard not to acknowledge anything even to ayala even to herself word have be forced from now be conscious terribly conscious that word be true there must be one else now whether tom whether such a tom such a other be just little word have won be to lose again girl love most often because be loved not from choice on part be won by flattery of man desire be to lose again have seemed to throw soul into voice into eye a have asked question sudden thrill have filled for sake for sake have hoped that might not be lost to now began to fear that be lost to something have be told of relation between isadore hamel father be sculptor father having become successful artist father be liberal be essentially autocratic if supplied to son mean of living be willing to supply mean of very comfortable life expected that son must live to extent in accordance with fancy father wished son to live in rome to live after manner of roman isadore must prefer to live in london after manner of londoner for time have be allowed to do so have achieved moderate success young artist may achieve moderate success with pecuniary result that will be almost le than moderate after while sculptor in rome have told son that if intended to remain in london ought to do so on independent proceeds of own profession isadore if must return to rome must be made welcome to join affair to of father in other word be to be turned adrift if remained in london petted with luxury if must consent to follow art in italy in rome father lived after fashion be distasteful to son old mr hamel have repudiated convention convention be apt to go very quickly one after when first have be thrown aside man who cease to dress for dinner soon find to be trouble to wash hand house be bore calling be bore church be great bore family be bore wife be unendurable bore law be bore except by inferior can be constrained to do work mr hamel have got rid of great many bore have strong opinion that bore prevailed more mightily in london than in rome isadore be not bore to be always willing to have isadore near to if isadore chose to enter conventional mode of life must do at own expense may be said at once isadore present view of life be very much influenced by lucy dormer by feeling that certainly be conventional small house very prettily furnished somewhat near fulham road perhaps verging little towards south kensington with two maid perhaps additional one a nurse in process of month with pleasant english breakfast pleasant english teapot in evening afforded certainly very conventional aspect of life at present moment be aspect therefore must not go upon four with father in state of thing there have during last twelvemonth be more than one journey made to rome back ayala have seen at rome lady tringle remembering that man have be intimate with brother be afraid of have made inquiry about have fully resolved that must not be allowed into house if came after ayala have mother to speak of have little brother sister who also have mother to speak of mr hamel father entertained friend on sunday with express object of playing card that papist must do so be to be borne mr hamel be not papist therefore must certainly be much more have be learned at rome therefore lucy though never mentioned mr hamel name in queen gate heard evil thing said of man who be so dear to be custom of life to be driven out day with aunt gertrude not to be taken two three time round park must be to lady tringle to rob of best appreciated of gift of fortune have come to by reason of banker wealth be stern law a stern law lucy must accompany gertrude a being absolute daughter of house a having almost acknowledged lover of own be allowed choice for lucy there be alternative why must not go be driven two day before left town be being driven while aunt be sitting almost in slumber beside when suddenly young man leaning over railing took off hat so close to lucy that must almost have put out hand to be standing there alone seemed simply to be watching carriage a passed felt that blushed a bowed to saw also that colour have risen to face then turned gently round to aunt whom hoped to find still sleeping aunt emmeline must slumber with one eye open who be that young man dear said aunt emmeline be mr hamel mr isadore hamel said aunt emmeline horrified be that young man at rome who have got horrible father know father said lucy doe live at rome of course be mr hamel mean scraped acquaintance with ayala must not have for moment be not at sort of person young girl ought to know father be horrible man hope be friend of yours lucy be friend of mine lucy said in tone of voice be very seldom heard from when heard be evidence that beneath softness of general manner there lay will of own then dear hope that such friendship may be discontinued a long a remain with be friend of papa said lucy be very well suppose artist must know artist even though be disreputable mr hamel be not disreputable aunt emmeline a heard must almost fancy that be renewing one of difficulty with ayala dear said intended to be very impressive a spoke in matter such a must beg to be guided by must acknowledge that know world better than do mr hamel be not fit person to be acquainted with young lady who occupies place of daughter be sure will be sufficient then leant back in carriage seemed again to slumber still have one eye open so that if mr hamel must appear again at corner venture to raise hand might be aware of impropriety on day mr hamel did not appear again lucy did not speak word during drive on reaching house went at once to bed room while have be out with aunt close to while have be possible that man loved must appear again have be unable to collect thought to make up mind what must do say one thing simply be certain to that if mr hamel must present again to must not desert that aunt have said to a to impropriety like have effect at upon man have be welcomed at father house have be allowed there to be intimate with be now a be well aware much dearer to than other human being not for aunt emmelines in world must regard otherwise than a dearest friend when be alone discussed matter with be repugnant to that there must be secret on subject between herself aunt after what have be said much more that there must be deceit mr hamel be not fit to be acquainted with lady who occupies position of daughter be thus that aunt have spoken to proper answer seemed to be seemed at least to lucy in case dear aunt can not for moment longer occupy position of daughter a certainly be acquainted will remain acquainted with mr hamel to such speech a on own part there be two impediment in first place must imply that mr hamel be lover for implying mr hamel have given authority then what must immediately do when have thus obstinately declared to be unfit for daughter position be supposed now to occupy with firmness of determination must not bring to tell aunt that mr hamel be lover not because be not a yet true must have be quite willing that aunt must know exact truth if exact truth must be explained how must convey to one a aunt emmeline meaning of word be to lose again how must make aunt understand that held to be absolutely bound a by marriage vow by such word a word in there be promise even have come from fitting suitor must be regarded by aunt emmeline a being simply impertinent coming a did from one a isadore hamel be quite out of question to tell to aunt emmeline yet be necessary that something must be told have be ordered to drop acquaintance with isadore be essential that must declare that must hing of kind must not recognise such obedience a duty on part friendship have be created by father to whom earlier obedience have be due might be that refusing to render such obedience aunt uncle might tell that there must be no longer shelter for in house must not cherish foster disobedient child if must be so must though there must be home left to in wide world must not accept order must separate from man loved must simply tell aunt that must not drop mr hamel acquaintance because mr hamel be friend early on next morning did so be aware said aunt emmeline with severe face that be illegitimate lucy blushed made answer be be engaged to said lucy sharply have asked to marry said lucy then what be asked lady tringle in tone be intended to signify that a nothing of kind have taken place such friendship must be matter of consequence be papa friend dear what can matter poor papa have gone be in charge uncle surely can not object to choose friend a must wish mr hamel be gentleman of whom approve can not have seen very much of must be very easy for must bow to again in park to let see that like do like said lucy with energy lucy do like to see mr hamel feel almost sure that will come call here now that have seen last winter asked address gave house when be living with aunt dosett yes did aunt emmeline thought aunt margaret must not like to come to kingsbury crescent a ayala be to be here told might call at queen gate then lady tringle be really angry be not only that house must have be selected for so improper use that lucy must have shown fear respect for mr dosett have not be accorded to herself be shocking to pride that must have appeared to be easy of achievement at queen gate be too wicked to be attempted at kingsbury crescent then thing have be done seemed in to to be so horrible girl when living under care of aunt have made appointment with improper young man at house of aunt appointment made by young lady with young man must a thought be wrong began to be aghast at very nature of girl who must do thing on reflecting that girl be at present under charge a adopted daughter lucy said very impressively there must be end of there can not be end of said lucy do mean to say that be to come here to house whether uncle like not will come said lucy be sure will come now have seen will come at once why must do that if be not lover because said lucy then paused because be very hard to tell aunt emmeline why must come so quickly demanded aunt emmeline again because though have said nothing to such a mean stammered out lucy determined to tell whole truth believe that will if did must accept have mean know have certainly not must consent to be wife after what have told yes said lucy must then must not be in house be will not have here on pretence whatsoever thought not aunt emmeline therefore have told do mean that will make appointment with elsewhere certainly not have not in fact ever made appointment with know address till yesterday thought that be in rome never have line from in life of course have never written to upon hearing lady tringle sat in silence not quite knowing how to carry on conversation condition of lucy mind be so strange to that felt to be incompetent to dictate must only resolve under circumstance must objectionable man be allowed into house now aunt emmeline said lucy have told everything of course have right to order also have right told be to drop mr hamel can not drop if come in way certainly will not drop if come here will see if can if uncle tom choose to turn out of course can do so will tell uncle about said aunt emmeline angrily then will hear what say so conversation be ended at moment sir thomas be of course in city managing million a lucy have suggested that mr hamel might not improbably call on very day a be quite determined that mr hamel must not enter door of house in queen gate be necessary that step must be taken at once hour afterwards mr hamel did call asked for miss dormer door be opened by well appointed footman who with lugubrious face with face spoke much more eloquently than word declared that miss dormer be not at home in answer to further inquiry went on to express opinion that miss dormer never must be at home from may be seen aunt emmeline have taken strong measure to carry out purpose hamel when heard fate thus plainly spoken from man mouth turned away not doubting meaning have seen lucy face in park have seen also lady tringle gesture after greeting that lady tringle must not be disposed to receive at house be not matter of surprise to when lucy went to bed that night did not doubt that mr hamel have called that have be turned away from door chapter xviii down in scotland when time came tringles together with honourable mr traffick started for glenbogie aunt emmeline have told sir thomas lucy sin sir thomas have not made so much of a wife have expected must be bad thing to have husband for lucy said sir thomas man have got sixpence have profession know that make anything then think of father be illegitimate sir thomas seemed rather to sneer at if knew way old man life in rome play card sunday again sir thomas sneered sir thomas be fairly submissive to conventionality did not think that ought to stand in way of provision for young lady who have provision of own must wish to have at queen gate asked lady tringle certainly not if make nothing by profession good deal think depends upon then nothing further be said lucy be not told uncle opinion on matter a have be promised when went down to glenbogie only knew that mr hamel be considered to be by far too black sheep to be admitted into aunt presence that must regard a separated from man a far a separation must be effected by present protector if must be true to a to girl whom have short time since so keenly rejoiced in finding again be quite sure that must be true to on day fixed th of august mr houston arrived at glenbogie with boot stocking ammunition such a tom have recommended when interrogated on matter by sister gertrude travelled down with man think know said to lucy at rate sister doe because saw with at rome man turned out to be isadore hamel did like to ask whether be coming here said frank houston be not coming here said aunt emmeline certainly not said gertrude who be quite prepared to take up cudgel on mother behalf against mr hamel said something about man used to know at rome before came be nephew of marchesa baldoni be lady did like bit too well said gertrude very stuck up sort of person who did must to spoil ayala said aunt emmeline ayala have just be staying with said lucy have be very kind to ayala have nothing to do with now said aunt emmeline ayala can stay with whom aunt plea be mr hamel whom saw friend of marchesa seemed to be friend of marchesa nephew continued houston one colonel stubbs used to see at rome most curious man be name be jonathan suppose that man be ever seen so red before be shooting somewhere hamel seems to be going to join thought might have be coming here afterwards a be in rome together certainly be not coming here said aunt emmeline a for colonel stubbs never heard of before week of time allotted to frank houston have gone before have repeated word of suit to sir thomas with gertrude opportunity have be allowed by rest of family have be regarded a though be engaged mr traffick who be now at glenbogie in accordance with compact made with did not at first approve of frank houston have insinuated to lady tringle have said very plainly to augusta that regarded young man without employment without income a being quite unfit to marry if have seat in house must be quite different thing have said to augusta wife have snubbed telling almost in so many word that if gertrude be determined to have way in opposition to father certainly must not be deterred by brother in law be nothing to mr traffick have then said money wo come out of pocket when man have nothing else to do be sure to spend that can lay hand upon after however withdrew opposition allowed to be supposed that be ready to receive frank houston a brother in law must be so decided time be running by with expectant son in law with mr traffick who have achieved position be aware that grace must be allowed to beyond have be promised frank have fully considered matter be quite resolved that must be unmanly in to run after cousin imogene in tyrol before have performed business one day therefore after having returned from daily allowance of slaughter contrived to find sir thomas in solitude of own room again began to act part of allan dale thought mr houston said sir thomas that have settled that matter before not quite said houston know why must say so intended to be understood a expressing mind have be good enough to ask down here may ask man to house

residence might perhaps travel through scotland without finding more beautifully romantic spot in to reside from passage seemed to totter suspended over rock whence tumbling rushing water must always be heard like music close at hand view down over little twisting river be such a filled mind with conviction of realised poetry behind house across little garden there be high rock where little path have be formed from must be seen whole valley of caller broad shining expanse of lake beyond who knew cottage of drumcaller be apt to say that man in scotland have more picturesque abode one more

glenbogie be a far from lake on side a cottage be on how will get up except by walking can not say unless will write note to sir thomas ask to send horse down for sir thomas must not accommodate think will frown if come after niece simply want to call on miss dormer said hamel blushing because father be always kind to mean to ask question said colonel be just so a say like being in neighbourhood without calling on miss dormer daresay not doubt whether sir thomas lady tringle must be at inclined to make welcome a to distance can walk that easily enough if door be slammed in face can walk back again thus be resolved that early on following morning after breakfast isadore hamel must go across lake make way up to glenbogie chapter xix isadore hamel be asked to lunch on following morning morning of monday nd september isadore hamel started on journey have thought much about journey before made doubt door have be slammed in face in london felt quite conscious of conscious also that man

concurrence on part of sir thomas door have at rate not be slammed by lucy only person have really wished to see within house have be lucy dormer have hitherto reason for supposing that must be unwilling to receive face have be sweet gracious when saw in park be to deny hope of future intercourse with because lady tringle have chosen to despise must make attempt be more than probable doubt that attempt must be futile servant at glenbogie must probably be a well instructed a servant in queen gate still man have to go on do something if mean to do anything there must be good in sitting up at drumcaller at one side of lake thinking of lucy dormer far away at other side have not at made up mind that must ask lucy to be wife professional income be still poor a be aware have nothing felt to be incumbent upon to get nearer to if be possible to say something to if privilege of speech must be accorded to walked down to callerfoot refusing loan of colonel pony carriage thence have carried across lake in hired boat to place called sandy quay that be assured be spot on other side from whence nearest road must be found to glenbogie nobody on callerfoot side must tell must be distance at sandy quay be assured that be twelve mile to glenbogie house soon found that man who told have pony for hire ye will nae get there under twalve mile maybe saxteen if ye attampt to walk up glin so said

dropping head again amongst bush hamel when have made good footing have first to turn round so that lad might not lose wage dirty little hand came up for sixpence head never appeared again be well known in neighbourhood especially at sandy quay where boat be used to land sir thomas be not partial to visitor who made way into glenbogie by authorised road while hamel be paying debt stood still on steed waiting to see who might be trespasser be not high road said sir thomas a young man approached a last quarter of hour from bottom of ravine have be occupied in very stiff climbing among rock information conveyed appeared to hamel to have be almost unnecessary way up to house if be going there must have be through lodge down there perhaps be sir thomas tringle said hamel be name then have to ask pardon for mode of ingres be going up to house having crossed lake from callerfoot did not know way on side so have clambered up ravine sir thomas bowed then waited for further tidings believe miss dormer be at house niece be there name be hamel isadore hamel be sculptor used to be acquainted with father have have great kindness from whole family so be going to call upon if object will go on to house sir thomas sat upon horse speechless for minute have to consider whether did not object not be well aware that wife objected aware also that have declined to coincide with wife objection when have be pressed upon why must not niece have advantage of lover if proper sort of lover came in way a to father moral son birth matter to sir thomas be nothing young man be told be good at making bust must one buy bust when be made be question wife must certainly be prejudiced must think necessary to reject for lucy suitor must reject for own girl then a sir thomas felt have not shown great judgment in selecting suitor for own girl oh mr hamel be said at last isadore hamel called at queen gate once not long ago did said hamel saw one no did heard well can go on to house if like have better ask for lady tringle after coming over from callerfoot will want lunch stop moment mind if ride back with so two started towards house hamel listened whilst sir thomas expatiated on beauty of glenbogie have passed through one gate be approaching when away among tree there be young lady seen walking alone there be miss dormer said hamel suppose may join sir thomas must not quite make up mind whether meeting be to be allowed not must not bring at spur of moment to refuse sanction so hamel made way across to lucy while sir thomas rode on alone to house lucy have seen uncle on cob being accustomed to see on cob knew of course who be have also seen man with not in least expecting hamel be in part have never dreamt that be uncle companion be not till hamel be near to that understood that man be coming to join then when did recognise man be lost in amazement hardly expected to see here said indeed did expect must find in way uncle know be asked lucy oh yes met a came up from ravine have asked to go on to house to lunch then there be silence for few moment a walked on together hope think that be persecuting in making way over here oh not persecuting lucy when heard sound of what have said be angry with feeling that have almost declared guilty of wrong in having come thither of course be glad to see added for papa sake be afraid afraid of what miss dormer looked full in face a answered collecting courage to make declaration seemed to be necessary aunt emmeline doe not want to come why must not want can not tell perhaps if did know must not tell be so called at queen gate know that be not admitted though be at home of course aunt emmeline have right to choose who will come be not a though have house of own sir thomas asked in then have better go in after what aunt emmeline said think that ought to remain with uncle know be with said hamel then walked on towards house together in silence for while do mean to say continued that because aunt object be never to see again hope will see again be friend must be so very sorry not to see again suppose said slowly can never be more than papa friend be mine also must be more than then paused a if waiting for reply of course have none to make must be so much more than lucy still have answer to give there come time when answer be a excellent eloquence a word can be spoken hamel who have probably not thought much of be nevertheless at once informed by instinct that be so oh lucy said if can love say so mr hamel whispered lucy mr hamel told about aunt emmeline will not allow ought not to have let speak to like while be staying here uncle know be with aunt doe not know must go to house expressly desired must not speak to will obey always not always did not say must obey always day perhaps will do a think fit then will speak to then will speak to said love love answered again looking full in face now pray pray let go on for have stopped awhile amidst tree have put out hand a though to take hers have opened arm a though must embrace passed on quickly hardly answered further question till found together in hall of house then met lady tringle who be just passing into room where lunch be laid following be augusta gertrude honourable septimus traffick for though frank houston have found compelled to go at day named honourable septimus have contrived to squeeze out week augusta be indeed still not without hope that paternal hospitality of glenbogie might be prolonged till dear merle park must once again open portal sir thomas have already passed into dining room having in gruff voice informed wife that have invited mr hamel to come in to lunch mr hamel have exclaimed yes mr hamel must not see man starving when have come way know anything against then have turned away have gone into dining room be now standing with back to empty fire place determined to take mr hamel part if want of courtesy be shown to certainly be hard upon lady tringle frowned be going to walk on without acknowledgment when lucy timidly went through form of introduction aunt emmeline be mr hamel uncle tom met somewhere in ground have asked to come to luncheon then lady tringle curtseyed made bow curtsey bow together be sufficient to have crushed heart of young man who have not be comforted exalted by such word a isadore have heard from lucy lip not five minute since love have said after lady tringle might curtsey bow a must must still live uncrushed after curtsey bow lady tringle passed on lucy fell into rank behind gertrude then hamel afterwards took place behind honourable septimus if will sit there mr hamel said lady tringle pointing to chair across table obliquely at greatest possible distance from occupied by lucy there be stationed between mr traffick sir thomas now in present frame of mind position at table made very little difference to lunch be eaten in grim silence sir thomas be not man profuse with conversation at meal at moment be ill inclined for word except what might use in scolding wife for being uncivil to guest lady tringle sat with head erect hardly opening mouth sufficiently to allow food to enter be purpose to show displeasure at mr hamel showed augusta took mother part thoroughly despising two dormer girl lover that might have poor gertrude have on that morning be violently persecuted by lecture a to frank houston impecuniosity lucy of course must not speak honourable septimus be anxious chiefly about lunch somewhat anxious also to offend master mistress of merle park hamel made one two little effort to extract answer from sir thomas soon found that sir thomas must prefer to be left in silence what did signify to have done that wanted much more than have expected rising getting away from luncheon be always difficulty so great difficulty when there be guest that lunch must never be much company festival there be provision for leaving table a there be at dinner on occasion lady tringle extemporised provision first moment in have ceased to eat mr hamel said very loudly must like cheese mr hamel with little start declared that wanted cheese then dear think will go into room lucy will come with upon four lady went out in procession ladyship be careful that lucy must go first so that there might be possibility of escape augusta gertrude followed mind of four be somewhat perturbed among four lucy heart be by far lightest be staying over with stubbs at cottage asked honourable septimus very queer fellow be stubbs very good fellow said hamel dare say have got shooting think not not head glentower must let acre of shooting over there for money be earl of glentower to whom belonged enormous tract of country on other side of lake what on earth doe do with stuck up on top of rock doe shoot sometimes believe when lord glentower be there be poor kind of fun waiting to be asked for day said honourable septimus who rarely waited for anything till be asked doe get fishing catch few trout sometimes in tarn above fancy that stubbs be much devoted to shooting fishing then what d doe do with in country a hamel shrugged shoulder not caring to say that what with walking what with reading writing friend must be a happy a day be long in such place a drumcaller be liberal what asked hamel oh liberal upon word know what be be chiefly given to poetry tobacco military matter then honourable septimus turned up nose in disgust ceased cross examination a to character pursuit of colonel jonathan stubbs sir thomas be very much obliged to for kindness said hamel getting up suddenly a be long way over to drumcaller think will make start know way down glen must be sure to miss by other route perhaps will let go back a came sir thomas offered loan of horse be refused started on return journey across lake when have gone few step from portal turned to look at house contained one whom now regarded a belonging exclusively to perhaps thought that might catch final view of lucy not quite thinking fancied that such chance might at least be possible saw nothing uninteresting facade of grand mansion lucy be employed quite otherwise be listening to lecture in aunt be describing to how very badly mr hamel have behaved in obtruding on shade of glenbogie lecture be somewhat long a aunt emmeline found necessary to repeat argument have before used a to miscreant birth a to want of adequate mean a to general iniquity of miscreant father repeated more than once with energy be quite unusual to flood of eloquence be so great that lucy found moment for interposing word till evil have be denunciated twice thrice then spoke aunt emmeline said be engaged to mr hamel now what have asked to be wife have promised that after have said to aunt emmeline told must not drop did not bid come here uncle tom brought when saw must have avoided if must told ought not to be here because did not wish then answered that uncle knew that be with of course when told that loved must not make other answer then aunt emmeline expressed magnitude of indignation simply by silence lucy be left to think of lover in solitude how have fared on day journey said colonel when hamel found still seated on platform with book in hand much better than thought sir thomas gave luncheon young lady young lady be gracious also be afraid can not carry praise of family at glenbogie further three tringle lady looked at a be sitting at table a though certainly have business in august society chapter xx stubbs upon matrimony before evening be over in course of night might be better said a two men sat up late with pipe hamel told friend colonel exactly what have taken place that morning over at glenbogie went for purpose of course asked colonel for off chance know well enough never heard of man walking twelve mile to call upon young lady merely because knew father when there be to be second call within few week first having not be taken in very good part by young lady friend inquiring mind told that there be something more than old family friendship inquiring mind saw into truth now look forward to further event can bake can brew doubt that must if tried can wash shirt for man suppose dear fellow intend to say that wife will have to wash yours washing shirt a read in poem from be quoting be presumed to be simply emblematic of household duty in general take say in good part a coming from friend regard matrimony said colonel a being altogether happiest state of life for man unless to be engaged to lovely creature in whom one can have perfect confidence may be thought happier one can enjoy ecstatic mental reflection delight of conceit come from being loved that feeling of superiority to world around illumines bosom of favoured lover without having to put one hand into one pocket having one pipe put out morally physically next to be matrimony be only remedy for consciousness of disreputable debauchery savour of always cling more le strongly to unmarried men in rank of life chime must be heard at midnight let young man be ever so well given to propriety must have just touch of swingebuckler about will seem to to be deficient in virility there be getting out of until man marry then well then do know man whose long preserved hat be always brushed carefully whose coat be pattern of neatness still little threadbare when look at in colour of whose cheek there be still touch of juvenility whose step be ever heavy whose brow be always sad seriousness of life have pressed smile out of have learned hardly to want anything for outward decency common necessary of life such little personal indulgence a be common to to be a strange to a ortolan diamond think do know do well have seen in regiment have met on step of public office have watched a entered parsonage house will find coming out of lawyer office where have sat for last nine hour having supported nature with two penny biscuit have always few thin hair over forehead have always that well brushed hat have always load of care on brow be generally thinking whether will endeavour to extend credit with butcher resolve that supply of meat may be again curtailed without injury to health of five daughter be ugly picture be true in case of course be yet not ugly round said meditative colonel who have just replenished pipe there be on other side five daughter partner of load of care know be well to have five daughter rather than to live with plenty of beef mutton even with ortolan if will with one to care whether body may be racked in world spirit in next say whether balance of good evil be on one side other when man be going to do thing must know what be be going to do reading of said hamel be that if succeed in marrying miss dormer must have thin lock bad hat butcher bill other men do instead have balance at banker die worth thirty forty fifty thousand pound to great consolation of five daughter hundred thousand pound there be of course end to amount of thousand successful professional man may accumulate may be man question be whether must not have reasonable ground to suppose man before encumber with five daughter seems to said hamel that need of such assurance be cowardly be just question be always debating with also want to rid of swingebuckler flavour feel that for like adam be not good must be alone must fain ask first girl must love well enough to wish to make one with to be wife regardless of hat butcher daughter be plucky fine thing for man to feel that can make back broad enough for burden yet what be good of thinking that can carry sack of wheat when be sure that have not in truth strength to raise from ground strength will come said hamel yes bad hat worse than bad hat soiled gown perhaps with soiled gown altered heart perhaps with altered heart absence of tenderness be woman special right to expect from man must have thought must have be last to be so self diffident to be so thoughtful mean said colonel be unattached now having have special duty for last three month have given over to thinking in nasty morbid manner come daresay partly from tobacco there be comfort in such reflection falling out of one man mouth ever have slightest effect in influencing man conduct hamel have told friend with great triumph of engagement with lucy dormer friend did not return confidence by informing sculptor during whole of conversation for many day previous to mind have be concerned with image of lucy sister be aware that ayala have be a be turned out from rich uncle house given over to comparative poverty of kingsbury crescent at present moment be possessed of what might be considered comfortable income for bachelor have be accustomed to live almost more than comfortably having so lived be aware of that have not adapted for straitened circumstance in spite of advice of a to brewing baking washing capability of female candidate for marriage knew well enough to be aware that wife red with face from kitchen fire must be distasteful to have often told that to look for woman with money must be still more distasteful therefore have thought that for present at least must be well for to remain a be now have come across ayala though in pursuance of philosophy have assured that ayala must be nothing to still found so often reverting to resolution ayala instead of being nothing be very much indeed to three day after hamel be preparing for departure immediately after breakfast what beast be to go said colonel when there can be possible reason for going five daughter bad make necessary that fellow must do little work sometimes why ca make image down here with for model mud out of caller for clay must have slightest objection in art can not perpetuate atrocity of colour a fellow did who painted portrait last winter if will go go make bust at unheard of price so that five daughter may live for ever on fat of land can do good for by going over to glenbogie if must snub that mr traffick who be of men most atrocious power doe exist said colonel must snub honourable septimus that man be possessed of strength thoroughly envy be perhaps more enviable than other gift god can give word can not penetrate that skin of satire flow off like water from duck ridicule doe not touch fellest abuse doe not succeed in inflicting slightest wound have learnt great secret that man can not be cut who will not be cut a be worth man while to protract enmity with one a suffers from prolonged enmity walk unassailable by dart be must say happiest man in london then fear can hing for at glenbogie to mollify aunt emmeline must fear be beyond power sir thomas a far a can see doe not require much mollifying sir thomas might give young woman thousand two be not way in desire to keep good hat on head said hamel a seated in little carriage be to take down to callerfoot colonel remained at drumcaller till end of september when presence be required at aldershot during time shot good deal in obedience to good natured behest of lord glentower in spite of up

tried to have ayala here fear will not come off lady albury be good natured at last did not quite like writing to mr dosett so mamma wrote lady answer be very stiff thought better for ayala to remain among own friend poor ayala be clear that knight will be wanted to go in armour get out of prison will leave to to say who must be knight hope will come for day two before go to aldershot stay till st of october will be beast if lady albury say never mean to ask again oh stubbs said sir harry stubbs be one of fellow who never come if be asked of course sat upon then declared that be dearest friend

to nephew colonel stubbs dear jonathan did best for protege be afraid will not succeed aunt mr dosett seems to think that a ayala be fated to live with ayala have better take fate a find meaning of be that if girl be doomed to have dull life have better not begin with little pleasure there be good deal to be said for argument if be girl must like to begin with pleasure take chance for reaction must perhaps be vain enough to think that during preliminary course might solve difficulty by beau yeux saw mr dosett once now have have letter from upon whole be inclined to pity poor ayala be very happy here marchese have gone to como to look after property have there be ill natured enough to say that two thing go together in truth be never comfortable out of italy have slice of red meat put before other day decided to start at once on first of october go back to london will remain till end of november have asked nina to come again in november in order that may see hunt know mean that will try to jump over something have leg broken must be here not allow if doe come here will perhaps go down to brighton for fortnight yes do think ayala dormer be very pretty girl do think also that be clever quite agree that be ladylike therefore think that be just such girl a such man a colonel jonathan stubbs ought to marry be one of human being who seem to have be removed out of world brought up in though know ever so much that nobody else know be ignorant of ever so much that everybody ought to know wandering through grove seated by brook shivering with on top of mountain must be charming doubt whether must be equally good at top of table looking after child keeping week account must tease with poetry not even pretend to be instructed when told how army ought to be moved say nothing a to fact that have got penny though be just in position make necessary for man to get money with wife therefore be altogether indisposed to matrimonial outlook in direction affectionate aunt beatrice

tennis when know must be cut out by mr ponsonby if day in november be to come off then will come coach across country tell sir harry say so will bring three horse for one week think very hard about poor ayala dormer what can knight do in case when young lady be handed over to custody of uncle aunt becomes that uncle aunt individual property mr dosett may be most noxious dragon that ever be created for mortification general misery of imprisoned damsel still be omnipotent only knight who can be of service be one who will go with ring in hand absolutely carry prisoner away by force of marriage service unfortunate cousin be so exclusively devoted to duty of fighting country battle that have not even time to think of step so momentous a poor ayala be stupid enough to accuse of pitying because can not be knight to release can not think how happy must be at stalham struggling to beat mr ponsonby at lawn tennis then risking cropper when happy day of november must come round loving cousin j s colonel stubbs to marchesa baldoni dear aunt letter be worthy of queen of sheba if a be doubt case corresponded with king solomon a for ayala fate if be fate to live with mr dosett can only submit to can not carry over to italy must marchese allow to divide italian good thing with nina poor little bird have chance of living amidst diamond bank note with tringle millionaire threw away after fashion that understand doubt be fool can not like better for hardly think that fortnight at stalham with sir harry luxury around must do much service a for myself top of table future companion who be to be doomed to listen to military lucubration be altogether inclined to agree with seeing that write in pure spirit of worldly good sense doubt queen of sheba gave advice of same sort to king solomon never knew woman to speak confidentially of matrimony otherwise than a matter of pound shilling penny in counsel so given word of love have ever be known to creep in why must seeing that love can not put leg of mutton into pot imagine say in spirit either of censure satire idea be own must ever marry will do so in strict accordance with tenet thinking altogether of weekly account determined to eschew sitting by side of brook have told nina about plan will be at stalham in november to see that doe not break neck yours always j s chapter xxi ayala indignation perhaps mr dosett have just cause for refusing sanction for proposed visit to albury if fate did require that ayala must live permanently in kingsbury crescent gaiety of very gay house wealth of very wealthy house must hardly be good preparation for life up to time of going to marchesa in brook street ayala have certainly done best to suit to aunt manner though have done with pain suffering have hemmed towel mended sheet have made round to shop have endeavoured to attend to pound of meat to sympathise with aunt in interest taken in relic of joint a escaped from hungry treatment of two maiden in kitchen ayala have be clever enough to understand that aunt have be wounded by lucy indifference not so much because have desired to avail herself of lucy labour a from feeling that indifference have seemed to declare that own pursuit be mean vulgar understanding have struggled to make pursuit own have in part succeeded aunt must talk to about butter washing matter a to lip have be closed in conversation with lucy that ayala be struggling mr dosett have be aware have thought that such struggle be good have not be hopeless then came visit to brook street ayala returned quite altered young woman seemed a though must must struggle longer hate mutton bone said to aunt one morning soon after return doubt must like meat joint best said aunt frowning hate joint too have dare say be cockered up at marchesa with made dish hate dish said ayala petulantly hate eating yes do be ignoble nature must have managed differently ought to have sucked in from atmosphere through finger hair a tree do by leaf there must have be butcher grease nasty smell from kitchen gin be worse than allusion to mild unfashionable stimulant to mr dosett have be reduced by good nature be flying in face of creator miss said aunt margaret in most angry voice in face of creator who made everything ordained what creature must eat drink by infinite wisdom nevertheless said ayala think might have done without boiled mutton then turned to article of domestic needlework be in lap so a to show that in spite of wickedness of opinion did not mean to be idle mr dosett in wrath snatched work from niece hand carried out of room thus declaring that not even pillow case in house must owe stitch to hand of girl so ungrateful so blasphemous wrath wore off soon ayala though not contrite be meek walked home with aunt on following morning patiently carrying pound of butter six egg small lump of bacon in basket after that pillow case be recommitted to there still be left evidence enough that girl mind have be upset by luxury of brook street evidence to aunt margaret paid very much attention insisting upon in colloquy with husband think that little amusement be good for young people said uncle reginald weakly for old people too doubt about if can get so a not to do harm at same time nothing can be good for young woman unfits for state of life to have pleased god to call ayala have to live with doubt there be

pretty mr dosett be supposed to be plain ayala be interesting while mr dosett from nature of circumstance be most uninteresting be agreed on side at stalham so pretty bird a ayala must not be

making great friend to pretty girl whose eldest son be a yet only nine so that there must be no danger to herself own flock there be much ridicule thrown on mr dosett at stalham many pretty thing said of bird who be so unworthily imprisoned in kingsbury crescent at last there be something like conspiracy purport of be to get bird out of cage in november in conspiracy can hardly be said that marchesa took active part much a liked ayala be le prone than lady albury to think that girl be ill used be more keenly alive than cousin rather cousin wife to hard necessity of world ayala must be said to have made own bed at rate there be bed must lie on be not dosetts fault that be poor according to mean be doing best must for niece be entitled to praise rather than abuse then marchesa be afraid for nephew colonel stubbs in letter to have declared that quite agreed with view a to matrimony be quite alive to nephew sarcasm nephew though might in truth agree with nevertheless be sarcastic though be sarcastic still might be made to accede to view because did in truth agree with be eminently intelligent woman seeing far into character knew pretty well real condition of nephew mind must foresee conduct must marry before long might not improbably marry girl with money if one must be made to come in way who must at same time suit somewhat fastidious taste ayala suited taste ayala who have not shilling marchesa thought only too likely that if ayala be released from cage brought to albury ayala might become mr jonathan stubbs that ayala must refuse to become mr jonathan

prevail at stalham of course do said lady albury poor little girl have heard so much about of goodness to mr dosett know be mother to still little country air must not be beneficial do say that will come to mr dosett then mr dosett felt disagreeable a be must preach sermon wife have preached to did preach spoke timidly of own poverty need there be that ayala must share spoke word of danger might

have felt to be duty not husband husband came did not a heaven might be propitious that ayala must go to stalham for sake of finding husband be certainly beyond extent of providing care in fact how be girl to have chance at unless be allowed to see one of course say with reference to house there will be young men there anything of kind taking broad view unless let girl like have what chance come in way how be to get on think have hardly right to do have done for best be sure of mr dosett hope will tell mr dosett with compliment how thoroughly appreciate goodness must have called upon instead of

to marry man in same class a if continued care a to small pecuniary need be to be future lot then certainly comfort must only be disturbed by such visit a now proposed be not probable that such must be destiny in store for mr dosett knew world well enough to be aware that pretty girl such a ayala can not find rich husband merely by exhibiting prettiness kingsbury crescent unalloyed by danger of stalham must certainly be most secure then have be told that ayala now have special chance offered to that have right to rob of chance felt more strongly because be not daughter only niece with

others stood still for moment looking intently at few hound who with tail feathering in air with nose down seemed at same time to be irresolute determined knowing that scent be there not yet quite fixed a to line moment colonel said standing up in stirrup with left hand raised while right held rein whip close down on horse neck moment only whispered then shook head angrily a heard ill timed

hardly seemed to be that of hound larry knew spinney knew brook knew fox perhaps be aware of spot at brute must cross water if did cross brute did cross water therefore there be cranbury brook between many of forward rider line sir harry be then with two three other farmer larry have lead two girl be with tony tappett though have got up to hound did not endeavour to ride straight to a did larry twentyman be old unambitious very anxious to know where hound be so that might be with must want assistance of voice counsel anxious to be near enough to take fox from must run into taking glory in jumping over fence if must avoid creeping about here there knowing from experience nearly turn in animal mind aware of impediment must delay riding fast only when impediment be far between taking amusement to out of riding with heart cruelly bloodily ruthlessly set upon killing animal before to kill fox must imperil neck for glory of riding must not soil boot if must help after girl came colonel somewhat shorn of honour in be no longer giving lead doing best to maintain pace twentyman be making very good now young lady said twentyman give head let do just a please alongside of other not too near to be brook confluent of cranbury brook be wide enough to require good deal of jumping may be supposed that two young lady did not understand much of instruction given to to hold breath be brave be only idea present to rest must come from instinct chance other side of brook be heaven must be purgatory larry fearing perhaps that order a to not being too near might not be obeyed added little to own pace so a to be clear of nevertheless be only few stride behind have larry horse missed footing there must have be mess a be took brook side by side close to other landed full of delight glory on opposite bank bravo young lady shouted twentyman oh nina be divine said ayala nina be little too much out of breath for answering simply threw up eye to heaven made flourish with whip

ingenuity of man there be deep dell in bramble bracken be so thick that hound careful of snout must penetrate undergrowth of wood be so interwoven that huntsman must see through depth there be dark nook so impervious that fox ignorant of theory of own scent must have wondered why hound must have be induced to creep into space so narrow from one side to of wood hunted brute must traverse always seem to have at last succeeded in putting persecutor at fault so be on occasion run while lasted have occupied perhaps three quarter of hour during time equally long poor old tony be to be seen

to show there be have better read by will come to again in hour then very solemnly with trace of ill mr dosett left room there be something in tone gait so exceedingly solemn that ayala be almost frightened of course letter must be about colonel stubbs of course writer of must find fault with be conscious that be adding one to terribly long list of sin in not consenting to marry colonel stubbs be misfortune that friend found fault with everything that did among there be not one not even nina who fully sympathised with not even to lucy must expatiate with certainty of sympathy in regard to angel of light now though aunt be apparently not angry only solemn felt already sure that be to be told that be duty to marry colonel stubbs be only other day that aunt be preaching to a to propriety of marrying cousin tom seemed said to herself that people thought that girl be bound to marry man who must provide house for bread to eat clothes to wear passed through mind a slowly drew lady albury letter from envelope prepared to read letter be a follows stalham monday th november dear madam niece will return to a request on thursday before reach think duty to inform of little circumstance have occurred here cousin colonel jonathan stubbs who be also nephew of marchesa baldoni have made miss dormer offer be bound to add did not think improbable that must be so when called on husband begged to allow niece to come to did not then know cousin intention a fact doubt whether knew from what have heard thought probable a conceive that young lady must be fortunate in becoming cousin wife have scruple have proposed to have rejected have set heart upon matter be most anxious that must succeed because know to be man who will not easily brook disappointment where have set heart of men know be most steadfast in purpose took liberty of speaking to niece on subject be disposed to think that be deferred by feeling of foolish romance partly because doe not like name partly because cousin be not handsome man in girl eye more probably however have built up to herself poetic fiction dream of know not what if be so be pity that must lose opportunity of settling well happily in life gave a reason that did not love experience be not so long a yours perhaps such a have have taught to think that wife will love husband when find used well at point mercenary marriage be of course bad be pity think that girl such a niece must lose chance of so much happiness by freak of romance colonel stubbs who be only twenty eight year of age have staff appointment at aldershot have private mean of own on alone must be justified in marrying on death of uncle general stubbs will inherit considerable accession of fortune be not of course rich man have ample for want of family in other good gift temper manliness truth tenderness know one to excel must trust young friend of own into hand with perfect safety have thought right to tell will use own judgment in saying what think fit to niece must be made to understand that own immediate friend approve of offer must probably be induced to accept have not heard cousin say what may be future plan think possible that a be quite in earnest will not take one repulse must ask again hope that niece may receive with altered view pray believe to be dear madam yours sincerely rosaline albury ayala read letter twice over before aunt returned to a read felt something of feeling of renewed kindness come upon in reference to writer of not that be in least changed in own resolution that liked lady albury for wishing to change reason given however be altogether impotent with colonel stubbs have mean of keeping wife if be reason then also ought to marry cousin tom tringle colonel stubbs be good true so also very probably be tom tringle must not compare two men knew that cousin tom be altogether distasteful to while took delight in companionship of colonel reason for marrying one be to thinking a strong a for marrying other there must be only one valid excuse for marriage that of adoring man be quite sure that did not adore colonel jonathan stubbs lady albury have said in letter that girl must be sure to love man who treated well after marriage must not suffice for be to marry at must be necessary that must love man before marriage have read letter dear said mr dosett a entered room closed door carefully behind spoke almost in whisper seemed to be altogether changed by magnitude of occasion yes aunt margaret have read suppose be true true be true in part did meet colonel stubbs oh yes met have met before yes aunt margaret used to come to brook street be marchesa nephew did question aunt margaret asked in very low whisper most solemn voice did make love to in brook street said ayala sharply not at not at never thought of such thing never dreamed of such thing when began talking to out in wood at stalham on saturday have be be on friendly term with very friendly term be quite friend used to talk about manner of thing be very fond of never afraid of anything that said to be be cousin seemed almost to be cousin too then do like of course do everybody must like be reason why must want to marry upon mr dosett sat silent for awhile turning great matter over in thought be quite clear to word ayala have spoken be true probable also that lady albury word be true in inmost thought regarded ayala a fool here be girl who have not shilling of own who be simply burden on relative whom did not especially love who be doomed to life be essentially distasteful to for in respect to herself house mr dosett have sense enough to acknowledge who seemed devoted to society of rich gay people yet must not take opportunity be offered of escaping what disliked going to loved two offer have now be made to of thoroughly eligible to of must objection have be made by of person concerned sir thomas have shown to be absolutely anxious for success of son now seemed that grand relation of colonel stubbs be in favour of match what be in ayala entitled to such promotion mr dosett did not quite perceive to eye niece be fantastic girl pretty indeed not endowed with regular tranquil beauty thought to be of feminine grace most attractive why tom tringle must have be so deeply smitten with ayala have be marvel to now story of colonel stubbs be greater marvel ayala said ought to think better of think better of what aunt margaret have seen what lady albury say about cousin colonel stubbs what have to do with believe what say if so why must not accept because ca said ayala have idea what be to become of future life said mr dosett very gravely not in least said ayala be fib because have idea in fullness of time must be heavenly fate to put hand into of angel of light gentleman wo come running after always dear be almost a bad a being told by aunt emmeline that have encouraged cousin tom be great shame to say that want anybody to run after never did dear think that ever did mr dosett who be justice did acknowledge to herself that of such fault a suggested ayala be innocent fault be quite in other direction consisted of unwillingness to settle to free relation of burden of maintaining when proper opportunity arose for doing so only want to explain to that people must must must make hay while sun shine be young now be not one twenty yet said ayala proudly one twenty be very good time for girl to marry be to say if proper sort of gentleman asks think ought to be scolded because seem to to be proper sort want anybody to come nobody ought to be talked to about at if cared about one uncle reginald did not approve then might talk to think that anything ought to be said about anybody unless like so conversation be over mr dosett felt that have be entirely vanquished lady albury letter be shown to mr dosett refused to say word to niece on subject in argument followed between wife took niece part opposing altogether that idea that hay must be made while sun shine simply mean selling said mr dosett be nonsense reginald of course such girl a ayala have to do best can with good look what else have to depend upon brother in law will do something for hope will though think that very safe reed to depend upon a have twice offended of course girl think of marrying ayala must be very much disgusted if be told that be to be old maid live upon l year supplied by sir thomas bounty might have be that must have to do now that chance be open ought to take must choose between cousin tom colonel stubbs must tell that if will not will no longer be responsible for to mr dosett turned altogether deaf ear be quite sure that responsibility must be continued till ayala must marry till must die must not make threat must certainly be unable to carry out must be very glad if ayala must bring to marry of young men be pity that must feel compelled to refuse offer so excellent be matter for own judgment one in must not interfere for two day almost led to coldness between man wife during suffering of poor mr dosett be heartrending not many day after ayala return sister lucy came to see certain reason have caused lady tringle to stay at glenbogie longer than usual family be now passing through london on way to merle park perhaps be fact that trafficks have be effectually extruded from glenbogie must doubtless turn up at merle park must lady tringle take up residence there before autumn be over that must spend christmas at merle park be acknowledged thing to mamma tringle acknowledged benefit because liked to have daughter with to papa tringle acknowledged evil because

evening will walk on stage at once without dinner wish have heard kind of thing said to must not have thought have gone to walk with for own pleasure have not deserved think not nevertheless bore woman of course can say what plea there be docimer hope wo call coward mr docimer came out on terrace on two be standing looking a sour a death be going by diligence to innspruck afternoon said mr

own consent passed away from have spent sweet fresh year of youth who knew must know that have be so have told that must be fate to purchase for husband with beauty might be so at rate did not doubt own beauty if be to be so then romance charm of life be gone have quite agreed that six hundred year lodging in marylebone must be quite unendurable what be there left for must be endurable must be happy with prospect of gertrude tringle money must not be happy looking forward to unloved husband who be to be purchased by beauty chapter xxix at merle park sir thomas took real holiday of year at

november there must be three month before parliament must meet curse be not muttered just formed between teeth a saw hat sir thomas in angriest mood never went so far a quite to mutter curse will one have to expiate anathema be well kept within barrier of teeth only have achieved amount of utterance sir went on with servant at heel chucking about door rather violently till found mr traffick alone in drawing room mr traffick have have glass of sherry bitter brought in for refreshment sir thomas saw glass on mantelpiece never took sherry bitter one glass of wine with two o'clock mutton chop sufficed till dinner be very well to be member of parliament after member of parliament never do anything men who work take sherry bitter men who work put hat in other people hall without leave from master of house where be mistress said sir thomas to man without taking notice of son in law lady have only just come in from driving be very cold have gone up to dress sir thomas went out of room again banging door again taking notice of mr traffick mr traffick put hand up to mantelpiece finished sherry bitter dear said mr traffick to wife up in bed room father have come down in one of tantrum knew must said augusta doe not signify least give kiss when see seem to notice there be not man in world have higher regard for than father if one be to see in one of tantrum must suppose meant to be uncivil hope wo be downright unkind septimus said wife never fear kindest hearted man in world be father so be here be first word of greeting sir thomas addressed to wife in bed room yes tom be here when did come well to tell truth found here sir thomas restrained word on right inside of teeth thought be to be here day sooner so came on wednesday morning be to come know wish knew when be to go want to turn own daughter out of own house why doe get house of own for for sake why doe do have spending of l year of money yet be to keep want to turn daughter out of house will end in turning out when week have passed by mr traffick have not be a yet turned out sir thomas when came back to merle park on following friday condescended to speak to son in law to say something to a to news of day did in evident spirit of preconceived hostility everything be down again said fluctuation be always common at time of year said traffick observe that trade always becomes brisk little before christmas to man with fixed income like doe much matter said sir thomas be looking at in public light exactly man who have income never spends need not trouble with private view a to money market mr traffick rubbed hand asked whether new building at back of lombard street premise be nearly finished mr traffick economy have deleterious effect upon gertrude poor girl did not deserve sir thomas deeply resolving in mind that must at not very distant date find mean by must rid of mr traffick declared to that must not at rate burden with son in law of same kind frank houston be to thinking of same kind therefore hardened heart against frank houston now frank houston must have got wife with l year a mr traffick have done must certainly not have troubled tringle mansion with too much of presence must have be object to remove a far a possible from tringles to have enjoyed life luxuriously with proceeds of wife fortune hope in respect be unjustly impeded by mr traffick parsimony soon after leaving hotel in tyrol at lately saw frank houston wrote to lady love declaring impatience of ardour suggesting that must be convenient if everything must be settled before christmas in letter declared to gertrude how very uncomfortable be to to have to discus money matter with father be so disagreeable that did not think that must bring to do again if must only be urgent with father must of course prevail acting upon gertrude determined to be urgent with father on second coming to merle park when a have be explained sir thomas be in frame of mind very much opposed to impecunious son in law previous to attacking father gertrude have tried hand again upon mother lady tringle have declined if anything be to be done must do lady tringle have said papa said gertrude having followed into little sitting room where digested arranged telegram when at merle park wish something must be settled about mr houston sir thomas at moment be very angry mr traffick have not only asked for loan of carriage to take into hastings have expressed wish that there might be peculiar kind of claret served at dinner with be conversant to be much attached then said may a well have settled at once how papa may understand for good will have nothing to do with mr houston papa must be very cruel dear if call cruel will not allow to come talk to at cruel indeed what be idea of cruelty everybody know that be attached to other everybody know nothing of kind know nothing of kind be only making fool of mr houston be penniless adventurer be only attached to money will never see penny of be not adventurer papa be much le like adventurer than mr traffick have income of own only be not much about a much a must pay bill at club for cigar champagne may make mind at rest for will not give mr houston shilling why must man expect to live out of earnings who never did day work in life gertrude left room despondently a there be nothing more to be done on occasion seemed to a though be being used with utmost cruelty augusta have be allowed to marry man without shilling have be enriched with l why must be treated worse than augusta be very strongly of opinion that frank houston be very much better than septimus traffick mr traffick aptitude for saving money be already known to whole household frank must never wish to save frank must spend income for like gentleman frank must not hang about glenbogie merle park till must be turned out everybody be fond of frank gertrude have already learnt to despise mr traffick member of parliament though be have already begun to think that having be chosen by frank houston who be decidedly man of fashion have proved to be of higher calibre than sister augusta father refusal to have be not only very rough very decided must not abandon frank such idea never for moment crossed mind what step must next take thinking over during whole of day did at last form plan greatly feared that plan must not recommend to mr frank houston be not timid might be so in spite of father anger roughness must not doubt ultimate generosity frank might doubt if frank must be induced to come carry off from merle park marry in manner approved for such occasion must stand risk of getting money afterwards be greatly afraid that risk must be too much for frank did not however see other scheme before a to waiting patiently till father obdurate heart must be softened by greater obduracy of own love there be tedium prolonged dulness in such prospect be anything attractive to have be possible must have made bargain with father if wo give l let begin with l even feared must not altogether be agreeable to frank let think of how must plan of being run away with seemed alone to be feasible not altogether disagreeable be necessary that must answer lover letter embargo have a yet be put upon correspondence therefore must send reply without external difficulty dear frank said quite agree with about christmas ought to be settled have very bad news to send to have be to papa a told be very unkind nothing must be worse said that ought to earn bread be of course humbug did understand that there ought to be gentleman who never earn bread be sure if have be earning bread by going to lombard street day must have ever cared for say that will not give single shilling think be angry because augusta husband will come live here always be disgusting of course be fault be that else money have gone wrong perhaps have very bad fit of indigestion be however so savage that really know how to go to again mamma be quite afraid of doe not dare say word because be who managed about mr traffick what ought to be done of course like to think that must be kept waiting be not sure that quite like will do anything propose be not afraid of running little risk if must get married without knowing anything about be sure must give money afterwards because be always so good natured in long run so generous can be very savage must be sure to forgive how must be if be to go away be of age believe that one must stop if must manage that must get married in way must do best know people can get married at ostend see what else be to be done can write to at present here nothing wrong will come of augusta say that if papa be to begin to suspect anything about going away must stop letter dear frank be yours always always most lovingly gertrude need be bit afraid must be quite up to going off if must arrange believe papa said mr traffick on afternoon of day on be written that gertrude be thinking of doing something wrong therefore feel to be duty to bring letter augusta have not be enabled to read letter have discussed with sister propriety of eloping wo advise have said if do mr houston must arrange to be married at ostend know can be done second thought have perhaps told that such arrangement must be injurious to noble blood of traffick family have therefore felt to be duty to extract letter from family letter box to give to father daughter who must so excellently do duty must surely not be turned out before parliament met sir thomas took letter said not word to elder child when be alone doubted be half minded to send letter on what harm must two fool do by writing to other while held string of purse there must be marriage then bethought of paternal authority of right have to know that daughter did opened letter there ought to be gentleman who earn bread ought there said to if so gentleman ought not to come to for bread be already supporting one such be quite enough mamma be quite afraid of doe dare say word that rather liked be sure must give money afterwards be sure must do such thing said to reflected that in such condition must rather be delighted than otherwise in watching impecunious importunity of baffled son in law next sentence reconciled girl to almost entirely be always so good natured in long run so generous for good natured did not care much liked to be thought generous then calmly tore letter in little bit threw into waste paper basket sat for ten minute thinking what have better do finding task thus imposed upon to be much more difficult than distribution of loan at last determined that if

must not even make attempt knew well enough to be aware that be in many respect ignorant must have endeavoured to take bracelet personally to ayala have not be conscious that must not recommend present with such romantic phrase touch of poetry a must be gratifying to fine sense be to find in presence with necklace must depend on for word letter might be sent in own handwriting poetry romance of might be supplied by now have happened that tom have formed marvellous friendship in rome with colonel stubbs have be hunting together in campagna tom have be enabled to accommodate colonel with

colonel said just a be going to bed wonder if must give hour before breakfast be matter of great importance tom a said assumed most solemn face hour if like dear boy be generally up soon after six be always out on horseback before breakfast a soon a light serf then if will have called at half past seven will be ever so much obliged to next morning at eight two be closeted together tom immediately extracted parcel from pocket opened diamond to view upon word be pretty little trinket said colonel taking necklace in hand three hundred guinea said tom opening eye very wide daresay be must have be

not a much a must buy pair of glove love bit le for a to income governor will stump up like brick now want to write letter be kind of thing third person ca do said colonel when have considered request for moment why not yes can do say just simplest word a come up be sure to go further with girl than what man may write be impossible that man must be natural on task a natural know about natural said tom who be anxious now to explain character of lady in question know that letter be particularly natural must please touch of poetry romance must go further than anything natural who be lady asked colonel who certainly be by time entitled to be so far inquisitive be cousin ayala dormer who ayala dormer cousin be at rome think ever saw there have seen since said colonel have did know be with aunt marchesa baldoni dear so be never put two thing together admire certainly do dear fellow ca write letter for then put down pen have taken up a though have intended to comply with friend request may take a settled can not write impossible one man must never write such letter for man have better give thing in person be if mean to go on with matter will certainly go on with said tom stoutly after certain time know reiterated offer do know do do partake of nature of persecution reiterated refusal be sort of persecution like seems to that ayala miss dormer mean must be protected by sort of feeling feeling of of what may perhaps call dependent position be peculiarly peculiarly situated if married must be much better situated must give everything want be affair of money mr tringle tom felt from use of word mister that be in way giving offence felt also that there be true cause for offence when man offer everything said asks for nothing think must be said to persecute after time becomes persecution be sure ayala must feel so cousin ca suppose that be ill using said tom who disliked ayala quite a much a did mister miss dormer meant can have nothing further to say about ca write letter must not imagine that ayala miss dormer must be moved in least by present must possibly be made to must go out now if mind for hour will be back in time for breakfast then tom be left alone with necklace lying on table before knew that something be wrong with colonel must not in least guess what might be be quite aware that early in interview colonel have encouraged to persevere with lady have then suddenly not only advised to desist have told in so many word that be bound to desist out of consideration for lady colonel have spoken of cousin in manner be distasteful to must not analyse feeling did not exactly know why be displeased be displeased colonel when asked for assistance be of course bound to talk about lady must be compelled by nature of confidence to mention lady name must even have be called on to write christian name must have done with delicacy almost with blush instead of ayala name have be common on tongue tom felt to be offended hardly knew why then why have be called mister tringle breakfast be eaten shortly afterwards in company of three four other men be not eaten in comfort then tom hurried back to london to lombard street after failure tom felt to be impossible to go to friend for assistance there have be annoyance in describing love to colonel stubbs pain in treatment have received even have there be friend to whom must have confided task must not have brought to encounter repetition of such treatment be a firmly fixed a ever in conviction that must not write letter a thought of word with must accompany personal presentation of necklace reflected that in probability might not be able to force way into ayala presence then happy thought struck mr dosett be altogether on side everybody be on side except ayala pigheaded colonel must not be excellent thing to entrust necklace to hand of aunt dosett in order that might give over to ayala with eloquence in power satisfied with project at once wrote note to mr dosett dear aunt want to see on most important business if will not be troubling will call upon to morrow at ten o'clock before go to place of business yours affectionately t tringle junior on following morning apparelled with ring be good hearted well intentioned young man with excellent quality must have be slow of intellect when have not a yet learnt deleterious effect of ring on occasion put on ring chain bright waistcoat made thing disgusting to be looked at by well trained female a far a aunt be concerned must have be altogether indifferent a to appearance there be present to mind small hope that might be allowed to see ayala a immediate result of necklace must see ayala then how unfortunate must be that must present before eye of mistress without adornment did not doubt must be grateful to have heard from ayala own lip that thing ought to be pretty therefore endeavoured to make pretty of course failed a do men who endeavour to make pretty be out of question that must understand cause of failure aunt dosett want to do very great favour began with solemn voice be going to party tom said party who give party in london at time of day oh mean because have just got few thing on when call anywhere always do have got lady to see lady of rank so just made change be fib what can do for tom want to look at then brought out necklace taking out of case displayed gem tastefully upon

very pretty think be pretty well aunt dosett price for little trifle be three hundred guinea a said looked into aunt face for increased admiration gave three hundred guinea for went with ready money in hand when tempted man with cheque to let have for two hundred fifty pound in buying jewelry must always do never buy jewelry said mr dosett crossly if must mean now will tell what want to do be for ayala for ayala yes indeed be not fellow to stick at trifle when want to carry purpose bought other day gave ready money for two hundred fifty pound on purpose to give to ayala in naming value of course will do when give might a well say three hundred guinea be price on ticket saw so there wo be untruth know be to give be just what want when talk to flare up a likely a not 'd fling necklace at head must do hope must depend upon how thing went when do talk to always seems that nothing say can be right now if will give can put in manner of pretty thing will be prettiest thing said mr dosett be just what be thinking everybody agrees that diamond will go further with girl than anything else when told governor quite jumped at idea sir thomas know be giving oh dear yes have to get rhino from go about with two hundred fifty pound always in own pocket if have sent money to ayala how much better must have be said poor mr dosett think that at who ever heard of making present to young lady in money ayala be romantic must have be most unromantic thing out must not have done least good in world must simply have gone to buy boot petticoat such like girl must never be brought to think of lover merely by putting on pair of boot when fastens necklace a round throat ought to have chance think so aunt dosett tom will tell something said aunt what be aunt dosett believe that have chance do mean that asked sorrowfully do think that necklace will do good not least of course will offer to if wish because uncle quite approve of a husband for ayala be bound to tell truth think necklace will do good then sat silent for time meditating upon condition might be imprudent might be wrong done to father to jeopardise necklace how must be if ayala be to take necklace not to take be to give asked yes said bravely with sigh give same from from sir thomas oh from from if be told came from governor 'd keep whether be sure hope will keep said trying to remove bad impression former word might perhaps have left may be sure will not keep said mr dosett unless must intend to accept hand of can hold out hope to there be matter tom think must tell a be so straightforward in offer gentleman have asked to marry have accepted exclaimed tom have not accepted have refused then be just where be said tom have refused think that be in sort of way attached to though too have be refused imagine that chance be better than yours who d be said tom jumping up from seat in great excitement tom exclaimed mr dosett beg pardon see be very important who be fellow be one colonel jonathan stubbs who colonel jonathan stubbs impossible ca be colonel stubbs know colonel stubbs can assure be true tom have have letter from lady relative of colonel stubbs telling whole story colonel stubbs said that pass anything ever heard have refused yes have refused have not accepted since certainly have not accepted yet may give bracelet same said tom hurrying out of room that colonel stubbs must have made offer to ayala yet have accepted tom tringle confidence chapter xxxii tom despair reader will understand that fate of necklace be very soon decided ayala declared that be very beautiful have indeed pretty taste for diamond must have be proud enough to call necklace own a declared to aunt must not accept tom though be made of diamond from head to foot accept tom when must not even bring to think of becoming wife of jonathan stubbs if colonel stubbs must not be received by imagination a angel of light how immeasurably distant from anything angelic must be tom tringle of course must go back said when question have to be decided a to future fate of necklace a consequence poor mr dosett be compelled to make special journey into city to deposit well sealed parcel in hand of tom tringle cousin sends kind regard said can not bring to accept magnificent present tom have be very much put about since visit to crescent have aunt merely told that present must be inefficacious must have taken assurance a being simply opinion must have still entertained hope in diamond tidings a to lover crushed altogether such lover very man whom have asked to write letter for why have not colonel stubbs told truth when thus own secret have become revealed by accident understood now ayala mister reason why colonel must not write letter then became very angry with colonel whom bitterly accused of falsehood treason what right have colonel to meddle with cousin at how false have be to say nothing of what have done when rival have told everything in way made up mind that be duty to hate colonel stubbs if possible to inflict personal punishment upon be reckless of now if must only get one good blow at colonel head with thick stick must be indifferent a to what law might do with afterwards perhaps might be able to provoke colonel stubbs to fight with have idea duel at present be not in fashion nevertheless in such case a man ought to fight must at rate have gratification of calling colonel coward if must refuse to fight be more wretched because spirit within be cowed by idea of colonel did acknowledge to that chance must be bad while rival a colonel stubbs stood in way tried to argue with that be not so a far a knew colonel stubbs be must remain very much le rich man than doubted very much whether colonel stubbs must keep carriage in london for wife while have be already arranged that be to be allowed to do so must succeed in marrying ayala to be partner in house of travers treason be much greater thing than to be colonel though assured of again again still be cowed there be something about colonel did more than redeem red hair ugly mouth of something poor tom be sensible nevertheless if occasion must arise thought that must punch colonel head not without evil consequence to still that must punch colonel head not minding consequence such have be condition of mind when left crescent be not improved by receipt of parcel hardly said word when uncle put into hand merely muttering something consigning diamond to desk did not tell that ayala must now be abandoned must have be better for if must have done so real springing hopeful hope departed from bosom came from colonel rather than from rejected necklace did send that jewelry father asked day afterwards yes sent what have now become of be in desk there did send back again came back uncle dosett brought want to say anything more about if please be sorry for tom very sorry a have set heart upon wish must have be a must have necklace must not be left there tom shook head in despair have better let have necklace be not must grudge to tom if must do good will have sir will be better so be understanding then necklace be transferred to receptacle belonging to sir thomas lock of might probably

told father on one occasion that have devoted for fortnight to champagne theatre have be taken a joke have be fairly punctual at place of business have shown symptom of fast living now occurred to that fast living must be only thing for have be quite willing to apply to marriage steady life fortune have not favoured if drank too much now lay in bed became idle be not fault there came into head

only on plea that other name available for club have already be appropriated in metropolis there be certainly nothing in club peculiarly applicable to mountain then there be other club in london with

responsible not only for lamentable condition of lover also of of friend for in softer moment tom have told thing to faddle faddle have declared that must be true to death to friend suffering such unmerited misfortune perhaps fidelity of faddle may have owed something to fact that tom pecuniary allowance be more generous than accorded to to ayala must be attributed occurrence of misfortune tom

isadore hamel in lombard street in following result of tom presentation of necklace have got beyond period story be presumed to have reached tom be in durance during christmas week must go back to promise have be made by uncle sir thomas to lucy about six week before time promise have extended only to undertaking on part of sir thomas to see isadore hamel if must call at house in lombard street at certain hour on certain day lucy be overwhelmed with gratitude when promise be made few moment previously have be indignant because uncle have appeared to speak of lover a two beggar sir thomas have explained in sort apologised then have come promise to lucy seemed to contain assurance of effectual aid sir thomas must not have asked to see lover have intended to be hostile to lover something must be done to solve difficulty have seemed to lucy to be so grave must not longer be made to think that must give up lover home under uncle roof have be terribly distressing to because have be well aware that on leaving uncle house must be taken in only by lover to whom immediate marriage must be ruinous yet must not undertake to give up lover therefore uncle promise have made very happy forgave ungenerous allusion to two beggar letter be written to isadore in high spirit know what uncle tom intends mean to be kind of course must go to if be must tell everything about everything be not strict hard like aunt emmeline mean to be good too be sometimes so very hard be happier now because think something will be done to relieve from terrible weight be to sometimes wish that have never come to in kensington garden because have become such burden to there be much more in lucy doubt went on to declare burden a be intended to be persistent hamel when received letter be resolved to keep appointment made for hope be not very high have be angry with lady tringle in first place because of treatment of at glenbogie then much more strongly because have be cruel to lucy did conceive to be under strong debt of gratitude to sir thomas though have be invited to lunch be aware that tringles have despised repaid compliment with heart by despising tringles be to sample of sort of people thought to be of most despicable be not only vulgar rich purse proud conceited a well to thinking there be nothing of such people be entitled to be proud of course make money money out of money employment regarded a vile creating nothing useful beautiful to create something useful be to thinking very good to create something beautiful be almost divine to manipulate million till must breed other million be meanest occupation for life energy be thus fear that mr hamel looked at business carried on in lombard street being a yet very young in world seeing many thing with distorted eye be aware that plan must be proposed to might probably accelerate marriage be aware also that must be very unwilling to take advice from sir thomas sir thomas doubt must be coarse rough might perhaps offer pecuniary assistance in manner must make impossible for to accept have told score of time poor a be did not want of tringle money father arbitrary conduct towards have caused great misery have be brought up in luxury have felt hard enough to be deprived of father mean because must not abandon mode of life be congenial to having be thus a be cast off by father have resolved that behoved to depend only on in matter of love be specially prone to be indignant independent one have right to dictate to must follow dictation of none to lucy alone did acknowledge debt to owed everything even for sake must not condescend to accept sir thomas money with money advice lucy have begged in letter to tell everything to uncle must tell sir thomas everything a to income prospect intention because sir thomas a lucy uncle must be entitled to such information thought very improbable that must accept counsel from sir thomas such being condition of hamel mind be to be feared that little good must come from visit to lombard street lucy have simply thought that uncle out of enormous store must provide adequate income hamel thought that sir thomas out of enormous impudence must desire to dictate everything sir thomas be in truth anxious to be good natured to do kindness to niece be not willing to give money without being sure that be putting into good hand oh be hamel said young man to speaking to across counter in lombard street office be tom who a reader will remember have not yet got into trouble on account of policeman tom hamel have never met once before for few moment in coliseum at rome artist not remembering did not know by whom be accosted in familiar manner be name sir said hamel here be card perhaps will do kindness to take to sir thomas tringle right old fellow know about have got puxley with from bank of england just at moment come through into room will soon have polished off old puxley tom be more to hamel than other clerk felt to be aggrieved followed tom into room a be told then prepared to wait in patience for convenience of great man so lucy be going to make match of said tom be terrible to hamel must be possible that clerk in lombard street talked of lucy in way because be niece of senior partner be clerk a matter of course instructed in most private affair of tringle family be here in obedience to direction from sir thomas said hamel ignoring altogether impudent allusion young man have made of course be perhaps know who be not in least said hamel be thomas tringle junior said tom with little accession of dignity beg pardon did not know said hamel ought to be thick rejoined tom because be going in for ayala perhaps have heard that before hamel have heard be well aware that tom be to ayala intolerable burden like old man of sea have heard of tom a poor ayala pet aversion a lover not to be shaken off though have be refused score of time ayala be to sculptor only second in sacredness to lucy now be told by tom that be going in for ayala expression be so distressing to feeling that shuddered when heard be possible that one must say of that be going in for lucy at moment sir thomas opened door grasping hamel by hand led away into own sanctum now mr hamel said sir thomas in cheeriest voice how be hamel declared that be very well expressed hope that sir thomas be same be not so young a be mr hamel year be heavier so be work be worst of when one be young strong one very often have enough to do daresay find so sometimes in profession said hamel go on working though very often sell what do be bad said sir thomas be case always with artist before have made name for be case with many up to last day of life of labour artist have to look for sir thomas dear that seems very sad be sculptor believe yes sir thomas thing make must take deal of room be very heavy at mr hamel only smiled think if be to call auction 'd get something for at suggestion sculptor frowned condescended to make reply sir thomas went on with suggestion if dozen other beginner made sort of gallery among people must buy a do thing in marylebone road stick up somewhere about ground must be better than keeping getting nothing hamel have in studio at home allegorical figure of italia united of prostrate roman catholic church in mind eye saw for moment stuck here there about garden of such place a glenbogie into have be infused poetry of nature conviction of intelligence have never dreamed of selling have never dared to think that lover of art must encourage to put into marble conception of genius now adorned studio standing there in plaster of paris to be so valuable contained so much of thought so many of aspiration that even have marble counterpart be ordered paid for nothing must have induced to part with original now be advised to sell by auction in order that might rival grotesque tradesman whose business be to populate garden of wealthy tasteless briton be thus that idea represented to simply smiled sir thomas did not fail to appreciate smile now about young lady said sir thomas not altogether in so good humour a have be when began suggestion be bad look out for when a say can not sell work when have done think quite understand matter sir thomas perhaps not certainly doe seem unintelligible that man must lumber up with lot of thing can not sell tradesman must know that must get into bankruptcy court if be to go on like what be sauce for goose will be sauce for gander also mr hamel again smiled held tongue if ca sell ware how can keep wife ware a call be of two kind one though doubt made for sale be hardly saleable other be done to order such income a make come from latter head suggested sir thomas bust be generally called well bust call head be head bust take be well never mind sir thomas found difficulty in defining idea of bust man want to have something more le like one to put up in church then pay perhaps in library can put where like when have bought just so there ai many of come in way if understand right not a many a must wish what can net at end of year be question lucy have recommended to tell sir thomas everything have come there determined to tell at rate everything referring to money have not slightest desire to keep amount of income from sir thomas question be put to in so distasteful way that must not bring to be confidential varies with various circumstance be very small very small five hundred year be ill natured because sir thomas knew that mr hamel did not earn five hundred year be becoming acerbated by young man manner oh dear said hamel four hundred four hundred three have never netted three hundred in one year after paying incidental expense seems to to be uncommonly little for young man who be thinking of marrying think have better give up certainly think nothing of kind doe father do anything for nothing at also make head head other thing sell when have made yes sir thomas sell have hard time once now be run after refuse more order than can accept wo do anything for nothing have quarreled with be very bad well now mr hamel must mind telling what idea be sir thomas when asked question still intended to give assistance be still minded that young people must by assistance be enabled to marry be strongly of opinion that be duty a rich protecting uncle to say something about imprudence to magnify difficulty certainly must be wrong for uncle merely because be rich to give away money to dependent relative without reference to hard principle possessor of money always feel to be business to inculcate up to point hamel have done nothing to ingratiate sir thomas be beginning to think that sculptor be impudent prig to declare to must marriage ever take place young couple must not be made welcome at glenbogie merle park still intended to go on with purpose for lucy sake therefore asked sculptor a to idea generally idea be that will marry miss dormer support on earnings of profession idea be that will do so before long in comfort idea also be that will be last to complain of discomfort may arise from straitened circumstance at present idea be that be preparing for happy independent life idea also be assure that of idea be one to cling with fondest assurance will do very best to make life happy when come to grace home there be manliness in must have touched sir thomas have be in better humour a be have be so much irritated by young man manner that must not bring to be just be to understand that intend to marry on something under three hundred year hamel paused moment before made reply how be to answer question said at last seeing that miss dormer be in hand that be unlikely to be influenced by anything may say will be very much influenced said sir thomas be father still alive think must have put head together between decided on what might have be best for lucy happiness do think that be indifferent to happiness demanded sir thomas must have suggested to continued hamel not noticing last question that must remain in own home till must make one for worthy of acceptance then must have arranged among must have be best for happiness can not do with if tell to morrow that must give up protection engagement with then must come to make best of little can do for who say that be going to turn out said sir thomas rising angrily from chair think that one have said of then why do throw in teeth because wife have threatened then sir thomas boiled over in anger one have threatened be untrue be guilty of impertinence untruth in saying so here hamel rose from chair took up hat stop young man hear have to say to have done nothing good to niece nevertheless be true sir thomas that have be told by wife that must either abandon protection of roof find fault with lady tringle for saying so may have be natural expression of judicious opinion when ask after intention in reference to niece be bound to tell propose to subject to undoubted inconvenience of poor home simply because find to be threatened with loss of have not be threatened sir have better ask wife sir thomas if find that what have said be true think will own have be obliged to explain a have done a have told to face have be guilty of untruth will now leave with walked out of room word sir thomas threw after have effect in recalling must be acknowledged that hamel have be very foolish in referring to aunt emmeline threat who doe not know that word be constantly used be intended to have real effect who doe not know that angry woman will often talk after fashion be certainly fact that aunt emmeline have more than once declared to lucy that must not be allowed to remain one of family unless must give up lover lucy in loyal endeavour to explain to lover own position have told of threat from moment have held prepared to find home for future wife must threat be carried into execution sir thomas be well aware that such word have be spoken knew wife knew how little such word signified wife without consent must not have power to turn dog from merle park threat have simply be argument intended to dissuade lucy from choice now have be thrown in teeth just when have intended to make provision for girl who be not in truth related to in order that might ratify choice be very angry with young prig who have thus rushed out of presence be angry too with wife who have brought into difficulty by foolish threat be angry also with knowing that have be wrong to accuse man of falsehood chapter xxxiv never threatened to turn out then there be written following letter be sent received before sir thomas went to merle park therefore also before again saw lucy dearest dearest love have be a desired to lombard street fear that embassy have not led to good know to be about a bad ambassador a one can send ambassador must be soft gentle willing to make best of everything never prone to take offence must be addicted specially to independence be ungentle apt to be suspicious especially if anything be said derogatory to art be proud of being artist be often ashamed of because exhibit pride may say same of spirit of independence be determined to be independent if live find independence sometimes kicking up heel till hate from will perceive have not have success in lombard street be quite willing to answer uncle question must ask about money indeed have secret from on subject when subjected to cross examination forcing into bathos of poverty a thought broke down not five hundred year not four not three oh heaven propose to take wife will understand how writhed wriggled under scorn then there came something worse than rather if remember rightly worst thing came first be over in studio will remember perhaps of own abortive treasure melancholy soul inspiring creation of have thought so much others have thought so little that one else must value be natural to seems unnatural almost cruel that one must tell to face that be valueless uncle of course have never seen knew that sculptor be generally burdened with ware a called suggested must sell by auction for what might fetch in order that corner occupy might be vacant thought that perhaps might do for country gentleman to stick about among shrub knowing foolish soreness on subject will understand how well must have be prepared by to endure uncle cross examination then asked a to idea not art idea idea a to bread cheese for future told a exactly a must explained to that if be left in possession of comfortable home such a must have be that of father must think best for sake to delay marriage till must be prepared to do something better for than can at present hold ready to give have to give at moment notice must be required to leave house lucy speaking in name said something further declared belief that for sake must bear inconvenience of so poor home without complaining then there arose anger on side on mine must say insult on told that have business to suggest that must be expelled from house replied that threat have come if not from then from lady tringle upon accused of positive falsehood asserting that aunt have said nothing of kind then referred to lady tringle refused to stay longer in room with because have insulted so will see did le than nothing by embassy told that must be so a descended into underground cavern at gloucester road station be not to suppose blame more indeed so much a do be not to be expected that must behave a gentleman of fine feeling perhaps ought to have be expected must behave a man of common sense ought to have taken advice about auction apparently in good part ought not to have writhed when scorned poor earnings when asked a to idea must not have alluded to aunt threat a to turning out must have be placid humble then want of generous feeling must have mattered nothing spilt milk broken egg be past saving good thing may have come from uncle generosity have brushed hair for aright be now clean gone seeing that scrubbed altogether wrong way for know must regret very much have idea that money must be sweet to man except earns have enough belief in to be confident that sooner later will earn sufficiency dearest own feel disgusted with when think have diminished present comfort perhaps lessened for future resource must have be yours rather than mine milk have be spilt now must only think what can best do without seems to that only two home be possible for one with sir thomas a niece other with a wife be conceited enough to think that will prefer latter even with many inconvenience can uncle aunt prevent from marrying at very early day must choose to do so there must be preliminary ceremony of nature of be thoroughly ignorant must suppose be achieved in month must advise to ask aunt boldly whether wish to go to stay with explaining of course that intend to hold to engagement explaining at same time that be quite ready to be married at once if be anxious to be quit of be advice now dear one word of something softer for did lover ever write to lady of heart so long letter so abominably stuffed with matter of business how will best tell how dearly love perhaps may do by showing that a far a be concerned long to hear that aunt emmeline uncle tom be more hard hearted obdurate than be ever uncle aunt before long to hear that have be turned out into cold because know that then must come to though be even le than three hundred year wish must have seen uncle face a terribly mean figure reached ear for moment fear that must want order come slow enough come little quicker than did have never for moment doubted own ultimate success if be with must be more confident than ever nevertheless must aunt bid to stay must think right to comply with desire will not complain adieu come from one who be altogether happy in confidence that at rate before long will have become wife isadore hamel quite expect to be scolded for awkwardness indeed will be disappointed if be not same post brought hamel long letter to lucy brought also short very angry scrawl from sir thomas to wife eye of lady tringle saw epistle other eye will see few word contained be full of marital wrath why have threatened to turn own niece out of door why have subjected to necessity of

added to aunt acerbity indeed for last day two aunt acerbity towards have be much diminished lady tringle have known that husband intended to do something by hamel marriage must be rendered possible though altogether disapproved of hamel marriage must be obliged to accede to if sir thomas acceded to encouraged by money let be married then a far a tringles be concerned let there be end of dormer

further be said either by lucy by aunt a to lover till sir thomas came down to merle park on saturday evening on arrival seemed inclined to be gracious to whole household even including mr traffick who received attention of kind exactly a though most amicable arrangement be always existing between father in law aunt emmeline when seemed that be to encounter further anger on account of revelation hamel have made in lombard street also recovered temper evening be spent a though there be cause for serious family discord in spirit on following morning went to church be delightful to hear flattering word with mr traffick praised merle park everything belonging to during hour of lunch went so far a to make delicately laudatory hint in praise of hospitality in general especially a to so nobly exercised by london merchant prince sir thomas smiled a heard a smiled resolved that a soon a christmas festivity must be over honourable septimus traffick must certainly be turned out of house after lunch there came message to lucy by page boy who be supposed to attend generally to personal want of aunt emmeline saying that uncle must be glad of attendance for walk dear said have got thick

have written to then told about have written to certainly have answered doubt well lucy have intended to be kind to mr hamel a be probably aware be not enabled to carry out intention seems to be very independent sort of young man be independent think have not word to say against if man can be independent be so much better if man can do everything for so a to require to beg to borrow will be much better for dear must understand that man can not be independent with one hand accept assistance with other at one same time be not character be sure said lucy striving to hide indignation while defended lover character think be therefore must remain independent can hing for know that uncle tom very well then there be end of only want to make understand be willing to assist that be unwilling to be assisted like better for there must be end of quite understand uncle tom then there be one other thing have got to say accused of having threatened to turn out of house now dear hereupon lucy struggled to say word hardly knowing what word ought to say interrupted just hear out till have done then there need not be word about never threatened to turn out not uncle tom said endeavouring to press arm with hand if aunt said word in anger must not have made enough of to write tell thought meant to go then did know whom else to ask anybody else ever intended to turn out have meant to be kind to to ayala if thing have gone wrong can not say that have be fault now have better stay here not say word more about till be ready to take that ca be yet for long time be making at present not more than two hundred year be sure must be quite a much a can do to keep coat on back with income a must make up mind to wait probably for year a told before if man chooses to have glory of independence must also bear inconvenience now dear let there be end of never say again want to turn out of house chapter xxxv tom tringle sends challenge next six week went on tranquilly at merle park without word spoken about hamel sir thomas who be in country a little a possible showed scorn to son in law simply by paucity of word speaking to when did speak to with deliberate courtesy mr traffick perfectly understood be that dangerous serenity so often presage storm there be something going to be up with father said to augusta augusta replied that have never seen father so civil before must be great convenience continued member of parliament if must be made to hold tongue till parliament meet be afraid that be too good to expect in other respect thing be comfortable at merle park though be not always comfortable up in london tom a reader know be misbehaving sadly at mountaineer be period of unlimited champagne of almost total absence from lombard street be seldom that sir thomas must get hold of son when did that broken hearted youth must reply to expostulation simply by asserting that if father must induce ayala to marry everything must go straight in lombard street then came final blow tom be of course expected at merle park on christmas eve did not make appearance then on christmas day christmas fell on wednesday be intended that family must remain in country till following monday on thursday sir thomas went up to town to make inquiry respecting heir a to whom lady tringle have then become absolutely unhappy in london heard disastrous truth tom in sportive mood have caused serious inconvenience to most respectable policeman be destined to remain week in hand of philistine then for time other tringle trouble be buried forgotten in great trouble respecting tom lady tringle be unable to leave room during period of incarceration mr traffick promised to have victim liberated by direct interference of secretary of state failed to get anything of kind accomplished girl be completely cowed by enormity of misfortune so tom name be hardly mentioned except in sad confidential whisper of sufferer sir thomas suffered most to be positive disgrace weighing down moment of life at travers treason must not hold up head boldly open mouth loudly a have always be wont at travers treason there be not clerk who did not know that governor be altered man since misfortune have happened to hope of firm what passed between sir thomas son on occasion have already be told in previous chapter sir thomas on whole behaved with indulgence must be acknowledged felt that son must in truth absent from lombard street for time tom have be advised by father to go forth see world prolonged tour have be proposed to to most young men might seem to have great attraction to must have have attraction enough have not be for ayala there must have be hardly limit to allowance made to must have gone forth armed with introduction must have made port happy home to a soon a tour be suggested resolved at once that must not move to distance from ayala what expected what even hoped must not tell while ayala be in london ayala be unmarried must not be made to take far away be thoroughly ashamed of be not at man who must bear week of imprisonment not think disgraced for day two shut up altogether in lodging never once showed at mountaineer faddle came to snubbed faddle at first remembering severe thing father have said about faddles in general soon allowed that feeling to die away when choice seemed to be between faddle solitude then crept out in dark ate dinner with faddle at tavern generally paying bill for of after dinner must play dozen game of billiards with friend at unknown billiard room then creep home to lodging blighted human being at last about end of first week in january be induced to go down to merle park there mr mr traffick be still sojourning real grief have afflicted sir thomas having caused to postpone intention in regard to son in law at merle park tom be cosseted spoilt by woman very injudiciously be not perhaps fact that regarded a hero simply because have punched policeman in stomach then be locked up in vindication of injured law of country incident in combination with unhappy love did seem to make heroic even lucy regarded with favour because of constancy to sister whereas other lady measured admiration for persistency by warmth of anger against silly girl who be causing so much trouble mother told over over again that cousin be not worth regard then when must throw on sofa in agony of despair weakened perhaps a much by course of champagne a by course of love then too must bid hope at last promised that must endeavour to persuade ayala to look at matter in more favourable light must all be right if be not for accursed stubbs poor tom must say to mother man whom called friend man lent horse to when must get one anywhere else man to whom confided everything even about necklace if have be for stubbs never must have hurt that policeman when be striking thought that be stubbs then mother must heap feminine malediction on poor colonel head so together must weep think of revenge from moment tom have heard colonel stubbs name mentioned a of rival have meditated revenge be quite true when said that have be thinking of stubbs when struck policeman have consumed period of confinement in gnashing teeth in regard to poor friend jonathan told father that must not go upon long tour because of ayala in truth love be now so mixed up with idea of vengeance that did not know prevailed if must first have slaughtered stubbs then perhaps might have started how be to slaughter stubbs various idea occurred to mind at first thought that must go down to aldershot with biggest cutting whip must find in shop in piccadilly then occurred to that at aldershot must have british army against that british army might do something to worse even than london magistrate then must wait till colonel must be met elsewhere ascertained that colonel be still at stalham where have passed christmas thought how might be if be to attack colonel in presence of friend alburys assured that a far a personal injury went feared nothing have disinclination to be hit over head if must be sure of hitting colonel over head if must be managed that two must fly at other with fist be allowed to do worst must to other for hour without interference must be quite satisfied down at stalham must not be allowed world must be against nobody there to see that got fair play if must encounter man in street of london must be better be to seek man down at stalham must probably find in county lunatic asylum what must do for revenge be surely entitled to by law of chivalry a to have own idea have right to inflict injury upon successful even upon unsuccessful rival be not shame so excellent institution a duelling must have be stamped out wandering about lawn shrubbery at merle park thought of at last came to resolution institution have be stamped out a far a great britain be concerned be aware of seemed to that have not be stamped out in other more generous country have happened to notice that certain enthusiastic politician in france have enjoyed many duel have never be severely repressed by law of country newspaper writer be always fighting in france be never guillotined idea of being hanged be horrible to so distasteful that saw at glance that duel in england be out of question to have head cut off even if must come to must be much le affair in belgium in italy in germany never did cut off head of very numerous gentleman who fought duel there be southern state of american union where fancied that men might fight duel just a pleased must be ready to go even to new orleans at day notice if only must induce colonel stubbs to meet there thought that if colonel stubbs really possessed spirit seemed to be attributed to by british army generally must come if properly invoked fight duel a whether at new orleans at other well chosen blood allowing spot on world surface tom be prepared to go anywhere for blood invocation must be properly made when have wanted letter of kind to be written for

be repeated a to when where how have not a yet made up mind then tom tringle have come to at aldershot communicating to fact that have rival also other fact that other rival like have hitherto be unsuccessful seemed improbable to that girl a ayala must attach to such man a cousin tom nevertheless be uneasy regarded tom tringle a miracle of wealth felt certain that united effort of whole family must be used to arrange match ayala have refused also therefore up to present moment chance of other man be better than own when tom left at aldershot hardly remembered that tom knew nothing of secret whereas tom have communicated to own never for moment occurred to that tom must quarrel with although have seen that poor fellow have be disgusted because have refused to write letter on christmas eve have gone down to stalham there have remained discussing matter of love with lady albury to one else in house have affair be mentioned by sir harry be supposed to remain there only for sake of hunting with sir harry be of guest most popular thus came to pas that prolonged presence at stalham be not matter of special remark much of time did devote to hunting there be half hour devoted in company with lady albury to ayala perfection ayala obstinacy lady albury be almost inclined to think that ayala must be given up married lady seldom estimate even girl like best at full value seems to such one a lady albury almost pity that one a colonel stubbs must waste energy upon anything so insignificant a ayala dormer speciality of attraction be of course absent to woman unless have considered matter so far a to be able to clothe thought in male vestment a woman do can not understand longing be felt for so small treasure lady albury thought that young lady be very well that ayala be very well among young lady ayala in getting colonel stubbs for husband must a lady albury thought have received so much more than desert that be now almost inclined to be angry with colonel dear friend

princess to just at present must be regarded a only judge in matter will be goddess if please said lady albury goddess princess pink pearl name please supposed to convey perfection will be same to may be that be in truth better more lovely divine than many young lady who be at present moment exercising heart of many gentleman know enough of world to be aware that jack have gill be gill be end of hope then that may be gill in order that may must have here again must absolutely not know how to go to work be to find in presence of aunt dosett in kingsbury crescent in answer to lady albury assured that must be quite willing to have girl again at stalham if must be managed be reminding however how difficult have be on previous occasion to overcome scruple of mr dosett when servant

said servant say have letter must put into own particular hand look like bailiff said lady albury laughing colonel stubbs declaring that have special reason to be afraid of bailiff left room went down into hall at real hall of house be used a billiard room here leaning against billiard table colonel found poor faddle when man be compelled by chance circumstance to address man whom doe not know whom by inspection feel will never wish to know always hardens face sometimes also voice so be with colonel when looked at faddle word did say not in word absolutely uncivil a to nature of business in hand then faddle showing emotion by quaver in voice suggested that a matter be one of extreme delicacy more private apartment might be provided upon stubbs led way into little room be for most part filled with hunting gear offered stranger one of three chair contained faddle sat down finding so compelled though colonel still remained standing then extracted fatal epistle from pocket colonel stubbs said handing up missive be directed by friend mr thomas tringle junior to put letter into own hand when have read will be ready to consult with a to content few word have learnt by heart on journey down having practised continually colonel took letter turning to window read with back to visitor read twice from beginning to end in order that might have time to resolve whether must laugh aloud at faddle tringle whether might not be better to endeavour to soften anger of poor tom by message must be at rate kindly worded be from friend tom tringle said from mr thomas tringle junior said faddle proudly so perceive be sorry to think that must be in so much trouble be one of best fellow know be really grieved that must be unhappy know be nonsense be not nonsense at colonel stubbs must allow to be judge of mr faddle be at rate nonsense to want to go somewhere fight duel must not do with man under circumstance here there be possible ground for quarrel whatsoever a will endeavour to explain to friend mr tringle will be sure to write to at once so will bid good afternoon did not at suit poor faddle after so long journey thought probable that must write colonel stubbs therefore be prepared to wait if can not be accommodated here will wait will wait elsewhere will not be at necessary have post to london twice day must be aware colonel stubbs that letter of sort must not be sent by post kind of letter will write may be sent by post very well will not be bellicose therefore there can be objection really think colonel stubbs that be making very little of very serious matter mr faddle really must manage own affair after own way must like glass of sherry if not need hardly ask to stay here longer upon that went out into billiard room rang bell poor faddle must have liked glass of sherry

have learned lesson there have be letter two then there have be that walk in wood on italian side of tyrolese alp reader may remember how be hurried away in diligence for innspruck because be considered that further sojourn in same house with imogene be dangerous have gone even a went have attempted to make joke of whole affair have not be quite joke to even then there be imogene love imogene anger together with aversion towards poor girl whom intended to marry became stronger more strongly be convinced of imogene love of anger nevertheless persevered not with best success a have already be told now a left house in lombard street wrote what be intended to be last epistle to gertrude be driven again to think of miss docimer indeed have in pocket a sat at club little note have

must at last moment prove hard hearted then let see again yours with letter in pocket have gone down to merle park determined to put end to tringle affair in one way other duty a have planned to must not be altered by imogene letter if duty must become impracticable why then must be open to to consider imogene might have to say to docimers be now in london where be custom to live during six month of year houston have not be at house since have parted from in tyrol have spent little of time in london since autumn when there have not be anxious to see people who have at rate treated somewhat roughly now must be necessary that must answer imogene letter what must be nature of such answer certainly have not a yet decided must have decided before very convincing assurance of sir thomas tringle that matter be at rate over now adriatic might wed if adriatic thought well to do so matter however be one required good deal of consideration gave to ten minute of intense thought during consumed cup of coffee cigarette then throwing away burnt end of paper hurried into morning room wrote to lady a follows dear imogene will not have to press to bosom a wife second daughter of sir thomas tringle bart high honour of alliance have at last be refused by in very plain language have become mr frank houston doubt must have done duty to own cousin that lot however have not be written for in book of fate father be persistent in looking upon a idle profligate adventurer though have be kind enough to hint more than once that might be possible for to achieve young lady have succeeded in convincing that never must achieve anything beyond barren possession of beauty wife family on present very moderate income must be burdensome therefore with infinite regret have bade adieu to miss tringle have not hitherto be to see either brother mr docimer because have be altogether unaware whether brother mr docimer must be glad to see a say there be storm on tyrolese hill side in there be more than one wind blowing at same time find fault with anybody perhaps storm be needed to clear air hate storm pretend to be very grand fellow do endeavour not to be disagreeable brother if remember

niece then have quarrelled with own selection have changed niece have be done to accommodate own fancy now wanted to change niece back again felt aware that request be unreasonable came therefore determined to wrap up in blandest smile when ayala have left room mr dosett sat mute in attention be quite aware that something very much out of ordinary way be to be asked of in ordinary way lady tringle never did smile when came to kingsbury crescent must be profuse in finery must seem to throw off spark of wealth at word spoke now even dress have be toned down to humbler manner there be touch of husband purse in gait margaret said have proposition of great importance to make to mr dosett opened eye wider sat still mute poor girl be not be not be not doing perhaps very best for

poor fellow hardly take anything will sit afternoon smoking cigarette sipping tea be quite sad to see then come talk to be always asking to make ayala have think that anybody can ever make ayala do anything not quite by talking to dare say not did not mean to say word to about just now can hing fear said mr dosett be going to suggest something wanted first to say word two about poor lucy be just at present poor to lady tringle ayala lucy tom gertrude even augusta be poor because be to be turned out of bedroom be in trouble oh dear yes added thinking well to correct so that mr dosett might not imagine that must have to look forward to trouble with lucy must arrange affair doubt if be not with be engaged to mr isadore hamel sculptor so have heard doe not earn very much just at present fear sir thomas did offer to help be perhaps little hoity toity giving air however did not come off there be waiting mean to say word against poor lucy think pity know perhaps be natural enough be what must have liked for niece who be living with just a though be daughter must help what be to do emmeline let just change place again change again ayala go to lucy come back here just that if ayala be with must be sure to get used to tom at last then lucy must manage affair with mr hamel so much better if be with why must manage affair better if be with lady tringle be aware that be weak part of case on poor ayala poor tom side of question there be good deal might be said then though might not convince might be eloquent touching lucy must say nothing did not simply signify that wanted to get rid of girl now mr dosett have also wanted to get rid of lucy when former exchange have be made what mean be that if be away sir thomas must be more likely to do something for be invention at spur of moment do not feel that girl must not be chucked about like ball from battledore asked mr dosett for own good margaret only propose for own good ca think must be good thing for ayala to be married to tom if liked why must like know what that mean poor ayala be young little romantic must be great deal happier if must be knocked out of have to marry somebody sooner settle down better sir thomas will

lucy must too again whispered lady tringle if be told be to go what else can do why must ayala wish to come there be quarrel before yes because of augusta augusta be married now lady tringle must not quite say that augusta be gone will speak to ayala perhaps must come better from margaret if agree with be not sure that do be quite sure that brother must not force to go whether wished not doubt must be glad if marriage must be arranged can not force girl to marry aversion in case be so strong aversion aversion to being married mean be so strong that think will go of own accord to house where be likely to meet cousin dare say may be fool say nothing about of course will be asked if wish to go then lucy can be asked too of course must depend upon what brother say then lady tringle took leave without again seeing ayala a went declared intention of calling at somerset house must not think right said in matter of such importance to leave london without consulting brother might be possible thought that must be able to talk brother over whereas wife if have first word might turn other way be aunt emmeline gone asked ayala when came down be glad have gone because never know how to look when call dear know hate hope not ayala be sure doe because hated augusta do hate augusta aunt hate only one of lot like be uncle tom then proposition be made ayala sitting with mouth wide

back again only reason for former expulsion having be enmity of augusta uncle tom aunt doubt gertrude must be very glad to receive not word be said about tom then something be urged a to material comfort of tringle establishment of necessary poverty of kingsbury crescent lucy be to have poverty said ayala indignantly think probable dear that before long lucy will become wife of mr hamel want to get rid of demanded ayala dear not so must not think that for moment proposition have not originated with at be endeavouring to do duty by explaining to advantage must enjoy by going to aunt emmeline certainly can not have if remain here must tell that if return to sir thomas will probably provide for know what mean by providing for said ayala who have in mind dim idea that cousin tom be supposed to be provision be quite aware that aunt margaret in explanation a hitherto given have not mentioned tom name be sure that have not be omitted without reason by providing mean that if be living in house will leave something in will a must be natural that must do for child belonging to uncle reginald said in low very serious tone will fear have nothing to leave to then there be silence for minute after mr dosett asked important question well ayala what do think about must go said ayala may stay yes dear may certainly stay if wish then will stay said ayala jumping up on to foot want to turn out aunt margaret then went down on knee leaning on aunt lap looked up into face if will keep will try to be good dear be good have nothing to complain of of course will keep nobody have thought for moment of bidding go must understand that when aunt made proposition be bound to tell then there be great embracing kissing ayala felt that be relieved from terrible danger have often declared that one must make marry cousin tom have seemed to for moment that if be given up bodily to tringles mode of escape must be open to short of suicide there have be moment almost of regret that have never brought to regard jonathan stubbs a angel of light at somerset house lady tringle made suggestion to brother with even more flowery assurance of general happiness than have used in endeavouring to persuade wife ayala must of course be married to tom in course of next six month during same period lucy doubt must be married to very enterprising somewhat obstinate young man mr hamel thus there must be end to dormer trouble reginald said will be relieved from burden never ought to have be laid upon shoulder will think of said very gravely over over again beyond will think of

something of angel about little accident be recorded at close of last chapter occurred on tuesday night on following afternoon tom tringle again very much out of spirit returned to merle park there be now nothing further for to do in london have have last chance with ayala last chance have certainly done good fortune whether kindly unkindly have given opportunity of revenging upon colonel have taken advantage of opportunity did not find much relieved by what have done rival conduct have caused to be thoroughly ashamed of have at rate taken from further hope of revenge so now there be nothing for to take back to merle park on wednesday heard nothing further of matter on thursday sir thomas came down from london showing to poor tom paragraph in one of morning paper asked whether knew anything of circumstance to reference be made paragraph be a follows that very bellicose young city knight who at christmas time got into trouble by thrashing policeman within inch of life in

theatre abstain from mentioning officer name be however known to city knight again fell into hand of police be taken to watch house colonel who knew something of family accompanied begged assailant off officer on duty be most unwilling to let culprit go colonel used influence be successful may be very well between generous colonel valiant knight if young man have friend have better look to

longer with bee in bonnet will be locked up in lunatic asylum will not be able to get out again must go abroad to tom made immediate answer lamentable a be position still be unwilling to leave london while ayala be living there be to consent to go away for lengthened period by doing so must seem to abandon own claim hope knew there be none yet even yet regarded a one of ayala suitor do think well continued father that must remain in london while such paragraph a be being written about be not in london now said tom be not in london while be at merle park of course will not go up to london without leave do understand that here tom again be silent if do continued father will not be received down here again at queen gate will cheque for allowance be honoured longer at bank in fact if obey will throw off altogether absurdity about love have be carried on long enough so came to be understood in family that tom be to be kept in mild durance at merle park till everything must have be arranged for extended tour about world to tom gave positive assent be understood that when time came must yield to father command have thus come to pas that affray at door of haymarket became known to so much of world at large a interested in affair of colonel stubbs of tringles other paragraph be written in two hero of evening be designated a colonel j s a t t junior of firm of t t in city who pleased must read initial thus world be aware that colonel have received blow have resented affront only by rescuing assailant from hand of police word be said at first seemed to imply that colonel have not exhibited spirit might have be expected from having be struck must not have thrashed man who struck at rate have left ruffian in hand of policeman for proper punishment many day have not passed over before colonel conduct have be viewed in different light men woman be declaring that have done manly gallant thing affair have in way become sufficiently well known to justify allusion made to in following letter from lady albury to ayala stalham tuesday th february dear ayala be quite indispensable for happiness of everybody particularly that of sir harry that must come down here on twentieth nina will be here on farewell visit before return to mother of course have heard that be arranged between lord george bideford will be last opportunity of will have of seeing once again before martyrdom world be to be told that be to follow to rome where be to be married doubt by pope under dome of st peter belief be that lord george be going to travel with way if be man take to be

written line to aunt to press request for visit will doubt show to if please can show mine in return now dear must explain to one two other arrangement certain gentleman will certainly not be here be not fault that certain gentleman went to kingsbury crescent certain gentleman be a be aware great friend of ours be entitled to explain if so seemed good to certain gentleman be not favoured in enterprise by stalham interest at rate certain gentleman will not be at stalham on occasion so much for certain gentleman colonel stubbs will be here a will be coming down on twentieth must be glad to travel by same train so that may look after ticket luggage be slave for occasion will leave paddington station by pm train if will suit think that behaved beautifully in little affair at haymarket theatre must not mention only that everybody have heard of almost other man must have struck poor fellow again be one of very few who always know what to do at moment without taking time to think of mind come like good girl affectionate friend rosaline albury be in way that ayala heard what have taken place between cousin tom colonel stubbs hint of fracas between two men have reached ear now asked various question of aunt at last elicited truth tom have attacked other lover in street have attacked colonel stubbs because of injured love have grossly misbehaved a consequence must have be locked up by police have not colonel interfered on behalf to ayala seemed to be conduct worthy almost of angel of light then question of proposed visit be discussed first with aunt then with mr dosett be quite willing that niece must go to stalham to mr dosett thinking further journey to stalham must mean engagement with colonel stubbs when have read lady albury letter be quite sure that have be lady albury meaning captain batsby be not to receive stalham interest that interest be to be used on part of colonel stubbs have not slightest objection be clear to that ayala must have to be married before long be out of question that one man after must fall in love with violently that nothing must come of mr dosett have become quite despondent about tom there be amount of dislike must be impossible to overcome a for captain batsby there must be chance for man whom young lady must not be induced even to see other lover whom lady must not admit that loved a to whom have declared that must never love be held in very high favour do think be so noble not to hit tom again have said therefore a colonel stubbs have sufficient income there must be reason why ayala must not go again to stalham so be that mr dosett argued with such be judgment expressed to ayala there be difficulty ayala little stock of cash be gone must not go to stalham without money money must come out of uncle reginald pocket must not go to stalham without expenditure a well knew must be hard for to bear then there be that terrible question of clothes when suggestion have be made of further transfer of niece cheque have come from sir thomas if ayala come to will want few thing sir thomas have said in note to mr dosett mr dosett have chosen that cheque must be sent back when be decided that further transfer must not take place cheque have be sent back there have be end of there must be morning dress there must be hat there must be boot so much mr dosett acknowledged let do what might with old thing mr dosett acknowledged that so much a must at least be necessary will go to work mr dosett said will ask uncle what can do for think felt that have received recompense when ayala kissed be after ayala discussed matter with have longed to go once again to stalham dear stalham a called to herself a thought of place told that loved because lady albury have be so kind to because of nina because of hunting because of general pleasantness luxury of big comfortable house yes there be something to be said too of pleasantness of colonel stubbs till have made love to have be perhaps of fine new friend pleasantest how joyous voice have sounded to how fraught with gratification to have be bright ugly face how well have known how to talk to to make talk so that everything have be easy with how thoroughly remembered drollery on first night at party in london keen saying at theatre way have insisted that must hunt thought of little confidence have have with almost a though have be brother then have destroyed by becoming lover be to be lover still if so must be right that must go again to stalham knowing that must meet there must be right that must consent to travel with under special escort be to do so must not be forced to do more if must again ask be so probable that must not ask again be so strange that one must have asked if did ask certainly be not like angel of light whom have never seen of whom picture in imagination be a clearly drawn a though be in presence daily there be wave of hair shape of brow peculiarity of eye with nose mouth cut a sharp a chisel must cut out of marble of graced angel none of belonged to colonel be chief of grace made angel so glorious to there be depth of poetry about deep clear pellucid a lake among grassy bank make thing of world mean when compared to angel of light lived on essence of be beautiful altogether unalloyed by grossness of earth that one must come in way oh did not look for having formed image of angel for must be possible that must have anything le divine le beautiful le angelic yes there be something of angel about even about colonel jonathan stubbs be so clearly angel of earth whereas other one though living upon earth must be of air of sky of cloud of heaven celestial one knew have never seen partly dreamed that be dreaming if so have not dream spoilt for else oh yes indeed be good red haired ugly stubbs how well have behaved to tom how kind have be to herself how thoughtful of be if be not question of downright love of giving up to body soul a be how pleasant must be to dwell with for herself must confess that loved earthly thing such a jumping over brook with larry twentyman before to show way for love be necessary that there must be angel of light have not read that angel have come from heaven taken in marriage daughter of men be right that must go to stalham seeing that there be two such strong reason against must not go without costing uncle money must ill afford if did go must must not confess that have abandoned objection to colonel suit too understood something of have made so plain to aunt uncle think be right that must go aunt said to in drawing room that evening will set to work to morrow do best that can to make smart uncle be sitting in room at time ayala felt compelled to go to kiss thank for kindness be so sorry to cost so much money uncle reginald said will not be very much dear answered be hard that young people must not have amusement only hope will make happy at stalham always make people happy at stalham said ayala energetically now ayala said aunt can write letter to lady albury before go out to morrow give compliment tell that a be writing need not trouble ayala when be alone in bedroom felt almost horrified a reflected that in manner question have be settled for have be impossible for to reject uncle liberal offer when have be made must not find courage at moment to say that have thought better of must decline visit before be well aware of what be doing have assented have thus a be thrown over creation of dream yet a declared not even lady albury must make marry man merely because be at house thought that if must only avoid that first journey with colonel stubbs in railway still might hold own be to travel with of own accord must not be felt that must be wilfully throwing in way then made little plan for herself attempted to carry out when writing letter to lady albury on following morning what be nature of plan how effected will be seen in letter wrote kingsbury crescent thursday dear lady albury be so very good of to ask again will be so happy to visit stalham once more must have be very sorry not to see dear nina before return to italy have written to congratulate of course have told what happy girl think be though have not seen lord george take that from description a be going to be wife immediately at see why must not go back with to rome a for being married by pope think ever doe anything so useful a believe sits day have toe kissed be what told at rome be very glad of what tell about certain gentleman because think must have be happy at stalham if have be there surprised so much that must not think that meant in earnest never hardly spoke to other when be in house together perhaps if mind sha be in way here began to display little plan have made for own protection will come down by earlier train than mention there be one at then need not be in dark way need not say anything about to colonel stubbs because at mind travelling by yours affectionately ayala be little plan be very innocent when thought that lady albury must be blind to such scheme a got three word from lady albury saying that train must do very well that carriage must be at station to meet lady albury did not also say in note that have communicated with colonel stubbs on subject informed that must come up from aldershot earlier than intended in order that might adapt to ayala whim foolish little child said lady albury to herself a if must make difference be clear to lady albury that ayala must surrender now that be coming to stalham second time knowing that colonel must be there chapter xlvi ayala go again to stalham correspondence between lady albury colonel stubbs be close frequent friendship between being very close ayala have sometimes asked why lady albury must have be so kind affectionate to have failed to find sufficient answer have be asked to stalham at first so far a knew because have be intimate at rome with marchesa baldoni hence have apparently risen lady albury great friendship have seemed even to herself to be strange in truth marchesa have have very little to do with have lady albury become attached to ayala for ayala own sake to lady albury colonel stubbs be a declared to herself very often own real brother have married man very rich well known in world whom loved very well be not woman who in position must allow to love man that there might certainly be danger of kind be continually impressing on friend expediency of marriage if only must find one good enough to marry then colonel have found ayala lady albury at beginning of be not inclined to think that ayala be good enough judging at first from what heard then from what saw have not be very favourable to ayala when friend have insisted have declared that happiness depended on have shown by various sign that certainly must carry out intention if not at stalham then elsewhere lady albury have yielded to have become ayala great friend if be written in book that ayala be to become mr stubbs then must certainly be necessary that ayala must be friend have such confidence in jonathan stubbs a man of power that did not doubt of success in matter to might choose to devote wonder have be that ayala must have rejected chance when have come in way girl have be foolish allowing to be influenced by man red hair ill sounding name not knowing real pearl when saw so lady albury have thought having only be partially right in so thinking not having gone to depth of ayala power of dreaming be very confident however that girl when once again at stalham must yield easily therefore went to work doing that must to smoothen love road for friend jonathan woman mind have seen difficulty about clothes must have sent what be needful have not feared to offend dosetts ayala therefore prepared present must give to girl at stalham without offence if be to be girl high fate to become mr jonathan stubbs must be proper that must be adorned decked made beautiful among others of class a must become wife of such hero of passed between ayala word be sent down to aldershot stupid little wretch will throw out know wrote lady albury by making start two hour before have done work must let work do for occasion there be nothing like little journey together to make people understand other colonel be clearly determined to have little journey together might be present military duty at duty of love be for nonce in colonel mind more imperative though royal highness have be coming afternoon to inspect troop still must have resolved so to have arranged matter a to travel down with ayala to stalham not only be determined to do found necessary also to arrange previous meeting with lady albury before important twentieth of month did by making friend believe that presence in london for few hour must be necessary for various reason came up a desired there met at hotel in jermyn street on arrival here felt that be almost making fool of by extent of anxiety in nervousness about little girl be almost a insane a poor tom tringle who when despised love be altogether unable to control if can not persuade at last will be knocking somebody over head a did be thus be talking to a got out of cab at door of hotel now jonathan said lady albury what can there possibly be to justify in giving trouble know have to come up about cook character know have given that a reason to sir harry know also must have gone without cook for twelvemonth have not summoned truth be must not get down to stalham back without losing additional day can not possibly spare with doe not very much matter how many day spare how much money spend how much labour take so that obey command of colonel jonathan stubbs what on earth be there that can say do for more there be one two thing said want to understand in first place be quite in earnest about know that be in earnest perhaps understand full extent of earnestness if be to refuse ultimately must go away go away go where oh have not at thought of probably to india a might manage to get regiment there in truth must matter very little be talking like goose be very likely because in matter think feel like goose be not great thing in man to be turned out of course by undefined feeling have a to young woman thing have occurred before now will occur again in case if be thrown over what on earth be there about girl asked lady albury there be that precious brother in law of ours going to hang incontinently because will not look at unfortunate friend of yours tom tringle be if possible worse than ben batsby if two other gentleman be in same condition only make le singular must be third at rate be third mean to liken to indeed do a to connection with miss dormer can see difference be in love with have refused matter little whether man ugliness ring natural stupidity may have brought about result be very modest jonathan always be only never must see be modest in matter not for reason le persistent in doing best can for object now in seeing be to let understand that be well not life death because will not suffice either to kill to keep alive one of matter in man career be almost a important to a life death be very decided in refusal so be girl when first offer be made to how be girl so to arrange thought at moment notice a to accept man off hand girl do do so very rarely think when do be hardly worth having said lady albury laying down law on matter with great precision if girl accept man at once when have have a be preparation for such proposal must always surely be in state of great readiness for matrimonial project when there have be prolonged period of spooning then of course be quite different thing whole thing have in fact be arranged before important word have be spoken what professor in art be said odd thing be that one a must be so ignorant ca understand that must not come to stalham if mind be made up against said nothing of a lover took care to let know that be coming be very ready to put in same boat with poor ben batsby that other unfortunate wretch must do think have consented to come have known that ben must have be there friend tom tringle there be much more of upshot be a colonel have intended that must be that lady albury be made to understand ayala good will be essential to happiness of course will do best said a parted from though be not quite a much in love with a be yet will do best then when be left alone be prosecuting inquiry about new cook travelling back in afternoon to stalham again considered how wonderful thing be such girl a ayala so small apparently so unimportant so childish in manner with so little to say for must become person of such terrible importance twentieth came at ten minute before two ayala be at paddington railway station train be to start at have be chosen by so that might avoid colonel there be with aunt waiting for mr dosett have thought to be duty to see off have come with in cab there be two box laden with wardrobe such a be aunt have worked hard for though a have declared to herself there be special reason for still have wished to look best a saw box put into van have told how much shabbier be than box of other young lady who went visiting to such house a stalham rejoiced that colonel stubbs be not there to see considered whether be possible that colonel stubbs must recognise dress have worn at stalham before be now to appear in quite altered shape wondered also whether must be possible that colonel stubbs must know how poor be a be thinking of there be colonel stubbs on platform have never doubted little plan must be efficacious have aunt doubted who have seen through plan though not word have be spoken between on subject mr dosett have considered to be impossible that colonel engaged on duty of importance at aldershot must run away from to wait upon child like ayala even though have professed to be in love with child have never seen colonel on occasion did not expect to see there be suddenly shaking hand with ayala aunt mr dosett whispered ayala then colonel began to talk to elder lady a though younger lady be person of very much le importance yes have run up from aldershot little earlier than have intended there have be nothing particular to keep down at aldershot have always be intention to go to stalham on day be glad of accident be bringing miss dormer there just at same time spent good deal of time at stalham because sir harry who be in truth cousin be a intimate a brother always lived at stalham when must get away from duty be not in london stalham be very nice place certainly one of most comfortable house knew in england so went on till almost made mr dosett believe did make ayala believe that visit to stalham have nothing to do with yet mr dosett knew that offer have be made ayala bethought herself that did not care so much for re manufactured frock after yet for shabby appearance of box real angel of light must not care for frock for box certainly must not be indifferent after fashion of of then began to reflect that be making fool of be put into carriage mr dosett having luckily decided against use of second class going to such house a stalham ayala ought said mr dosett to go a other lady must have be wife must have be very different for ayala on occasion a must be extravagant ayala be therefore put into seat while colonel stood at door outside still talking to mr dosett think will be let to come away at end of week said colonel sir harry doe like people to come away very soon ayala heard thought that remembered that sir harry be very indifferent a to coming going of visitor go up to london about end of march said colonel if miss dormer be to return about week before must do very well oh said ayala putting head out of window must think of staying so long a then last final bustle be made by guard colonel got in door be shut mr dosett standing on platform nodded head for last time there be only four person in carriage in opposite corner there be two old person probably husband wife who have be very careful a to foot warming apparatus be muffled up very closely in woollen fur if mind shutting door sir said old gentleman rather testily because wife

marriage for ayala to thinking ayala be not entitled to husband at augusta have never given way in affair of tom have declared conviction that stubbs have never be in earnest be of opinion that captain batsby must be much better off at merle park without ayala than must have be in young lady presence when arrived nothing be said to at once about ayala gertrude who recovered from great sickness occasioned by mr houston misconduct though recovery be intended only to be temporary made herself a pleasant a possible captain batsby be made welcome remained three day before sought

here very great must let lock up though in matter of must have be best pleased if must have locked up for ever kept from sight of world admire girl captain batsby think that ever heard of man who loved girl a love hesitate to say that continue to walk world in way of not committing suicide mean simply because there be still possibility while have not a yet stood at hymeneal altar with man must have shot stubbs willingly though knew be to be tried for at old bailey hung must have done willingly willingly other man after captain batsby thought might be prudent not to say anything especial a to own love how foolish must be for man like with good fortune of own to marry girl who have not sixpence captain be led into vain thought by great civility displayed to by lady of house with lucy whom knew to be ayala sister have not prospered very well came to ear that be out of favour with aunt therefore meddled with little tringle lady however be very kind to so kind that be tempted to think le than ever of one who have be so little courteous to a ayala mr traffick be of course married woman amounted to nothing gertrude world knew that septimus traffick without shilling of own have become happy possessor of very large sum of money batsby have more to recommend than traffick why must not also become happy possessor went away for week hunting into northamptonshire then at lady tringle request came back to merle park at time miss tringle have quite recovered health have dropped immediate speech a to mr houston have not be provoked must have allowed to drop into oblivion married sister may take liberty be well rid of think said augusta gertrude heaved deep sigh did not wish to acknowledge to be rid of until string be well fitted to bow after man with nothing to do in world with profession occupation with money mr traffick have not got very much money of own have seat in parliament be very much more than fortune will undoubtedly be in power when party come in be man of birth frank houston have nothing to recommend birth said gertrude turning up nose queen who be fountain of honour made father nobleman that constitutes birth married sister said with stern severity of manner perfect reliance on constitutional privilege of sovereign know that need talk about said gertrude not at mr houston have behaved very badly suppose there be end of a far a house be concerned captain batsby seems to to be very nice young man suppose have got money man must certainly have got money occupation have got said gertrude however be not true a captain batsby have left service have forgotten cousin so soon gertrude asked one day a be walking with happy captain in park captain doubt have be saying soft thing to do throw that in teeth a offence inconstancy in men be generally considered a offence said gertrude what might be in woman did not just then declare after have heard of cousin since have be here must hardly have thought that must be reckoned so in case have heard nothing against from be told that have treated brother very badly poor tom that be flirting with man particularly dislike suppose doe make rather peculiar with colonel stubbs after only

guise of lover that be so mr traffick be well aware be lady tringle very much in dark frank houston be to be considered a good a gone if so must be well that daughter must have string be tired of

difficulty lay with sir thomas sir thomas have brought captain batsby there to merle park a ayala lover a have be very little at home be unaware of change have taken place then gertrude be still supposed to be engaged to mr houston although lover have be so violently rejected by lady felt that a be made of sterner stuff than so must be more difficult to reconcile to alteration be now proposed in family arrangement who be to bell cat let go to papa in usual way ask leave said mr traffick did suggest said gertrude seems not to like to do quite yet be coward a know that be more coward than anybody else remember when septimus be quite afraid to go near papa then benjamin have got money of own doe make difference be quite untrue saying that septimus be ever afraid of papa of course know position a member of parliament too well for suppose truth be be about ayala be little odd about ayala said gertrude resuming confidential tone be so hard to make papa understand about kind of thing declare believe think that never ought to speak to man because of scoundrel frank houston be in truth so strange to sir thomas that must not understand of existing perplexity why did captain batsby remain a guest at merle park have special dislike to man when lady tringle have told that have asked captain to prolong visit have made objection why must man remain there knowing a did now that there be chance of ayala coming to merle park at last on certain saturday evening did make inquiry on subject what on earth be that man staying here for said to wife think like place perhaps like place a

why have be so foolish then seemed a though at moment separation took place between herself spirit have haunted seemed to know now now at very moment that man be too good for knowledge have be coming to have almost come when have spoken to in wood if must only have be that must have delayed appeal to yet for day two thought now that if must have delayed for few hour cure must have be complete if have talked to a so well knew how to talk while be in wood together while be walking home so a to have exorcised spirit from by sweetness of word then have told that there be love to have if chose to have then thought must have taken have come to while word have prepared under guidance of spirit be yet upon tongue can not have said can not have not told that did not love did love said to herself almost acknowledging that spirit have be wholly exorcised fashion of mind be altogether different from have so strongly prevailed with be honest noble man high in world repute clever gentleman man of taste possessed of gentle ever present humour be so inexpressibly delightful to never again spoke to herself even in thought of angel of light never comforted again with vision of be to come there have appeared to man better than other men when have asked for hand have simply said can not yet have loved time how foolish how false how wicked have be be thus that thought of a sat there alone in bedroom through long hour of afternoon when sent up for asking to come down begged that might be allowed to remain there till dinner time because be tired with walk must not come again now oh be too proud too firm too manly for that be not for such one a to come whining after girl like cousin tom must be possible that must even yet tell must say to one little word contradicting have so often uttered in wood now can once whispered in ear must do a to be aware that there be room for hope to speak such word low a might be spoken simple little a might be be altogether impossible have have chance have lost because of idle dream that dream have be idle declared to not aware that ayala whom lover have loved must not have be ayala to be loved by for dream now must go back to uncle aunt to kingsbury crescent with added sorrow that world of dream be closed to for ever when maid came to consented to have frock put on frock sir harry have given boldly resolving to struggle through sorrow till lady albury must have dismissed to home nobody must want now at stalham dismissal must soon come while have be alone in room colonel have be closeted with lady albury have at least be thus shut up together for half hour during have told tale have to own said half laughing a began tale that thoroughly respect miss dormer why be to be called miss dormer because have shown worthy of respect what be that mean jonathan knew own mind when told at first that must not accept offer did honour of making now stick to purpose think that young lady who will do must be respected have refused again altogether a how well hardly know that be prepared to explain 'as how ' even to be about a thick skinned man in such matter a may find anywhere know that even can bring to tell 'as how ' how ' be very clear in one respect be manifest that knew own mind be knowledge not in possession of young lady told that must not marry believe not that told so not that knew own mind be little simple fool who with vagary in brain be throwing away utterly own happiness while be vexing a to vexation be right cross grained little idiot idiot certainly be not a to being cross grained have never found human being with grain running more directly in same way have never come across talk to jonathan like said when call cross grained mean that be running counter to own happiness can not tell anything about must have endeavoured think to make happy have certainly run counter to happiness now what a to very moment will leave stalham to morrow why must do let go if one must go be just what want to prevent why must lose little pleasure suppose that can make house happy to now why must care to do so when will have driven away sat silent for minute two looking at fire with hand on two knee must acknowledge jonathan continued have taken kindly to ayala of yours do acknowledge can not be that must be same to simply a young lady staying here a be on own behalf a be when regarded a possible wife then little trick grace belonging to endeared to because regarded a one who be about to become one of ourselves what be trick grace to now be world to said colonel must wipe out of memory unless indeed mean to ask again ah be will ask again say so wish to rob of chance may be that will of course must to morrow if thought there be hope to morrow there must be none must like to know must find again in hand so friendly a yours if at end of month must think strong enough to encounter risk of refusal must sir harry allow to remain here for month must say probably nothing about plan be continued let remain here say for three week month do continue kindness to if not for sake then for mine let feel that be made one of yourselves a say will be hard said lady albury must not be hard if thought that be going to become so at last try for sake say not word to about though not shunning name be to a though have told nothing of then when period be over will come again if find can do so if love be still stronger than sense of self respect will do so lady albury promised to do then interview between be over colonel stubbs be going to aldershot to morrow said to ayala in drawing room after dinner find now that can not very well remain away there be hesitation in voice a said look in eye taught ayala to suppose that have heard anything of what have occurred in wood be indeed said ayala trying in vain to be equally undemonstrative be great trouble to be quite unable to prevent unless indeed can control can not control said ayala with fixed look of resolution with lady albury have already become familiar that evening before went to bed colonel bade good bye a intended to start early in morning never saw such fellow a be for sudden change said sir harry what be good of staying here for hunting when ground tony temper be a hard a brick bat if go now can get week further on in march if rain must come with sir harry seemed to be satisfied ayala felt sure that tony temper rain have have nothing to do with good bye miss dormer said with pleasantest smile pleasantest voice good bye repeated what must not have given that voice must be a pleasant a smile failed so utterly that little word be inaudible almost obliterated by choking of sob how bitterly severe have that word miss dormer sounded from mouth must not have called ayala for last time even though world must have heard be wide awake in morning heard wheel of cart a be driven off a sound died away upon ear felt that be gone from for ever how have be that have said can not so often when heart be set upon can now remained to to take away from stalham a fast a might understood perfectly idea lady albury have expressed to well loved friend be nothing to anybody at stalham simply young lady staying in house a might be young lady connected with by blood young lady whose father mother have be friend have be brought there to stalham now second time in order that jonathan stubbs might take a wife driven by madness have refused destiny now nobody must want at stalham longer have better begin to pack up at once go coldness of people now that have refused to do a have be asked must be unbearable to yet must not let appear that stalham be no longer dear to merely because colonel stubbs have left must let day go by then say with ease must muster that must take departure on next after life before must be blank have known up to so at least told that jonathan stubbs must afford at rate chance now there must be other chance first blank day passed away seemed to almost a though have right to speak to one be sure that lady rufford knew what have occurred because nothing more be said a to proposed visit mr colonel stubbs must have be welcome anywhere who be ayala dormer even though lady albury bade come out in carriage seemed to to be done a final effort of kindness of course must be anxious to be rid of evening buxom woman did not come to help dress be accident buxom woman be wanted here there till be too late ayala have left room ayala in truth required assistance in dressing when first agonizing moment of new frock have be passed over must sooner have arrayed without assistance now seemed a though buxom woman be running away because ayala be thought to be no longer worthy of service on next morning began little speech to lady albury going away to morrow said lady albury perhaps next day suggested ayala dear have be arranged that must stay here for three week say be arranged everybody understood be sure aunt understood because one person go everybody else be to follow so a to break up party honour among thief thief well anything else like to call party have be made up to tell truth think that young lady have same right of changing mind rushing about a men assume young lady ought to be more steady where be to get young lady at moment notice to play lawn tennis with mr greene compose stay where be like good girl what will sir harry say sir harry will probably go on talking about stillborough fox quarreling with odious captain glomax be if remain here if go of sudden will perhaps hint hint what lady albury never mind will make hint if be good girl nothing be said at moment about colonel nothing further than little allusion made above then there came lawn tennis ayala regained something of spirit a contrived with assistance of sir harry to beat nina curate on following day lady albury spoke out more plainly be because of colonel stubbs that said that must go away ayala paused moment then answered stoutly yes be because of colonel stubbs why ayala paused again stoutness almost deserted because well dear think ought to be asked said ayala well will not be asked will not be cruel to do not know that if ask anything be with view to own good oh yes said ayala though may not ask suppose may speak to ayala made reply either assenting dissenting know do not that colonel stubbs love other like brother sister more dearly than many brother sister suppose so that therefore tell everything told what took place in wood because of have gone away of course be angry with because have gone away be sorry that have gone because of cause of always wish that must have everything that desire now wish that must have thing because desire above other thing doe desire above other thing thought ayala to herself if be really so can not now tell that will have can not say that too long to get quite a eagerly a longs to have suggestion rushed quickly to mind answer to came a quickly must not do so offer of kind must come from by what have said must abide unless indeed must come to again why must go ayala because have gone why must say aloud that have come here to listen to offer that have gone away a soon a have resolved that for reason that be not satisfactory to oh lady albury must be conclusion drawn remain here with see if can like well enough to be one of dear lady albury do love dearly what may do can not say whether may bring to try once again know will ask whether there might possibly be other answer be to do so no said ayala driven by sudden fit of obstinacy must not control ask question about be sure will be better for to remain here for few week will make happy if can can learn to think over what have passed without emotion thus be decided that ayala must prolong visit into middle of march must not understand own conduct when again found alone why have ejaculated that sudden when lady albury have suggested to possibility of changing purpose knew that must fain change if be possible yet when idea be presented to replied with sudden denial of possibility still there be hope even though hope be faint whether may bring to try again know so be that lady albury have spoken of of what lady albury said to now believed word whether must bring surely one a must not condescend so far a if did one word must be sufficient by one else must allow to be thought for instant that must wish to reverse decision must still be to other person from whom such suggestion might come must give chance must tell instantly truth of everything can love love be impossible must not love must be thus that answer must be given to must allow chance of making chapter lii call folly three week passed by ayala be still at stalham colonel stubbs have not a yet appeared very little have be said about sir henry must sometimes suggest that if meant to see more hunting have better come at once be not addressed to ayala made up mind that must not come be sure that be keeping away by presence must not bring to try over again a lady albury have put why must bring to do anything on behalf of one who have treated so badly have be settled that must remain to th of march when month must be up from time in lady albury have decided upon that a period of visit of secret have given no slightest hint if ever did come again must not be because have asked for coming a far a knew how to carry out such purpose concealed from lady albury anything like feeling of regret be so far successful that lady albury thought expedient to bring in other assistance to help cause a will be seen by letter ayala received when three week have passed by in meantime there have be at first dismay then wonder lastly amusement at condition of captain batsby when captain batsby have first learned at merle park that ayala jonathan stubbs be at stalham wrote very angrily to lady albury in answer to sister in law have pleaded guilty still defending how must make responsible for young lady who did not indeed seem ready to bestow affection on of suitor still acknowledged that little favour be being shown to colonel stubbs wishing to train man to idea that in special matter colonel stubbs must be recognised a stalham favourite then further letter be received from captain there came tidings that be staying at merle park ayala heard continually from sister lucy sent revelation a to captain seemed to be very much at home at merle park said lucy then at last expressed own opinion that captain batsby gertrude be becoming very fond of other yet whole story of gertrude mr houston be known of course to lucy through lucy to ayala to ayala sudden change be very amusing a certainly did not wish to retain own hold on captain be not specially attached to cousin gertrude from ayala tidings went to lady albury in way fear have be entertained a to captain displeasure be turned to wonder amusement up to period nothing have be heard of projected trip to ostend then came letter to ayala to allusion have be made letter from old friend marchesa who be now at rome be ostensibly in answer to letter from ayala be written in great part in compliance with instruction received from lady albury be a follows dear ayala be glad to get letter about nina be very

prospect have word two to say about bliss of somebody else nina be own child of course come first one jonathan stubbs be nephew be also very near to heart from hear fancy that have set mind also on connubial bliss have not heard that be so bird have whispered to that have not be kind to why must be so nobody know better than do that young lady be entitled to custody of own heart that must not be compelled even persuaded to give hand in opposition to own feeling if feeling heart be altogether opposed to poor fellow of course there must be end of have thought that from time first met have be favourite of yours so much so that there be moment in feared that might think too much of attention of man who have ever be favourite with who have known have found that in be altogether mistaken when came that evening to see last of at theatre taking a knew did considerable trouble to release from other engagement be pretty sure how be going to be be not man to be in love with girl for month then to be in love with next month when once allowed to think that be in love thing be done fixed for great delight else to great trouble knew how be to be so have be be not right in saying that on two occasion at considerable interval have come to made distinct offer of hand fear though actually know that have just a distinctly rejected offer know because none can know exact word with received from tender of that have to give can easily believe that with intelligence might be deceived by feminine reserve coyness of such girl a if be so do pray that folly may be allowed to interfere with happiness with yours call folly not because be adverse to feminine reserve not because be prone to quarrel even with what call coyness because know nature so well feel that must not bear rebuff of many man must think nothing that must not bring to ask again perhaps even for seventh time a might do if be that by frequent asking happiness yours must be insured must not be folly such happiness must be marred by childish disinclination on part to tell truth a said before if heart be set against there must be end of can understand that girl so young a must fail to see great merit of such man therefore write a do thinking possible that in respect may be willing to accept from mouth something a to man will be regarded a truth be on inner man on nature disposition that happiness of wife must depend more noble nature more truthful spirit than have never met be one on whom in phase of life may depend may depend a on rock be one without vacillation always steady to purpose requiring from in way of duty conduct infinitely more than demand from around if ever there be man altogether manly be one yet woman angel ever held heart more tender within bosom see with child think of word when have spoken to remember estimation in friend hold who know best such a friend lady albury sir harry cousin nina must name many others be with whom have seen most frequently if can love man do not think that must make happy if can not must there not be something wrong in heart unless indeed be already predisposed to one else think of dear ayala remember be always affectionate friend julia baldoni ayala first feeling a read letter be conviction that friend have altogether wasted labour in writing of what use be to tell of man virtue to tell that man heart be a tender a angel truth a assured a god courage that of hero that be possessed of attribute must by right belong to angel of light knew that without requiring evidence of lady from rome having need of evidence on matter from other human being of what use must evidence be on such subject from most truthful lip that ever spoke have not found out must word from others have prevailed with have found out be already gospel that be tender true manly heroic a brightly angelic a must be angel of light be already absolute fact to heart have never be predisposed to one else be of have always dreamed even long before have seen be man perfect in good thing who be to come take with if ever man must come take wanted marchesa baldoni now to tell that angel have in truth come realised before in glory have shown to be utterly unfit for angel though recognised now have not recognised in time even when have recognised have be driven by madness to reject feminine reserve coyness folly yes indeed knew that too without need of telling from elder kind of coyness have displayed have be very infatuation of feminine imbecility be because nature have made utterly unfit for destiny that have be driven by coyness feminine reserve to destroy be thus that ayala conversed with know nature so well feel that must not bear rebuff of many man must think nothing thus did not doubt marchesa have spoken very truly of what value be now must not recall rebuff must not now eradicate cowardice have made repeat wicked fatal word can not can not can not letter have come too late for there be nothing must do to amend doom must send answer to friend in italy there must be nothing in answer to to assist feminine reserve coyness have become odious to a have be displayed by to still remained in full force a to assistance from others must not tell to send back to must not implore help in trouble if must come of own accord impelled once more by great tenderness of heart once more from real real love then there must be more coyness if will still have oh yes there be letter to be written so wrote that by far greater part of larger part at least have reference to nina wedding will think of on th of april said will then be at home at kingsbury crescent will have nothing else to think of in be first allusion to own condition with lover on last side of sheet be necessary that must say more than something must be said thoughtfully carefully gratefully in reply to so much thought care friendship a have be shown to must be so written that nothing of secret must be read in task be so troublesome that be compelled to recopy whole of long letter because sentence a first written did not please be so much obliged to said by kindness about colonel stubbs did do honour of asking to be wife felt so be not to suppose did not understand that be over now can not explain to why felt that must not do be over therefore writing about be good only want to be sure of two thing that there be one else that do love so much for kindness may be sure of third thing too that be over do hope that will still let be friend a friend have always liked so much be brave bold thought in answer to such word a marchesa did not know how to do better on tuesday th of march be to return to kingsbury crescent various little word be said at stalham indicating intended break in arrangement captain certainly wo come now said lady albury alluding to arrangement a though have be made solely with view of saving ayala from encounter with objectionable lover croppy have come back said sir harry one day croppy being pony ayala have ridden miss dormer can have now for what little there be left of hunting be said on saturday before be to go how must ride croppy for rest of hunting when must be at kingsbury crescent on of occasion did say word assumed that little look of contradiction friend at stalham already knew how to read then on sunday morning there came letter for lady albury what doe say asked sir harry at breakfast will show before go to church answered wife then ayala knew that letter be from colonel stubbs did not expect that letter must be shown however came to be case when be in library waiting to start to church lady albury came in threw letter to across table that concern said have better read there be lady in room also waiting to start on walk across park therefore be natural that nothing else must be said at moment ayala read letter returned to envelope then handed back to lady albury so that there be word spoken about before church letter be very short be a follows will be at stalham by afternoon train on sunday th in time for dinner if will send dog cart must not leave most exigeant of place week suppose albury will go on in woodland for week ten day in april must put up with hear that batsby be altogether fixed by fascination of merle park hope that albury will receive consolation in money then there be postscript if croppy can be got back again miss dormer might see tumble into river be evident that lady albury did not expect anything to be said at present put letter into pocket there for moment be end of may be feared that ayala attention be not fixed that morning so closely a must have be on service of church there be so much in little letter insisted upon having attention have there be postscript letter must have be very different in case body of letter must have intended to have reference to rather must have have reference altogether opposite to postscript gave in case must have be manifest to that have intentionally postponed coming till have left stalham then suggestion about hunting must have have interest for everything must have be over must have be at kingsbury crescent must have be at stalham postscript declared intention of finding still in old quarter must not be there a declared to herself after there must be one other day then must be gone even allusion to to pony made letter something to of intense interest have not be so lady albury must not have shown to a be why have lady albury shown to in quiet placid friendly way a though be natural that letter from colonel stubbs to stalham must be shown to at lunch sir harry began about pony at once miss dormer said pony will hardly be fit to morrow distance during rest of week be too great for have better wait till monday week when stubbs will be here to look after be going home on tuesday said ayala have have pony brought on purpose for said sir harry be not going at said lady albury have to be altered will write to mr dosett think began ayala will take very much amiss said sir harry if go now stubbs be coming on purpose think began ayala again dear ayala be case for thinking said lady albury most positively will not leave house till day in april will have to be settled hereafter let have word more about then on immediate occasion further word about be spoken ayala be quite unable to speak a sat attempting to eat lunch chapter liii how lucy affair arranged must go again to merle park where tringle family be still living from gertrude have not a yet be violently abducted at period to reader have be brought in relation have be given of affair at stalham jonathan stubbs little note to lady albury be received on sunday rd march gertrude be not abducted till th on th be brought back not in great triumph at time house be considerably perturbed sir thomas be very angry with daughter augusta having be led to believe that have be privy to gertrude escapade so angry that very violent word have be spoken a to expulsion from house tom also be ill absolutely ill in bed with doctor to see from love declaring that must throw over ship side drown while there be yet chance left to for ayala in midst of lady tringle herself be by mean exempt from paternal wrath be told that must have known what be going on between daughter that idiot captain that encouraged trafficks to remain that coddled up son till be sick from sheer lackadaisical idleness only one in house who seemed to be exempt from wrath of sir thomas be lucy therefore be upon lucy head fell concentrated energy of aunt emmeline revenge when captain batsby be spoken of with contumely in light of husband being always done by sir thomas lady tringle must make rejoinder to when sir thomas have turned back by saying that captain in majesty army with good blood in vein competent fortune be at rate better than poor artist who have so to say blood be unable to earn bread when tom be ridiculed for love for ayala must go on to explain always after sir thomas back have be turned that poor tom have be encouraged by father whereas lucy have taken upon to engage in opposition to pastor master then came climax be very well to say that augusta be intruding there be people who intruded much worse than augusta without so much right when be said poor sore hearted woman felt own cruelty endeavoured to withdraw harsh word wound have be given venom rankled so bitterly that lucy must no longer bear existence among tringles ought not to remain after wrote to lover though went into poor house ought not to remain wrote to mr hamel said to aunt told that a did not like being here have better better go away where be to go did say did like being here ought to take up in way do feel that be in way aunt think have better go where be to go declare that everybody say everything to break heart of course be to remain here till have got house to keep in letter have gone reply have come telling lucy that might be poor house to must be destined must be there to share with hamel wrote with high heart have already resolved previous to that must at once prepare home for coming bride though be sore distressed by emergency of position father have become more more bitter with a learned that son must in respect be guided by there be sum of money now declared to be due to isadore acknowledged to have be lent to of father demanded repayment if said acknowledge anything of obedience of son that money be at disposal other that may want if determine to be a free from control a deaf to advice a might be other young man then must be to a might be other young man have written to father saying that money must be repaid a soon a possible misfortune have come to at trying time be however before have received lucy last account of own misery at merle park so when be received be in part prepared colonel in writing to lady albury have declared aldershot to be most exigeant place by have intended to imply that professional care be too heavy to allow frequent absence nevertheless must contrive occasionally to fly up to london for little relief once when doing so have found sitting in sculptor studio there listening to hamel account of lucy trouble at merle park hamel said nothing a to own difficulty be very eager in explaining necessity of removing lucy from tyranny to be subjected will perhaps be remembered that hamel down in scotland have declared to friend purpose of asking lucy dormer to be wife also success of enterprise after have gone across lake to glenbogie will be borne in mind also must colonel succeed in winning ayala to way of thinking two men must become husband of two sister fully sympathised with other in way have become sincere intimate friend be like sister asked colonel who be not a yet acquainted with lucy hardly like although in truth there be family likeness lucy be taller with perhaps more regular feature certainly more quiet in manner ayala can be very quiet too said lover oh yes because varies in mood remember almost a child when must remain perfectly still for quarter of hour then must be up about house everywhere glancing about like ray of sun reflected from mirror a move in hand have grown steadier since said colonel can not imagine to be steady not a lucy be steady lucy if be necessary can sit fill with own thought for hour together of be most like father be of like in thorough love for thing beautiful be of unlike in that be indulgent while like woman in general be always devoting to others will not devote to thought jonathan stubbs to may be because like father love thing beautiful poor lucy continued hamel must fain devote to around if must only permit must probably prefer devoting to said colonel doubt must if be expedient if may presume that love may presume also that must wish to live with be not expedient asked other will be so trust before long seems to be so necessary just at present to sculptor at moment made reply if continued stubbs treat among a say ought at rate to be relieved from misery ought to be relieved certainly will be relieved say that be not expedient only meant that there be difficulty difficulty will have to be got over think that difficulty be got over when man look at steadily suppose be affair of money well yes difficulty seem to to be affair of money man of course must wish to earn enough before marries to make wife comfortable must struggle on a be not be impatient be not that fear be more uncomfortable a be now than must be here in midst of poverty after hamel what be extent of poverty be real circumstance a have gone so far might a well tell everything then after considerable pressure sculptor did tell everything there be income of le than three hundred year must probably become about four within next twelvemonth there be fund prepared with to buy necessary furniture for incoming of wife there be debt demanded by father must be paid asked colonel must starve rather than not pay said hamel if alone be to be considered must certainly be paid within next six month if be alone even though must starve then friend told that debt must be paid at once amounted to little more than hundred pound then of course conversation be carried further when friend inquires a to pecuniary distress of friend feel a matter of course bound to relieve must supply also mean necessary for incoming of young wife with much energy for long time hamel refused to accept assistance offered to colonel insisted in first place on what considered to be due from to ayala sister then on fact that doubted not in least ultimate success must attend professional industry of friend so before day be over be settled among money be to be forthcoming at once so that debt might be paid preparation made hamel be to write to lucy declare that must be ready to receive a soon a arrangement must be made for immediate marriage then came further outrage cruel speech a to intruder lucy wrote to lover owning that must be well for that must be relieved news be of course declared to family at merle park never knew anything so hard said aunt emmeline of course have told that be fault when lucy made answer to went on with complaint know that have told have turned out be not true told be better must go a did not like being here suppose lucy be in little hurry to have marriage come off said augusta who must surely have spared cousin if at moment have remembered haste have be displayed by sister thought best said lucy be sure know how be to be done said aunt emmeline must tell uncle know how be to be married from here seeing trouble be in will be up in london before said gertrude from queen gate continued aunt emmeline suppose will much signify will just go to church like servant maid asked gertrude yes like servant maid said lucy be to say servant maid must suppose simply walk in be married will do same think have better tell uncle said aunt emmeline be sure did not mean that be to go away like will be own doing can not help if will do then lucy did tell uncle mean to live upon three hundred year exclaimed sir thomas know what be talking about think mr hamel know be a ignorant a babe unborn mean about kind of thing doubt can make thing in stone a well a anybody in marble uncle tom marble be stone suppose in iron bronze uncle tom very well there be iron in bronze suppose doe know what wife will cost have bought furniture be going to buy just little will do why must want to bring into lucy looked wistfully up into face have be personally kind to found to be impossible to complain to of aunt be not happy here aunt cousin think that be wrong must be married to now uncle tom why did kick up heel when wanted to help nevertheless gave order on subject very much in lucy favour be to be married from queen gate gertrude must be bridesmaid ayala doubt must be other when wife expostulated consented that marriage must be very quiet still must have a have said then bestowed cheque upon lucy larger in amount than stubbs loan saying that after what have passed in lombard street must not venture to send money to so independent person a mr isadore hamel adding that lucy perhaps must condescend to accept there be smile in eye a said otherwise ill natured word so lucy without wound to feeling must kiss accept bounty suppose be to have nothing to do in settling day said aunt emmeline be however settled between that marriage must take place on certain day in may upon lucy be of course overjoyed wrote to lover in full flow of spirit sent cheque having written name with great pride on back of there be little trouble about a part of have to come back a trousseau still arrangement be pleasantly made then sir thomas again became more kind to in rough manner even when trouble be at worst after return of gertrude if will not be altogether oppressive to pride may tell that will make allowance of hundred year a niece just for personal expense know that be so proud uncle tom seemed so to if say nothing to about just buy few gown now again will perhaps be so wrapt up in higher affair of art a not to take notice be sure will notice what wear said lucy however communicated uncle intention to lover sent back grateful thanks to sir thomas a one effect of colonel money be sent back to with assurance that a thing be now settling such pecuniary assistance be not needed be not done till ayala have heard what angel of light have done on sister behalf a to ayala feeling in respect must be silent here a otherwise must make premature allusion to condition in ayala found before have at last managed to escape from stalham park papa said gertrude to father one evening think must do something for too now just at time sir thomas greatly to own annoyance be coming down to merle park evening according to plan a at present arranged be to stay in country till after easter then be to go up to town in time to despatch poor tom upon long journey round world poor tom be now in bed apparently ill there seemed to be great doubt whether must be made to go on appointed day in spite of taking of berth preparation of outfit tom if well enough be to sail on nineteenth of april there now wanted not above ten day to time think must do something for now asked gertrude hitherto sir thomas have extended no sign of pardon to youngest daughter never failed to allude to to captain batsby a two idiot whenever name be mentioned before yes dear will endeavour to do good deal for if will behave do call behaving papa in first place telling that be very sorry for misbehaviour with idiot of course be sorry if have offended well that will go for something how about idiot papa exclaimed be not idiot must one idiot have gone on errand a gentleman lady have done before papa doubt said gentleman have run away with young lady before generally have behaved very badly when have done so behaved very badly indeed because have come to house with sanction with express purpose of expressing affection for young lady think that folly in special running away be worse even than conduct how did come to think that must get married merely by crossing over sea to ostend must be utterly ashamed of a son in law chiefly because have shown to be idiot papa will accept wo dear will not not though love if be to give choice must take mr houston houston be scoundrel very likely then be not idiot choice must be altogether in favour of mr houston will tell will do dear will consent to accept captain batsby a son in law if will consent to become husband without having shilling with must that be kind papa think that can show greater kindness than to protect from man who be quite sure doe not care farthing about have tell ample income of own oh yes papa then can afford to marry without fortune poor mr houston must not have done so because have nothing of own declare a think of be becoming very tender hearted towards mr houston think have better have mr houston back again suppose must come if be to send for then burst into tear went away hid chapter liv tom last attempt while gertrude be still away on ill omened voyage in quest of parson lady tringle be stirred up to great enterprise on behalf of unhappy son there wanted now little more than fortnight before starting of ship father still declared must carry out across world have progressed so far in contemplating matter a to own to that must be best for to obey father if there be hope mind be still swayed by theory of love constancy have heard of men who have succeeded after dozen time of asking if stubbs hated generous stubbs be in truth successful rival then indeed thing must be over then must go sooner better a told mother dozen time day must matter nothing to whether be sent to japan rocky mountain north pole in such case must be quite content to go if only for sake of going how be to be sure be indeed nearly sure in other direction if ayala be in truth engaged to colonel stubbs must certainly be known through lucy then have heard through lucy that though ayala be staying at colonel be not there have gone ayala have remained week after week without then towards end of march wrote letter to uncle reginald be very piteous in tone dear uncle reginald letter said know whether have heard of have be very ill unhappy be now in bed nobody here know that be sending letter to be about ayala be not such fool a to suppose that can do anything for if must think must of course ca must choose for only do so wish that must choose nobody must ever be more kind to can tell really how be be engaged to marry colonel stubbs know that refused because told so if be not engaged to think must have shy at know what poet say faint heart never won fair lady do tell if be be not engaged know that be with alburys colonel stubbs be friend ca make marry colonel stubbs more than friend can make marry wish must mean friend not if be really engaged must go away hide in furthermost corner of world siberia central africa must be same to must have little trouble in getting rid of if knew that be over with will never stir from realm till know fate therefore waiting reply be affectionate nephew thomas tringle junior mr dosett when received letter consulted wife before replied to then did so very shortly dear tom a far a know aunt cousin ayala be not engaged to marry one must deceive if did not add belief that be resolved not to accept offer have done honour to make affectionate uncle reginald dosett latter portion of paragraph have influence whatsoever on tom did not know that before have ever attempted to conceal from relation fact that ayala have refused again again be not that a notorious to world at large a minister promise that income tax must be abolished income tax be not abolished a yet ayala be not married to one else ayala be not even engaged to other suitor why must not change mind a well a minister certainly must not go either to north pole to new york a long a there must be hope of bliss for in england then called mother to bedside go to stalham dear said mother why not ca eat lady albury be more than baronet wife just same a be about eating tom must know what to say to need not tell anything say that have come to call upon niece must be such odd thing to do never do call on ayala even when be in london what doe matter being odd must learn truth at rate if doe not care for one else why must have must make baronet wife be day when governor tom talk in way only mean in course of nature son do come after father know a for money suppose governor be quite a rich a alburys think must matter doe count mother suppose ayala be same a other girl in respect be sure know why be that must have taken aversion to suppose be that doe think so much quite such swell a other men one ca account for such thing tom be just therefore might come round without accounting for at rate might try might tell that be ruining that will have to go about wandering over world because be so hard hearted think must dear said lady tringle after considering matter for while why not be because of trouble dear mother doe not think what trouble may take for child if good may be done be not trouble must walk round england to get for if must do why not then at rate might get answer from must tell something of intention mother will never go away till know more about than do now governor say that will turn out let turn out wo make go away oh tom doe mean say if knew that be over chance be gone then must go away be not alburys be afraid of said lady tringle what then be father can not go if will not let nevertheless promised before left bedside that must ask sir thomas when came home whether must permit to make journey occurred while sir thomas be away in quest of daughter may be imagined that immediately after return be hardly in humour to yield to such request a have be suggested be for moment almost sick of child sick of merle park sick of wife inclined to think that only comfort to be found in world be to be have among million in little back parlour in lombard street be on sunday that returned on day did not see son on monday morning went into room tom be about to press upon prayer have addressed to mother when lip be closed by father harshness tom said will be pleased to remember that start on nineteenth father start on nineteenth said sir thomas then left room closing door behind with none of tenderness generally accorded to invalid have not asked tom said to mother shortly afterwards not yet dear mind be so disturbed by unfortunate affair be not mind disturbed may tell will not go though must turn out dozen time unless know more about than do now sir thomas came home again that evening very sour in temper nothing must be said to be angry with everybody lady tringle hardly dared to go near then on following morning on tuesday evening however returned somewhat softened in demeanour million have perhaps gone right though child must go so wrong when spoke to younger daughter of did so in jeering tone afterwards always assumed when allusion be made to captain batsby disagreeable a be seemed to imply something of forgiveness ate dinner drank glass of wine without making allusion to parsimonious habit of son in law mr traffick lady tringle therefore considered that might approach with tom request go to stalham exclaimed well dear suppose must see what must learn from suppose must learn much be always pig headed stiff necked creature be sure must be pleasure to to see what good must do demanded sir thomas well dear say that wo go unless can get message from be sure want to go to stalham nothing on earth must be so disagreeable perhaps must bring back word two must make go upon journey what sort of word why if be to say that be engaged to colonel stubbs then must go say that must start at once if knew that cousin be really engaged to somebody else if be not perhaps must just colour little must be such grand thing to get away in miserable condition if be once on travel do think must soon begin to forget of course must said sir thomas then might a well try have set heart upon if think have done bidding then will obey a for turning out tom of course really mean that in answer to sir thomas said nothing knew well enough that tom must be turned out that turning out of son be difficult task to accomplish one altogether beyond power of sir thomas chief cause of sorrow lay in fact that a head of travers treason be debarred from assistance companionship of son travers treason be nothing to because son must run so far away from right path there be nothing must not do to bring back if ayala must have be bought by reasonable even unreasonable amount of thousand must have bought willingly for boy delight be thing wonderful to that tom must have be upset so absolutely by love did appreciate feeling so far that be willing to condone folly already committed if tom must only put in way of recovery that massacreing of policeman ill spent night at mountaineer at bolivia foolish challenge almost more foolish blow under portico at haymarket must be forgiven if tom must only consent to go through slight purgation must again fit for travers treason purgation must be made a pleasant a possible must travel about world with pocket full of money with arrangement for luxurious comfort only must go there be other way in must be so purged a to be again fit for travers treason did not at believe that ayala must now be purchased whether pig headed not ayala be certainly willed good such a tom expected must come from projected visit to stalham if must allow to be made in obedience to tom request then perhaps tidings might be brought back whether strictly true not might induce tom to allow to be put on board ship arguing thus with sir thomas at last gave consent be most disagreeable task mother thus undertook must not go from merle park to stalham back in one day be necessary that must sleep two night in london be arranged therefore that must go up to london on thursday then make journey down to stalham back on friday get home on saturday there must then still remain nearly fortnight before tom must have to leave merle park after much consideration be decided that note must be written to ayala apprising of aunt coming hope lady albury will not be surprised at visit said note be so anxious to see just for hour upon matter of great importance will run chance must prefer to have seen girl without notice then have notice be given girl must perhaps have be out of way a be telegram be received back in reply will be at home lady albury will be very glad to see at lunch say there will be room ready if will sleep certainly will not stay there lady tringle said to mr traffick be a well to know that will be civil to be stuck up sort of people believe said augusta just like marchesa baldoni who be one of a to being civil be matter of course must hardly be uncivil to one connected with lord boardotrade then came thursday on journey be to be commenced a moment came near lady tringle be very much afraid of task before be afraid even of niece ayala who have assumed increased proportion in eye since have persistently refused not only tom also colonel stubbs captain batsby then in spite of own connexion with lord boardotrade of whom since daughter marriage have learned to think le than have done before did feel that alburys be fashionable people ayala a guest have achieved something for stalham be doubt superior in general estimation to merle park with there have be always certain awe of ayala have not felt in reference to lucy ayala demand that augusta must go upstairs fetch scrap book have have effect a have also success in going up st peter to marchesa dance then there must be lady albury alburys only that tom be very anxious must even now have abandoned undertaking mother said tom on last morning will do best can for oh yes dear do think that if must make understand real truth might have yet must like that fellow must die be afraid that be hard hearted tom believe mother have seen when must kill even fly if must only be made to see good must do be afraid wo care for unless can bring really to love why must love ah boy how be to tell perhaps if have loved so well might have be different if have scorned scorn her must scorn have heard of kind of thing before how be one to help ca scorn friend just because choose to say so to when see be something so precious to must not be rough to to save life when first came be so must laugh at then now talk about goddess be sure be goddess to if have made no more than woman of might have be better tom be too late now doctrine lady tringle be enunciating to son repudiated be one have be often preached never practised man when be conscious of presence of mere woman to whom feel that worship be due may for own purpose be able to tell lie to make believe that acknowledges divinity in presence when feel goddess can not carry before a though be mere woman a such inferior to in attribute poor tom have felt touch of something divine have fallen immediately prostrate before shrine with face to ground chance with ayala must in circumstance have be great be certainly not one to have yielded to prostrate worshipper mother said tom recalling lady tringle a be leaving room what be dear must really go now will be too late for train mother tell tell tell love mother ran back kissed brow then left room lady tringle spent that evening in queen gate where sir thomas remained with hour passed heavily a have not much present to mind with to console other sir thomas have belief whatever in journey except in so far a might help to induce son to proceed upon travel wife have be so far softened by poor tom sorrow a to hope little in spite of judgment that ayala might yet relent heart be soft towards son so that felt that girl must deserve manner of punishment unless must at last yield to tom wish be sure that must not be so yet in spite of conviction hoped on next morning train took safely to stalham road station a approached end of journey heart became heavier within felt that must not fail to give excuse to alburys for journey unless indeed ayala must do a must have at station found albury carriage with albury coachman albury footman albury livery waiting for be closed carriage for moment thought that ayala might be there in case must have performed commission in carriage then have returned to london without going to house at ayala be not there lady tringle be driven up to house then taken through hall into small sitting room where for moment be alone then door opened ayala radiant with beauty in prettiness of best morning costume be in moment in arm seemed in brightness to be different from ayala who have be known before at glenbogie in rome dear aunt said ayala be so delighted to see at stalham chapter lv in castle there lived knight ayala be compelled to consent to remain at think repeated so often be of course of avail to sir harry must be angry lady albury must be disgusted be to go so remained there be to be week before colonel stubbs must come be to remain not only for week also for short time afterwards so

colonel stubbs have be three four day at stalham basking in sunshine of ayala love that of stalham family heard of great event have occurred in life of ayala third lover during walk to from

have escaped so long nobody know man when have just engaged to be married be a prone a ever to talk of other men escaping feeling that though other young lady be better than evil to be avoided young

what do think have happened said sir harry jumping up from chair at breakfast table what have happened asked wife benjamin have run off to ostend with young lady benjamin with young lady exclaimed lady albury ayala stubbs be equally astonished of knowing that captain have be excluded from stalham because of ardour of unfortunate love for ayala ayala be doing said ayala be very glad if be happy who be young lady asked stubbs be that make so very peculiar said sir harry looking at ayala have learned something of tringle family be aware of ayala connection with who be harry demanded ladyship sir thomas tringle younger daughter gertrude exclaimed ayala who also knew of engagement with mr houston worst of be continued sir harry that be not at happy young lady have come back while nobody know what have become of benjamin benjamin never will get wife said lady albury thus detail of little event became known at stalham except immediate condition whereabouts of lover of captain condition whereabouts something must be told when great disruption came have be abused ridiculed by sir thomas at ostend felt that must neither remain there where very waiter knew what have happened must return to dover in same vessel with sir thomas daughter therefore took first train went to brussels brussels did not offer many allurement in present frame of mind found nobody there whom particularly knew nothing particular to do solitude in continental town with amusement beyond offered by table d'hote theatre be oppressing time endeavoured to occupy with thinking of last promise have made to gertrude must break must keep sir thomas tringle be doubt very rich man then there be fact must become known to world that have run off with young lady must ultimately succeed in marrying young lady enterprise must bear le of appearance of failure than must do otherwise then must money not be forthcoming consolation coming from possession of gertrude must hardly suffice to make happy man sir thomas when came to consider matter must certainly feel that daughter have compromised herself by journey that must be good for to be married to man who have taken might be that sir thomas must yield consent to make at rate compromise rumour have reached ear that traffick have received l with elder daughter must consent to take half sum after week spent amidst charm of brussels returned to london without public declaration of doing so sneaked back a friend of said of at club then went to work to carry out purpose a best might all be known of at stalham be that have returned to lodging in london on th of april when ayala be promised bride of nearly two week standing uncle aunt be aware that lot in life have be fixed for sir thomas be alone in back room in lombard street with mind sorely diverted from only joy of life whole family be now in town septimus traffick with wife be actually occupying room in queen gate how have come to pas sir thomas hardly knew word have be extracted from signifying compliance with request that augusta might come to house for night two until fitting residence must be prepared for something have be said of lord boardotrade house being vacated for husband early in april occurrence to married lady be liable be about to take place with augusta sir thomas certainly understood that occurrence be to be expected under roof of coming infant noble grandfather something a to ancestral hall have be thrown out in chance way of conversation then certainly have assented to minimum of london hospitality for daughter a certainly not including presence of son in law now of be domiciled in big front spare bed room at queen gate perplexed sorely then tom have be brought up from country still a invalid mother moaning groaning over a though be sick almost past hope of recovery yet nineteenth of month now only eight day distant be still fixed for departure tom on return of mother from stalham have to certain extent accepted a irrevocable fact of bore tidings ayala be engaged to stubbs must doubtless with very little delay become mr jonathan stubbs knew said knew nothing must have prevented unless have shot through heart told that have refused man must have looked like after being refused by ayala then never expressed hope again be over for a regarded ayala still refused to be well even for day two to leave bed have allowed mother to understand that if fact of engagement be indubitably brought home to must gird up loin for journey proceed at once wherever might be thought good to send father have sternly reminded of promise when so reminded tom have turned in bed uttered groan instead of reply now have be brought up to london be no longer actually in bed even yet have not signified intention of girding up loin proceeding upon journey nevertheless preparation be going on under sir thomas direction portmanteau be already being packed gertrude also be source of discomfort to father considered to have be deprived of two lover one after other in spirit of cruel parsimony with heavy weight upon breast refused to take part in family conversation everything have be done for augusta everything be to be done for tom for nothing have be done nothing have be promised be therefore very sulky with trouble around sir thomas be sitting oppressed disheartened in lombard street on friday th of april then there entered to one of junior clerk with card announcing name of captain batsby looked at for second before gave notification of intention then desired young man to tell gentleman that must not see message have be delivered captain batsby with frown of anger on brow be about to shake dust off from foot on uncourteous threshold when there came message saying that captain batsby must go in see sir thomas if wished upon turned round be shown into little sitting room well captain batsby said sir thomas what can do for now be glad to see that have come back safely from foreign part have called said captain to say something about daughter what more can have to say about at captain be considerably puzzled of course sir thomas must know what have to say way in be separated at ostend be very distressing to feeling daresay also must think to miss tringle not improbably have always observed that when people be interrupted in performance of egregious stupidity feeling be hurt a said before what can do for now be very anxious to complete alliance have done honour to propose to did not know that have proposed anything came down to house under false pretence then persuaded daughter else persuaded to go off together to ostend be that what call alliance a far a went be be elopement be to understand that now want to arrange elopement that have come to ask consent oh dear then what do mean by completing alliance want to make said captain offer for young lady hand in proper form consider to be in position justifies in doing so be possessed of young lady affection have mean of own equal to presume will be disposed to give very much better mean hope captain batsby otherwise see what wife must have to live upon will tell exactly what feeling be in matter daughter have gone off with forgetting duty that owed to to mother throwing aside idea of propriety after will not say that will not marry if of think fit doubt mean have reason for supposing that must be cruel to be two fool after fool must live in world what do say be will not give sixpence towards supporting in folly now captain batsby can complete alliance not a please captain batsby have be called fool also at ostend there amidst distressing circumstance of position have be constrained to bear opprobious name little customary a be for one gentleman to allow to be called fool by now have collected thought have reminded of position in world have told that did not become to be too humble before city man of business might have be very well at ostend be not going to be called fool in london without resenting sir thomas said fool folly be term can not allow to use to if present to here captain batsby at own house perhaps may say at ostend will use such term to suppose will acknowledge that be entitled to ask for daughter hand suppose will acknowledge that when man run away with daughter be entitled to express opinion of conduct be over now sir thomas what did did for love there be good in cry over spilt milk question be a to future happiness of young lady be only wise word have heard say captain batsby there be good in cry after spilt milk journey to ostend be done gone be not very agreeable have lived through quite think that show good judgment in not intending to go there again in quest of clergyman if want to be married there be plenty of in london will not oppose marriage will not give shilling man ever have better opportunity of showing disinterestedness of affection now good morning sir thomas captain batsby time be precious have told all that there be to tell then stood up captain with stern demeanour angry brow left room took in silence away from lombard street do want to marry captain batsby sir thomas said to daughter that evening having invited to come apart with after dinner yes do think that prefer on whole to mr houston mr houston be scoundrel wish that must not talk about papa like so much best of two said sir thomas of course be for to judge must have brought to give something to houston luckily however captain batsby have got income of own have papa be sure that must like to take a husband yes papa very well have be with to day be in london tell that have be with to day in lombard street what did say did say anything about yes dear came to ask for hand well papa told must make objection must leave altogether to only interfered with one small detail a to own wish assured must never give single shilling suppose will matter much to a have know mean of own be thus that sir thomas punished daughter for misconduct captain batsby trafficks be acquainted with other member of parliament have of course heard of journey to ostend from wife have be instigated by to express opinion that young people ought to be married be such very serious thing said augusta to husband to be four hour on sea together then know mr traffick acknowledged that be serious be reminded by wife that in capacity of brother be bound to interfere on sister behalf papa know understands nothing about kind of thing with family interest seat in parliament ought to be able to arrange traffick probably knew how far family interest seat in parliament must avail have at rate got wife with large fortune be promising for still further certain domiciliary advantage doubted whether must do much for batsby still promised to try if must arrange matter might be that must curry fresh favour with sir thomas by doing so therefore made business to encounter captain batsby on sunday afternoon at club to belonged so have come back from little trip said member of parliament captain be not unwilling to discus question of family relation with mr traffick if anybody must have influence with sir thomas might probably be mr traffick yes have come back without bride without bride a yet be

that will live to have comfortable wife large family become in course of year senior partner in great house of travers treason let who have soft heart now throw old shoe after chapter lxii how very much loved have seen how mr traffick be finally turned out of father in law house rather not quite finally when last saw a continued to sleep at queen gate for two three night after until have found shelter for head did without encountering sir thomas sir thomas pretending while to believe that be gone then in very truth last pair of boot be removed wife remained awaiting great occurrence with paternal comfort around mr traffick having be quite right in surmising that father must not expose daughter in delicate condition to inclemency of weather more than natural attention on part of father grandfather to need of own daughter grandchild did not in least mitigate in bosom of member of parliament wrath felt at own expulsion be not a said to fact that be expelled coarseness of language used truth be said to friend in house that though be arranged must remain there till after wife confinement must not bear language will probably be acknowledged that language be of nature not to be borne when therefore captain batsby went down to house on day of tom departure to see counsellor found mr traffick full rather of anger than of counsel oh yes said member walking with captain up down of lobby spoke to told mind very freely when say will do thing always do a for tringle nobody know better than doe not do to be afraid of there be little bit of cur about what did say did like truth be know mind speaking to openly oh said batsby think ought to do a well with second girl a have done with first captain batsby at opened eye said nothing having good income of own thought much of not being younger son of lord not being member of parliament thought le of advantage of high privilege did not suit however to argue question at present moment be proud of connection with family look perhaps even more than ought to do to seat in house must get in if cared for said batsby very likely be more difficult than ever to find seat just now family connection of course doe help one have to trust to that good deal before be known what did sir thomas say made uncommonly disagreeable can tell that must very well abuse be very particular in what said about of course be cut up about elopement felt augusta be very much hurt in precarious state be so likely to do mischief ca be undone now no ca be undone make one feel that ca make demand for money a though set about in other way when made up mind to marry stated what thought have right to demand got knew very well must take shilling le doe make difference when know very well that have got to marry girl whether with without money have got to marry girl at have rather think have old fellow be generally considered that when gentleman have gone off with girl mean to marry not if father come after brings back when have gone afterwards to family house proposed again in mother presence in mr traffick received unfair advantage from communication be made to by wife of course must marry sir thomas know that knowing why must be flush with money never allowed to say single word must use against till ready money down have be all settled what be did say batsby be thoroughly sick of hearing counsellor tell so many thing a to

be stingy money there right girl be own child will have to wait time be have nothing to begin with will be about think what doe matter batsby be always talking about income aint not so much a do of seat in parliament everybody say be likely to lose at next election then of course there be quarrel mr traffick took offended dignity back to house almost doubting whether might not be duty to bring captain batsby to bar for contempt of privilege captain took off in thorough disgust nevertheless there be fact that have engaged to young lady second time have run away with with object of marrying have then according to own theory in such matter be relieved from responsibility by appearance of father re abduction of young lady a young lady have be taken away from be to be supposed that intended marriage be negatived by proper authority when starting for brussels be free man have be wise must have remained there at equally safe distance from lady charm then from distance might have made demand for money elopement must have operated in favour rather than otherwise have come back have foolishly allowed to be persuaded to show at queen gate have obeyed traffick advice now traffick have simply thrown over quarrelled with have too promised in presence of mother married sister that must marry young lady without regard to money felt be very angry with consoling a best might with reflection that sir thomas money be certainly safe sir thomas be liberal man in present condition must be well for thought to remain inactive see what circumstance must do for circumstance very

that sister in law be entitled to visit workshop in sister future bread be to be earned then starting from kingsbury crescent must go in cab whereas such proceeding emanating from queen gate must have

other girl without shilling there be stubbs houston batsby gone drowned be just same a though 'd drowned lord john be horrified nay disgusted by folly of world nevertheless before end of year be engaged to marry very pretty girl a devoid of fortune a ayala chapter lxiv ayala marriage now have come to last chapter may be doubted whether reader unless be one specially gifted with genius for statistic will have perceived how very many people have be made happy by matrimony if marriage be proper ending for novel only ending a writer take to be be not discordant surely tale be ever so properly ended with so full concord a one infinite trouble have be taken not only in arranging marriage in joining like to like so that if not happiness at rate sympathetic unhappiness might be produced two sister will be trusted be happy have chosen men from heart have be chosen after same fashion two other sister have be so wedded that one will follow idiosyncrasy of husband other bring husband to follow idiosyncrasy without much danger of mutiny revolt a to miss docimer there must be room for fear may be questioned whether be not worthy of better lot than have be achieved for by joining fortune to of frank houston speaking for have hope of frank houston be hard to rescue man from slough of luxury idleness combined if anything can do be cradle filled annually may be that will yet learn that broad back with heavy weight upon give best chance of happiness here below of lord john married prospect must not say much a came so very lately on scene even may perhaps do something in world when find that nursery be filling for special friend tom tringle wife have be found in making effort did manfully certainly have not chosen consort who must be fit for have not seen clearly a have done sister cousin have fallen in love too young being nature of young men to be much younger than young lady not knowing have be a might be barn door cock who have set heart upon azure plumaged high soaring lady of wood lady with azure plume have too high soaring tendency be enabled by true insight to find male who must be fit for barn door cock when left on board steamer going to new york have not yet learned nature of own requirement knowledge will come to there may be doubt a to frank houston think that there need be none a to tom tringle proper wife will be forthcoming in future year when will probably have glenbogie merle park of own will own fortune did well for in making cousin ayala so stern to prayer ayala ayala pet heroine have not be yet married when last chapter be written now there remains page two in reader must bid adieu to a stand at altar with angel of light be at stalham for fortnight before marriage in order a lady albury said that buxom ladysmaid might see that everything have be done rightly in reference to trousseau dear said lady albury be important know dare say can bake brew because say so know anything about clothes ayala who by time be very intimate with friend pouted lip said that if jonathan did not like thing a chose to have might do other thing lady albury have way inducing sir harry to add something even to uncle tom liberality buxom woman went about task in such fashion that if colonel stubbs be not satisfied must have be very unconscionable colonel probably must know nothing about except that bride in bridal array have not looked so well a in other garment take be invariably case till at end of first year glimmer of truth a to lady wardrobe must come upon told there must be many new dress before two year be over miss said buxom female a spread frock worked petticoat collar silk stocking lace handkerchief about bedroom to be inspected by lady albury mr gosling one two other friend before be finally packed up then came day on colonel be to reach stalham that day being monday whereas wedding be to take place on wednesday be considered to be within bound of propriety that colonel must sleep at stalham on monday under same roof with bride on tuesday be arranged that must satisfy decorous feeling of neighbourhood by removing to parsonage be distant about mile across park be contiguous to church here lived mr greene bachelor curate rector of parish being invalid absent in italy see why be to be sent away after dinner to walk across park in dark said ayala when matter be discussed before colonel coming be law dear said lady albury have to be obeyed whether understand not like other law mr greene will be with so that one will run away with in dark then will be able to go into church without dirtying dress boot thought there must be dozen carriage at least there wo be room in one of for be to be nobody until come forth from church a husband then be to be everybody be very theory of marriage think managed very well between said lady albury afterwards really can not guess trouble took why must there have be trouble because be perverse creature a old lady said be not sure that be not right because girl doe so often raise in lover estimation by refusing dozen time be not up to indeed be not be sure did not intend to give trouble to anybody did only think of going up to london to meet of coming from aldershot to meet simply that might put head together how to overcome perversity of young woman a there then came look almost of pain on ayala brow do believe be for best in way came to understand how absolutely necessary be to be necessary to think so oh if can only be necessary to always there must have be going up to london must have rushed into arm at once must have be unusual so be unusual said ayala be probable that colonel did not enjoy day at stalham before marriage except during hour two in be allowed to take ayala out for last walk such day can hardly be agreeable to man of whom be known by around that be on eve of committing matrimony there be always on such occasion feeling of weakness a though man have be subdued brought at length into cage tamed so a to be made fit for domestic purpose deprived of ancient freedom amongst wood whereas girl feel to be triumphant conqueror who have successfully performed great act of taming such being case man have perhaps better keep away till be forced to appear at church door nevertheless colonel did enjoy last walk oh yes said of course will go to old wood where else be so glad that poor fox went through gobblegoose otherwise must never have gone there then who know whether must ever have be friend again more if one wood have be there think must have be found ah be just can know that have purpose perhaps be determined to carry out well rather must be sure of must carry out purpose even if have one have to doubt to be unhappy to hate because have be perverse declare do think men have so much best of how glorious must have be to be able to walk straight up say jonathan stubbs love better than world will be husband suppose jonathan stubbs of occasion be to decline honour where must be then must be disagreeable said ayala be disagreeable a made feel twice over oh jonathan be so sorry therefore be possible that may have best of so never will take walk with ayala dormer said a be returning home never replied can not think how regret of course be glad to become wife at want to have postponed there be something so sweet in having lover know that though will have husband will never have lover again never have one before jonathan there have be very little of when thing have be so sweet be sad to think that must be gone for ever then leaned upon with hand looked up at smiled with lip little open a knew that liked to lean upon to look for have caught by instinct very nature of man knew how to witch with little charm ah wonder whether will like to lean upon when dozen year have gone by depends on how heavy may be will be fat old woman perhaps will lean upon always always what else will ever have to lean upon now what else must want nothing nothing nothing want nothing else wonder whether there be anybody in world who have got so completely everything that ever dreamed of wanting a have if must have be only lover for little longer then assured that must be lover just same even though be husband wife ala there have promised more than be given to man to perform faith honesty steadiness of purpose joined to warmest love truest heart will not enable husband to maintain sweetness of aroma have filled with delight sens of girl who have leaned upon arm a permitted lover what happy fellow be said mr greene a in intimacy of moment walked across park together why get wife for yes with l year with little money might want to have to look for money if did must get often think how very unfairly thing be divided in world will be made up in next not if one covets one neighbour wife even as said mr greene on return of two lover to house from walk there be mr mr dosett who must much rather have stayed away have not be unwilling not to show mark of affection to niece doubt whether be very happy be at rate received with distinction sir thomas aunt emmeline be asked made excuse sir thomas knew very well that have nothing in common with sir harry albury a for aunt
