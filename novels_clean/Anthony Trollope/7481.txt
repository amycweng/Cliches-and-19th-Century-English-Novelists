constrained to sit down to breakfast with monitor at half past eight be at rate so far regardful of mr richards a not to smoke in bedroom to come home sober enough to walk upstairs without assistance

have held living in london have resided there have however died when two of child be very young while third be still baby from time mr woodward have lived at cottage at hampton have there maintained good repute paying way from month to month a widow with limited income must do devoting to amusement education of daughter be not probably from want of opportunity to cast aside that mr woodward have remained true to weed for at time of husband death be young very pretty woman income of l year though moderate enough for want of gentleman family must no doubt have added sufficiently to charm to have procured second alliance have be so minded twelve year however have now elapsed since mr woodward have be gathered to father neighbouring world of hampton who have of declared over over again that young widow must certainly marry again be now becoming a unanimous in expressed opinion that old widow knew value of money too well to risk in keeping of best that ever wore boot at date at story commences be comely little woman past forty somewhat below middle height rather embonpoint a widow of forty must be with pretty fat foot pretty fat hand wearing just soupcon of widow cap on head with hair now slightly grey parted in front brushed very smoothly not too carefully in bandeau over forehead be quick little body full of good humour slightly given to repartee perhaps rather too impatient of fool though averse to fool must sympathize with folly great poet have said that woman be rake at heart there be something of rake at heart about mr woodward never must be got to express adequate horror at fast young men be apt to have own sly little joke at woman who prided on being punctilious must perhaps more safely indulge in a scandal have never even whispered word against with daughter lived on term almost of equality two elder be now grown up be be respectively eighteen seventeen year old be devotedly attached to mother looked on a only perfect woman in existence must willingly hing must vex perhaps be not quite so systematically obedient to a child must be to only surviving parent mr woodward however found nothing amiss one else therefore must well have right to complain be

appearance a in disposition gertrude carried by far greater air of command be handsomer of two cleverer must write french nearly speak while sister must only read must play difficult piece from sight took sister morning pain to practise must fill in finish drawing while sister be still struggling struggling in vain with first principle of art there be softness about linda for such be name of second miss woodward in eye of many men made up for superior beauty superior talent of gertrude gertrude be perhaps hardly so soft a so young girl must be in have be magnified that spirit of gentle raillery made so attractive part of mother character enjoyed emulated mother quick sharp saying hardly did so with mother grace sometimes attempted with much more than mother severity also detested fool in promulgating opinion on subject be too apt to declare who fool be whom detested may be thought that under such circumstance there must be little confidence between sister nevertheless in early day lived together a sister must do gertrude when spoke of fool never intended to include linda in number linda appreciated too truly admired too thoroughly sister beauty talent to be jealous of of youngest girl katie be not necessary at present to say much at time be thirteen year of age be happy pretty romping child gave fair promise to be at rate equal to sister in beauty in mind be quick intelligent great taste be for boating romance of life consisted in laying out ideal pleasure ground building ideal castle in little reedy island ait lay out in thames few perch from drawing room window such be family of woodward harry norman father mr woodward have be first cousin hence have be quite natural that when norman came up to reside in london must be made welcome to surbiton cottage have so be made welcome have thus got into habit of spending saturday evening sunday at home of relative in summer must row up in own wherry land carpet bag direct on woodward lawn in winter came down by hampton court five pm train in case returned on monday morning thus a regard that portion of time be most own may be said almost to have lived at surbiton cottage if on sunday omitted to make appearance omission be ascribed by lady of hampton in half serious sort of joke to metropolitan allurement temptation ought to have withstood when tudor norman came to live together be natural enough that tudor also must be taken down to surbiton cottage norman must not leave on saturday without telling much of friend whom went to visit must hardly say much of without offering to introduce companion to tudor accordingly went there soon came to pas that also very frequently spent sunday at hampton must be remembered at time time be of norman tudor first entrance on london life girl at surbiton cottage be mere girl be little more than child have not a be got wing so a to be able to fly away when provocation to do so might come be in short gertrude linda woodward not miss woodward drawer came down below frock instead of frock below drawer in lieu of studying french language a be done by grown up lady did french lesson a be case with lady who be not grown up under circumstance there be embarrassment a to what young people must call other soon became very intimate a harry alaric gertrude linda be not however to be conceived that alaric tudor at once took same footing in house a norman be far from being case in first place never slept there seeing that there be bed for most confidential intercourse in household took place a sat cosy over last ember of drawing room fire chatting about everything nothing a girl always can do after tudor have gone away to bed at inn on opposite side of way then tudor did not come on saturday at first did not do so without express invitation although girl soon habituated to familiarity of new friend christian name be time before mr woodward did so two three year soon flew by linda gertrude became miss woodward frock be prolonged drawer curtailed lesson abandoned still alaric tudor harry norman came to hampton not le frequently than of yore world resident on portion of left bank of thames found out that harry norman gertrude be to be man wife that alaric tudor linda woodward be to go through same ceremony found out said that have done so a usual world be wrong at least in part for at time of be speaking word of love making have passed at rate between last named couple what be mr woodward about time be match making match marring be negligently omitting duty of mother on so important occasion be certainly neither match making match marring be from negligence that be thus quiescent knew thought knew that two young men be fit to be husband to daughter felt that if wish for such alliance must spring up between pair there be reason why must interfere to prevent felt also that must not interfere to bring such matter to pas young people have by chance be thrown together must there be love passage among a be natural to suppose there might be must be well must there be none such must be well also thoroughly trusted own child did not distrust friend so a regard woodward matter be allowed to rest can not say that on matter quite approve of conduct though can not admire feeling engendered daughter be very young though have made such positive advance a have be above described towards discretion of womanhood be of age when must have be regarded a mere boy have belonged to other sex assertion made by clara van artevelde that woman upon sunny side of wall ' be doubtless true young lady gifted a be with such advantage may perhaps be thought to require counsel advice in first tender year in so often have to make mar fortune not that mr woodward gave advice not that advised well often did so perhaps too much a equal too little a parent be that a may trust reader will not be inclined so early in story to lean heavily on mr woodward whom at once declare to be own chief favourite in tale be that a may so occurred that gertrude before be nineteen have listened to vow of love from harry norman neither accepted repudiated that linda have before be eighteen perhaps unfortunately taught to think probable that might have to listen to vow of love from alaric tudor there have be no concealment between young men a to feeling norman have told friend score of time that be first wish of heart to marry gertrude woodward have told moreover what be ground for hope what reason for despair behe be a proud a queen have once said a be rowing from hampton to searle wharf lay on oar a falling tide carried boat softly past green bank of richmond behe be a proud a queen yet a timid a fawn let tell love will not say word to in reply a for touching in way of caress must a soon think of putting arm round goddess 'and why not put arm round goddess ' said alaric who be perhaps little bolder than friend little le romantic to harry answered nothing laying back to work swept on past garden of kew shot among wooden danger of putney bridge ' wish must bring to make up to linda ' said resting again from labour 'that must make matter so much easier ' 'bring ' said alaric 'what mean be that wish must bring linda to consent to be made up to ' think must have much difficulty ' said harry finding much easier to answer for linda than for sister perhaps admire ' think by far prettier of two said alaric 'that be nonsense ' said harry getting rather red in face feeling rather angry 'indeed do so be convinced must most men need not murder man want to make up to linda surely will be better must admire own wife than yours 'oh may admire whom like to say that be prettier than gertrude why know be nonsense ' havery well dear fellow then to oblige will fall in love with gertrude ' know wo do ' said harry 'for be not so very fond of other joking apart do wish so must make up to linda ' 'well will when aunt leaf l year there be answering so two men changed conversation a walked up together from boat wharf to office of weight measure be just at time that fortune old mr tudor of shropshire parsonage brought charley tudor to reside with two hero for first month six week charley be ruthlessly left by companion to get through sunday a best must be to be hoped that spent in divine worship may fear be surmised with more probability that paid devotion at shrine of very inferior public house deity in neighbourhood of somerset house a matter of course norman tudor spoke much of new companion to lady at surbiton cottage a by degree reported somewhat favourably of improved moral mr woodward with woman true kindness begged that might be brought down to hampton ' be afraid will find very rough ' said cousin alaric 'at rate will not find fool ' said norman who be always more charitable of two god for ' said mr woodward if will come next saturday let by mean do so pray give compliment to tell how glad will be to see thus be wild wolf to be led into sheep cote infernal navvy to be introduced among angel of surbiton cottage mr woodward thought that have taste for reclaiming reprobate be determined to try hand on charley tudor charley went debut be perfectly successful have hitherto only looked on worst side of character bad a character be have better side be good natured in extreme kind hearted affectionate though too apt to be noisy even boisterous when much encouraged be not without certain innate genuine modesty knowledge of own iniquity have rather increased than blunted a norman have said of be fool education have not be good have done nothing by subsequent reading to make up for deficiency be well endowed with mother wit owed none of deficiency to nature churlishness came be well received girl thought must surely get drunk before left table mr woodward feared austere precision of parlourmaid might be offended by unworthy familiarity accident of kind seemed to occur came to tea table perfectly sober a far a mr woodward must tell be unaware of presence of parlour maiden on sunday morning charley went to church just like christian now mr woodward certainly have expected that must have spent two hour in smoking attacking parlour maid went to church however seemed in whit astray there stood up when others stood up sat down when others sat down after infernal navvy bad a doubtless be knew something of recognized manner of civilized life thus charley tudor ingratiated at surbiton cottage when left received kind intimation from mistress that must be glad to see again day be fixed so charley must not accompany cousin harry norman on next saturday be not long before got direct invitation so also became intimate at hampton there must be danger of one falling in love with for katie be still child thing stood thus at surbiton cottage when mr woodward received proposition from relative of own surprised not little be from certain captain cuttwater who be maternal uncle to mr woodward consisted of nothing le than offer to come live with for remaining term of natural life now mr woodward girl have seen very little of grand uncle what little have seen have only taught to laugh at when name be mentioned in family conclave be always made subject of little feminine joke mr woodward though always took uncle part did so in manner made feel that be fair game for quizzing when proposal be first enunciated to girl one for katie be one of council suggested that must be declined with many thanks will take for midshipman said linda 'and stop ration mast head whenever displease ' ' be sure be cross old hunk though mamma say be not ' said katie with impudence of spoilt fourteen will interfere with one of pursuit said gertrude more thoughtfully 'and be sure to quarrel with young men mr woodward though have consulted daughter have argument of own in favour of captain cuttwater proposition have not yet made known to good humoured happy a always be have care in world income be only l year now that income tax have settled down on be barely sufficient for modest want moiety of died with remainder must be poor support for three daughter if at time of death must so chance that must leave in want of support have always regarded captain cuttwater a probable source of future aid be childless unmarried have not a far a be aware relative in world must therefore under circumstance be bad policy to offend letter in have made offer have be of very peculiar kind have begun by saying that be to be turned out of present berth by d whig government on account of age being a young man a ever have be that behoved to look out for place of residence in might live if must so please god die also then said that expected to pay l year for board lodging thought might a well go to niece a to shark who must probably starve also said poor a be always have be have contrived to scrape together few hundred pound that be well aware that if lived among stranger must be done out of shilling of that if niece must receive hoped to be able to keep together for benefit of grand niece c now mr woodward knew uncle to be honest minded man knew also that in spite of protestation a to being very poor man have saved money enough to make of consequence wherever went therefore conceived that must not with prudence send to seek home among chance stranger explained a much of to girl a thought proper ended matter by making understand that captain cuttwater be to be received on saturday after three scion of civil service be at surbiton cottage will show how far charley have then made good ground to state that coming of captain be debated in presence 'and when be great man to be here ' said norman 'at once believe ' said mr woodward 'that be perhaps before end of week certainly before end of next what be like ' said alaric 'why have tail hanging down behind like cat dog ' said katie 'hold tongue miss ' said gertrude 'as be to come must be treated with respect be great bore to will destroy pleasure of life ' 'nonsense gertrude ' said mr woodward 'it be almost wicked of to say so destroy pleasure of life to have old gentleman live in same house with ought to be more moderate dear in what say ' 'that be very well mamma ' said gertrude 'but know like ' 'but be true that captain cuttwater wear pigtail asked norman ' care what wear ' said gertrude 'he may wear three if like ' 'oh wish must ' said katie laughing 'that must be so delicious oh linda fancy captain cuttwater with three pigtail be sorry to disappoint katie ' said mr woodward uncle doe not wear even one once did cut off long since be so sorry ' said katie suppose will want to dine early go to bed early said linda 'his going to bed early must be great blessing ' said gertrude mindful of midnight conclave on saturday sunday 'but getting up early wo be blessing at said linda who have weakness on subject 'talking of bed harry will have worst of ' said katie 'for captain be to have room ' 'yes indeed ' said mr woodward sighing gently 'we will no longer have bed for harry be worst of ' harry of course assured that if be worst of there be nothing very bad in must have bed at inn a well a alaric charley amount of evil must only be crown night thus advent of captain cuttwater be discussed chapter iv captain cuttwater captain cuttwater have not seen much service afloat be have not be personally concerned in many of sea engagement in about time of nelson gave so great halo of glory to british lion have even be permitted to to take prominent part in such minor affair a have since occurred have not opportunity of

many others earliest year be spent in cruising among west indie then came home spent considerable portion of life in idleness if time can be said to have be idly spent devoted to torturing admiralty

be again sent afloat a senior lieutenant in ten gun brig cruised for time off coast of africa hunting for slaver returning after while from enterprising employment received sort of amphibious appointment at devonport what duty be here author being in point landsman be unable to describe who be inclined to ridicule captain cuttwater declared that most important of consisted in seeing that midshipman in about dockyard washed face put on clean linen not le often than three time week according to own account have many thing of higher nature to attend to indeed hardly ship sank swam in hamoaze except by special permission for space of twenty year if own view of own career may be accepted a correct have once declared to certain naval acquaintance over third glass of grog that regarded a birthright to be admiral at age of seventy two have not yet acquired birthright probability of ever attaining be becoming very small indeed be still bothering lord secretary of admiralty for further promotion when be astounded by being informed by port admiral that be to be made happy by half pay pension admiral in communicating intelligence have pretended to think that be giving captain information must not be otherwise than grateful to be not le aware that old man must be furious at being so treated what pension put on half pay shelf for life while be still anxiously expecting promotion call to higher duty have so long be due now that power be matured must hardly be longer denied to after that have done for country ungrateful thankless ignorant country be thus to

admiral have long indulged hope of being greeted in street of devonport a sir bartholomew cuttwater kcb be to be thus thrown aside in prime with other acknowledgement than bare income to be entitled be hardly too much to say that old officer who have lacked mean to distinguish retire from of military service free from bitter disappointment sour feeling of neglected worth captain cuttwater felt so keenly clergyman doctor lawyer feel whit disgraced if reach end of worldly labour without special note honour to soldier sailor such indifference to merit be wormwood be bane of profession nine men

not be granted advantage to have claim never took answer made request subject of prolonged correspondence till at last energetic assistant secretary declared that must no longer be borne captain cuttwater be dismissed with pension half pay during service have contrived to save four five thousand pound now be about to retire with assured income adequate to want public who have paying of captain cuttwater may perhaps think that be amply remunerated for what have done captain entertained very different opinion such be view be obliged to take of professional side of captain cuttwater character professional side be by far worst counting fathom of rope looking after unruly midshipman on shore be not duty capable of bringing out in high relief better trait of main character uncle bat a during few last year of life be always called at surbiton cottage be gentleman man of honour in spite of anything might be said to contrary at admiralty be man with soft heart though end of nose be

weighty confident nose inviting to more observation than of brother feature demanded in latter year have spread out in soft porous red excrescence to extent a to make really deserving of considerable attention stranger ever passed captain cuttwater in street of devonport without asking who be at rate specially noticing must of course be admitted that too strongly pronounced partiality for alcoholic drink have produced defect in captain cuttwater nasal organ yet be most staunch friend of temperance man alive dead have ever seen captain cuttwater worse for liquor at least so boasted captain there be none at rate in devonport to give lie woe betide midshipman whom must see elated with too much wine even to common sailor who must be tipsy at wrong time must show mercy most eloquent

even what be like great preparation be made for though summer have nearly commenced large fire be kept burning in bedroom bed be newly hung with new curtain two feather bed be piled on other everything be done five woman must think desirable to relieve ailings of suffering age fact however be that captain cuttwater be accustomed to small tent bedstead in room without carpet that usually slept on single mattress that never have fire in bedroom even in depth of winter travelling from devonport to london be now easy matter captain cuttwater old a be found able to get through to hampton in one day mr went to meet at hampton court in fly conveyed to new home together with carpet bag cocked hat sword very small portmanteau when inquired after remainder of luggage asked what more lumber

with feeling of anger at herself that must condescend to apologize to one a to own conduct in own house 'they be very nice young men be sure ' said uncle bat 'indeed be ' said mr woodward 'and very civil to young lady said uncle bat have known since be child uncle of course make more intimate than young men generally be with young lady again mr woodward be angry with for making excuse on subject

if indeed can be fairly said to have have favourite child captain cuttwater poured out glass of rum dropped subject soon afterwards whole party came in from lawn katie be draggled wet for have persisted in making way right across island to look out for site for palace norman be little inclined to be sulky for katie have got better of when have got out of boat must not get into again a must not very well leave in island have be obliged to remain paddling about while heard happy voice of alaric two girl from lawn alaric be in high good humour entered room intent on threatened purpose of seducing captain cuttwater affection two girl be blooming with happy glee gertrude be especially bright in spite of somewhat sombre demeanour of lover tea be brought in whereupon captain cuttwater having taken bit of toast crammed into saucer fell fast asleep in arm chair will have very little opportunity to night ' said linda almost in whisper 'opportunity for what ' asked mr woodward 'hush

pointing to captain who be thoroughly enjoying uttering sonorous snore at regular fixed interval down katie make noise ' said mr woodward gently katie slunk into chair opened wide large bright eye applied diligently to teacup then after taking breath said in very audible whisper to sister 'be not to talk at linda will be very dull think 'yes dear be to talk a much a please a often a please a loud a please be to say if mamma will let ' said captain cuttwater without apparent waking effort in moment snoring be going on again a regularly a before katie looked round again opened eye laughed mr woodward said 'you be very good natured uncle ' girl exchanged look with alaric norman who have not yet recovered good humour went on sipping tea a soon a tea thing be gone uncle bat yawned shook asked if be not nearly time to go to bed 'whenever like uncle bat ' said mr woodward who began to find that agreed with gertrude early habit on part of uncle must be family blessing perhaps will take something before go ' 'well mind if do take thimbleful of rum water ' so odious spirit bottle be again brought into drawing room call at admiralty sir a came through town ' said alaric 'call at

uncle bat ' know what mean alaric ' said harry norman who be just at present somewhat disposed to contradict friend not ill inclined to contradict captain also 'as far a can judge admiralty be very last office government will think of touching ' 'the government ' shouted captain cuttwater if be to wait for government navy may go to deuce sir ' be pressure from without must do work said alaric 'pressure from without said norman scornfully hate to hear such trash will see young gentleman will see ' said captain may be trash may be right that five fellow who never did queen day service in life must get fifteen hundred two thousand year have power of robbing old sailor like of reward due to for sixty year hard work reward very wage have actually earned look at now d look at here be captain cuttwater with sixty year service have done more perhaps for queen navy than than be too true captain cuttwater ' said alaric speaking with sort of mock earnestness completely took in captain stealing glance at same time at two girl who sat over work at drawing room table too true there be doubt whole thing must be altered soon in first place must have sailor at head of navy 'yes said captain one know something about too ' 'you will never have sailor sitting a first lord ' said norman authoritatively 'unless be when party man high in rank may happen to have be in navy a boy 'and why not ' said captain cuttwater quite angrily 'because first lord must sit in cabinet to do that must be thorough politician 'd politician craving lady pardon ' said uncle bat 'amen said alaric uncle bat thinking that have thoroughly carried point finished grog took up candlestick toddled off to bed 'well think have done something towards carrying point ' said alaric ' did think be half so cunning ' said linda laughing ' can not think how can condescend to advocate opinion diametrically opposed to own conviction said norman somewhat haughtily fo fum ' said alaric 'what be about said mr woodward 'alaric want to do can to ingratiate with uncle bat ' said gertrude 'and be sure be going right way to work ' be very good natured on part ' said mr woodward ' know what be talking about ' said katie yawning 'and think be very stupid so will go to bed ' rest soon followed did not sit up so late chatting over fire evening a be wont on saturday though none of knew what cause prevented chapter v bushey park next day being sunday whole party very properly went to church during sermon captain cuttwater very improperly went to sleep snored ponderously whole time katie be so thoroughly shocked that did not know way to look norman who have recovered good humour alaric must not refrain from smiling a caught eye of two girl mr woodward made sundry little abortive effort to wake uncle with foot altogether abortive be not for captain must open eye gaze at for moment in most good natured lack lustre manner conceivable then in moment must be again asleep snoring with regularity of kitchen clock be at first very dreadful to woodward after month two got used to so apparently did pastor people of hampton after church there be lunch of course then according to wont went out to walk sunday walk in general be matter of difficulty beautiful neighbourhood of hampton court with palace garden lovely park be so popular with londoner that be generally alive on day with thronged multitude of men woman child thus becomes not eligible resort for lover of privacy captain cuttwater however on occasion insisted on seeing chestnut crowd consequently went into bushey park uncle bat who professed to be philanthropist who be also bit of democrat declared delighted with what saw be great thing for london citizen to come down there with wife child eat dinner in open air under spreading tree harry alaric agreed with mr woodward however averred that must be much better if must go to church first gertrude linda be of opinion that park be spoilt by dirty bit of greasy paper be left about on side katie thought very hard that a londoner be allowed to eat dinner in park might not have hers there also to captain cuttwater rejoined that must give picnic at richmond before summer be over world know how such party a of friend by degree separate into two three when sauntering about in shady walk be seldom indeed that norman must induce dulcinea to be so complaisant in favour accident kindness on part favoured on occasion a katie went on eliciting from uncle bat fresh promise a to picnic harry gertrude found together under one avenue of tree while alaric linda be equally fortunate unfortunate under did so wish to speak few word to gertrude ' said norman 'but seems a though now that captain have come among old habit way be to be upset see that need say that ' said 'we may perhaps be put out little be mamma linda see that need suffer ' beuffer not suffer yet be suffering ' 'what be suffering ' said 'why to be a be last night not able to speak to other harry must be little reasonable said laughing 'if did not talk last night whose fault be ' ' suppose will say be own perhaps be must not feel comfortable while be drinking gin water ' be rum ' said gertrude rather gravely 'well rum water in mother drawing room cursing swearing before linda a though be in cockpit of man of war saw be able to make happy be sure be not more indifferent to than be ' 'alaric seemed to to be bent on making fool of old man to tell truth can not approve of doing so ' 'it seems to harry that approve of what of be doing ' said ' fear be in black book captain cuttwater mamma alaric of ' 'well now gertrude do mean to say think right that katie must sit by hear man talk a captain cuttwater talked last night do mean to say that scene passed with rum curse absurd ridicule be thrown on mother uncle be such a must take place in mother drawing room ' ' mean to say harry that mother be best only judge of what must what must not take place there ' norman felt somewhat silenced by walked on for time without speaking be little too apt to take upon character of mentor strange to say be aware of own fault in particular thus though temptation to preach be very powerful refrained for while present desire be to say soft thing rather than sharp word though lecturing be at moment much easier to than love making bethought of object controlled spirit of morality be strong within 'but be so happy before uncle came said speaking with sweetest voice looking at beautiful girl beside with love be able to throw into handsome face 'and be happy now that have come at rate ought to be ' said gertrude doing little in mentor line now that occasion came in way gertrude know very well there be only one thing can make happy ' said 'why unreasonable man just now said be perfectly happy before captain cuttwater came suppose one thing now necessary be to send away again ' 'no gertrude thing necessary be to take away ' out of contamination of poor old uncle bat bottle of rum harry see must be cowardly in to leave mamma linda to suffer calamity alone ' wonder gertrude whether in heart of heart really care straw about ' said harry who be now very sentimental somewhat lachrymose 'you know care very much about be very wrong in to express doubt ' said gertrude with duplicity be almost wicked a if did not fully understand that kind of 'caring ' of norman spoke be of very different nature from general 'caring on behalf shared with rest of family 'all of yes be not speaking of of be speaking of gertrude in particular can ever love well enough to be wife ' there be knowing what may be able to do in three four year time even must depend very much on how behave in mean time if get cross because captain cuttwater have come here snub alaric linda a did last night scold at mamma because chooses to let own uncle live in own house why to tell truth think ever will ' person who have propensity to lecture others have strong constitutional dislike to being lectured such be decidedly case with harry norman in spite of strong love anxious desire to make agreeable brow became somewhat darkened lip somewhat compressed must not probably have be annoyed have not be found fault with for snubbing friend tudor why must gertrude gertrude put forward to defend friend let say what chose for mother even for profane dram drinking vulgar old uncle be too much that must take up cudgel for alaric tudor 'well said ' be annoyed last night must own grieved to hear alaric turning uncle into ridicule that before mother face grieved to see linda encourage in what alaric said about admiralty did not speak truthfully mean to say that alaric said what be false ' 'inasmuch a be pretending to express own opinion did say what be false must will say that never yet knew alaric say word be not true be more be quite sure that must not accuse of falsehood behind back in fit of jealousy ' said norman looking now a black a grim death 'yes be jealousy so turned out that alaric got on better last night with captain cuttwater than did that make jealous ' 'pish said norman somewhat relieved still sufficiently disgusted that lady love must suppose that must be otherwise than supremely indifferent to opinion of captain cuttwater love scene however be fatally interrupted pair be not long before joined captain mr woodward katie how fared with other pair under other avenue of chestnut alaric tudor have certainly come out with defined intention of making love a harry norman have done with such companion be very difficult for to avoid linda be much more open to attack of nature than sister not that be a general rule willingly wilfully inclined to give more encouragement to lover than gertrude have le power of fence le skill in protecting much le of naughty self esteem make woman fancy that love making to be liberty want of make others feel that love making be to compliment alaric tudor have defined intention of making love have sort of suspicion that might if pleased do so successfully have defined intention of letting alone be far seeing prudent man for age perhaps too prudent be nevertheless fully susceptible of pleasure of holding affectionate close intercourse with so sweet girl a linda woodward though knew that marriage with girl without dowry must for be death blow to high hope must hardly resist temptation of conjugating verb to love have be able to choose from two sister must probably have selected gertrude in spite of what have said to norman in boat gertrude be bespoken therefore seemed unnatural that there must not be love passage between linda ah mr woodward friend friend be well that thou shouldst leave that sweet unguarded rosebud of thine to such peril a also commenced wooing by talking over captain cuttwater did not quarrel over linda be quite content to be told by friend what ought to do how ought to think about uncle alaric have better way of laying down law than norman must do so without offending hearer pride consequently be generally better listened to than friend though law be probably not in effect so sound have soon done with captain cuttwater alaric have to choose subject gertrude norman be at distance from be in sight somewhat in advance 'look at harry ' said alaric ' know from motion of shoulder that be at moment saying something very tender ' 'it be ten time more likely that be quarrelling ' said linda 'oh quarrel of lover know about ' 'you must not call lover alaric mamma must not like indeed must gertrude be sure must not for world do anything mr woodward must not like between linda be not lover 'no be not that know of believe that be bit ' said linda blushing at own fib why must not be how indeed be possible that must not be be for heartily beg gertrude pardon how be possible that harry must not be in love with 'indeed gertrude be very very beautiful ' said linda with faintest possible sigh occasioned by remembrance of own inferior charm be very very beautiful ' repeated alaric speaking with absent air a though mind be fully engaged in thinking of beauty of spoke be not in linda nature to be angry because sister be admired because be not yet there be something in alaric warm tone of admiration gave feeling of unhappiness must have be quite unable to define even have attempted saw sister harry norman before knew in heart that be lover in spite of little weak declaration to contrary saw how earnestly sister be loved in kindly loving nature must not envy fancied happiness envy certainly be not envy must not for world have robbed sister of admirer be so natural for to feel that must be delicious to be admired did not begrudge gertrude norman superior beauty greater wealth knew that gertrude be entitled to more much more than seeing that norman be gertrude lover be not natural that alaric must be hers then though harry be handsomer richer liked alaric so much better of two now that alaric be alone with only subject must think to talk of be gertrude beauty must not be supposed that thought in plainly developed form passed through linda mind be not that thought that felt such feeling be quite involuntary whereas one thought be more le under command linda must not have allowed to think in way for world must not control feeling walked on side by side perfectly silent for minute two ill natured tear be gathering in corner of linda eye be afraid even to raise hand to brush away for fear alaric must see thus went on gathering till be like to fall 'how singular be ' said alaric 'how very singular way in find living with perfect stranger a be ' ' perfect stranger said linda who having remembered alaric since day of short frock lesson looked on a very old friend indeed 'yes perfect stranger if think of do of know about mother never saw mother father knew nothing of father there be kindred blood common to harry norman there be near cousin what be must be thus allowed to live with walk with have common interest in doings 'why be dear friend of mamma be not ' ' dear friend of mamma said 'well indeed hope be for mother be at rate dear friend to linda one can not be so much without longing to be more look at harry how happy be ' 'but alaric surely must not interfere with harry ' said linda whose humble innocent heart thought still of nothing merit of sister then remembering that be necessary that must admit nothing on gertrude behalf entered little protest against assumption that sister acknowledged norman for lover 'that be must not do so if there be anything in ' ' interfere with harry ' said alaric switching head off bit of fern with cane carried indeed have wish at to do that be not that of be thinking harry be welcome to happiness be if gertrude can be brought to make happy ' linda made answer now tear came running down face eye became dim heart beat very quick did quite remember where be up to moment man have spoken word of love to linda woodward to girl first word be very trying with harry ' alaric repeated again renewed attack on fern linda what opinion must have of ' linda be past answering must not protest must have be expedient to do so that opinion of companion be not unfavourable 'gertrude be beautiful very beautiful ' continued still beating about bush a modest lover do must do 'but be not only beautiful girl in surbiton cottage to eye be most so linda be now quite beside knew that decorum required that must say something stiff stately to repress such language if future character for propriety have depended on must not bring to say word knew that gertrude when so addressed must have maintained dignity have concealed secret even if allowed to have secret to conceal knew that behoved to be repellent antagonistic to first vow of first lover ala have power of antagonism energy for repulse left in knee seemed to be weak beneath must do be to pluck to piece few flower that carried at waist alaric saw advantage be too generous to push closely indeed did choose to commit to assured intention of positive declaration wished to raise interest in linda heart having done so to leave matter to chance something however be necessary that must say walked while by in silence decapitating fern then coming close to said 'linda dear linda be not angry with ' linda however answered nothing 'linda dearest linda speak one word to ' `` said linda through tear alaric pray 'well linda will not say word to now let walk gently will catch up quite in time before leave park so sauntered on exchanging further word linda by degree recovered calmness a did so found to be oh so happy have never never envied gertrude lover be so sweet so very sweet to be able to share sister happiness alaric be also happy at moment doubtless enjoyed triumph of success still have feeling of sad care at heart how be to marry girl without shilling be high hope be soaring ambition to be thrown over for dream of love ah mr woodward friend friend thou who wouldst have fed thy young one like pelican with blood from thine own breast have such feeding be of avail thou who art kindest of mother have be well for thee to subject to such peril poor weak young dove of thine uncle bat have become tired with walk crawled home so slowly that alaric linda caught party just a reached small wicket lead out of park on side nearest to hampton nothing be said thought of absence entered house together four of however be conscious that sunday walk beneath chestnut of bushey park must long be remembered nothing else occurred to make day memorable in evening after dinner mr woodward daughter went to church leaving younger guest to entertain elder one elder one soon took matter in own hand by going to sleep harry alaric being thus at liberty sauntered out down river side made forced attempt at good humour speaking cheerily to other there be confidence between a there have be on morning when harry rowed friend up to london ah have occurred between to break bond of mutual trust to quench ardour of firm friendship so be between now be fated that never again must place full confidence in other there be such breach between sister at least not a yet even between there be free full interchange of hope fear gertrude linda shared same room be accustomed a what girl be not to talk half through night of wish thought feeling gertrude be generally prone enough to talk of harry norman sometimes must say loved little just little at others must declare that loved not at be not a heroine love in novel not a thought must love must do must ever be lot to be wooed by lover a young fancy pictured to then must describe beau ideal description certainly gave counterpart of harry norman to tell truth however gertrude be a yet heart whole when talked of love harry norman did not know what love be on special sunday evening be disinclined to speak of at not that loved more than usual that be beginning to think that must not ever really love at have taught to think that might probably be husband have hitherto felt such repugnance to destiny a caused to shun subject now be beginning to think of matter seriously a did so felt that life might have for lot more blessed than of sharing world with cousin harry when therefore linda began to question about lover to make little hint of desire to tell what alaric have said of norman gertrude gave encouragement must speak of captain cuttwater of katie lesson of new dress be to make for mother of mr everscreech long sermon of anything in fact of harry norman now be very hard on poor linda heart be bursting within to tell sister that also be beloved must not do so without little encouragement in conference took cue of conversation from sister though must have talked about alaric by hour if gertrude must have consented to talk about harry did not know how to start subject of own lover while gertrude be so cold uncommunicative a to hers struggled very hard to obtain privilege for so anxiously longed in doing so only met with sad sore rebuff at last said linda when gertrude thought that subject have be put to rest at rate for night ' think mamma must be pleased if knew that have engaged to harry norman ' said gertrude evincing strong mind by tone in spoke ' if mamma wished must have told for never have secret must be a wrong to engage with harry a must be with alaric for though harry have property of own while poor alaric have none have very insufficient income for married man have fortune with to help if nothing else prevented must consider wicked in to make burden to man while be yet so young comparatively so poor prudent sensible high minded well disciplined gertrude have heart really felt spark of love for man of whom spoke how much must prudent sensible high minded consideration have weighed with ala not feather having made prudent high minded speech turned round slept poor linda also turned round bedewed pillow no longer panted to tell sister of alaric love on next morning two young men returned to town customary

divided in wish on subject a two candidate must be on following morning however norman introduced subject suppose be only jesting yesterday ' said 'when told captain that be not going to be candidate ' 'indeed can hardly say be in jest in earnest said alaric ' simply meant to decline to discus subject with uncle bat 'but of course do mean to stand ' said harry alaric made answer 'perhaps must rather decline to discus matter with also ' said harry 'not at must much prefer discussing openly honestly own impression be that have better leave alone ' 'and why so ' said harry 'why so repeated alaric 'well there be so many reason in first place there must be seven to one against must confess that if did stand must not like to be beaten ' 'the same argument might keep back said norman 'that be true one man will be more sensitive more cowardly if will than then think one must stand who doe not believe to have fair chance doing so might probably mar future prospect how can put in competition with such men a uppinall minus harry laughed slightly for knew have be asked by many how such men a uppinall minusex must think of putting in competition with alaric tudor 'that be something like mock modesty be not alaric ' 'no by heaven be not know well what men be made of know think know own ability will own rank a human creature much higher than rank have have not that have be that examiner will chiefly require ' have other reason said norman ' must strongly advise to send in name ' harry have reason though last be by mean least will be candidate probably successful one to tell truth have inclination to stand against norman turned very red then answered somewhat gravely ' must advise to lay aside objection fairly tell that consider chance better than own 'and suppose be so be sure be not suppose be so what then 'why will do right to take advantage of ' 'yes so gain step lose friend ' said alaric 'no there can be heartburn to in being selected for though be older than be senior in office be to be put over head must in course of nature make division between if be possible that must forgive must be quite impossible that gertrude must do so value friendship that of woodward too highly to risk ' norman instantly fired up with true generous energy must be wretched ' said 'if thought that consideration weighed with must rather withdraw than allow such feeling to interfere with prospect indeed after what have said will not send in own name unless also send in yours will only be creating fuel for feud ' said alaric 'to put out of question promotion must compensate to for what must lose at hampton man must lose nothing faith know whether be not must lose if be successful at expense 'how must gertrude receive ' said alaric pushing matter further than perhaps must have done 'we wo mind gertrude ' said norman with little shade of black upon brow be older man than therefore promotion be to of more importance than to be also poorer man have mean besides drawn from office if marry can settle on wife have none such must consider to be worse than wicked if allowed consideration of such nature to stand in way of best interest believe alaric that though will a others be anxious for success must in failing be much consoled by knowing that have succeeded a finished speaking grasped friend hand warmly in token of truth of assertion alaric brushed tear from eye ended by promising to be guided by friend advice harry norman a walked into office felt glow of triumph a reflected that have done duty by friend with true disinterested honesty alaric also felt glow of triumph a reflected that come what might there must be now necessity for to break with norman with woodward norman must now always remember that be at own instigation that alaric have consented to be candidate a regarded real fact of candidature prize be too great to allow of throwing away such chance alaric present income be l that hoped to gain be l chapter vii mr fidus neverbend immediately on entering office tudor gave to be understood that intended to give in name a candidate have hardly done so when attention be called off from coming examination by circumstance be ultimately of great importance to one of assistant secretary sent for told that service having be required by sir gregory hardlines for week so be at once to go over to gentleman office alaric must perceive that a sir gregory name be mentioned assistant secretary smiled on with aspect of benign solicitude went over accordingly found that sir gregory having be desired to select man for special service in country have named be to go down to tavistock with gentleman from wood forest for purpose of settling disputed point a to boundary privilege of certain mine situated there on crown property 'you know nothing about mining presume ' said sir gregory 'nothing ' said alaric ' thought not be one reason why selected what be wanted be man of sharp intelligence plain common sense one also who can write english for will fall to lot to draw up report on matter mr neverbend who be to be colleague can not put two word together ber neverbend ' said alaric 'yes fidus neverbend of wood forest very excellent public servant one in whom fullest confidence can be placed between will never set thames on fire ' 'does understand mining ' asked alaric understands government property will take care that crown be not wronged tudor government will look to to get true common sense view of case trust mean really do trust that will not disgrace choice ' alaric of course promised that must do best expressed deepest gratitude to patron went off to put into communication with mr neverbend at wood forest having received assurance that examination in own office must not take place till after return from tavistock be not slow to perceive that if must manage to come back with eclat of successful mission prestige of such journey must go far to assist on coming trial mr fidus neverbend be absolute dragon of honesty integrity be of such pervading nature that bristled with a porcupine doe with quill have theory axiom a to man conduct conduct especially of man in queen civil service up to man must live consequently one appeared to to be true just in dealing quarter of hour spent over newspaper be in eye downright robbery if saw man so employed must divide out total of salary into hourly portion tell to fraction of how much be defrauding public if ate biscuit in middle of day did so with eye firmly fixed on document have never be known to be absent from office after ten before four when sir gregory hardlines declared that mr fidus neverbend must never set thames on fire meant to express opinion that gentleman be fool that person who be responsible for sending mr neverbend on mission now about to be undertaken be little better than fool for so sending mr neverbend be fool be not disciple of sir gregory school have never sat in philosopher porch listened to high doctrine prevalent at weight measure must not write with mr precis conventional correctness dispose of subject at moment notice a must mr uppinall nevertheless be fool sir gregory like many other wise men thought that there be swan of own hatching must ask with pompous conceit of pharisee in age whether good must come out of wood forest sir gregory however perfectly succeeded in object of imbuing tudor with very indifferent opinion of new colleague ability be object that tudor must altogether take upper hand in piece of work be to be done between that must be clearly proved how very incapable wood forest be of doing own business mr fidus neverbend however others in outer world might think of have high character in own office did not under estimate when be told that young clerk named tudor be to accompany conceived that might look on companion rather in light of temporary private secretary than equal partner imagined that new glory be added to by being so treated two men therefore met other with very different view though mr neverbend be fool be not equal either in tact ability to alaric tudor alaric have interview with be not slow to perceive sort of man with whom have to act of course on occasion little more than grimace civility passed between mr neverbend even in grimace civility managed to show that regarded a decidedly upon occasion mr tudor ' said ' think of starting on tuesday tuesday will not suppose be inconvenient to ' beir gregory have already told that be expected to be at tavistock on tuesday evening ' 'ah know about ' said neverbend 'that may be very well for sir gregory rather think will stay night at plymouth ' 'it will be same to ' said tudor ' have looked at paper yet so can hardly say what may be necessary 'no of course not a to paper know that there be much with need trouble believe be pretty well up in case mr tudor there will be good deal of writing to do when be there ' 'we be used to fancy ' said tudor beo wo kill ' 'no of course not understand that there will be good many people for to see great many conflicting interest for to reconcile probably may find obliged to go down two three of mine 'well will be good fun ' said alaric neverbend drew up idea of having fun at cost of government be painful to however spared stranger reproach merely remarked that work surmised must be heavy enough for man who went below ground for one who remained above only point settled between be that of starting by early train on tuesday named then alaric returned to sir gregory office there to read through digest immense bulk of paper bearing on question at issue there have appeared be lately opened between tamar tavy new mine have become exceedingly prosperous outrageously prosperous a shareholder director of neighbouring mine taught to

before went be of course passed at hampton there received full glory of special appointment received glory norman in equal degree fell into background mr woodward stuck kindly to harry endeavoured in gentle way to quiz projected trip to devonshire other party be too strong raillery failed to have intended effect gertrude especially expressed opinion that be great thing for so young man to have be selected for such employment by person linda though said le must not prevent tell tale face from saying more katie predicted that alaric must certainly marry mary jane wheal bring to surbiton cottage captain cuttwater offered to hero introduction to old naval officer at devonport 'by jingo must like to go with ' said captain fear pleasure must not repay trouble said alaric laughing word think will do ' said captain must be of greatest possible service to a officer of crown must give so much weight there must make known know ' ' must not hear of such thing ' said alaric trembling at idea uncle bat have conjured up 'there be admiral starbod captain focassel old hardaport sir jib boom why d n must do anything for craving lady pardon ' alaric in own defence be obliged to declare that rule of service especially required that must hold friendly communication with one during time that be employed on special service poor captain cuttwater grieved to have good nature checked be obliged to put up with excuse consoled with abusing government must condescend to give so absurd order be on saturday on sunday going to church captain suggested that alaric might at rate just call upon sir jib on

discreet very collected to take leaf out of sister book give encouragement must not absolutely swear to that did not now never must return passion must point out how very imprudent engagement between two young person situated a be must be how foolish must be for to bind for number of year to marriage must be postponed must tell alaric make understand that be not to regard a affianced to with woman faith must nevertheless remain true to be linda great resolve strong hope that in very few week alaric must be promoted to marrying income of l per annum made prospect of task not so painful a might otherwise have be fate however robbed of pleasure if must have be pleasure of sacrificing love to duty 'dear linda dearest linda ' be not again whispered into ear what on earth be that be to do down in mine asked mr woodward a sat together in evening 'nothing on earth mr woodward be to be below surface forty fathom deep ' said alaric 'take care that ever come up again ' said 'they say mine be exceedingly rich perhaps may be tempted to stay down there ' will be like gloomy gnome life in dark cold mine said katie 'be very dangerous going down into place asked linda been go down come up again day of life what other men can do can suppose doe follow at said captain cuttwater sort of figure must make on yard arm reefing sail in gale of wind ' 'pray do take care of ' said gertrude norman brow grew black ' thought that be settled that mr neverbend be to go down that be to stay above ground ' said beo mr neverbend settled that arrangement may perhaps be unsettled again said alaric with certain feeling of confidence in own strong will at doubt ' said mr woodward 'that if be to get sly peep at must find sitting comfortably at inn time that neither of will go foot below ground havery likely mean to say be that if neverbend go down will go too mind gloomy gnome mind bring up bit of gold for ' said katie on monday morning started with often expressed good wish of party with note for sir jib boom captain made promise that must deliver alaric fully determined to lose long before got to plymouth that evening norman passed together a soon a office hour be over went into london exhibition be then open there walking up down long centre aisle talked with something like mutual confidence of future prospect be favourite resort with norman who have schooled to feel interest in work of art alaric mind be of different cast panted rather for great than beautiful be inclined to ridicule growing taste of day for torso palissy ware assyrian monster there be then mutual confidence between two young men norman who be apt to examine own motif more strictly than alaric ever did have felt that something like suspicion a to friend have crept over have felt also that there be ground for such suspicion have determined to throw off to be again cordial with companion have resolved so to do before last visit at hampton be at hampton that suspicion have be engendered there found unable to be genial kindly contented surbiton cottage be becoming to anything abode of happiness that have once be year ago have be hero of hampton sunday must not now feel that alaric have a be supplanted with own friend arrival even of so insignificant person a captain cuttwater captain cuttwater be very insignificant in norman mind have done much to produce state of thing have be turned out of bedroom at cottage have therefore lost last loving lingering word sometimes protracted to so late hour have be customary after alaric departure to inn last lingering word have be so sweet because sweetness have not be shared with friend must not be genial happy at surbiton cottage be by mean satisfied with that must not have be so when found that have be surly with alaric be much more angry with than alaric be with alaric indeed be indifferent about have wish to triumph over harry have object to pursue be not man to allow to be diverted from by one caprice 'this trip be great thing for ' said harry 'well really know of course must not decline on whole must be just a well pleased to have be spared if get through well why will be well even can not help at examination know that ' 'why week passed in slush of cornish mine wo teach man algebra ' 'it will give prestige ' mean to say examiner wo examine fairly well perhaps so what will be effect on if fail know nothing of mine have colleague with of whom can only learn that be not weak enough to be led wise enough to lead who be so self opinionated that think be to do whole work yet so jealous that fear will take very bread out of mouth what be to do with man must manage ' said harry 'that be much easier said than done replied alaric wish have task instead of ' beo sir gregory when chose knew what be about ' word harry be full of compliment to day really ought to take hat off 'no be not be in mood for compliment know very well what stuff be made of know superiority to myself know will be selected to go up over head feel alaric must not be surprised that to certain degree be painful to to feel by god help will get over if succeed will go hard with will teach to rejoice at look at fawn there ' said turning away face to hide tear in eye ever see more perfect motion alaric be touched there be more triumph than sympathy in heart be sweet much too sweet to to hear superiority thus acknowledged be superior to men who worked round in office be made of more plastic clay than despite inferiority of education knew to be fit for higher work than must do a acknowledgement be made to by man whom of around certainly ranked second to must not feel that heart blood ran warm within must not tread with elastic step behoved to answer harry to answer in other spirit than 'oh harry ' said 'you have plot to ruin by own conceit to make blow out destroy poor frog be in trying to loom a largely a great cow fidus neverbend know be fully conscious how much inferior education have be to yours 'education be nothing ' said education be nothing alaric triumphantly re echoed word in heart 'education be nothing mind mind be everything mind will ' so expressed to own inner self out loud spoke much more courteously 'it be innate modesty of own heart harry make think so highly of so meanly of proof of what can do be yet to be seen year alone can decide that career will be honourable happy of feel fully sure wish be a confident of mine ' alaric ' said norman going on rather with thread of own thought than answering intending to answer what other said 'in following up high ambition know have high ambition allow to believe that end justifies mean because see that men around act a though believed so ' 'do do so do seem to do so said alaric turning sharply round ' be angry with alaric think want to preach sometimes fancy not that do so that mind be turning way that in eager desire for honourable success wo scrutinize step will have to take ' must get to top of hill in short even though hillside be miry well own wish to get to top of hill 'but not to defile in doing so ' man come home from successful chase with bag well stuffed with game woman quarrel with because there be mud on gaiter 'alaric that be evil be evil lie be evil 'and be liar forbid must say so heaven forbid must have to think so be by such doctrine a that men become liar 'what by having muddy gaiter 'by disregarding mean in looking to end 'and will tell how men become mere vegetable by filling mind with useless needle scruple by straining at gnat finish quotation ' said harry ' have finished in speaking to must not for world go on seem to insinuate that must swallow camel insinuation must be more base unjust nevertheless think may be too over scrupulous what great man ever rose to greatness ' continued alaric after have walked nearly length of building in silence 'who thought necessary to pick step in manner have described ' 'then must not be great said harry 'but surely god intends that there will be great men on earth certainly wish that there must be good men said harry 'and can not man be good great ' be problem for man to solve do try good certainly can be if look to for assistance let that come first then greatness if be possible 'it be quibble about word ' said alaric 'what be good david be man after god own heart great man too yet did thing be to do must be too base to live look at jacob how did achieve tremendous right of patriarchal primogeniture come policeman be trying to get rid of be time for to go so left building passed remainder of evening in concord together in concord so soon to be dissolved ah perhaps never to be renewed on next morning alaric new companion met other at early hour at paddington station neverbend be rather fussy with dispatch box large official packet office messenger dashing up in cab brought to at moment of departure neverbend enemy be wont to declare that messenger cab big packet always rushed up at moment of starting on of official trip then have ticket to get time to buy really have not leisure to do more than nod at alaric till have folded rug around tried that cushion be soft enough completed arrangement for journey mr tudor ' at last said a soon a train be in motion how be morning ready for work hope ' 'well not exactly at moment ' said alaric 'one have to get up so early for morning train 'early mr tudor idea be that hour must be considered early late when crown requires service 'just at present crown requires nothing else of suppose that must go along at rate of forty mile hour 'there be nothing like saving time ' said neverbend ' know have a yet have experience in sort of case so have brought paper refer to somewhat similar matter occurred in forest of dean be sent down there be report then wrote propose to take for model of will have to draw up when return from tavistock a spoke produced voluminous document treatise in have contrived to render more obscure matter that have be sent to clear up on crown property in forest of dean now alaric have be told of very report be aware that be going to tavistock in order that joint result of mr neverbend labour might be communicated to crown officer in intelligible language monster report before contained twenty six page of close folio writing felt that really must not oblige mr neverbend by reading 'forest of dean ah be coal be not ' said alaric beary jane seems to be exclusively in tin line fear there will be analogy ' 'the case be in many respect similar ' said neverbend 'and method of treating ' 'then really can not concur with a to propriety of reading must feel absolutely wrong to read word of such report for fear might be prejudiced by view of case must in mind be positively dishonest in to encourage bias in own feeling on one side other 'but really mr tudor ' need not say how much personal advantage must be to to have benefit of experience conscience tell must not do so think will go to sleep ' mr neverbend did not know what to make of companion whether to admire high tone of official honesty to reprobate idleness in refusing to make master of report while be settling question in own mind tudor went to sleep did not wake till be invited to partake of ten minute refreshment at swindon ' rather think ' said mr neverbend 'that will go on to tavistock to night ' 'oh of course ' said alaric ' never for moment thought of stopping short of ' taking out book showed disinclined for further conversation course be open to to do a please in such matter ' said neverbend continuing subject a soon a reached bristol station on whole rather think have better go on to tavistock to night ' 'no will not stop at plymouth ' said a passed by taunton on reaching exeter declared that have fully made up mind on subject will get chaise at plymouth ' said alaric ' think there will be public conveyance ' said neverbend 'but chaise will be quickest said one 'and much dearest said other wo signify much to ' said alaric 'we sha pay bill 'it will signify great deal to ' said neverbend with look of ferocious honesty so reached plymouth on getting out of railway carriage alaric at once hired carriage with pair of horse luggage be strapped on mr neverbend before time for expostulation have fairly come found posting down road to tavistock followed at respectful distance by two coach omnibus be soon drinking tea together at bedford hotel beg to assure travelling reader that might have drunk tea in much worse place mr neverbend though made great struggle to protect dignity maintain superiority of higher rank felt ground sinking from beneath foot from hour to hour must not at understand how be even servant at hotel seemed to pay more deference to tudor than to before evening be over absolutely found drinking port wine negus because colleague have ordered for 'and now said neverbend who be tired with long journey think will go to bed ' 'do said alaric who be not at all tired 'and will go through infernal mass of

satisfaction one friend have in welfare be not written in same warm affectionate tone a to norman alaric perceived instantly that be not cordial loved mr woodward dearly greatly desired love sympathy what then must not have everything determined therefore not to trouble mind if mr woodward did not sympathize with others of family must do so success must ultimately bring round what woman ever yet refused to sympathize with successful ambition alaric also received letter from captain cuttwater in gallant veteran expressed great joy at result of examination 'let best man win world over said 'whatever name be will have to make same rule at admiralty too day of howard be gone by be unless can prove able seaman very few of ever did yet let best man win be what say let man get fair share of

rush there at once that might throw into arm into arm at daughter foot time have now come to when wanted to be comforted by knowledge that love be returned resolved that during next visit must formally propose to gertrude determination to do strong hope that might do successfully kept up during interval on following week be to go to father place to shoot having obtained leave of absence for month felt that must still enjoy if must take with conviction that be right at surbiton cottage mr woodward in letter though have spoken much of girl have said nothing special about gertrude nevertheless norman gathered from that intended that must go thither to look for comfort that must find there comfort that required mr woodward have intended that such must be effect of letter be at present dearest wish of heart to see norman gertrude married that norman have often declared love to eldest daughter knew very well knew also that gertrude have never rejected having perfect confidence in child have purposely abstained from saying anything must bias opinion have determined to leave matter in hand of young people judging that might be best arranged a true love match between without interference from have therefore said nothing to gertrude on subject mr woodward however discovered that be in error when be too late for to retrieve mistake indeed have discovered before letter be written what must have done must not have forbidden harry to come to house must not have warned not to throw at daughter foot cup be prepared for lip be necessary that must drink of there be nothing for must blame nothing for must blame nothing for did blame daughter be sorrowful pitiful to be lamented wept for aye groaned for many inward groan cost be at rate well that must attribute sorrow to spite of circumstance rather than to ill conduct of loved must have be fair to blame gertrude in matter while be yet child friend of mother have be thrown with when be little more than child found that friend have become lover liked in one sense loved be accustomed to regard a one whom must be almost wrong in not to like love what wonder then that when first spoke to warm word of adoration have not be able at once to know own heart tell that hope must be in vain perceived by instinct rather than by spoken word that mother be favourable to young lover that if accepted must please mother that course of true love might in case run what wonder then that must have hesitated before found necessary to say that must not must not be harry norman wife on saturday morning morning of night be a hoped to see go to bed happy lover so happy in love a to be able to forget other sorrow be sitting alone with mother be natural that conversation must turn to alaric harry alaric with happy prospect be soon dismissed mr woodward continued to sing praise of who have be potent with magi of civil service must now be lion of weight measure must say think be weak of to retire ' said gertrude 'alaric say in letter to uncle bat have persevered must in probability have be successful must rather say that be generous ' said mother know mamma that of course depends on motif must generosity of sort between two young men in position be absurd mean that such regard for friend must be quixotic 'yes mamma ' 'perhaps must true generosity noble feeling be now called quixotic surely gertrude must not quarrel with harry on account ' think got frightened mamma have not nerve to go through with ' mr woodward looked vexed made immediate reply for time mother daughter went on working without further conversation at last gertrude said think man be bound to do best can for be honestly there be something spoony in one man allowing to get before a long a can manage to be first mr woodward did not like tone in daughter spoke felt that boded ill for harry welfare tried tried in vain to elicit from daughter expression of kinder feeling dear must say think be hard on probably just at present have spirit of contradiction in if be to begin to abuse perhaps must get to praise ' 'oh mamma did not abuse ' beomething like dear when said be spoony ' 'oh mamma must not abuse for world know how good be know how love ' gertrude though very little given to sobbing mood burst into tear here gertrude come here child ' said mr woodward now moved more for daughter than for favourite 'what be what make cry did not really mean that abused poor harry gertrude got up from chair knelt at mother foot hid face in mother lap 'oh mamma ' said with half smothered voice ' know what mean know what

husband still worst be to come a mr woodward well knew a gertrude knew also to come too on very day mr woodward with woman keen perception felt assured that harry norman when found at cottage freed from presence of successful candidate surrounded by affectionate face of circle must melt at once look to love for consolation understood feeling of heart a well a though have read in book yet must hing to save from fresh sorrow cup be prepared for be necessary that must drink must not tell must not tell even that daughter have rejected when a yet have made offer so harry norman hurried down to

be stricken with fearful stroke for while be powerless captain cuttwater having shaken off dining room nap came for tea then at last gertrude also descending from own chamber glided quietly into room when did so norman with struggle roused took chair next to mr woodward opposite to eldest daughter who must describe intense discomfiture of tea party paint in fitting colour different misery of one

called son dearest friend sobbed till heart be nigh to break 'what ' thought 'what must daughter wish for when repulsed from foot such suitor a harry norman ' then went quietly down stair quietly out of house having packed up bag at inn started off through pouring rain walked away through dark stormy night through dirt mud wet to london lodging be again seen at surbiton cottage for month after adventure chapter xiii communication of importance norman dark wet walk did physically harm morally good started on in frame of mind induces man to look with indifference on coming evil under impression that evil already come be too heavy to admit of increase by time that be thoroughly wet through well splashed with mud considerably fatigued by first five six mile walk began to reflect life be not over with that must think of future thing a well a be past got home about two o'clock having knocked up landlady mr richards betook to bed alaric have be in room for last two hour of charley latch key mr richards knew nothing stated belief however that two be seldom saw that erratic gentleman in bed on following morning alaric when got hot water heard that norman returned during night from hampton immediately guessed what have brought back knew that nothing short of great trouble must have induced harry to leave cottage so abruptly that trouble must have be of such nature a to make remaining with woodward aggravation of such trouble must have come on one a charley seldom made appearance at breakfast table on sunday morning alaric foresaw that must undergo tete tete must not be agreeable to must be much more disagreeable to companion for there be help harry have however prepared for what have to go through immediately that two be alone told tale in very few word ' said ' proposed to gertrude last night refused ' alaric tudor be deeply grieved for friend there be something in rejected suitor countenance something in tone of voice must have touched heart softer than stone alaric heart have not a yet be so hardened by world a to render callous to sight of such grief a word for harry will think better of in month two ' said 'never never be sure of not only from own manner from mother ' said harry yet during walk home have be trying to console with reflection that most young lady reject husband once twice before accept there be offering man comfort in such sorrow a unless indeed be one to whom worship of bacchus may be made fitting substitute for of paphian goddess there be sort of disgrace often felt if never acknowledged attache to man for having put into norman present position generally prevents from confessing defeat in such matter misfortune in question be one doubtless occurs not unfrequently to mankind a mankind generally bear special disappointment in silence a vanity of woman be generally exceeded by good nature secret believe in most case remains secret will wasting in despair die because woman fair if be not fair for what care how fair be be upshot of consideration withers poet gave to matter withers be doubtless right 't be thus that rejected lover must think thus that must demean seldom come to philosophy till few day have passed by talking of grievance doe not assist in doing so when therefore harry have declared what have happened to have declared also that have further hope did not at first find much better for what have confessed be lackadaisical piteous alaric though have endeavoured to be friendly soon found that have power of imparting comfort early in day parted did not see other again till following morning ' be going down to normansgrove on thursday ' said harry 'yes know ' said alaric ' think will ask leave to go to day ca make much difference sooner get away better so be settled norman left town same afternoon alaric with blushing honour thick upon be left alone london be now very empty be constrained to enjoy glory very much by have never associated much with minusexes uppinalls yet with jones robinson of own office must not be expected that there must be specially confidential intercourse between just at present moment undy be of course out of town with rest of fashionable world alaric during next week be left very much on own hand 'and so ' said to a walked solitary along lone path of rotten row across huge desert to marble arch 'and so poor harry hope have be in vain have lost promotion now have lost bride poor harry then occurred to that a have acquired promotion might be destiny to win bride also have never told that loved gertrude have looked on a norman own at rate be not man to sigh in despair after anything be out of reach now now that harry chance be over that bond of friendship must interfere with passion why must not tell that loved gertrude 'if a harry have said there be longer hope for why ' said alaric to must not try chance ' of linda of 'dear dearest linda ' at moment thought very little perhaps not at of what mr woodward might say of did think good deal week be melancholy dull passed very slowly at hampton on sunday morning became known to norman be gone subject by tacit consent be allowed to pas unnoticed even katie even uncle bat be aware that something have occurred ought to prevent from inquiring too particularly why harry have started back to town in so sudden manner so said nothing to linda gertrude have told what have happened linda a heard asked whether be prepared to be equally obdurate with lover have now mean of supporting wife why must be obdurate nothing be said on subject between gertrude mother what more must mr woodward say must have be totally opposed to whole principle of life to endeavour by mean to persuade daughter to match to have used maternal influence in norman favour be well aware that must have be impossible to do so successfully gertrude be not girl to be talked into marriage by parent certainly not by such parent a mother there be therefore nothing further to be said about on saturday alaric went down arrival hardly made thing more pleasant mr woodward must not bring to be cordial with girl be restrained by certain feeling that must not be right to show too much outward joy at alaric success linda said one little word of affectionate encouragement produced apparent return from alaric immediate object be to recover mr woodward good grace thought before went that have reason to hope that might do so of household captain cuttwater be most emphatic in congratulation have doubt said 'that best man have won have always hoped that best man might win have not have same luck when be young be very glad to see such excellent rule brought into service must soon work great change be quite sure at board of admiralty ' on sunday afternoon captain cuttwater asked into own bedroom told with solemn serious manner that have communication of importance to make to alaric followed captain into well known room in norman used to sleep wondering what must be nature of uncle bat important communication might probably be tidings of sir jib boom ber alaric said old man a soon a be seated on opposite side of little pembroke table stood in middle of room ' be heartily glad to hear of success at weight measure not that ever doubted if made fair sailing match of ' ' be sure be much obliged to captain cuttwater 'that be a may be by by fact be have taken fancy to like fellow know how to push alaric have nothing for to repeat again that felt grateful for captain cuttwater good opinion have anything to say against mr norman very nice young man indeed be very nice though perhaps not quite so cheerful in manner a might be alaric began to take friend part declared what very worthy fellow harry be ' be sure of be sure of ' said uncle bat everybody ca be man ca make everybody heir ' alaric pricked up ear so after captain cuttwater be right in calling communication important what business have captain cuttwater to talk of making new heir have not declared that woodward be heir ' have got little money mr alaric ' went on saying in low modest tone very different from that ordinarily used ' have got little money not much will of course go to niece here ' 'of course ' said alaric 'that be to say will go to child be same thing ' 'quite same thing ' said alaric idea be if man have saved few pound think have right to give to love best now have child of own alaric declared aware of fact suppose sha have now 'not if marry ' said alaric who felt rather at loss for proper answer must not however have made better one 'no be what mean think will marry be very well contented here like surbiton cottage amazingly be charming place ' said alaric suppose will ever have child of own then uncle bat sighed gently 'and so have be considering whom must like to adopt ' 'quite right captain cuttwater ' must like to adopt must like to have one whom must call in special manner own now mr alaric have made up mind who do think be ' 'oh captain cuttwater must guess on matter must like to guess wrong ' 'perhaps not be right well then will tell be gertrude ' alaric be well aware that be gertrude before name have be pronounced 'yes be gertrude of course must go out of bessie family of course must be gertrude linda katie now linda katie be very well have gumption gertrude have ' 'no have not ' said alaric ' like gumption said captain cuttwater 'you have great deal of gumption be why like ' alaric laughed muttered something 'now have be thinking of something ' uncle bat looked strangely mysterious ' wonder what think of gertrude ' said alaric ' can see through millstone a well a ' said captain used to think that norman gertrude meant to hit off together alaric said nothing did not feel inclined to tell norman secret yet must not belie gertrude by contradicting justice of captain cuttwater opinion ' used to think so now find there be nothing in be sure gertrude must have think be right have gumption enough 'harry norman be fool dare say not ' said captain take word will never have lord bless norman know that a well a do ' alaric knew very well also did not say so 'now long short of be why make up to if will make up to carry day can say be will do can to keep pot boiling if think will help may tell gertrude say so ' be certainly important communication one to alaric found very difficult to give immediate answer said great deal about affection for mr woodward of admiration for miss woodward of strong sense of captain cuttwater kindness of own unworthiness left captain with impression that be not prepared at present moment to put forward a candidate for gertrude hand ' know what deuce must have ' said captain to be a fine girl a be likely to find two three thousand pound be so easily got day by fellow have shilling of own when alaric took departure next morning thought perceived from mr woodward manner that there be le than usual cordiality in tone in said that of course must return at end of week will if possible said 'and need not say that hope to do so fear may be kept in town at rate will write ' when end of week came wrote to say that unfortunately be kept in town thoroughly understood that people be most valued when make scarce got

justified choice done duty with credit to yourself benefit to public hope may go on prosper a long a remember that own interest must always be kept in subservience to of public service will not fail

over again that norman must have be victorious have stood ground to end assured that such be general opinion through whole establishment did without talking much about praising in way when did so speech be wholly of friend of sorrow that felt that friend must have be disappointed in hope have effect of norman rejected love of spoke knew that other must be aware of subject be far too tender to be touched at rate a yet so matter went on alaric regained footing of favour have for while lost with mistress of house there be one inmate of surbiton cottage who saw that though alaric spent so much of time with mr woodward found opportunity also for other private conversation be linda why be that in moment before dressed for dinner alaric be whispering with gertrude not with why be that alaric have felt necessary to stay from church that sunday evening when gertrude also have be prevented from going by headache have remained said in order captain cuttwater might have company linda be not slow to learn that uncle bat have be left to doze away time by why on following monday have gertrude be down so early why have alaric be over from inn full hour before usual time linda saw knew be disgusted even then did not must not think that alaric must be untrue to that own sister must rob of lover must not be that there must be such baseness in human nature poor linda yet though did not believe that such falseness must exist in world of hers at surbiton cottage must not restrain from complaining rather petulantly to sister a be going to bed on sunday evening ' hope headache be better ' said in tone of voice a near to irony a soft nature must produce 'yes be quite well now ' said gertrude disdaining to notice irony dare say alaric have headache too suppose one be about a bad a other 'linda said gertrude answering rather with dignity than with anger 'you ought to know by time that be not likely that must plead false excuse alaric never said have headache 'he said stayed from church to be with uncle bat when came back found with ' 'uncle bat went to sleep then came into drawing room ' two girl said nothing more about linda must have remembered that have never breathed word to sister of alaric passion for herself gertrude solemn propriety have deterred her just a be about to do so how very little of passion have alaric breathed yet ala enough to fill fond girl heart with dream of love occupied waking sleeping thought oh ye ruthless swain from whose unhallowed lip fall word full of poisoned honey do ye never think of bitter agony of many month of dull misery of many year of cold monotony of uncheered life follow so often a consequence of short hour of pastime on monday morning a soon a alaric charley have started for town be morning on linda have be provoked to find that gertrude alaric have be up hour before must have be gertrude followed mother to dressing room with palpitating heart closed door behind linda remained downstairs putting away tea sugar not

very gertrude who have warned not to listen to such word from such lip must have listened to have adopted made own must not must not be yet linda heart sank low within 'if really love ' said mother again caressing eldest daughter a acknowledged love hardly with such tenderness a when daughter have repudiated that other love really love dearest of course of course can not object ' ' do mamma do

feeling alaric never said word to that might not have said before friend till till must own mamma that one can have behaved more nobly than alaric have done ' mr woodward nevertheless have own sentiment on matter be not quite in unison with of daughter then be not in love with alaric daughter be thought that alaric love be passion have lately come to birth have be true to friend nobly true a gertrude have described must never have be born at at rate not till harry have have more prolonged chance of being successful with suit mr woodward understood human nature better than daughter at least flattered herself that did so felt well assured that alaric have not be dying for love during period of harry unsuccessful courtship might thought have waited little longer before chose for wife girl whom friend have loved seeing that have be made confidant of love such be feeling mr woodward felt unable to repress must not refuse consent to marriage after have slight twinge of conscience inward conviction that be prejudiced in harry favour a daughter be in alaric then have lost all right to object to alaric by allowing to be so constantly at cottage then again there be nothing to in reason must object in point of immediate income alaric be now better match of two kissed daughter therefore promised that must do best to take alaric to heart a son in law 'you will tell uncle bat mamma ' said gertrude ' o yes certainly dear of course will be told suppose doe not make much matter immediately ' think must be told mamma must not like to think that be treated with anything like disrespect ' havery well dear will tell ' said mr woodward who be somewhat surprised at daughter punctilious feeling about uncle bat however be very proper be glad to think that child be inclined to treat grand uncle with respect in spite of long nose then gertrude be preparing to leave room mother stopped 'gertrude dear said 'yes mamma ' 'come here dearest shut door gertrude have told linda yet 'no mamma not yet a mr woodward asked question there be indescribable look of painful emotion on brow did not escape gertrude eye be not to perfectly unintelligible have conceived idea why did not

certainly mamma if wish ' thing be going wrong with mr woodward have perceived with mother anxious eye that second daughter be not indifferent to alaric tudor while yet thought that norman gertrude must have suited other have caused disquietude have entertained none of grand idea to gertrude have given utterance with so much sententiousness when silenced linda tale of love before telling of have be commenced mr woodward have always felt sufficiently confident that alaric must push in world must have made objection to a son in law have be contented to take second instead of first of flock have never spoken to linda on matter linda have offered to confidence felt sure that second child must not have entertained affection have be unable altogether to conceal have lover plea be poured into ear mr woodward questioned daughter little understood well nature of must nearly read thought linda thought be not difficult to read 'linda pet ' said a soon a must get linda into room without absolutely sending for 'you have not yet heard gertrude news ' said linda turning very pale feeling that heart be like to burst ' must let one tell linda come here dearest stand there away from can guess what be linda for moment must not speak 'no mamma ' said at last know what be ' mr woodward twined arm round daughter waist a sat on sofa close to other linda tried to compose felt that be trembling in mother arm must have given anything to be calm anything to hide secret little guessed then how well mother knew eye be turned down found that must not raise to mother face 'no mamma ' said ' know what be ' 'gertrude be to be married linda be engaged ' thought refused harry ' said linda through whose mind faint idea be passing of cruelty of nature arrangement gave lover to sister dearest did now have made offer have accepted ' mr woodward must hardly bring to speak out that have to say yet felt that be only prolonging torture for be so anxious to find remedy ' said linda on whom full certainty of misery have now all come have accepted dear alaric ' dear alaric what word for linda ear did reach ear did not dwell there soft gentle nature sank beneath sound mother when looked to for reply found that be sinking through arm linda have fainted mr woodward screamed rang for assistance emptied water jug over daughter did anything else must have effect of revealing to whole household fact that linda have fainted have seen girl faint before be not frightened how when linda recovered be to be comforted mr woodward laid gently on sofa undid dress loosened stay then sat by chafing hand moistening lip temple till gradually poor girl eye reopened recovery from fainting fit real fainting fit beg young lady to understand brings with most unpleasant sensation for minute linda sorrow be quelled by suffering a recovered strength remembered where be what have happened sobbing violently burst into hysterical storm of tear most poignant feeling now be one of fear lest mother must have guessed secret mr woodward well understood must hing towards comforting child till there be perfect confidence between be easy to arrive at with linda must afterwards be difficult to persuade a to course ought to take two girl be so essentially different one so eager to stand alone guide other so prone to lean on nearest support came to hand be not long before linda have told mother everything by word tear little sign of mute confession made mother understand with exactness what have passed between alaric quite exactly what have be state of own heart sobbed wept looked up to mother for forgiveness a though have be guilty of great sin when mother caressed with mother tenderness told that be absolved from fault free of blame be to certain degree comforted might now happen mother must be on side mr woodward when looked into matter found that be must have demanded pardon of daughter not daughter of why have tender lamb be allowed to wander out of fold while wolf in sheep clothing be invited into pasture ground gertrude with talent beauty dignity of demeanour have hitherto be perhaps closest to mother heart have be if not most cherished yet most valued gertrude have be apple of eye must be altered now if mother love must atone for mother negligence mr woodward must atone to child for hour of misery katie sweet bonny katie at least must be protected from wolf be thought passed through mr woodward heart a sat there caressing linda how be thing to be managed now at present moment be quite clear that wolf in sheep clothing must be admitted into pastoral family that fairest lamb of flock must be turned out altogether to take upon lupine nature roam wood beast of prey a matter stood behoved to make such sheep of alaric a might be found practicable so mr woodward set to work to teach daughter how best might conduct in present state of wretchedness have to bear with sister success to listen to sister joy to enter into future plan to assist at toilet to prepare

of duelling be gone by unfortunately a norman now thought nothing determined must ever induce again to hold friendly intercourse with traitor abstained from making such oath a to woodward determined that conduct in respect must be governed by manner in alaric be received by gertrude letter read over over again time did so indulged in fresh burst of hatred against man who have deceived ' dishonest

with accuracy be state of mind alaric told gertrude how missive have be treated gertrude of course told mother there be very little of joy at surbiton cottage must have be forerunner of wedding none

heart melted within when heard that harry be really ill have gone on waiting day after day for answer to letter answer came answer came in lieu thereof heard that harry be laid up at normansgrove heard gertrude heard in spite of coming wedding there be very little joy at surbiton cottage then mr woodward wrote again man must have have heart of stone not to be moved by such letter have 'heard

concerned wrote to say that though be still weak be not dangerously ill that intended if nothing occurred amiss to be in town about end of year hoped might then see to thank for kindness must understand that must not go down to surbiton cottage a must doubtless have occasion for coming up to town might thus contrive to meet then sent love to linda katie ended by saying that have written to

alaric having acknowledged to necessity of breaking ice walked into room where norman sat with three four others be absolutely necessary that must make arrangement with a to certain branch of office work though be competent for a superior to have sent for norman a inferior thought best to abstain from doing so even though be thereby obliged to face enemy for first time in presence of others mr

troubling diligent barmaid have done so about ten minute when jabesh more punctual than usual entered place charley regarded a promising sign of forthcoming cash very frequently happened that waited there hour that after jabesh must not come then morning visit to mecklenburg square have to be made again so poor charley time rather time of poor office be cut up wasted destroyed ' mutton chop '

considering vast income of resident in metropolis be not perhaps wont to mix in highest circle of belgravian aristocracy yet be enabled to dress in elegance of fashion contrived to see good deal of society move in highly respectable neighbourhood of russell square gower street dress be made at distinguished establishment of madame mantalini in hanover square at least be in habit of getting one

say like mending up old clothes bit better than charley doe said katie pray go on mamma ' so mr woodward continued to read on day of macassar visit in tavistock square crinoline be dressed in most elegant morning costume be very light barege muslin extremely full a have assured friend miss manasseh of keppel street have be sent home from establishment in hanover square only day before be aware that miss manasseh instantly propagated ill natured report that have seen identical dress in milliner room up two pair back in store street then miss manasseh be known to be envious have moreover seen

dress be light pea green pattern be ivy wreath entwined with pansy tulip flounce showed separate wreath there be nine flounce highest of fairy circle be about three inch below smallest waist that ever be tightly girded in steel whalebone macassar have once declared in moment of ecstatic energy that small waist be chiefest grace in woman how often have lady crinoline maid when in extreme agony of labour put malediction on name on account of speech be unnecessary to speak of drapery of arm showed elaborate lace of sleeve beneath sometimes also pearly whiteness of rounded arm be sight must almost drive macassar to distraction at such moment a that hope of patriotic poet for good of civil service be not strictly fulfilled in heart of macassar jones oh if lady crinoline must have known be unnecessary also to describe strange hidden mechanism of mysterious petticoat gave such full dimension such ample sweeping proportion to tout ensemble of lady appearance be unnecessary must perhaps be improper a far a be concerned be certainly impossible here charley blushed a mr woodward looked at from over top of paper let suffice to say that must envelop sofa without slightest effort throw drapery yard half from on side without appearance of stretching completely fill carriage be more frequently fate entangle inextricably in cab word however must be said of little foot peeped out now again so beautifully from beneath artistic construction above alluded to of foot perhaps rather of shoe yet what can be said of successfully that french name so correctly spelt so elaborately accented so beautifully finished in gold letter from form however one must say that cordonnier must have imported from england be only visible to favoured knight who be occasionally permitted to carry shoe home in pocket word must be said about hair dressed l'imperatrice redolent of sweetest patchouli disclosing glory of ingenuous perhaps too open brow word must be said ala how inefficacious to do justice to ingenuity so wonderfully displayed hair of lady crinoline be perhaps more lovely than abundant to produce glorious effect that effect have now symbolized among english lass head dress l'imperatrice a one idea of feminine beauty hair be called on to give separate aid a be case with so many of who be anxious to put best foot foremost everything be abstracted from rear in order to create show in front then to complete garniture of head to make perfect to leave point of escape for susceptible admirer of modern beauty dorsal appendage be necessary of morning a well a in more

see give a true said charley ' will never get done if katie wo hold tongue ' said mr woodward perhaps be when at seaside in september at broadstairs herne bay dover crinoline mamma invigorated with sea breeze of ocean perhaps be there that be enabled to assume that covering for head in soul most delighted be tom jerry hat turned up at side with short knowing feather velvet trimming steel buckle blinking brightly in noonday sun have macassar seen in must have yielded captive at once quarter quarter be most marked perhaps most attractive peculiarity of lady crinoline face that end of nose be little turned up charm in unison with upturned edge of cruel hearted be found by many men to be invincible know how dreadful be spectacle of saracen head a appears did appear painted on huge board at top of snow hill from that be left to surmise with what tremendous audacity of countenance with what terror striking preparation of outward man eastern army be led to battle can men so fearfully bold in appearance ever turn back fly look a though must destroy by glance of ferocious eye who must withstand hirsute horror of fiery face there be just such audacity courage of similar description perhaps may say equal invincibility in charm of tom jerry hat when duly put on over face of proper description over face a of lady crinoline give to wearer appearance of concentration of pluck a eastern array doe quail before quiet valour of europe so may perhaps say doe open quick audacity of tom jerry tend to le powerful result than modest enduring patience of bonnet end second chapter bravo charley ' said mr woodward 'in name of british female public beg to thank for exertion 'the editor said be to write down turned up hat said charley ' rather like ' ' hope new slouch be not audacious saracen head ' said linda 'or mine ' said katie 'but may say what like about now for mine be drowned ' 'come girl there be four more chapter see let finish then can discus afterwards ' chapter iii having thus described lady crinoline 'you have described at said linda 'you have got beyond clothes yet 'there be nothing beyond ' said charley 'you have even described face ' said katie 'you have only said that have turned up nose 'there be nothing further that one can say about ' said charley having thus described lady crinoline ' continued mr woodward now becomes duty a impartial historian to give account of mr macassar jones be not prepared to give exact name of artist by whom mr macassar jones be turned out to world so perfectly dressed man be to do so signal service done to one establishment by advertisement must draw down on anger of trade at large tailor of london must be in league against daily delight be sufficient to remark that artist office be not hundred mile

grace of long sleeve length of back propriety innate respectability perfect decorum have almost said high moral worth of whole who must not willingly sacrifice individual existence that might become exponent of such coat macassar jones be proud to do so have bestowed perhaps greatest amount of personal attention on collar be matter more within own grasp than great important article to attention have be already drawn one nevertheless on be able to expend whole amount of energy genius people may think that rounder be rounder that if one be careful to get rounder one have done be necessary so thought not macassar jones men wear collar of two ply of linen men of three macassar jones wore collar of four ply men sensual self indulgent men appear to think that collar must be made for neck macassar jones knew better who never spared when cause be good knew that neck have be made for collar be at rate evident that such be case with own little can be said of head except that be small narrow genteel hat might be spoken of perhaps with advantage of loose studied tie of inch wide cravat paragraph might be made must fain not be tedious will only further remark that always carried with wonderful representation of like to to miracle only smaller in dimension like a duodecimo be to folio babe a be of own begetting little alter ego in took much delight be umbrella look at delicate

returned to town captain cuttwater went up with be again quiet at surbiton cottage chapter xxiv mr m'buffer accepts chiltern hundred be anxious hour for honourable undecimus scott when first learnt that mr m'buffer have accepted stewardship of chiltern hundred stewardship of chiltern hundred doe never occur to anyone how many person be appointed to valuable situation doe anyone ever reflect why member of parliament when wish to resign post of honour must not be simply gazetted in newspaper a having done so instead of being named a new steward of chiltern hundred one ever doe think of resigning becoming steward be one same thing with difference however that one of grand bulwark of british constitution be thus preserved well mr m'buffer who having be elected by independent elector of tillietudlem burgh to serve in parliament must not in accordance with law of constitution have got out of honourable difficult position by scheme of own found on sudden free man queen having selected to be steward for district in question have doubt that deed of appointment set forth that majesty have be moved to step by firm trust have in skill fidelity of said mr m'buffer if so majesty trust must seem to have be somewhat misplaced a mr m'buffer having be managing director of bankrupt swindle from have contrived to pillage thirty forty thousand pound be now unable to show face at tillietudlem in house of common in thus retreating from membership have object to save from expulsion feared be however consolation for to think that in what have done bulwark of british constitution have be preserved be anxious moment for undy existing parliament have still year half possibly two year half to run have already be withdrawn from public eye longer than thought be suitable to success of career particularly disliked obscurity for have found that in case obscurity have meant comparative poverty obscure man a observed early in life have nothing to sell now undy have once have something to sell very good market have made of be of course anxious that halcyon day must return fond of a elector of tillietudlem doubt be devoted a might be in general way to interest still still be possible that might forget if remained too long away from embrace 'out of sight out of mind ' be proverb open to worst side of human nature even at tillietudlem nature worst side might sometimes show actuated by such feeling a undy heard with joy tidings of m'buffer stewardship determined to rush to battle at once battle knew there must be to be brought in for district of tillietudlem be prize have never yet fallen to man lot without contest tillietudlem be poor pocket borough to be disposed of way way according to caprice venal call of aristocrat men of tillietudlem knew value of vote must only give according to conscience way to win conscience to overcome sensitive doubt of free independent tillietudlem elector undy knew to cost be almost question a once told alaric whether that must sell be worth that be compelled to buy having put neck to collar in line of life be not now going to withdraw tillietudlem be once more vacant undy determined to try again undaunted by former outlay to make outlay however at rate in electioneering matter be necessary that man must have in hand ready cash at present moment undy have very little therefore news of mr m'buffer retirement to german bath for health be not heard with unalloyed delight first went into city a men always do when want money though in what portion of city find have never come to author knowledge charley tudor to be sure did get l by going to 'banks of jordan ' supply likely to be derived from such fountain a must hardly be sufficient for undy want having done what must in city came to alaric prayed for assistance of friend energy in matter alaric must not have be be not unwilling to assist to extent of own immediate mean own immediate mean be limited undy desire for ready cash be almost unlimited there be certain railway proposed railway in ireland in undy have ventured very deeply more so indeed than have deemed quite prudent to divulge to friend in order to gain certain end have induced alaric to become director of line line in question be great west cork be to run from skibbereen to bantry momentous question now hotly debated before railway board be on moot point of branch to ballydehob if undy must carry west cork ballydehob branch entire must make pretty thing of if a there be too much reason to fear irish foe must prevail leave a undy have once said in eloquent speech at very influential meeting of shareholder leave unfortunate agricultural commercial interest of ballydehob steeped in cimmerian darkness chance be that poor undy must be well nigh ruined such being case have striven not unsuccessfully to draw alaric into concern alaric have bought very cheaply good many share many people said be worth nothing have by dint of undy machination be chosen director on board undy meanwhile lay by hoping that fortune might restore to parliament haply put on committee must finally adjudicate a to great question of ballydehob branch such be circumstance under came to alaric with view of raising such sum of money a might enable to overcome scruple of tillietudlem elector place in shoe lately vacated by mr m'buffer be sitting together after dinner when commenced subject mr val clementina have done tudor honour of dining with lady have now gone up into drawing room be busy talking over chiswick affair be to come off in next week after mr val intended to give small evening party to most elite of acquaintance 'we wo have world dear have said to gertrude 'but just few of own set be really nice clementina be dying to try new back step with m jaquetanape so wo crowd room such be immediate arrangement of tudor scott party m'buffer be off at last said scott a seated filled glass after closing dining room door brought pig to bad market after 'he be infernal rogue ' said alaric 'well suppose be ' said undy 'and fool into bargain to be found out 'he be downright swindler ' said alaric 'after ' said other not paying much attention to alaric indignation 'he did not do so very badly why m'buffer have be at now for thirteen year began with nothing have blood money god know have social merit to recommend be a vulgar a hog a awkward a elephant a ugly a ape believe never have friend be known at club to be greatest bore that ever came out of scotland yet for thirteen year have lived on fat of land for five year have be in parliament wife have gone about in carriage man in city have be willing to shake hand with ' 'and have come to ' said alaric whom question of m'buffer temporary prosperity made rather thoughtful 'well not so bad have have fling for thirteen year be something thirteen good year out of man life be more than fall to lot of one then suppose have saved something ' be spoken of everywhere a monster for whom hanging be too good ' wo hang yesterday be god to day be devil to morrow will be man again be ' mean to tell undy that consciousness of such crime a m'buffer have committed must not make man wretched in world probably in next also 'judge not ye will not be judged ' said undy quoting scripture a devil did before 'and a for consciousness of crime suppose m'buffer have none at have doubt think quite a honest a rest of world firmly belief that of be playing same game using same mean have idea dishonesty be objectionable ' what do think about ' ' think greatest rogue be who talk most of honesty therefore a wish to be thought honest never talk of own sat silent for while undy bethinking what argument must be most efficacious towards inducing alaric to strip of available shilling that have alaric debating in own mind that great question so often debated a to whether men men of world great best men whom saw around really endeavoured to be honest endeavoured only to seem so honesty be preached to on side did in intercourse with world find men to be honest did behove practical man like man so determined to battle with world a have determined did behove one a to be more honest than neighbour also encouraged by mystic word 'excelsior to be watchword of battle repeated morning noon night be prevailing idea of life yes how great how grand how absorbing be idea what if man may be going down down to tophet yet think while that be scaling wall of heaven wish to think honest ' said disturbing undy just a hero have determined on way in must play present hand of card have not slightest difficulty about ' said undy 'and dare say have none either a to m'buffer going will be great thing for if a doubt can get seat ' 'it will be great thing for ' said alaric who a well a undy have parliamentary ambition 'and for too boy must carry ballydehob branch to dead certainty even if did not do that 'd bring so near that expectation of must send share up like mercury in fine weather be at l s d now if be in house next session will be up to l s before easter what be more dear fellow if ca help ourselves in way will be worth nothing in very few month alaric looked rather blank for have invested deeply in line of be now director of week standing perhaps must say sitting have sold out golden hope in wheal mary jane for sake of embarking money becoming director in irish railway in one other speculation nearer home of undy have great opinion viz limehouse thames bridge company such being case did not like to hear west cork with ballydehob branch spoken of so slightingly 'the fact be man can do anything if be in house can hing if be not ' said undy 'you know old aberdeen saying 'you scratch will scratch ' be not only what man may do for be what others will do for when be in position to help now there be fellow be hand glove with of there be not one of must lift finger to help a be now let get seat again will do for just anything ask vigil move new writ to night got line from asking whether be ready there be good to be got by waiting so told to fire away suppose will go down at once said alaric 'well that a may be at least yes intention there be one thing needful be needful beoney ' suggested alaric money cash rhino tin ready by what other name goddess must be pleased to have worshipped money sir there be difficulty now a ever even at tillietudlem money will have weight ' 'ca father assist ' said alaric bey father wonder how 'd look if got letter from asking for money might a well expect goose to feed young with blood out of own breast like pelican a expect that scotch lord must give money to younger son like english duke what must father get by being member for tillietudlem must look nearer home than father what can do for ' `` 'yes ' said undy ' be sure mean to say will refuse to lend helping hand if can must realize by ballydehobs if be once in house then 'd have money back at once 'it be not that ' said alaric 'but have got ' ' be sure must let have thousand so ' said undy ' think couple of thousand must carry must make out other myself 'every shilling have ' said alaric 'be either in ballydehobs in limehouse bridge why sell ' beo have ' said undy 'everything can without utter ruin ballydehobs be not saleable a know ' 'what can do for then ' undy set again to think ' have doubt must get thousand on joint name blackguard m'ruen must do ' 'who be m'ruen ' asked alaric low blackguard of discounting jew christian must do then heaven know what must charge 'd make so many difficulty must have money for next fortnight must have name on bill in such man hand on account ' said alaric 'well like ' said undy 'but what deuce be to do might a well go to tillietudlem without head a without money ' thought 'd kept lot of mary janes said alaric beo have be gone now tell have managed l must murder now if seat be to go into other hand 'd get committee on limehouse bridge must treble money vigil told must not refuse committee though of course government wo consent to grant if can help ' 'well undy can let have l be shilling have at banker ' 'they must not let overdraw few hundred suggested undy ' certainly will not try ' said alaric 'you be so full of scruple so green so young ' said undy almost in enthusiasm of remonstrance 'what can be harm of trying ' bey credit ' lal what be meaning of credit how be to know whether have got credit if try come will tell how can do old cuttwater must lend for asking ' to proposition alaric at first turned deaf ear by degree allowed undy to talk over undy showed that if lost tillietudlem burgh on occasion must be useless for to attempt to stand for again in such case must have alternative at next general election to stand for borough of strathbogy in aberdeenshire whereas if must secure tillietudlem a seat for gaberlunzie interest in borough of strathbogy be supposed to be by mean small must be transferred to alaric indeed sandie scott eldest hope of gaberlunzie family must in such case propose alaric to elector cabetalk cottage in hon sandie lived be on outskirt of gaberlunzie property be absolutely within boundary of borough overcome by other argument alaric at last consented to ask from captain cuttwater loan of l that sum undy have agreed to accept a sufficient contribution to desirable public object re seating for tillietudlem borough a alaric on reflection thought that must be uncomfortable to be left penniless a be just a likely that uncle bat must lend l a l determined to ask for loan of entire sum accordingly did so letter a have seen reached captain while harry charley be at surbiton cottage old gentleman be anything pleased in first place liked money though not with overweening affection in next place have done great deal for alaric did not like being asked to do more lastly feared that there must be evil cause for necessity of loan so soon after alaric marriage alaric in making application have not done so actually without making explanation on subject wrote long letter worded very cleverly only served to mystify captain a alaric have intended that must do captain cuttwater be most anxious that alaric whom looked on a adopted son must rise in world must have be delighted to think that might possibly live to see in parliament must probably have made considerable pecuniary sacrifice for object with design therefore of softening captain cuttwater heart alaric in letter have spoken about great change be coming of necessity that there be of stirring of great pecuniary result to be expected from small present expenditure ended by declaring that money be to be used in forwarding election of friend scott for tillietudlem district burgh now fact be that uncle bat though cared great deal for alaric did not care rope end for undy scott must enjoy rum punch just a keenly if mr scott be in obscurity a must possibly hope to do even if gentleman must be promoted to be lord of treasury be not at pleased to think that hard

to free through one glass house after across lawn along path attempting now then to get word with linda not at so happy a have hoped to have be at last gertrude came to rescue be congregated for while in one great flower house gertrude finding near sister asked how liked 'oh be very beautiful ' said katie 'only what dear 'must let come with little while look here ' crept softly around to other side of sister sidling with little step away from frenchman at whom however kept furtively looking a though feared that must detect in act here gertrude ' said twitching sister arm 'that gentleman there

charley be doing to see whether be coming to notice 'they be bright star of immediate handiwork ' said ugolina 'and if dim eye must read aright must whisper to secret of love ' 'yes dare say must ' said katie who felt perhaps little disappointed because charley lingered while shaking hand with mr val clementina golightly be however for moment there be much shaking of hand to be done considerable taking off of hat to be gone through a alaric charley encountered head of column first be only natural that must work way through gradually katie however never guessed how must that charley have calculated that by reaching last must be able to remain with be still listening to ugolina who be mounting higher higher up to heaven when found hand in charley ugolina might now mount up get down again a best must for katie must no longer listen to alaric have not seen yet since ducking have to listen to to answer congratulation charley standing by making comment say took to water quite naturally swam like duck ' said alaric 'only went in head foremost said charley 'all bather ought to do ' said alaric 'and tell katie did feel comfortable when be in water recollect anything about ' said 'only that saw charley coming to just when be going to sink for last time why be told that floated like deal board ' 'the big hat crinoline kept up ' said charley behe have idea of sinking ' 'oh

after while people passed on there be lull before others filled place katie found opposite to beautiful black rose with one close to charley ' have got something for ' said a spoke felt to be almost hot with blushing beomething for ' said charley also felt abashed did not know why be only very little thing ' said katie feeling in pocket 'and be almost ashamed to ask to take made one else put

life that even under circumstance have found able to fill room respectably if indeed there be absolute crowding if space be left in front drawing room sufficient for operation of dancer must still attribute apparent want of fashionable popularity to selection of few nice people whom have asked hon mr val be ordinary woman understood well how to make most of good with god provided miss neverbends be to dine with tudor go with to dance in evening brother fidus be to meet there charley be of course one of party at dinner a there be other gentleman there alaric have excellent opportunity when lady went up to toilet to impress on cousin expediency of losing time in securing to miss golightly twenty thousand pound conversation a will be seen at last became rather animated 'well charley what do think of beautiful clementina ' said alaric pushing over bottle to cousin a soon a found alone ' 'doosed fine girl a captain val say be ' ' 'doosed fine girl of course ' said charley laughing have too much go in for be afraid bearriage child will soon pull that down 'd make excellent wife for such man a to tell truth charley if will take advice will lose time in making up to have got that d french fellow at heel though suppose care one straw about may be well to make sure 'but mean in earnest that think that miss golightly must have ' 'indeed do be just man to get on with girl a far a can see be just man will never get on in other way under sun charley sighed a thought of many debt poor prospect passionate love there seemed indeed to be little chance that ever must get on at in ordinary sense of word `` m sure 'd refuse ' said still wishing to back out of difficulty `` m sure must have not got penny in world know ' 'that be just reason have got lot of money

brother in law figgs be bedridden when old golightly be off hook altogether will be chosen undy talk of putting in name a of family friend so will have everything to assist ' charley looked very grave have not be in habit of discussing such matter seemed to that if be about to become in legal manner guardian of miss golightly fortune that in be reason enough why alaric must not propose such match a needy men to be sure did often marry rich lady world looked on regarded only a matter of course surely must be duty of guardian to protect ward from such fate if be in power to do so alaric who saw something of what be going on in cousin mind essayed to remove impression be thus made 'besides know clementina be chicken fortune be at own disposal guardian on earth can not prevent marrying if make up mind to do so charley gulped down glass of wine then sat staring at fire saying nothing further be true enough that be very poor true enough that miss golightly fortune must set on leg make man of true enough perhaps that other expedient of must think must do so then there be so many argument be betrong against deed ' in first place thought impossible that must be successful in such suit then again must hardly be honest to obtain such success if be possible then thirdly have sort of affection whatsoever for miss golightly fourthly lastly chiefly loved so dearly tenderly loved poor katie woodward a thought of felt horror stricken with at allowing idea of becoming suitor to to dwell for instant on mind looking up with resolution be able to summon said be impossible alaric quite impossible must do ' 'then what do mean to do ' said alaric who be angry at having scheme thus thwarted 'do mean to be beggar if not how do intend to get out of difficulty ' trust not beggar ' said charley sadly 'what other hope have what rational hope of setting right ' 'perhaps may do something by writing ' said charley very bashfully 'by writing have have have alaric laughed somewhat cruelly at poor navvy ' do something by writing what will do by writing will make l penny of trade going must say be likely to be poorest for poor man poorest most heart breaking what have made already to encourage ' 'the editor say that 'crinoline macassar ' will come to l s ' 'and when will get ' 'the editor say that rule be to pay six month after date of publication daily delight be only new thing know editor say that if sale come up to expectation will increase scale of pay ' ' prospect of l s for fortnight hard work be bad look out boy have better take heiress 'it may be bad look out ' said charley whose spirit be raised by cousin sneer at rate be honest will tell what alaric 'd sooner earn l by writing for press than get l in other way can think of may be poor trade in one way author believe be poor be sure have consolation 'well charley hope with heart that may find for own part seeing what place world be seeing be general aspiration of other men seeing what a appears to creator have intended for goal of labour look for advancement prosperity such rank station a may be able to win for labourer be worthy of hire mean to refuse such wage a may come in way ' 'yes said charley who now that spirit be roused determined to fight battle manfully 'yes labourer be worthy of hire be to get miss golightly fortune must be taking hire without labour ' said alaric 'it must be dishonest in way for love must not love at moment married ' 'honesty said alaric still sneering be sign of dishonesty of age so strong a continual talk one hears about honesty ' be quite manifest that alaric have not sat at foot of undy scott without profiting by lesson have heard 'with what face ' continued 'can pretend to be more honest than neighbour ' know that be wrong unmanly too to hunt girl down merely for what have got ' 'there be great many wrong unmanly men about then said alaric through house of parliament see how many men there have married for money aye made excellent husband afterwards will tell what be charley be humbug in to pretend to be better than others be not bit better mind say be worse have none of too much of honesty of be so fond of prating where be honesty when ordered coat for know can not pay when swore to bootmaker that must have amount of little bill after next quarter day knowing in heart at time that must get farthing of if be so honest why did waste money to day in going to chiswick instead of paying portion of debt honest be dare say indifferently honest a world go like rest of think might put burden of clementina fortune on conscience without feeling much worse for after what have already gone through ' charley became very red in face a sat silent listening to alaric address did speak at once at first pause so alaric went on truth take be that at present moment have personal fancy for girl ' 'no have not ' said charley 'and be so incredibly careless a to prudential consideration a to prefer immediate personal fancy to future welfare of whole life can say no more if will think well of proposition will do can to assist have doubt must make good husband to miss golightly that must be very happy with if think otherwise there be end of pray talk so much about honesty tailor must arrest to morrow if heard ' 'there be two kind of honesty take ' said charley speaking with suppressed anger sorrow visible in face 'that world see that doe not see for have nothing to say in own defence have made bed badly must lie on a be certainly will not mend by marrying girl can never love a for alaric who know love watch career with greatest hope know ambition look to see rise in world in rising a will do must remember nothing be wrong can become right because other people do ' 'well charley ' said other for lecture did not certainly expect from be not on account le welcome now suppose go upstairs dress for mr val so went upstairs katie heart beat high a got out of carriage mr val private carriage have be kept on for occasion saw before above on stair crowd of muslin crushing way on towards room prepared for dancing katie have never be to ball before hope that word ball may not bring down on adverse criticism of morning post be probably not ball in strictly fashionable sense of word be so to katie to intent purpose dancing have hitherto be done at child party a sort of supplemental amusement to evening tea gathering at hampton hampton court have never yet seen muse worshipped with premeditated ceremony of banished carpet chalked floor hired musician heart consequently beat high a made way upstairs linked arm in arm with ugolina neverbend dance much ' said ugolina 'oh hope so ' said katie ' will not be amusement of be peculiarly fond for active habit suit ' be probably said with allusion to sister who be apt to be short of breath 'but in dance of present day conversation be impossible look upon pursuit a barbaric stop feast of reason flow of soul ' katie did not quite understand thought in heart that must not at mind giving up talking for whole evening if must only get dancing enough on matter heart misgave to be sure be engaged to charley for first quadrille second waltz there engagement stopped whereas clementina a be aware have whole book full of what if must get more dancing when charley good nature must have be expended have idea that one must care to dance with when older partner be to be have ah katie yet know extent of rich wealth of own attraction then heard little speech from mr val behe be really quite ashamed really be to see so many people must not wish of guest away must be impossible though perhaps one two might be spared said in confidential whisper to gertrude who one two might be must be difficult to decide a have made same whisper to one really be ashamed there be almost crowd have quite intended that house must be nearly empty fact be everybody asked have come a must not of course have counted on why have got see twice a many people a have expected then went on made same speech to next arrival katie who wanted to begin play at beginning kept eye anxiously on charley who be still standing with lactimel neverbend on arm now ' said to herself 'if must forget begin dancing with miss neverbend then remembered how have jumped into water determined that even with such provocation a must not be angry with there be danger of charley forgetting 'come ' said 'we must not lose more time if mean to dance first set alaric will be vi vi be going to dance with miss neverbend so stood up katie tightened glove gave dress little shake looked at shoe then work of evening began must have liked to have sat down for first dance ' said confidentially to charley 'because be first ball down suppose will be let to sit down whole evening will be cry out for mercy about three four o'clock in morning ' be to go on now said katie whose eye be intent on figure who must not have gone wrong allowed partner to do so on consideration so dance went on right merrily `` ve got to dance first polka with miss golightly ' said charley 'and next with ' said katie 'you may be sure sha forget ' 'you lucky man to get miss golightly for partner be told be most beautiful dancer in world o mademoiselle be much better ' said charley naming principal stage performer of day one be to go whole hog one have better do thoroughly ' katie did not quite understand then what meant merely replied that must look at performance in however be destined to be disappointed for charley have hardly left before miss golightly brought up to identical m delabarbe de l'empereur who have so terribly put out in garden be done so suddenly that katie presence of mind be quite insufficient to provide with mean of escape frenchman bowed very low said nothing katie made little curtsy be equally silent then felt own arm gathered up put within stood up to take share in awful performance felt to be in such nervous fright that must willingly have be home again at hampton if must a be utterly impossible have only to bethink herself of step get through work a best might away went charley clementina leading throng away went m jaquetanape linda away went frenchman clasping in arm happy ugolina away went lactimel with young weight measure then came katie turn pressed lip together shut eye felt tall frenchman arm behind back made start be like plunging into cold

girl have with great triumph tired out finger of mother sister forced to own that be impossible to put down m de l'empereur therefore have work before did like man a long a must katie who have not yet assumed air will of grown up young lady thought that be bound to go on a long a grand partner chose to go with on other hand accustomed in gallantry to obey lady wish considered bound to leave to to stop when pleased so went on with apparently interminable gyration charley heiress have twice be in motion have twice stopped still be going on ugolina have refreshed with many delicious observation lactimel have thrice paused to advocate dancing for million still went on circle be gradually left to still went on people stood round admiring others pitying still went on katie thinking of step business did not perceive that partner be alone ever anon others of course joined in so went on on on m delabarbe de l'empereur be strong active man began to perceive that lady be too much for be already melting away with exertion while partner be a cool a cucumber with active young leg lightly filled vein small agile frame must have gone on almost for ever m de l'empereur be more encumbered gallantry be at last beat by nature overtasked muscle must do more for be fain to stop dropping partner into chair throwing in state of utter exhaustion against wall katie be hardly out of breath a received congratulation of friend at moment must not understand why be quizzing in after time however be often reproached with having danced frenchman to death in evening in revenge for having bored in morning be observed that m delabarbe de l'empereur danced more that evening indeed very soon left house katie have not be able to see miss golightly performance have be well worth seeing be certainly no ordinary performer if did not quite come up to remarkable movement one see on stage under name of dancing fault be neither in will ability only in education charley also be peculiarly well suited to give 'ample verge room enough ' to show off perfection most peculiar merit consisted perhaps in power of stopping suddenly while going on at rate of hunt one way without pause apparent difficulty going just a fast other way be done by jerk must one must be inclined to think have dislocated bone entirely upset internal arrangement be done without injury disagreeable result to brain elsewhere know how steamer be manoeuvred when have to change course how stop ease back miss golightly stopped eased backed at once that without collision with other craft be truly very wonderful katie ought to have looked at katie soon found occasion to cast off fear that evening happiness must be destroyed by dearth of partner trouble began to be of exactly opposite description have almost envied miss golightly little book full of engagement now found dreadfully bewildered by book of own one have given card pencil moment must get to herself be taken up in endeavouring to guard from perfidy on own part down card at interval be not very far apart there be great c stood for charley firmest feeling be that earthly consideration must be allowed to interfere with landmark then there be manner of hieroglyphic sometimes unfortunately illegible to katie french name english name mixed together in manner most vexatious to make matter worse found that have put down victoire jaquetanape mr johnson of weight by great must not remember with whom be bound to dance lancer to have promised last polka before supper one thing however be quite fixed when supper must arrive be to go downstairs with charley 'what dreadful news linda ' said charley 'did hear ' linda be standing up with mr neverbend for sober quadrille katie also be close by with partner 'dreadful news indeed 'what be ' said linda ' man can die once to be sure to be killed in such manner a be certainly very sad ' 'killed who have be killed ' said neverbend 'well perhaps must say killed only died in cab a went home ' 'died in cab how dreadful ' said neverbend 'who who be mr tudor ' 'did hear how very odd why m de l'empereur to be sure wonder what coroner will bring in ' can talk such nonsense charley ' said linda havery well master charley ' said katie 'all come of being writer of romance suppose be to be next contribution to daily delight neverbend went off on quadrille not at pleased with joke indeed be never pleased with joke in instance ventured to suggest to partner that idea of gentleman expiring in cab be much too horrid to be laughed at 'oh never mind charley tudor ' said linda 'he always go on in way like so much ' mr neverbend who though not very young still have susceptible heart within bosom have be much taken by linda charm already began to entertain idea a mr neverbend must be desirable adjunct to establishment at future period must not do better than offer worldly good to acceptance of miss woodward therefore said nothing further in disparagement of family friend resolved that such alliance must ever induce to make mr charles tudor welcome at house what must have expected internal navigation have ever be low place be surprised that hon mr val must have admitted one of navvy inside drawing room so ball went on mr johnson came duly for lancer m jaquetanape for polka johnson be great at lancer knowing turn vagary in most intricate exclusive of dance need hardly be said that polka with m jaquetanape be successful last honour however be not without evil result for excited envy of ugolina who proud of own performance have longed hitherto in vain to be whirled round room by wondrously expert foreigner dear ' said ugolina with air that plainly said that katie be to be treated a child hope have have dancing enough ' indeed have not ' said katie fully appreciating purport cause of companion remark 'not near enough 'ah dear must remember ' said ugolina 'your mamma will be displeased if fatigue ' bey mamma be never displeased because amuse be not bit fatigued so saying katie walked off took refuge with sister gertrude what business have ugolina neverbend to interfere between mamma then came supper there be great rush to get downstairs charley be so clever that even did not put out of course there be sitting down mean that bashful retiring obedient guest be to stand on leg while who be forward impudent disobedient found seat for wherever must charley be certainly among latter class did not rest therefore till have got katie into old arm chair in one corner of room in such position a to enable to eat own supper leaning against chimney piece ' say johnson ' said 'do bring ham chicken be for lady be wedged up here ca get out johnson sherry ' good natured young weight obeyed brought desired provision johnson upon word be sorry to be so troublesome one more plateful if please for lady good deal if please for lady for be very hungry more sherry johnson again obeyed weight be always obedient charley of course appropriated second portion to own purpose

said katie mamma linda gertrude never do harry norman never doe alaric ' harry norman never doe ' said charley with something like vexation in tone made exception to katie list of truth teller be thinking within whether alaric have juster right to be in catalogue than 'harry norman never doe certainly must not compare with katie be pattern of excellence be other way a everybody know be half laughing a spoke katie sharp ear knew that be more than half in earnest felt have pained by what have said 'oh charley did mean that indeed did not know that in serious thing be a truthful a be quite a good be in many way poor katie wanted to console wanted to be kind yet must not be dishonest a good know be not 'you be a good hearted if not better will be a steady wo charley be sure will know be more clever really more clever than of ' 'oh katie ' be quite sure be have always said so be angry with for what said 'angry with must be angry with ' ' must for world say anything to vex like better than of though alaric be brother in law of course do how must help when saved life ' beaved life pooh did save life boy must have done same waterman about place when fell in person who be nearest pulled out be ' there be something almost approaching to ferocity in voice a said yet when katie timidly looked up saw that have turned back to room that eye be full of tear have felt that be loved by child that be loved from feeling of uncalled for gratitude must not stop to analyse to separate sweet from bitter knew that latter prevailed be so little flattering to be loved when such love be offspring of gratitude then when gratitude be unnecessary when have be given in mistake for supposed acceptance of such love be little better than cheat be not ' said katie very decidedly 'it never will be in mind if have not be with must now have be drowned cold dead mamma where must have be oh charley will think so wicked if have said anything to vex ' charley did not analyse feeling did katie analyse hers must have be impossible for to do so must have done have done must have found that gratitude be excuse made to herself for passionate love must not have excused even to herself in other way said everything must to reassure make happy soon smiled laughed again 'now be what editor must call nemesis ' said charley 'oh be nemesis be ' 'johnson be cheated into doing work getting supper then scolded took away appetite so must eat be nemesis johnson be avenged only unluckily doe know wickedness be punished ' mind put into daily delight girl be going upstairs pray let get out so katie went upstairs again be then past one about two hour afterwards gertrude looking for sister that might take home found seated on bench with foot tucked under dress be very much fatigued looked to be so there be still bright laughing sparkle in eye showed that spirit be not even yet weary 'well katie have have enough dancing ' 'nearly said katie yawning 'you look a if must stand ' 'yes be too tired to stand still think must dance little more only 'only what ' 'whisper said katie gertrude put down ear near to sister lip shoe be quite worn out toe be out on floor be clearly time for to go home so away went chapter xxvii excelsior last word katie spoke a walked down mr val hall leaning on charley arm a led to carriage be 'you will be steady charley wo will try to be steady wo dear charley ' a spoke almost imperceptibly squeezed arm on be leaning charley pressed little hand a parted from said nothing what must say in moment of time in answer to request have made reply must have come most readily to lip must have be 'it be too late katie too late for to profit by caution even from steadiness now will save ' katie however wanted other answer than warm pressure felt on hand then leaning back in carriage shutting eye tried to think quietly over event of night be ala dream yet so like reality that must not divest herself of feeling that ball be still going on still seemed to see light hear music to feel whirled round room to see others whirling whirling whirling on side of thought over name on card little contest have taken place for hand charley joke m de l'empereur great disaster then a remembered how long have gone on twisting round with poor unfortunate ill used frenchman involuntarily burst out into fit of laughter gracious katie what be matter thought be asleep ' said gertrude beo did said linda 'what on earth can be laughing at now ' be laughing at ' said katie still going on with half suppressed chuckle 'and thinking what fool be to go on dancing so long with m de l'empereur oh dear gertrude be so tired will be home soon then burst out cry excitement fatigue of day have be too much for be now completely overcome ugolina neverbend advice though not quite given in kindest way have in be good mr woodward must in truth have be unhappy must have seen child at moment katie made attempt to laugh off tear failed sob then became hysterical lay with head on married sister shoulder almost choking in attempt to repress katie sob so ' said linda ' cry pray cry dear katie have better let have way ' said gertrude behe will be better directly wo katie ' in little time be better then burst out laughing again ' wonder why man went on when be so tired what stupid man must be gertrude linda laughed in order to comfort bring round 'do know think be because did know how to say betop ' in english then burst out laughing again led to fit of hysterical tear when reached home gertrude linda soon got into bed linda be to sleep with also be not very long in laying head on pillow before did so katie be fast asleep twice in sleep cried out 'oh charley oh charley then linda guessed how be with sister in depth of loving heart sorrowed for coming grief foresaw when morning came katie be feverish have headache be thought better that must remain in town alaric took linda down to hampton next day mr woodward came up a invalid be better took home still be invalid doctor declared that have never quite recovered from fall into river prescribed quiet cod liver oil truth about chiswick fete five hour dancing worn out shoe be not told to might perhaps have acquitted water god of injury be perhaps told to mr woodward `` m afraid tired at ball said mr woodward ' think did little said linda 'did dance much said mr woodward looking anxiously behe did dance good deal ' said linda mr woodward be too wise to ask further question a be fine night alaric have declared intention of walking home from mr val party charley started together soon parted on road not before alaric have have time to notice charley perverse stupidity a to miss golightly beo must take advice about clementina ' said 'it be quite impossible alaric ' said charley in apologetic voice ' must do what be more be sure never will ' 'no not now certainly ca do now if be not very much mistaken chance be gone think will find engaged to frenchman tonight havery likely ' said charley 'well did best must for good night old fellow `` m sure be much obliged to good night ' said charley alaric suggestion with reference to heiress be quite correct m jaquetanape have that night proposed be duly accepted be to present to loved one honourable mother on following morning a future son in law comforted supported in task of doing so by assurance from lady that if mother must not give consent marriage must go on same without how delightful to have dancer for lover thought clementina be 'excelsior ' charley walked home with sad heart have that day given pledge that must on morrow go to 'cat whistle ' visit lady love since night when sat there with norah geraghty on knee now nearly fortnight since have spent little of time there have indeed gone there once twice with friend scatterall have contrived to avoid confidential intercourse with landlady barmaid alleging a excuse for extra ordinary absence that time be wholly occupied by demand made on by editor of daily delight mr davis however be much too sharp so also may say be miss geraghty to be deceived well knew that young man a charley must go wherever inclination led till lately have be all impossible to get out of little back parlour at 'cat whistle ' now be nearly a difficult to get into understood what meant 'you 'd better take up with peppermint have done with ' said widow 'what be good of shilly willying till be a thin a whipping post if mind what be after will be off too ' 'and d go along with ' said miss geraghty who have still about twang of county clare from whence came heart ' said mr davis ' will save hundred pound if will be led by will not throw peppermint over till be sure of other take word for be ' ' hate peppermint 'nonsense be honest good sort of man deal more likely to keep out of want than other hereupon norah began to cry to wipe beautiful eye with glass cloth hers indeed be cruel position face be fortune fortune knew be deteriorating from day to day must not afford to lose lover that loved also lover that did not love matrimony with be extremely desirable be driven to confess that might very probably be either now never much a hated peppermint be quite aware that must take if must not do better then be absolutely certain that must lose lover so completely suited taste mr davis said be norah confiding a be so natural that lady must do little too much in own beauty thought that must have chance left also have high aspiration desired to rise in world to leave go of gin screw of tobacco behind to reach position more worthy of taste of woman translated doubtless into excellent irish be motto also must be so great thing to be wife of charles tudor esq of civil service more especially a dearly truly loved same charles tudor in heart of heart knew however that be not for to indulge in luxury of heart if circumstance absolutely forbade to eat drink clothe herself if possible to provide eating drinking clothes for future year be business of life be only real necessity have nothing to say in opposition to mr davis therefore went on cry again wiped eye with glass cloth mr davis however be stern monitor unindulgent to weakness of human nature when saw how norah took to heart sad fate resolved to make one more effort in favour consequently dressed very nicely put on best bonnet took unprecedented step of going off to internal navigation calling on charley in middle of office charley be poking over kennett avon lock entry with usual official energy when office messenger came up informed that lady be waiting to see ' lady ' said charley 'what lady ' immediately began thinking of woodward whom be to meet afternoon at chiswick `` m sure ca say sir that said be that be lady ' answered messenger falsely for well knew that woman be mr davis of 'cat whistle ' now clerk at internal navigation be badly off for waiting room in respect can different rank of different public office be more plainly seen than in presence absence of such little item of accommodation a at weight measure there be elegant little chamber carpeted furnished with leathern bottomed chair clock supplied with cream laid note paper new pen time newspaper little elysium in to pas hour while secretary whom one have called to see be completing last calculation on matter of decimal coinage there be such comfort at internal navigation there be indeed little room at top of stair in visitor be requested to sit down even here two men be always at work at work else at play into room mr davis be shown there charley found long intimately a young navvy have be acquainted with landlady of 'cat whistle ' have never before seen arrayed for outer world may be doubted whether sir john falstaff must at first glance have known even dame quickly in bonnet be if dame quickly in day have have bonnet at rate charley be at fault for moment be shaking hand with landlady before quite recognized who be men in room however have recognized charley well knew that have done so ber tudor began not bit abashed want to know what be be going to do ' though be not abashed charley be very much so however contrived to get out of room so that might speak to somewhat more privately in passage gentleman at internal navigation be well accustomed to mode of colloquy a tradesman not unfrequently called with view of having little conversation must not conveniently be held in public room 'and mr tudor what be going to do about poor girl there ' said mr davis a soon a found in passage saw that charley be comfortably settled with back against wall behe may go to hong kong for ' be what charley must have said did not say have sternness of heart moral courage to enable to do so be very anxious be true to get altogether quit of norah geraghty present immediate care be confined to desire of getting mr davis out of office ' said charley 'oh know will come settle something of day let see when say next tuesday beettle something ' said mr davis 'if be honest man a take there be only one thing to settle when do mean to marry ' 'hush ' said charley for a be speaking mr snape came down passage leading from mr oldeschole room 'hush ' mr snape a passed walked very slowly looked curiously round into widow face `` ll be even with old fellow for ' said charley to may be taken for granted that kept word before long be good hushing more ' said mr davis hardly waiting till mr snape erect ear be out of hearing 'hushing wo do good there be that girl dying grave will be top of head mr tudor mind tell fairly so now want to know what to be going to do then mr davis lifted up lid of market basket hung on left arm took out pocket handkerchief began to wipe eye unfortunate charley idea occurred to that might bolt leave then chance be that must make way into very room tell story there out before well knew that woman be capable of many thing if temper be fairly roused yet what must say to to induce to go out from that building leave alone to lesser misfortune be dying tell mr tudor ' continued landlady 'and if do die be sure of wo be slow to tell truth about be only friend be got be not going to see put upon so just tell in two word what be be going to do then mr davis replaced kerchief in basket stood boldly erect in middle of passage waiting for charley answer just at moment mr snape again appeared in passage going towards mr oldeschole room pernicious old man hated charley tudor to tell truth there be love lost between charley afflicted out of spirit a be at moment must not resist opportunity of being impertinent to old foe `` m afraid will make very tired mr snape if walk about so much ' said mr snape merely looked at then hard at mr davis passed on to mr oldeschole room 'well mr tudor will be so good a to tell what be be going to do about poor girl goodness mr davis know how be situated how can expect to give answer to question in place a will come to 'cat whistle ' on tuesday ' said eloquent lady know mean gammon ' charley perhaps did mean gammon protested that have never be more truthfully in earnest in life mr be door opened mr davis perceiving whipped out handkerchief in haste again began wiping eye not without audible sob 'confound woman said charley to 'what on earth will do with ' mr oldeschole door opened out of came mr oldeschole mr snape following what mean clerk have used to bring forth secretary need not now be inquired forth came passed along passage brushing close by charley mr davis mr oldeschole when saw that one of clerk be talking to woman who apparently be cry looked very intently on ground passed by with quick step mr snape looked a intently at woman passed very slowly acted according to light mean gammon at mr davis indeed will be there on tuesday night certainly if not sooner will indeed will be in desperate scrape if see here talking to longer there be rule against woman being in office at 'and there be rule against clerk marrying suppose ' said mr davis colloquy ended in charley promising to spend saturday evening at 'cat whistle ' with view of then there settling what meant to do about 'that there girl ' nothing short of such undertaking on part must induce mr davis to budge have known advantage might have made even better term must almost rather have given written promise to marry barmaid than have suffered to remain there till mr oldeschole must return see there again so mr davis with basket pocket handkerchief went way about marketing charley a returned to room gave strictest injunction to messenger not on ground excuse be woman to be again allowed to see at office when therefore on fine summer morning with early daylight bright around charley walked home from mr val party naturally felt sad enough have one sixpence left in pocket be engaged to spend evening of following day with delightful norah at 'cat whistle ' then there to plight troth in formal most irretrievable manner mr davis might choose to devise a thought of thing have ringing in ear last sound of angel voice will be steady charley wo know will dear charley wo now ' steady must not best thing for be to step down to waterloo bridge throw over still have money enough left to pay toll though not enough to hire pistol so went home got into bed on same day day be to witness charley betrothal to miss geraghty that of m jaquetanape with miss golightly alaric tudor have appointment with sir gregory hardlines at new office of civil service examination board alaric have be invited to wait upon great man in term made perfectly understand that communication to be made be one must not be unpleasing uncomplimentary to indeed pretty well guessed what be to be said to since promotion at weight measure have gone on rising in estimation a man of value to civil service at large nearly two year have now passed since date in page nothing have be said of official career during time have however be everything that friend must have wished to be have so put forward a absolutely to have satisfied actual chief clerk of office be even felt by of secretary to be treading very closely on heel yet great portion of time have be spent not at weight measure in giving sort of special assistance to sir gregory board authority at weight measure did not miss must have be well content that must have remained for ever with sir gregory have also become somewhat known to official world even beyond confines of weight measure examination board have changed club now belonged to downing have there be introduced by friend undy to many men whom to know must be very breath in nostril of rising official aspirant mr whip vigil of treasury have more than once taken by hand even chancellor of exchequer usually nodded to whenever o'ertasked functionary found moment to look in at official club thing have not be going quite smoothly at examination board tidings have got about mr jobbles be interfering with sir gregory that sir gregory did like to be sure when have be indiscreetly alluded to in house by one of gentleman who pas leisure hour in looking out for raw in hide of government carcass other gentleman gentleman from treasury bench have be able to give very satisfactory reply for why indeed must gentleman sit on treasury bench if be not able when so questioned to give very satisfactory reply giving satisfactory reply to ill natured question be one may say constitutional work of such gentleman who have generally well learned how to do so earned present place by asking selfsame question when seated a younger men in other part of house though answer given in instance be so eminently satisfactory a to draw down quite chorus of triumphant acclamation from official supporter of government nevertheless thing have not gone on at board quite a smoothly a might have be desirable mr jobbles be enthusiastically intent on examining whole adult male population of great britain have gone so far a to hint female competitor might at future time be made subject to measuring rule compass sir gregory however who having passed early day in office may perhaps be supposed to have have slight prejudice remaining in favour of ancient custom be not inclined to travel so quickly moreover preferred following own lead to taking other lead that mr jobbles might point out a preferable mr jobbles wanted to crush patronage at blow system of patronage must lamentably limit number of candidate among whom examination paper must be distributed longed to behold crowding around attendance a copious a mr spurgeon to see head bowed over posing question must have dictated legion must be too many for longed to be at great work energy be crushed by opposition of colleague sir gregory thought sir warwick though hardly gave firm support to sir gregory must not lend countenance to mr jobbles sir gregory thought enough must be done for present if merely provided that one admitted into service must be educated in such manner a to be fit for profession calling under sun that with slight proviso question of patronage might for present remain untouched 'do ' must have said to great officer of government 'appoint whom like in respect remain quite unfettered however be st peter to whom be confided key of elysium do send candidate please be for merely to say whether not will enter mr jobbles must have gone much farther must have have mankind for candidate have selected from whole mass most worthy of high reward so there be split at examination board be not to be healed even by very satisfactory reply given by treasury gentleman in house of common sir gregory rival be men likely to give way soon appeared manifest to power be that something must be done therefore came to light mr jobbles have found that clerical position be hardly compatible with seat at lay board retired to more congenial duty of comfortable prebendal stall at westminster that by close vicinity a be observed by newspaper usually supported government might be able to be of material use whenever advice must be required by board of commissioner sir gregory in meantime be instructed to suggest name of colleague therefore sent for alaric tudor alaric of course knew well what have be going on at board have be sir gregory confidential man through have worked out case for furnished with argument backed view have assisted whenever course have be necessary in holding mr jobbles head under pump alaric knew well on side bread be buttered must see with glance star be in ascendant perfectly understood point merit of winning horse went in to win upon sir gregory won when mr jobbles made last little speech at board retired to house in dean yard alaric felt tolerably certain that must be invited to fill vacant place be so invited 'that be l year at rate ' said to a with many word of submissive gratitude thanked patron for nomination 'that be l year so far so good now what must be next step excelsior be very nice to be commissioner sit at board at sir gregory right hand much nicer than being junior clerk at weight measure like harry norman there be nicer thing even than that there be greater men even than sir gregory richer figure than even l year ' so went to old office wrote resignation walked home meditating to what next step above must now aspire to rise 'excelsior still said to 'excelsior ' at same moment charley be leaving internal navigation a moved with unusual slowness down step bethought how might escape from fang of norah how if such might still be possible might fit for love of katie woodward excelsior such also be thought of mind did not dare to bring word to utterance be destined that thought must be interrupted by very friendly hand chapter xxviii outerman v tudor charley sat at office on saturday afternoon very meditative unlike be to do when office hour be over in first place have not shilling in world to get dinner habit be to breakfast at home at lodging with harry then to dine a best might at tavern if have not good fortune to be dining out have little dinner bill at house frequented in strand bill knew have reached culminating point must be aware be necessary that must be decreased not augmented at next commercial transaction might take place between tavern keeper be not first time by many in have be in similar plight resource in such case have be to tell truth gallantly to friend mr davis sort of viand not at unprepossessing to in hunger must always be forthcoming for at 'cat whistle ' supply be now closed to be under present circumstance to seek for dinner from fair hand of norah geraghty must be tantamount to giving up a lost for ever want of dinner however be small misfortune in comparison with others afflicted must must not keep promise to mr davis go to 'cat whistle ' that evening be question disturbed equanimity hindered from teasing mr snape in usual vivacious manner here let not be said that charley must be altogether despicable in being so weak that be not only vulgar rake in present habit fool also altogether spiritless of low disposition person who may so argue of who so argue of whom meet in real living world be ignorant of twist turn rapid change in character be brought about by outward circumstance many youth abandoned by friend to perdition on account of folly might have yet prospered have character not be set down a gone before in truth be well formed be not one calf only must be killed for returning prodigal oh father mother uncle aunt guardian elderly friend in general kill seven fatted calf if seven must unfortunately be necessary then there be third calamity charley have at moment in pocket certain document in civil still somewhat peremptory language invited to meet very celebrated learned pundit being le than one of majesty puisne judge at court in westminster to explain why declined to pay to one nathaniel outerman tailor sum of c c c document then went on to say that hesitation on charley part to accept invitation must be regarded a great contempt shown to said learned pundit must be treated accordingly now charley have not paid slightest attention to requisition from judge must conceived have be merely putting head into lion mouth to do so yet knew that such document meant something that day of grace be gone by that mr nathaniel outerman must very speedily have locked up so charley sat meditative over lock entry allowed even proposed vengeance on mr snape to be delayed say charley ' said scatterall coming over whispering to 'you must lend crown must ' charley said nothing looked on brother navvy in manner made other kind of reply quite unnecessary ' be afraid be so ' said scatterall in melancholy voice then a if by brilliance of thought have suddenly recovered spirit made little proposition `` ll tell what might do charley put watch up spout last week be silver turnip so only got fifteen shilling yours be cox savary be gold be sure 'd get l for easily perhaps l s now if will do take turnip down will let have turnip to wear if will let have ten shilling of money see 'd get clear let see how much scatterall went to work with sheet of foolscap paper endeavouring to make estimate of what amount of ready cash charley might have in pocket on completion of delicate little arrangement be d ' said charley 'you will not do then ' said dick charley merely repeated with little more emphasis speech have just before made 'oh very well ' said scatterall 'there must have be fairer bargain at least be on side for must have have watch to wear nearly money too charley still repeated same little speech be uncivil for have evidently be looked on by scatterall a unsatisfactory very well ' said that gentleman now in state of mild anger 'only saw that have fine new purse thought 'd wish to have something to put in ' charley again repeated offensive mandate did in spirit of bravado in order to maintain reputation allusion to purse made sadder than ever put hand into breast pocket felt that be near heart then fancied that again heard word will be steady wo dear charley ' at four o'clock be by mean in usual hurry to go away sat there drawing pattern on blotting paper chopping up stick of sealing wax with penknife in very disconsolate way scatterall went corkscrew went mr snape having carefully brushed hat taken down from accustomed peg old cotton umbrella also took departure fourth navvy who inhabited same room went also iron fingered hand of time struck quarter past four on somerset house clock still charley tudor lingered at office maid who came to sweep room be thoroughly amazed knew that something must be wrong just a be about to move mr oldeschole came bustling into room 'where be corkscrew ' said 'gone ' said charley 'and scatterall ' asked oldeschole 'gone sir ' said charley 'and mr snape ' said secretary be gone of course ' said charley taking revenge at last 'then mr tudor must trouble to copy paper for at once be wanted immediately for sir gregory hardlines be quite clear that mr oldeschole be very much in earnest about job that be rejoiced to find that still have one clerk to aid charley sat down did required work on other day must greatly have disliked summons now did not care much about made copy however a quickly a must then took in to mr oldeschole worthy secretary rewarded by lecture lecture however a charley well understood be intended all in kindness told how mr snape complained of how office book told against how clerk talked somerset house made story of grotesque iniquity with penitential air charley listened promised mr oldeschole promised also that bygone must be bygone wonder whether old cock must lend five pound note dare say must ' said charley to a left office abstained however from asking for returning to room took hat went downstairs a be sauntering forth through archway into strand man with decent coat very bad hat came up to `` m afraid must trouble to go with mr tudor ' said man right ' said charley 'outerman suppose be ' 'all right ' said bailiff away two walked together to sponging house in cursitor street charley have be arrested at suit of mr outerman tailor perfectly understood fact made special objection to following bailiff one case be at rate off mind must not now be will to do so ever so good keep appointment with norah geraghty perhaps be quite a well for to be arrested just at moment a be left at liberty must have come sooner later so walked on with bailiff not without feeling of consolation man have suggested to cab charley have told without slightest mauvaise honte that have not about mean of paying for cab man again suggested that perhaps have better go home get money a must find in cursitor street very desirable to have to charley replied that have money at home 'that be blue ' said man be rather

to norman made unwilling to incur further obligation so decided on sending for mr m'ruen in spite of being so poorly supplied with immediate cash be surmised from appearance clothes known rank that little outlay made in behalf must be probably repaid be therefore furnished with messenger on credit man be first to call at mr m'ruen with note then to go to charley lodging get brush razor c being first necessary of life for man naturally look when once overtaken by such misfortune a with charley be now afflicted in process of time brush razor came so did mr m'ruen 'this be very kind of ' said

very unpunctual that be impossible to do anything to assist charley however manfully resisted second attack upon devoted watch 'that be very blue very blue indeed said master of house a mr m'ruen took departure got huncles hants nothin ' of sort ' charley declared that have lot of uncle aunt grandfather grandmother perfect wealth of cousin that must send for of leading member of family to morrow

came escape in manner that have little recked of of have be asked must a little have approved mr richards landlady be not slow in learning from messenger how came to pas charley wanted article of toilet so suddenly demanded 'why see be just be quodded ' said boy mr richards be quite enough up to world have dealt with young men long enough to know what meant indeed be much surprised have practical knowledge that charley have strong propensity to pay debt be not unaccustomed to answer emissary of mr outerman other greedy tradesman who be similarly situated to mr richards charley be not in debt have therefore nothing to embitter own feeling against indeed have that fondness for lodging house keeper generally have for handsome dissipated easy tempered young man when heard that have be 'quodded ' immediately made up mind that step must be taken for release what be to do norman who be aware must 'unquod immediately if be in way be down at hampton be not expected to be at lodging for two three day after cogitation mr richards resolved that there be nothing for to go down to hampton break news to friend charley must not have be bit obliged to have known mr richards acted for best there be train down to hampton court night return train to bring home again so off started mr woodward have on same afternoon taken down katie who be still invalid norman have gone down with be to remain there for few day going up down morning evening mr woodward be sitting in drawing room linda katie be with latter lying in state on sofa a invalid young lady must do captain cuttwater be at hampton court norman be on water when fly from railway made way up to door of cottage richards ma'be ' said demure parlour maid ushering in lodging house keeper who in church going best made very decent appearance mr richards how be ' said mr woodward who knew woman very well 'pray sit down be there news from london ma'be such news such bad news mister charley ' up jumped katie from sofa stood erect upon floor stood there with mouth slightly open with eye intently fixed on mr richards with little hand firmly clenched drawing breath with hard short palpitating effort there stood said nothing 'oh mr richards what be ' said mr woodward heaven sake what be matter ma'be be be took ' said mr richards repeated mr woodward 'katie dear katie sit down child sit down ' 'oh mamma oh mamma ' said apparently unable to move certainly unable to stand 'tell mr richards what be have happened to mr tudor ' a spoke mr woodward got up passed arm around younger daughter waist linda also got up joined group ma'be ' said mr richards be took by bailiff now be in prison katie did not faint never have fainted probably did not know way clenched hand still tighter breathed harder than before repeated appeal to mother in voice of agony mamma oh mamma ' katie have very accurate conception of what arrest for debt meant knew that next to death imprisonment be severest punishment inflicted on erring mortal now heard that charley be in prison did not stop to think whether be for life for more limited period be enough for to know that terrible misfortune have come upon to who to young fancy be so bright so good so clever so excellent upon who have saved life upon whom so dearly loved 'oh mamma oh mamma ' said then in agony shut eye shuddered violently mr woodward be greatly afflicted be indeed sorry to hear such tidings of charley tudor grief be now deeper even than must not be longer blind to sort of feeling child evinced for young man must not think that passionate burst of overpowering sorrow be result of mere childish friendship must not see that katie bosom now held woman heart that heart be no longer own then mr woodward reflected of what nature of what sort be man whom have allowed to associate with darling almost a brother doe with sister whom have warmed in bosom till have found opportunity of inflicting deadly wound with terrible bitterness upbraided a sat down bade mr richards go on with tale knew that nothing must now be said must add to katie anguish mr richards story be soon told simply amounted to beister charley ' a always called have be arrested for debt at suit of tailor that have circumstance from fact of prisoner having sent for brush 'and so thought best thing be to come tell mr norman ' said mr richards concluding speech nothing must be done till norman came in linda went out with mr richards to get refreshment in dining room mr woodward sat with arm round katie neck on sofa comforting with kiss little caressing touch saying nothing katie still unconscious of passion gave way to spasmodic utterance of own grief mamma ' said ' what can be done what can do will do something mamma wo poor charley dear charley harry will do something wo wo harry go to london do something ' mr woodward did what must to quiet something must be done said must wait till harry came in then settle what be best nothing must be done till harry came in must be patient katie else will make really ill ' katie became afraid that must be sent off to bed on score of illness before harry have come thus lose advantage of hearing be step decided on so sat silent in corner of sofa feigning to be asleep pondering in mind what sort of penalty be penalty of imprisonment how dreadful how endurable how unendurable must put chain on must starve must cut off beautiful brown hair mr woodward sat silent waiting for harry return when first have watched katie extreme misery guessed secret of child heart have felt something like hard bitter anger against charley by degree feeling softened down be by mean natural to akin to usual tenderness after fault hitherto be probably more own than mr richards be sent back to town be thanked for trouble have taken told that mr norman must do in matter be necessary to be done so took departure linda returned to drawing room unfortunately captain cuttwater came in first none of mentioned charley misfortune to charley be favourite with uncle bat remark must not have be of most cheering tendency at last norman came also came a be wont through drawing room window throwing into chair began to tell girl how much have lost by not joining on river 'harry said mr woodward into dining room with for moment harry got up to follow katie linda also instantly jumped from seat to do same mr woodward looked round motioned to to stay with uncle linda obediently though reluctantly remained katie impulse be too strong for gave one imploring look at mother look mr woodward well understood then taking silence for consent crept into dining room 'harry said mr woodward a soon a dining room door be closed 'charley have be arrested then told how mr richards have be at cottage be nature of tidings have brought norman be not much surprised did feign to be so took news so coolly that katie almost hated 'did say who have arrested what be amount asked mr woodward replied that knew more than what have already told katie stood in shade with eye fixed upon cousin a yet said nothing how cruel how stony hearted must be to hear such dreadful tidings remain thus undisturbed have charley heard that norman be arrested must have be half way to london by time so at least thought katie beomething can be done for harry can there not must contrive to do something eh harry ' said mr woodward ' fear be too late to do anything to night ' said harry looking at watch last train be gone must not possibly find out before twelve 'and to morrow be sunday ' said mr woodward harry pray do something ' said katie 'pray pray pray do oh harry think of charley being in prison oh harry must do anything for ' then burst into tear caught hold of harry arm front of coat to add force to entreaty 'katie said mother ' be so foolish harry will of course do be best ' mamma say will hing why doe not go at once ' will go at once dear katie ' said ' will go now directly know whether can set free to night even to morrow a to morrow be sunday certainly will be done on monday may be sure of at rate can be done will be done without further talk upon subject took hat went way god almighty bless ' said mr woodward 'how infinitely greater be truth honesty than talent however brilliant ' spoke only to herself one even guessed what be nature of comparison thus made a soon a norman be gone katie went to bed in morning be pronounced to be too unwell to get up indeed be far from well during night only slept by short start in sleep be restless uneasy then when woke must burst out into fit of tear lie sobbing hysterically till slept again in morning mr woodward said something about charley misconduct threw into wretched state of misery from nothing must rouse till mother promised that prodigal must not be thrown over abandoned poor mr woodward be in dreadful state of doubt a to what now behoved to do felt that however anxious might be to assist charley for own sake be bounden duty to separate from child whatever merit might have in

only possible now when be too late began to perceive that have not known of what material own child be formed at sixteen gertrude linda have in reality be little more than child in manner katie have be more childish even than yet mr woodward a thought of thing felt heart faint within be resolved that cost what might charley must be banished from cottage at first word of assumed displeasure that uttered katie fell into such agony of grief that soft heart gave way found obliged to promise that sinner must be forgiven katie while be entirely unconscious of state of own feeling have thought that loved a woman love have thought of such love of together even entered mind must not have talked of a now talked have be brother must not have be le guarded in protestation of affection more open in appeal to mother that might be forgiven such be present state be doomed that eye must soon be opened that must know own sorrow on sunday afternoon norman returned to hampton with tidings that charley

claim charley with comb brush have returned to more benign custody of mr richards why did come down with ' said katie to norman who have gone up to bedroom to give good tidings norman looked at mr woodward made reply must probably prefer remaining in town at present said mr woodward 'it will be more comfortable for to do so then katie be left alone to meditate why charley must be more

norman have be gloomy have carried hostile brow angry eye at period of life two year generally doe much to quiet feeling of ill will pacify animosity norman feeling have by mean be quieted animosity pacified have loved alaric with close manly love now hated with close fear may say manly hatred alaric have a thought answered love by treachery there be that in norman heart must not allow to forgive one who have be traitor to have that kind of selfishness so common to of be so unconscious will not allow to pardon sin against own amour propre alaric might have be forgiven though have taken friend money distanced in office though have committed against offence one friend can commit against norman have be proud of love yet ashamed of proud of loving such girl a gertrude ashamed of being known to be in love at have confided love to alaric alaric have robbed of love wounded pride shame norman lacked charity must have be capable of forgiving even now looked at alaric doings through different

for from day on have learnt that be engaged to alaric have never seen still loved remembrance of in solitary walk with mr woodward must still speak of a might of one in distant clime for whose welfare be deeply interested have seen caressed baby at hampton be still dear to have alaric be called to long account must have be dearest wish to have become at future time husband of widow to feeling on norman part alaric be very indifferent existence operated a drawback on wife comfort to certain degree on own mr woodward must not banish norman from cottage even for daughter sake came by degree to be understood that tudor man wife must not go there unless be aware that norman be absent norman on other hand did absent when be understood that alaric gertrude be coming thus woodward kept up intercourse with be bore alaric thought most probable that norman must marry one of younger sister knew that family quarrel be uncomfortable injudicious when therefore became civil service commissioner be thus removed from business intercourse with norman conceived that must be wise to arrange reconciliation discussed matter with gertrude fully agreeing with undertook task of making proposal through mother did with kindness delicacy of woman desired mother to tell harry how much have valued friendship how greatly regretted loss of how anxious husband be to renew if possible former term of affection mr woodward by mean sanguine undertook commission undertook utterly failed when gertrude in disappointment spoke bitterly of norman bitterness mother sister mr woodward linda took norman part ' wish must be otherwise said mr woodward ' wish for sake be man not easily to be turned can not blame have suffered very much ' gertrude became very red mother word contained reproach against tacit unintended indeed not le keenly felt ' be not aware that mr norman have cause of just complaint ' said one unless be for sake of charity old association have wished that idea of injury must be forgiven forgotten if chooses still to indulge rancour must do so have taken to be better christian ' more word have sprung from mr woodward who in truth loved norman better for continuance of sorrow must not give up part so mother child parted two sister parted not quarrelling indeed not absolutely with angry word in tone of mind towards other widely differing from of former year mr woodward have lost none of love of parent gertrude have forgotten somewhat of reverence of child have added much to grief created by katie illness then of sudden katie became silent a well a sad ill silent sad so soft so loving in manner gentle little caress tender love ever lying in eye constant pressure of thin small hand must break mother heart katie must sit beside on sofa in drawing room for hour book taken up a excuse must be in lap must sit there gazing listlessly into vacant daylight till evening must come then when room be shaded sombre when light of fire merely served to make object indistinct must lean gently by degree upon mother bosom must coax mother arm round neck must thus creep a be into mother heart of heart then slow tear must trickle down cheek very slow one by one till must fall a telltale on mother hand darling katie ' mother must say `` m only tired mamma ' must be answer ' move mamma pray move be so comfortable then at night must put to rest close circled in linda arm must twist up little foot lie so quiet there that linda must remain motionless that might not disturb katie sleep soon warm tear must be running on bosom must know that katie be still thinking of love linda among virtue have not that of reticence mother have soon learnt from what have be said that night in bedroom about charley violation of confidence if be violation be hardly necessary to make mr woodward aware of what be passing in daughter bosom when katie ceased to ask charley might be sent for when ceased to plead for pardon to praise virtue mr woodward knew well cause of silence be not that others suspected love that have learned to suspect be not that be ashamed of loving charley that felt at once that such love must distress mother heart a sat there that night fingering silken hair have asked whether in truth man be master of heart have probed young bosom now by sudden growth became quick with woman impulse have owned to herself that did love be dearer to found than in world beside fondly a loved sister sweet to a be mother caress love be not a precious to a might be then remembered what be what be manner of life what character how different be from alaric harry norman remembered knew that love be unhappy passion must have sacrificed prisoner a have be debtor a be drunkard penniless spendthrift must not have hesitated to take for guide through life have done what woman might to guide in return must not sacrifice mother saw now why charley be not asked silently acquiesced in banishment be not yet quite seventeen not yet seventeen

put into fitting language thought god put into young heart in mind soliloquy charley vice be probably summed up in one word unsteady 'why be so unsteady why doe like wicked thing then a regarded mr woodward did make resolve that not even for love must add to unhappiness of loving tenderest mother there be bombast in katie expressed unexpressed after much consideration on matter mr woodward determined that must ask charley down to cottage in first place felt bitterly apparent ingratitude to when last have be together day after katie escape at bridge when tale have just be read have told with warmth of somewhat more than friendly affection henceforth must be more than common friend have promised love have almost promised affection care of mother now how be keeping promise have fallen into misfortune have immediately deserted over over again said to herself that first duty be to own child even with reflection must hardly reconcile to neglect of then moreover felt that be impossible that friendship mutual regard must die away suddenly without explanation attempt to bring about must not cure katie love if be done must not katie always think of charley wrong lastly be quite clear that katie have put check on own heart meeting now might be reverse of dangerous must be well that katie must use to be with now again well at rate that must see once before proposed journey to

be now late in october four month have intervened during period charley have seen none of woodward have over over again tried to convince that be own fault that have right to accuse mr woodward of ingratitude be hardly successful did feel in spite of that have be dropped because of disgrace attaching to arrest that mr woodward have put aside a being too bad to associate with daughter that be intended that henceforth must be stranger still have katie purse made sort of resolve that a long a kept that in possession a long a have that near heart must not go near norah geraghty resolution

parent of committee asserted that matter be one of such vital importance not only to whole metropolis to country at large that government be bound in first place to give large subsidy towards building bridge afterwards to pay heavy annual sum towards amount must be necessary to raise by toll mr whip vigil on other hand declared on part of government that bridge be wholly unnecessary that if be built ought to be pulled down again that not stiver must be given out of public purse with object on joined issue mr nogo prayed for committee mr vigil having duly consulted higher brother in government conceded point may easily be conceived how high be now hope of undy scott alaric tudor be not at necessary for that bridge must ever be built that probably be out of question very likely neither of regarded a possibility if committee of house of common must be got to say that ought to be built might safely calculate on selling out at large profit who be to sit on committee be now

condescended to show badger indeed of whom country might well be proud in scramble of fight little cur have be permitted to run away with little bone in way mr nogo member for mile end have be allowed to carry motion for committee to inquire a to expediency of government advancing quarter of million towards completion of momentous national undertaking building of bridge from limehouse to rotherhithe very much have be said about bridge till men living out of light of parliamentary life nine hundred ninety nine men be out of thousand in queen dominion have begun to think that be great want of age men living in light supporter of bridge a well a enemy knew very well that erection be quite unneeded must in probability never be made then firm of block pile cofferdam who held vast quantity of bridge share who be to be contractor for building have powerful influence in borough of limehouse where must mr nogo be if did not cultivate friendship of such men a block pile cofferdam so mr nogo who acted with mr nogo men be who have little job of own to do in doing of mr nogo occasionally assisted undy scott for instance such like men say have talked much about bridge gentleman on treasury bench who must have afforded to show up folly of scheme to put mr nogo down at once have be alone felt under necessity of temporizing a to giving penny of public money for purpose that knew be out of question that mr nogo never expected that knew mr nogo never expected a mr nogo number be so respectable be necessary to oppose in respectable parliamentary steady manner have fifteen with have be quite alone mr vigil must have sneered off have have four to back old badger must have laughed out of face with brace of grin fifteen mr whip vigil thought that committee must be most safe so must outer world be brought to confess that interest of limehouse poplar rotherhithe deptford have not be overlooked by careful government of whom be committee to be made up be now question to mr nogo in hour of temporary greatness be truly momentous of course be to be chairman to appertained duty of naming other member of naming indeed so much must undoubtedly do by strength of own privilege of what use to name string of men to whom mr vigil must not consent mr nogo did do so must have to divide on name be beaten at division there must be triumph in mr nogo fully understood that triumph must be achieved if be destined to triumph by astute skill in selection not by open choice of friend must obtain balance on side one in scale must lean so slightly to side that mr vigil eye might be deceived who knew mr vigil best be inclined to surmise such arrangement be somewhat beyond mr nogo political capacity there be proverb go to show that certain little lively animal may be shaved if be caught napping then difficulty of so catching be extreme mr nogo at head of list put mr vigil of course be necessity to must that must have dispensed with then named sundry supporter of government sundry member also of opposition filled up list with certain others who must not be regarded a sure supporter of one side other with whom for certain reason thought might in particular case be safe undy scott be of course not among number a mr nogo must only have damaged cause by naming man known to have pecuniary interest in concern member for mile end be doubtless sharp mr vigil be sharper object be in fact merely to do duty to country by preventing profuse useless expenditure of money anxiety be perfectly honest one to save exchequer namely circumstance of case required that must fight battle according to tactic of house well understood how to do so when list be read objected to two three name only to two three be not of staunch enemy of government did propose in place name of staunch supporter suggested certain gentleman who from acquaintance with bridge toll river c must a said be probably of use also be sure of men a succeeded with two of be also pretty sure of committee then committee met lot of witness be in attendance chairman opened case proceeded to prove by evidence of sundry most respectable men connected with limehouse with portion of surrey kent lying immediately opposite to that most intense desire for friendly commercial intercourse be felt that though absolutely close to other district be so divided by adverse circumstance circumstance be monstrous considering advance of science in nineteenth century that dearest friend be constrained to perpetual banishment from other that men of kent be utterly unable to do trade at limehouse limehousians equally unable to carry on traffic in surrey be wonderful that narrow river must be so effective for injury one gentleman from poplar proved that having given daughter in marriage to man of deptford two year since have not yet be able to see since day house by crow flight be seven furlong from own a kept horse must not get to residence without four hour walk for felt to be too old be however able to visit married daughter at reading be back to tea witness declared that life be made miserable by being thus debarred from child wiped eye with pocket handkerchief piteously sitting there in front of committee in answer to mr vigil admitted that there might be ferry stated that did not know having have from childhood aversion to water have not inquired be aware that rash people have gone through tunnel for did not think tunnel safe mode of transit gentleman belonging to rotherhithe who be obliged to be almost daily at blackwall maintained two horse for express purpose of going backwards forward round by london bridge cost l per annum bridge a now proposed gentleman declared that regarded a embryo monument of national glory must save l per annum then proceeded to make little speech about spirit of age influence of routine described a gloomy gnome oratory be cruelly cut short by mr vigil who demanded of whether ever used river steamer witness shuddered fearfully a assured committee that never did referred to cricket whose boiler burst in year besides have said thing to carry with witness told how unsafe be transit of heavy good by barge from one side of river to have have cargo of marine store must go to sea before time strong ebb of tide joined to river current have positively carried barge away course have not be stopped till have drifted on shore at purfleet acknowledged that something have transpired of bargeman being drunk have knowledge that such have be case other cargo of own have be carried away have heard that such be often case thought that bridge be imperatively demanded must toll pay felt sure that must why then must not bridge be built a commercial speculation without government aid thought that in such case fostering government be bound to come forward show way have few share in bridge have paid up l share be now worth s d have be worth nothing before committee have be ordered to sit declined to give opinion a to what share must be worth if money be granted lady at limehouse proved that if there be bridge must save s year by buying tea sugar at rotherhithe so singular be usage of trade that lady of rotherhithe must benefit husband equally return compliment by consuming bread of limehouse shore of kent be pining for beef of opposite bank only too anxious to give in return surplus stock of own poultry 'let bridge be opened a be asserted by one animated vendor of rope 'and poplar must soon rival pimlico perhaps might not be desirable in eye of men who lived in purlieu of court who be desirous to build new bridge except over ornamental water in st james park ' upon uttering rope vendor looked at mr vigil a though expected to sink at once under table mr block of great firm of block pile cofferdam then came forward declared that large sum of money be necessary before great national undertaking must be begun in spirit worthy of nineteenth century be intended to commence approach on side of river quarter of mile from first abutment of bridge in order to acquire necessary altitude without steep ascent then described what glorious bridge bridge must be how must eclipse bridge have ever be built how fleet of nation must ride under how many hundred thousand square foot of wrought iron must be consumed in construction how many ton of portland stone in abutment parapet supporting wall how much timber must be buried twenty fathom deep in mud of river how many mile of paving stone must be laid down mr block went on with astonishing figure till committee be bewildered even mr vigil though well used to calculation must hardly raise mind to dimension of proposed undertaking engineer followed showed how easily great work must be accomplished there be difficulty literally none patronage of crown be be required engineer be asked whether by word patronage meant money after little laughing few counter question admitted that in estimation patronage money did mean same thing such be case made out by promoter of bridge chairman party be very sanguine of success conceived that mr block figure have completely cowed antagonist mr vigil then took case in hand brought forward witness now appeared that intercourse between people living on side of river be immense ever on increase limehouse must seem have nothing to do to go to deptford that deptford consumed time in returning visit little child be sent across continually on most trifling errand going coming for one halfpenny immense income be made by owner of ferry two adjacent street in london have more to do with other than have lane of rotherhithe lane of limehouse westminster lambeth be further apart le connected by friendly intercourse frequenter of ferry be found to outnumber passenger over waterloo bridge by ten to one indeed so lamentable proposition a of building bridge across river have never before be mooted by public men conversant with such matter gave a opinion that amount of toll must reasonably be expected must pay one per cent on money be proposed to expend sum however stated must not more than cover full cost of bridge traffic must be prohibited by heavy charge must be necessary probability must be that ferry must still continue to be ordinary mode of crossing river gentleman accustomed to use strong figure of speech declared that if bridge be built wisest course must be to sow surface with grass let out for grazing witness be taken specially in hand by mr nogo targed very tightly mr vigil have contrived to prove out of mouth of inimical witness very reverse of have be summoned thither to assert secret of ferry have be first brought to light by gentleman who must not visit daughter at deptford so on triumph have evidently be very pleasant to mr vigil mr nogo thought that might judiciously take leaf out of treasury book actuated by ambition with assistance of friend m'carthy desmond put le than question to gentleman who suggested grazing in order to induce to say that if there be bridge men must probably walk over must not bring to own to single passenger unless must abandon toll most that must get from be that perhaps old woman with more money than wit might go over on sunday afternoon if did not believe old woman existed in part of world who have more money than wit witness be kept in chair for three day during mr vigil be nearly driven wild by loss of valuable time did not complain must have complained though might have absented have witness be kept in chair three week instead of three day expense of committee including witness shorthand writer printing be about l day never occurred to one of number to get up declare with indignation that waste of money time on so palpably absurd scheme be degrading to demand immediate close of labour went smoothly to end mr nogo walked off from task with approving conscience of patriotic legislator at close member met to prepare report be then first week in august be naturally in hurry to finish work be now duty to decide on merit of what have heard to form judgement a to veracity of witness declare on behalf of country represented whether bridge must be built at expense of nation with decision be ready enough not one of dreamed of being influenced by anything have be said before world be be in way concerned in matter knew that witness for bridge be anxious to have built that witness against bridge be anxious to prevent building must be worst of ignorance ignorance of usage of world live in to suppose that member of parliament must be influenced by such manoeuvre besides be not mind of man fully known before committee met various proposition be made by member among various amendment moved balance of different party have be nearly preserved decided victory be not to be expected on side at last resolution to committee came be 'that committee be not prepared under existing circumstance to recommend grant of public money for purpose of erecting bridge at limehouse that committee consider that matter be still open to consideration must further evidence be adduced mr vigil be perfectly satisfied did not wish to acerbate member for mile end be quite willing to give lift towards keeping seat for borough if able to do so without cost to public exchequer at limehouse report of committee be declared by certain person to be a good a decision in favour be only postponing matter for session mr vigil knew that have carried point world soon agreed with at least did work successfully considering circumstance of position did with credit to huge blue volume be then published containing among other thing mr nogo question answer so limehouse rotherhithe bridge dropped into oblivion be forgotten chapter xxxiii to stand not to stand sir gregory hardlines have be somewhat startled by alaric announcement of parliamentary intention not unnaturally occurred to great man must mr tudor succeed at strathbogy must also succeed in being allowed to hold office seat together tudor must very soon become first fiddle at civil service examination board be view of matter be by mean agreeable to sir gregory not for have devoted time energy best power of mind to office of be at present chief not for have taken by hand young clerk brought forward pushed up seated in high place to have kept mr jobbles must have be better than at rate must not have aspired to parliamentary honour when sir gregory came to look into hardly knew whether bugbear with have tried to frighten tudor be good serviceable bugbear such a must stand strain of such man logic reason be there really reason why one of commissioner must not sit in parliament must doing so be subversive of constitution must minister of day object to additional certain vote last point of view be one in did not at delight sir gregory to look at subject in question determined that must not speak on matter to chancellor of exchequer to of government wig who might be considered to be bigger wig than alaric thought over matter coolly also looked at till bugbear shrank into utter insignificance till became more than form of shred patch put up to frighten bird out of cherry orchard why must constitution be wounded by presence of one more commissioner in parliament why must not do public duty hold seat at same time a be done by so many others must have to go out if ministry went out be difficulty bugbear more substantial perhaps than others be prepared to meet even that be poor man profession be that of civil service ambition be to sit in parliament must see whether must not combine poverty with profession with ambition also sir gregory resolved in fear that must not speak to chancellor of exchequer on matter alaric on other hand in audacity resolved that must do so be thus that sir gregory regarded matter have done for man ' said to beee how have warmed in bosom how have lifted to fortune renown how have heaped benefit on head if gratitude in world be possible that man must be grateful to if one man can ever have interest at heart that man must have heartfelt anxiety a to interest yet how be have placed in chair next to own now be desirous of sitting above ' 't be thus sir gregory communed with be soliloquy be very different listener who must have overheard must hardly have thought that same question be being discussed by two have got so high ' said alaric own labour by own skill tact why must stop here have left earliest colleague far behind have distanced who be competitor in walk of life why must not still go on distance others also why stop when be only second third be very natural that sir gregory must wish to keep out of parliament can not in least blame let fight a best may for doe not wish higher career do sir gregory will now do that can to impede view because be antagonistic to own very well must only work harder to overcome objection there be word in of gratitude there be thought in alaric mind that behoved to be grateful to sir gregory be for own sake not for pupil that sir gregory have brought pupil forward grateful indeed in public life when be there time for gratitude who ever think of other interest than own such be alaric theory of life not le must have expected gratitude from whom might serve such also very probably be sir gregory theory when thought of who have helped instead of whom have helped so met discussed alaric little proposition saw yesterday ' said sir gregory have be thinking much of what be saying to of wish to go into parliament ' be very much obliged to ' said alaric ' need hardly tell tudor how anxious be to further advancement greatly value ability diligence have shown that be anxious to make serviceable to public be fully aware that owe great deal sir gregory 'oh mean that be nothing be not thinking of only want to understand be truly anxious to see take line in public matter may make service most valuable to public may redound most to own advantage have thought of what said to with most mature deliberation be persuaded that will best do duty to to service by recommending to abandon altogether idea of going into parliament ' sir gregory said in weightiest manner endeavoured to assume of authority with have cowed young tudor at weight measure a finished speech assumed profound look ought to have be very convincing time be gone by with alaric when such trick of legerdemain be convincing to grave brow compressed lip fixed eye have longer much effect upon have point to gain be thinking of not of sir gregory grimace will not see chancellor of exchequer on subject 'no ' said sir gregory must be useless for to do so must not advocate such scheme feeling certain that must be injurious to to service must not desire to see chancellor with view of opposing wish ' be much obliged to for at rate ' said alaric 'but do hope that will not carry plan farther when tell a do with utmost sincerity feel certain that attempt to seat in parliament can only lead to ruin of prospect a civil servant prospect be brighter now than of other young man in service can not think that must hesitate before take step will in opinion render resignation necessary will be sorry to resign sir gregory a have such true pleasure in serving with ' 'and presume salary of l year be not unacceptable ' said sir gregory with very faintest of smile mean said alaric ' be poor man depending altogether on own exertion for income can not afford to throw away chance ' 'then take word for must give up idea of parliament ' said sir gregory who thought that have carried point 'but call seat in parliament chance ' said alaric best chance that man circumstanced a be can possibly have have offer of seat sir gregory ca afford to throw away ' be duty to tell a head of office that will be duty to resign before offer a candidate ' 'that mean be present opinion sir gregory ' 'yes mr tudor be opinion opinion will be forced to express to chancellor of exchequer if persist in infatuation alaric looked very grave not whit angry be sorry for sir gregory very sorry have hoped to have have countenance ' must give mr tudor if must consistently with duty a public servant a can not be sure will not ask for ' how fidus neverbend must have admired chief commissioner must have seen heard at moment 'but ' continued relaxing for while muscle of face ' hope do hope will think better of be to gain come tudor think of way what be to gain with wife young family coming up about heel what be to gain by going into parliament be what ask be to gain ' be delightful to see how pleasantly practical sir gregory must become when chose to dismount from high horse 'it be considered high position in country of member of parliament ' said alaric ' man in gaining be generally supposed to have gained something ' 'true quite true be desirable position for rich man rich man eldest son even for poor man if by getting into parliament can put in way of improving income dear tudor be in none of position abandon idea dear tudor pray abandon if not for own sake at rate do so for of wife child ' sir gregory might a well have whistled not word that said have slightest effect on alaric how be possible that word must have effect seeing that alaric be convinced that sir gregory be pleading for own advantage not for of listener alaric did listen received that sir gregory said with most profound attention schooled face into look of most polite deference then with most cruel tone informed sir gregory that mind be quite made up that did intend to submit to elector of strathbogy a to what say about seat at board sir gregory may probably be right perhaps will be a well that must see chancellor of exchequer ' 'who will to cupar maun to cupar ' said sir gregory can only say mr tudor be very sorry for very sorry for wife very sorry very sorry indeed 'and who will to strathbogy maun to strathbogy ' said alaric laughing 'there be certainly air of truth about proverb a applied to myself just at present fact be whether for good for bad maun to strathbogy be present destiny fact have wife child doe make step most momentous one sir gregory must never forgive be to throw away such opportunity 'then have nothing more to say mr tudor 'of course will try to save place ' continued alaric look upon that a quite impossible ' said sir gregory can do harm at rate to see chancellor of exchequer if tell that seat in parliament seat at board be incompatible that a one of civil service commissioner be not free to stand for borough will in case sir gregory put resignation in hand before publish address so parted determined to do that in lay to thwart wish of other alaric be not in least influenced by anything sir gregory have said to have made up mind be determined to be turned from by argument that colleague must use nevertheless must not be meditative a walking home across park thought of wife child be true that have second trade be stock jobber a well a civil service commissioner already perceived how very difficult be to realize income to must trust from second precarious pursuit have also lived in style considerably beyond official income must have enabled to assume have on whole thought done very well yet must be dreadful thing to have to trust to so precarious livelihood have realized nothing have not yet be able to pay back money have so fraudulently taken to acquit of debt now lay daily heavier heavier on soul felt that must repay not only that undy share also before must again pas happy day quiet night plan of throwing up l year must badly assist in getting rid of incubus still that watchword of goaded on 'excelsior ' still said to 'excelsior ' if halted now now when ball be at foot might never have chance very early in life before beard be on chin before must style man according to law of country have determined within that seat in parliament be only fitting ambition for englishman be now within reach must be such dastard a to draw back hand be deterred from taking by old woman tale of prudence self interested lecture of sir gregory hardlines ' there be not much that must be so styled in debt of to m madame jaquetanape if must only pay off felt that must brave world without fear come what come might must sell out do so bridge committee be sitting share be already worth more than have paid for mr block have just given evidence commercial

fortnight of considerable excitement during sir gregory did not smile at other then saw chancellor of exchequer gentleman promised to speak to prime minister feeling unable to answer question put to definitely out of own head then fortnight passed on at end of time chancellor of exchequer sent for alaric have second interview 'well mr tudor ' said great man be matter of very considerable importance one on be not even yet prepared to give positive answer ' be very good news for alaric sir gregory have spoken of matter a one on there must be possible doubt have asserted that british lion must no longer sleep peaceably in lair if such violence be put on constitution a meditated by young commissioner be quite clear that chancellor of exchequer prime minister also looked at in very different light doubted alaric be well aware that doubt be a good a certainty to truth be that prime minister have said to chancellor of exchequer in half serious half jocular way that did see why must reject vote when offered to by member of civil service man must of course do work must be found that office work seat in parliament interfered with other why must take consequence if made row about in house complained why in case also mr tudor must take consequence then enough having be said on matter conversation dropped ' be not prepared to give positive answer ' said chancellor of exchequer who of course did not choose to commit alaric assured great man that be not so unreasonable a to expect positive answer positive answer a well knew be not often forthcoming among official men official men a have already learnt prefer to do business by answer be not positive have become adverse to positive answer since have become commissioner be quite prepared to dispense with in parliamentary career hoped that be now about to commence much however be quite clear that might offer a candidate to elector of strathbogy without resigning that sir gregory hostile remonstrance on subject must choose to make one must not be received a absolute law by greater power accordingly a alaric be elated sir gregory be depressed have risen high now young tyro whom have fostered be about to climb above head o ingratitude of men alaric however showed triumph be more submissive more gracious than ever to chief be only to that muttered 'excelsior chapter xxxiv westminster hall

might at rate bear must be well for if be put paper down with affected air of easy composure walked home through glaring gas light still trying to think still trying in vain to come to definite resolve then on following morning went off to call on mr val have a yet told gertrude nothing when asked what made start so early merely replied that have business to do on road a went have considerable doubt whether must be better for to break word to mr val not go near at in such event might be sure that must at once go to work do worst nevertheless must gain day probably two one two day might do that required whereas must not see mr val without giving explanation if false must be discovered to be false if true must be self condemnatory again however failed to decide at last knocked at mr val door merely because found there be shown up into drawing room found of course mr val seated on sofa also found be not at of course captain val on chair on one side of table m

have be invested captain val wiped moustache with middle finger of right hand by way of saying that quite assented to wife proposition victoire remarked that beadame be leetle anxious just leetle anxious not that anything must be wrong with m tudere because be one excellent mamma thought knew mr scott ' said alaric 'that daughter money be in fund 'then may understand clearly that none of amount so invested have be sold out otherwise appropriated by ' said mr val 'will allow to inquire what have given rise to question just at present moment asked alaric 'yes certainly said mr val 'rumours have reached husband rumour be happy to say believe that daughter money have be used for purpose of speculation whereupon captain val again wiped upper lip did not find necessary to speak beay venture to ask captain scott from what source such rumour have reached ' 'ah have what source d lie very likely d lie dare say people do talk eh know ' so much eloquent embryo member for strathbogy vouchsafed therefore mr tudor must be surprised that must ask question 'it be one simple simple question said victoire 'and if m tudere will say that be right for will be satisfied ' amiable victoire to tell truth be still quite satisfied to leave wife income in alaric hand must not have be at satisfied to remove to hand of respected step papa in law even admired mamma in law undertook trust ' said alaric 'which did with considerable hesitation certainly did not expect to be subjected to such cross examination a consider such question a insult therefore will refuse to

' said sir gregory to in course of day think have ' said alaric 'considering thing believe will be best for to do so ' doubt of ' said sir gregory 'not doubt of dear fellow then sir gregory began to evince by cordiality of official confidence that have fully taken alaric back into good grace be nothing to that strathbogy have given up alaric instead of alaric giving up strathbogy be sufficiently pleased at knowing that danger of being supplanted by own junior be over then alaric again went into weary city again made inquiry about share again returned to office thence to home on return to office found lying on table note in undy handwriting not signed in be informed that thing must yet be well if required share must be forthcoming on following day crumpled note tight in hand be about to fling among waste paper in moment thought better of smoothing paper straight folded laid carefully on desk day on visit into city have found that bridge share have fallen to le than value of

illness of norman elder brother life of brother have be very different in course from harry have be dissipated at college in riotous living have since be stained with debauchery during career of early manhood in consequence have be that health have be broken down be now tottering to early grave cuthbert norman be found to be so ill when day first named for linda marriage approached that have be thought absolutely necessary to postpone ceremony what amount of consolation mr woodward might have received from knowledge that daughter by young man decease must become mr norman of normansgrove need not inquire such consolation if existed at did not tend to dispel feeling of sombre disappointment such delay be sure to produce heir however rallied day early in august be fixed while be still invalid a such puzzled experience of very experienced medical gentleman who have best aristocratic practice in neighbourhood of hampton court london physician agreed that lung be not affected yet must not get well colour must not come to cheek flesh must not return to arm spirit of olden day shine forth in eye did not keep bed confine to room went about house with slow noiseless gentle tread so unlike step of katie whom once knew that be mystery to experienced medical gentleman be mystery to mother mr woodward well knew why child be no longer rosy plump debonnaire a watched katie move about so softly a saw constant attempt to smile whenever mother eye be on that mother heart almost gave way almost brought to own that must rather see darling wife of idle ruined spendthrift than watch thus drifting away to early grave day be by mean happy day for mr woodward when july day be fixed for linda marriage certain invitation be sent out to bid family friend to wedding call be not so numerous a have be when gertrude became bride sir gregory be to come down from town gallant speech maker from london club be to be gathered there to wake echo of opposite shore with matrimonial wit mr woodward must not bear that daughter must be married altogether a be in dark for many consideration guest be to be restricted in number mirth be to be restrained quiet when list be made out katie saw saw that charley name be not there beamma said touching mother arm in sweet winning way beay not charley come to linda wedding know how fond harry be of must not harry wish that must be here ' mr woodward eye immediately filled with tear looked at daughter not knowing how to answer have never spoken to katie of love word have ever passed between on subject be now always nearest to heart of mr woodward have much in character a mother be excellent nay perfect must not bring to question own child a to inward secret of bosom knew not at once how to answer katie question so looked up at with wistful eye laden with tear may do so mamma ' said katie katie be already braver woman than mother ' think harry must like poor charley will feel hurt at being left out may do mamma if like will not do harm mr woodward quite understood nature of promise conveyed in daughter assurance replied that charley must be asked be asked promised of course to come when wedding be postponed when other guest be put off also be informed that attendance at hampton be not immediately required so still remained stranger to cottage then after while day be named guest charley with be again invited norman be again assured that must be made happy ala hope be again delusive news arrived at surbiton cottage made indispensable that marriage must be again postponed news worse than have ever yet be received there news stunned made clear to that year be time for marrying alaric have be arrested alaric own gertrude own husband son in law brother in law proud high successful towering man of world alaric have be arrested be to be tried for embezzling money of ward fatal tidings be brought to hampton by harry norman how be received must now endeavour to tell that must be tedious might describe amazement with news be received at weight measure though great men at weight be jealous of alaric be not le proud of have watched rise with certain amount of displeasure yet have inconsiderable gratification in boasting that two of magi two working magi of civil service have be produced by own establishment when therefore tidings reached that tudor have be summoned in friendly way to bow street that have there passed whole morning that inquiry have ended in temporary suspension from official duty in having to provide two bailsmen for l a security that must on certain day be forthcoming to stand trial at old bailey for defrauding ward when say tidings be carried from room to room at weight measure feeling of surprise be equalled by of shame disappointment one knew who brought news to weight measure one ever doe know how such tidings fly one of junior clerk have heard from messenger to whom have be told downstairs then messenger who have be across to treasury chamber with immediate report a to projected change in size of authorized butter firkin heard same thing so news by degree be confirmed be not sufficient for norman a soon a rumour reached went off to bow street there learnt actual truth a have be above stated alaric be then there magistrate have decided on requiring bail have in fact be committed must be dreadful that woodward must first hear from lip of stranger reflection induced norman at once to go to hampton be dreadful also to find burdened with task of first telling such tidings when found knocking at cottage door be still doubtful how might best go through work have before found that have partial reprieve then be so partial that must have be much better for to have have such reprieve at mr woodward be at sunbury with linda one be at home katie what be to do be to tell katie be to pretend that be right that special business have brought unexpectedly to hampton 'oh harry linda will be so unhappy ' said katie a soon a saw 'they have gone to dine at sunbury

ill ' said norman 'but be in trouble came down a thought mother must be told ' so much said must say more in probably took most unwise course be open to might have held tongue altogether let katie believe that love alone have brought down a have done so often before might have told feeling sure that must be told before long did left in suspense consequence be that before mother return be very ill be past eleven before fly be heard in linda mother returned home katie have then gone upstairs not to bed have seated in armchair in mother dressing room sitting there waited till must be told by mother what have occurred when sound of wheel caught ear came to door of room held in hand that might learn what passed heard linda sudden affectionate greeting heard mr woodward expression of gratified surprise then heard also norman solemn tone by a be too clear joy gratification be at once suppressed then heard dining room door close knew that be telling tale to linda mother o misery of next hour for hour remained there talking katie knew nothing of what be talking knew only that norman have brought unhappiness to dozen different idea passed across mind first thought that alaric be dismissed then that be dead be not possible that harry have named alaric name to deceive might not misfortune whatever be be with charley might not be dead oh better so than other knew said a much to herself over over again did not le feel that death must involve own also at last dining room door opened heard mother step on stair heart beat so that must hardly support did not get up sat quite quiet waiting for tidings knew that must now hear mother face when entered room nearly drove to despair mr woodward have be cry bitterly violently convulsively cry when one have reached age of forty trace of such tear be not easily effaced even from woman cheek beamma mamma what be pray pray tell oh mamma what be ' said katie jumping up rushing into mother arm 'oh katie ' said mr woodward 'why be not in bed oh darling wish be in bed do so wish be in bed child child seating in nearest chair mr woodward again gave up to uncontrolled weeping then linda came up with copious tear still streaming down face made effort to control at age tear be easiest resource in time of grief norman have kept back moment to whisper one word of love then followed mother into room katie be now kneeling at mother foot said with more quietness than of others be able to assume have happened what make mamma so unhappy have anything happened to alaric ' linda be in state to tell anything 'do tell mamma ' said katie 'do tell at once have anything anything happened to to charley ' be worse than that thousand time worse than ' said mr woodward who in agony of own grief became for instant ungenerous katie blood rushed back to heart for moment own hand relaxed hold have on that of mother have never spoken of love for mother sake have be silent for mother sake have determined to suffer be silent now ever well must bear also be for moment relaxed hold then again tightened finger round mother hand held in firmer grasp 'it be alaric then said 'god forgive ' said mr woodward speaking through sob forgive be brokenhearted woman say know not what katie darling best of darling will forgive ' 'oh mamma ' said katie kissing mother hand arm very hem of garment mamma speak so wish knew what sorrow be so that might share with may not be told mamma be about alaric 'yes katie alaric be in trouble ' 'what trouble be ill ' be not ill be about money ' be arrested asked katie thinking of charley misfortune 'must not harry get out harry be so good must do anything even for alaric when be in trouble ' 'he will do everything for that can ' said linda through tear have not be arrested ' said mr woodward 'he be still at home be in trouble about miss golightly money be to be tried ' 'tried said katie 'tried like criminal katie might well express a horrified yes have to be tried like criminal tried a pickpocket housebreaker shoplifter be tried for somewhat similar offence with difference however that pickpocket housebreaker shoplifter be seldom educated men be in general led on to crime by want be to be tried for offence of making away with of miss golightly money for own purpose be explained to katie with more le perspicuity then gertrude mother sister lifted up voice together wept might be true be acquitted must none of believe to be guilty though agreed that have probably be imprudent then public shame of trial disgrace must follow accusation what downfall be here 'oh gertrude oh gertrude sobbed mr woodward indeed at time did not fare well with gertrude be very late before mr woodward daughter went to bed that night then katie though did not specially complain be very ill have lately received more than one wound be still unhealed now additional blow though apparently bore better than others altogether upset when morning came complained of headache be many day after before left bed mr woodward be up early indeed must hardly be said to have be in bed at for though have lain down for hour two have not slept early in morning knocked at harry door begged to come out to be not long in obeying summons soon joined in little breakfast parlour 'harry said 'you must go see alaric harry brow grew black on previous evening have spoken of alaric without bitterness nay almost with affection of gertrude have spoken with truest brotherly love have assured mr woodward that must do be in power for that must spare exertion purse have truer idea than have of what might probably be fact of case be prepared by mean at disposal to help sister in law if such aid must help have not thought of seeing alaric ' think must do good said 'yes harry will will do greatest good whom else can get to see who else can find out let know what really be required of ought to do must do must not understand must never trust sufficiently to tell truth 'we will make charley go to will tell everything to charley if will to anyone ' 'we can not trust charley be so thoughtless so imprudent besides harry can not tell everything to charley a can to if there be deficiency in woman fortune of course must be made good in case must raise money must not arrange with charley ' 'there can not think be very much wanting ' said norman who have hardly yet realized idea alaric have actually used ward money for own purpose have probably made bad investment trusted person that must not have trusted small property be in fund can get amount at moment notice think there will be necessity to raise more money than at rate happens must not touch own income think of katie ' harry dear good generous harry be so good so generous harry need not talk of now will see though wo ' 'it will do good ' said harry 'we have mutual trust in other be unforgiving harry now that requires forgiveness ' doe require forgiveness mr woodward if will turn out that have be guilty god know will forgive trust may not

forgiveness in such assistance there be generosity in for be ready to part with money there be kindness of heart for be anxious to do good to fellow creature there be with pride revenge alaric have out topped in everything be sweet to pride that hand must be one to raise from sudden fall man who have soared so high above alaric have injured what revenge be so perfect a to repay gross injury by great benefit be not thus that heap coal of fire on enemy head not that norman indulged in thought such a not that resolved thus to gratify pride thus to indulge revenge be unconscious of own sin be not le sinner ' said ' will not see will do good mr woodward found that be useless to try to bend that indeed knew from long experience be then settled that must go up to gertrude that morning travelling up to town together with norman that when have learned from daughter from alaric if alaric must talk to about concern what be really truth of matter must come to norman office tell what must be necessary for to do then marriage be again put off in be great misery a young lady who have just be married who may now be about to be married will surely own word 'put off ' be easily written

chaffanbrass be one of order of barrister by mean yet extinct of whom may be said that peculiarity be somewhat le often seen than be when mr chaffanbrass be in prime confined practice almost entirely to one class of work defence namely of culprit arraigned for heavy crime in be if not unrivalled at least unequalled rival have who thick a skin of such men may be presumed to be not unfrequently writhed beneath lash tongue must inflict to perfection have carried skill power of fence so certain be in attack so invulnerable when attacked that few men cared to come within reach of forensic flail to old stager who be generally opposed to gentleman who conducted prosecution on part of crown customarily spent time skill in trying to hang marauder on public safety whom be special business of mr chaffanbrass to preserve unhung to be if not civil at least forbearing when barrister who be comparatively stranger to ventured to oppose there be measure to impudent sarcasm offensive sneer however who most dreaded mr chaffanbrass who have most occasion to do so be witness rival lawyer must find protection on bench when power of endurance be tried too far witness in court of law have protection come there unfeed without hope of guerdon to give such assistance to state in repressing crime assisting justice a knowledge in particular case may enable to afford justice in order to ascertain whether testimony be true find necessary to subject to torture one must naturally imagine that undisturbed thread of clear evidence must be best obtained from man whose position be made easy whose mind be not harassed be not fact to turn witness to good account must be badgered way till be nearly mad must be made laughingstock for court very truth must be turned into falsehood so that may be falsely shamed must be accused of manner of villany threatened with manner of punishment must be made to feel that have friend near that world be against must be confounded till forget right hand from left till mind be turned into chaos heart into water then let give evidence what will fall from lip when in wretched collapse must be of special value for best talent of practised forensic hero be

question in softest voice glaring out of wicked old eye a did so at around then when have mouse well in hand out must come envenomed claw wretched animal must feel fatal wound in tenderest part mankind in general take pleasure in cruelty though who be civilized abstain from on principle on whole mr chaffanbrass be popular at old bailey men congregate to hear turn witness inside out chuckle with inward pleasure at success of cruelty mr chaffanbrass know like actor who be kept up to high mark by necessity of maintaining character never allows to grow dull over work therefore mr chaffanbrass bully when be quite unnecessary that must bully be labour of love though be now old stiff in joint though ease must be dear to though like gladiator satiated with blood must a regard be so pleased to sheathe sword yet never spare never spare never spare victim a lawyer in broad high sense of word may be presumed that mr chaffanbrass know little nothing have indeed occasion for such knowledge business be to perplex witness bamboozle jury in doing that be generally successful seldom care for carrying judge with such tactic indeed a be not likely to tell upon judge love be that judge must charge against jury give verdict in favour when achieves that feel that have earned money let others young lad spooneys of profession undertake milk water work of defending injured

in whose company may be allowed to sit in old coat old slipper delight also in book in daughter music in three four live pet dog bird squirrel whom morning night feed with own hand be charitable too subscribes largely to hospital founded for relief of suffering poor such be mr chaffanbrass who have be selected by astute mr gitemthruet to act a leading counsel on behalf of alaric if human wisdom must effect escape of client in such jeopardy wisdom of mr chaffanbrass must be likely to do in truth evidence be so strong against that even newgate hero almost feared result will not try patience of anyone by stating in detail circumstance of trial in doing so must only copy at rate might copy proceeding at of modern cause celebres with who love such subject be familiar why must force such matter on who love usual opening speech be made by chief man on prosecuting side who in usual manner declared 'that only object be justice that heart bled within to see man of such acknowledged public utility a mr tudor in position that sincerely hoped that jury might find possible to acquit that ' then went into 'but ' with so much venom that be clearly discernible to that in spite of protestation

figure having acknowledged be driven about until admitted that be very possible that entry made in bank book in course of year be false 'and such a ' said mr chaffanbrass dare to come forward to give evidence on commercial affair go down sir hide ignominy ' wretch convinced that be ruined for ever slunk out of court be ashamed to show at place of business for next three day there be ten twelve witness much of same sort who proved among that sum of twenty thousand pound have be placed at alaric disposal now ala twenty thousand pound be not forthcoming seemed to be very simple case to alaric own understanding seemed impossible that counsel must do anything for a impaled victim shrank with agonized terror from torture mr gitemthruet must turn round to alaric assure that be going on well quite a well a have expected mr chaffanbrass be really exerting when mr chaffanbrass did really exert rarely failed so long day faded away in hot sweltering court lordship at about seven o'clock declared intention of adjourning of course cause celebre such a be not going to decide in one day alaric guilt be clear a daylight to concerned man who have risen to be civil service commissioner to be entrusted with guardianship of twenty thousand pound be not to be treated like butcher who have merely smothered wife in ordinary way housebreaker who have followed professional career to natural end more than be due to rank station of man to very respectable retaining fee with mr gitemthruet have found enabled to secure venom of mr chaffanbrass so jury retired to regale en masse at neighbouring coffee house alaric be again permitted to be at large on bail amiable policeman in mufti still attending at distance mr chaffanbrass lordship retired to prepare by rest for morrow labour what be alaric to do soon found under guardianship of constant gitemthruet in neighbouring tavern cousin charley be with charley have be in court whole day except that have twice posted down to west

minded policeman will always bow till at last very policeman assisted a though be in way connected with trial on last visit at gertrude house have told that be very improbable that trial must be finished day have then said nothing a to alaric return to own house have indeed not occurred to that must be at liberty to do so charley at once caught at strongly recommended cousin to remain where be 'you will gain nothing by going home ' said 'gertrude doe not expect mr woodward be there will be better for party that must remain mr gitemthruet strongly backed advice alaric so counselled resolved to remain where be charley promised to stay with policeman in mufti without making promise at silently acquiesced in arrangement charley made one more visit to west saw norman at lodging mr woodward gertrude in albany place then returned to make night of with alaric need hardly say that charley made night of in very different manner from to brother navvy be so well accustomed chapter xli old bailey next morning at ten o'clock court be again crowded judge be again on bench prepared for patient endurance lord killtime sir gregory hardlines be alongside of jury be again in box ready with

alaric be again present under wing of mr gitemthruet great mr chaffanbrass be in place be leaning over slip of paper held in hand with compressed lip be meditating attack upon enemy on occasion wig be well over eye a peered up from under to judge face cocked nose with air of supercilious contempt for who be immediately around be for to begin day sport by making speech not so much in defence of client a in accusation of prosecutor have never said 'be fate might say misfortune to hear case against man in respectable position opened by crown with amount of envenomed virulence ' be then reminded that prosecution be not carried on by crown 'then said 'we may attribute virulence to private malice that be not to be attributed to fear that english bride must lose fortune that french husband must be deprived of portion of spoil will be able to prove to certainty did allow that audacity of denunciation learned friend have not considered incompatible with dignity of new silk gown must permit such latitude of invective a have adopted ' slight laugh be here heard in court involuntary smile played across judge face 'yes continued mr chaffanbrass ' boldly aver have never forgotten what be due to humanity a learned friend did in address to jury gentleman of jury will not confound natural indignation counsel must feel when defending innocence from false attack with uncalled for unprofessional acerbity have now be used in promoting such accusation a may at time be angry when see mean falsehood before in vain assuming garb of truth for with such jury a meet here generally be in vain may at time forget in anger if talk of venom virulence eager hostility yield palm without contest to learned friend in new silk gown ' then went on to dispose of witness whom have heard on previous day expressed regret that expose must have be made so disgraceful to commercial establishment of great commercial city only showed what be effect on such establishment of undue parsimony be now one of cry evil of time having thus shortly disposed of came to what men knew be real interest of day doings ' said 'the evidence in case to attention will be chiefly directed will be not that for accusation that for defence will be business to show to not only that client be guiltless to what temptation to be guilty have be purposely wickedly subjected will put into bar honourable member of house of common who will make revelation a to own life who will give insight into way mean of legislator will probably surprise not excluding lordship on bench will be able to explain to trust may be able to induce to do so for be possible that may be little coy will be able to explain to why client who be in way connected with scott golightlys figgs jaquetanapes why be made lady trustee will also perhaps tell after slight gentle persuasion whether have handled attempted to handle of lady money ' mr chaffanbrass then went on to state a form of court must not give power of addressing jury again must now explain to what conceived to be fact of case then admitted that client in anxiety to do best must with fortune entrusted to have invested badly present fate of unfortunate bridge share a to commercial world have lately held so many different opinion proved that have nevertheless be bona fide investment made in conjunction with by advice of mr scott lady uncle who thus for own purpose got possession of money be in truth confided to for other purpose client mr chaffanbrass acknowledged have behaved with great indiscretion moment found that investment must be injurious one to lady whose welfare be in hand at once resolved to make good whole amount from own pocket that have done so at rate must have done so for trial must be proved to nobler conduct than be impossible to imagine whereas lady uncle honourable member of parliament gentleman who have made stalking horse of mr chaffanbrass client refused to refund penny of spoil be now instigator of most unjust proceeding a mr chaffanbrass thus finished oration undy scott tried to smile complacently on around why did big drop of sweat stand on brow a eye involuntarily caught of mr chaffanbrass why did shuffle foot uneasily move hand foot hither thither a man doe when try in vain to be unconcerned why did pull glove on off throw back with affected air be so unusual to court be looking at one knew that be wretched wretched aye indeed be for assurance even of undy scott hardened man of club thrice elected twice rejected of tillietudlem fell prostrate before well known hot pincer of chaffanbrass torturer first witness called be henry norman alaric looked up for moment with surprise then averted eye mr gitemthruet have concealed from fact that norman be to be called merely proved that having heard from mr woodward who be prisoner mother in law must soon be own mother in law that deficiency have be alleged to exist in fortune of madame jaquetanape have on part of mr woodward produced what believed must cover deficiency that when have be informed that more money be wanting have offered to give security that whole must be paid in six month of course on mr chaffanbrass exercised none of terrible skill a lawyer on other side declined to cross examine be soon able to leave court did speedily for have desire to witness alaric misery then honourable undecimus scott be put into witness box be suggested on behalf that might give evidence from seat then occupied mr chaffanbrass must by mean allow intercourse with mr scott said must be of nearer closer more confidential nature than such arrangement a must admit witness to way of thinking be never efficient witness till have arm on rail of witness box must trouble mr scott to descend from grandeur of present position might return to seat after have be examined if then must have mind to do so friend undy found that have to obey be soon confronted with mr chaffanbrass in humbler manner that gentleman thought so desirable 'you be member of house of common believe mr scott ' began mr chaffanbrass undy acknowledged that be so 'and be son of peer believe ' ' scotch peer ' said undy 'oh scotch peer ' said mr chaffanbrass bringing wig forward over left eye in manner be almost irresistible ' scotch peer member of parliament son of scotch peer have be member of government believe mr scott ' undy confessed that have be in office for short time ' member of parliament son of peer one of government of great free country ought to be proud happy man be man of fortune too believe mr scott 'that be matter of opinion said undy 'different people have different idea know what call fortune call l fortune sum that lady have who married frenchman have l ' ' will not answer that question ' 'have l surely must have a much a a know married fortune unless indeed false hearted trustee have got hold of money also come have got l ' will not answer ' 'have got income at now demand answer to on oath sir ' lord must answer such question said undy 'yes sir

objection to let know whether have mean of living ' 'perhaps mr scott ' said judge 'you will not object to state whether posse fixed income 'have have not got income on live ' demanded mr chaffanbrass have income ' said undy not however in voice betokened much self confidence in strength of own answer have income have now mr scott will tell profession follow at moment with object of increasing income think may surmise by tone of voice that income be not very abundant ' have profession said undy 'on oath be in profession ' 'not at present oath be not stock jobber ' undy hesitated for moment 'by virtue of oath sir be stock jobber be not ' 'no be not at least believe not 'you believe not ' said mr chaffanbrass must be necessary to hear tone in be said to understand derision be implied 'you believe be not stock jobber be be not constantly buying share selling share railway share bridge share mining share such like sometimes buy share 'and sometimes sell 'yes sometimes sell ' where mr chaffanbrass have got exact information can not say very exact information have acquired respecting undy little transaction questioned about mary janes old friendship about west cork ballydehob branch about sundry other railway canal finally about limehouse bridge then again asked former question now ' said 'will tell jury whether be stock jobber ' 'it be matter of opinion said undy 'perhaps may be in sense of word sense of word said mr chaffanbrass 'you be a much stock jobber sir a man be policeman lordship be judge now mr scott be sorry must go back to private affair respecting be so unwilling to speak fear must trouble to tell how did raise money with bought that latter batch large lump of bridge share of be speaking ' ' borrowed from mr tudor ' said undy who have prepared to answer question glibly 'you borrowed from mr alaric tudor be from gentleman now upon trial borrowed believe just at time that became lady trustee ' 'yes said undy ' did so 'you have not repaid a yet ' 'no not yet ' said undy ' thought not can at say when mr tudor may probably get money ' ' be not at present prepared to name day when money be lent be not intended that must be repaid at early day mr tudor did not want money at early day did nevertheless have believe asked for since that very pressingly have never asked for ' said undy 'allow to remind mr scott have power of putting client into witness box although be on trial having so reminded let again beg to say whether have not asked for repayment of large sum of money very pressingly 'no have never done so 'by value of oath sir if have value did not client beseech to allow share to be sold while be yet saleable in order that niece trust money might be replaced in english fund 'he said something a to expediency of selling differed from ' thought must be better for lady interest that must remain unsold made question of lady interest be not trustee ' 'but share be bought with lady money ' 'what share asked undy 'what share sir share have professed to hold on lady behalf afterwards did not scruple to call own share of yours since have deliberate dishonesty so to call share of yours be not bought with lady money ' be bought with money borrowed from mr tudor 'and where did mr tudor get that money ' be question must ask ' said undy 'it be question sir just at present prefer to ask now sir be good enough to tell jury whence mr tudor got that money tell if dare do so that know ' undy for minute remained silent mr chaffanbrass remained silent also if fury of tongue for moment be at rest that of eye be a active a ever kept gaze steadily fixed upon witness stood there with compressed lip still resting on two hand a though be quite satisfied thus to watch prey be in power for instant glanced up to jury then allowed eye to resettle on face of witness a though might have said 'there gentleman there be son of peer member of parliament what do think of ' silence of minute be horrible to undy yet must hardly bring to break judge looked at with eye seemed to read inmost soul jury looked at condemning one alaric looked at with fierce glaring eye of hatred same eye have glared at night when have be collared in street whole crowd looked at derisively eye of be a nothing to eye of mr chaffanbrass ' never saw so great never did ' said mr gitemthruet whispering to client alaric even felt consolation in terrible discomfiture of enemy ' know where got ' said undy at last breaking terrible silence wiping perspiration from brow 'oh ' said mr chaffanbrass knocking wig back coming well out of kennel 'after waiting for quarter of hour so be able to tell jury at last that know anything about took small trifle of change out of pocket suppose ' know where took from ' 'and did ask ' 'no 'you got money be know be just at time mr tudor became lady trustee think have admitted that ' 'it may have be about time 'yes may have be about time a justly observe mr scott luckily know have date of two transaction never occurred to innocent mind that money got into hand be part of lady fortune that never occurred to innocent mind eh mr scott ' know that mind be more innocent mind than own said undy ' dare say not well did idea ever occur to guilty mind 'perhaps mind be not more guilty than own 'then may god help ' said mr chaffanbrass must be at bad pas told just now mr scott that time since mr tudor advised to sell share what made give advice ' meant said to sell own 'and pressed to sell yours 'yes 'he urged to do so more than once 'yes believe did ' 'and now mr scott can explain to jury why be so solicitous that must dispose of property ' know why must have done so unless wanted back money ' did ask for own money never asked for if have sold share perhaps might have asked for ' 'oh said mr chaffanbrass a uttered monosyllable looked up at jury gently shook head gently shook hand mr chaffanbrass be famous for little silent address to jury box not even yet have done with suspicious loan can not follow through whole of examination for kept old friend under harrow for le than seven hour though made further statement to jury made perfectly plain by undy own extracted admission by hesitation of denial that have knowingly received money out of niece fortune that have refused to sell share bought with money when pressed to do so by tudor in order that trust money might be again made up there be who blamed mr chaffanbrass for thus admitting that client have made away with ward money by lending to undy that acute gentleman saw clearly that must not contend against fact of property having be fraudulently used saw that might induce jury to attach so much guilt to undy that tudor must a be be whitened by blackness of other villany judge well knew must blow aside froth then judge must not find verdict towards end of day when undy be thoroughly worn out at time however mr chaffanbrass be a brisk a ever for nothing ever wore out when be pursuing game when interest of who have be sweltering in hot court day be observed to flag mr chaffanbrass began twisting round finger bit of paper of who be best acquainted with manner knew that must soon make use ber scott ' said suddenly dropping derisive sarcasm of former tone addressing with imaginable courtesy 'must oblige by telling whose handwriting be handed to scrap of paper undy took saw that writing be own eye be somewhat dim can hardly be said to have read be very short memorandum ran a follows 'all will yet be well if share be ready to morrow morning ' mr scott ' said lawyer recognize handwriting ' undy looked at endeavoured to examine closely must not eye swam head be giddy felt sick must have satisfied that writing be not clearly manifestly own must have denied document altogether feared to do handwriting might be proved to be own 'it be something like own said beomething like own be ' said mr chaffanbrass a though be much surprised 'like own well will have goodness to read ' undy turned in hand a though proposed task be singularly disagreeable to why thought to must be thus browbeaten by dirty old newgate lawyer why not pluck up courage at rate show that be man ' said ' will not read ' 'then will gentleman of jury have goodness to listen to ' of course there be contest then between lawyer on other side whether document might might not be read equally of course contest ended in judge decision that must be read mr chaffanbrass did read in voice audible to men will yet be well if share be ready to morrow morning ' may take a admitted suppose that be in handwriting mr scott ' probably may be though will not say that be ' 'do not know sir with positive certainty that be writing ' to undy made direct answer 'what be opinion mr scott ' said judge can probably give opinion by jury must be much guided ' ' think be lord ' said undy 'he think be said mr chaffanbrass addressing jury 'well for once agree with think be also how will have goodness to explain to whom be addressed ' ' can not say ' 'when be written ' ' know doe mean ' ' can not remember ' 'be addressed to mr tudor ' must think not 'now mr scott have goodness to look at jury to speak little louder be in habit of addressing larger audience than can not therefore be shamefaced mean to tell jury that think that note be not intended by for mr tudor ' ' think not ' said undy 'but ca say who be intended for ' 'no 'and by virtue of oath have told that know about ' undy remained silent mr chaffanbrass did not press for answer 'you have brother named valentine think now captain val have be summoned also be at moment in court mr chaffanbrass requested that might be desired to leave consequently be ordered out in charge of policeman 'and now mr scott be that note written by to mr tudor with reference to certain share proposed that mr tudor must place in brother hand now sir ask a member of parliament a member of government a son of peer to give true answer to question then again undy be silent again mr chaffanbrass leant on desk glared at 'and remember sir member of parliament nobleman a be will be indicted for perjury if be guilty of perjury ' bey lord ' said undy writhing in torment 'be to submit to ' ber chaffanbrass ' said judge 'you must not threaten witness mr scott surely can answer question mr chaffanbrass seemed not to have even heard what judge said so intently be eye fixed on poor undy 'well mr scott ' said at last very softly 'be convenient for to answer did that note refer to certain number of bridge share required mr tudor to hand over to stepfather of lady ' undy have trust in brother felt sure under fire of mr chaffanbrass must confess everything must be terrible to own truth must be more terrible to be indicted for perjury so sat silent bey lord perhaps will ask ' said mr chaffanbrass scott understand question why do not answer ' asked judge undy still remained silent 'you may go now said mr chaffanbrass 'your eloquence be of silent sort nevertheless be very impressive may go now sit on bench again if after what have passed sheriff think proper to permit ' undy however did not try that officer complaisance retired from witness box be not again seen during trial in conspicuous place in court be then past seven o'clock mr chaffanbrass insisted on going on with examination of captain val did not last long captain val also be in disagreeable position that did not know what undy have confessed what denied so also refused to answer question of mr chaffanbrass saying that might possibly damage must do so be enough for mr chaffanbrass then work be done at eight o'clock court again adjourned again charley posted off for third time day to let gertrude know even a yet be not over again alaric spent melancholy evening at neighbouring tavern then again on third morning be re assembled at old bailey rather be not re assembled few came now be who be obliged to come crack piece of trial portion to among connoisseur interest be attached that be over mr chaffanbrass have done work undy scott member of parliament have be gibbeted rest be in comparison stale flat unprofitable judge jury however be there so be prosecuting counsel so be mr chaffanbrass mr younglad so be poor alaric work of day be commenced by judge charge then alaric to infinite dismay found how sophistry laboured argument of very talented advocate be blown to wind shown to be worthless 'gentlemen said judge to juror after have gone through evidence told what be admissible what be not 'gentlemen must especially remind that in coming to verdict in matter amount of guilt on part of other person can render guiltless whom be now trying palliate guilt if be guilty endeavour have be made to affix deep stigma on one of witness who have be examined before to induce to feel rather than to think that mr tudor be at rate comparatively innocent innocent a compared with gentleman be not issue be called on to decide not whether mr scott for purpose of own led mr tudor on to guilt then turned against whether mr tudor have have not be guilty under act of parliament have be explained to 'as regard evidence of mr scott be justified in telling that if prisoner guilt depended in way on evidence must be duty to receive with most extreme caution to reject altogether if not corroborated that evidence be not trustworthy in great measure justified treatment witness encountered from learned barrister who examined mr scott be witness for defence not for prosecution case for prosecution in way hang on evidence 'if be opinion that mr tudor be guilty that be unwarily enticed into guilt by mr scott that whole arrangement of trust be brought about by mr scott others to enable to make cat paw of new trustee thus use lady money for own purpose such opinion on part may justify in recommending prisoner to merciful consideration of bench can not justify in finding verdict of not guilty a alaric heard much more to same effect hope certainly have be high during examination of undy scott again sank to zero left in despair have almost begun to doubt fact of own guilt so wondrously have conduct be glossed over by mr chaffanbrass so strikingly have good attempt on part be brought to light so black have scott be made to appear idea floated across brain that might go forth not only free of law whitewashed also in men opinion that might again sit on throne at civil service board again cry to 'excelsior indulge old dream of ambition ala deliberate well poised wisdom of judge seemed to shower down cold truth upon jury from very eye word be low in tone though very clear impassive delivered without gesticulation artifice such a so powerfully used by mr chaffanbrass alaric felt that be impossible to doubt truth of such man impossible to suppose that juryman must do so ah why have brought thus to quail beneath gaze of old man seated on bench with what object have forced to bend once proud neck have be before in court such a have mocked within own spirit paraphernalia of horsehair wig judge faded finery red cloth have laughed at musty stale solemnity by miscreant be awed policeman enchanted now thing told on heavily enough felt now weight import then jury retired from court to consider verdict mr gitemthruet predicted that must be hungry enough before sat down to next meal lordship be dead against ' said mr gitemthruet 'but be matter of course must look to jury city jury be very fond of mr chaffanbrass be not quite sure however that mr chaffanbrass be right must not have admitted so much then one know city jury so well a mr chaffanbrass ' other cause came on still jury did not return to court mr chaffanbrass seemed to have forgotten very existence of alaric tudor be deeply engaged in vindicating city butcher from imputation of having vended dead as by way of veal indignation be now forgotten be full of boisterous fun filling court with peal of laughter one o'clock came two three four five six seven still verdict at latter hour when court be about to be adjourned foreman came in assured judge that there be probability that must agree eleven of thought one way while twelfth be opposed to 'you must reason with gentleman said judge have lord ' said foreman 'but be thrown away upon ' beason with again ' said judge rising from bench preparing to go to dinner then one of great fundamental support of british constitution be brought into play reason be thrown away upon tough juryman therefore be necessary to ascertain what effect starvation might have upon verdict be unanimous decision from twelve men a to alaric guilt be necessary might be that three must think innocent nine guilty that other division of opinion might take place such division among jury be opposed to spirit of british constitution twelve men must think alike if will not must be made to do so beason with again ' said judge a went to own dinner have judge bade remind how hungry must soon be if remained obstinate lordship must probably have expressed thought be passing through mind 'there be one of lord ' said foreman will know be very ill before long be already so bad that ca sit upright there be many ludicrous point in blessed constitution perhaps nothing so ludicrous a juryman praying to judge for mercy have be caught shut up in box perhaps for five six day together badgered with dozen lawyer till be nearly deaf with continual talking then be locked up until will die find verdict such at least be intention of constitution death however of three four juryman from starvation must not suit humanity of present age therefore when extremity be nigh at hand dying juryman with medical certificate be allowed to be carried off be devoutly to be wished that one juryman might be starved to death while thus serving constitution absurdity then must cure verdict of majority must be taken in alaric case reason hunger did prevail at last moment a judge be leaving court be called back to receive verdict alaric also be brought back still under mr gitemthruet wing with came charley few officer of court be there jailer policeman two whose attendance be absolutely necessary with exception place be empty not long since men be crowding for seat policeman be hardly able to restrain pressure of who pushed forward now there be pushing dingy dirty bench few inch of have lately be so desirable be not at in request be anything inviting in appearance alaric sat down on very spot have lately be sacred to mr chaffanbrass mr gitemthruet seated above might also fancy barrister there sat for five minute in perfect silence suspense of moment cowed even attorney charley who sat on other side of alaric be so affected that must hardly have spoken have wished to do so then judge who have be obliged to re array before returned to bench again took seat officer of court inquired of foreman of jury in usual official language what finding be 'guilty on third count ' said foreman guilty on four others beg however most strongly to recommend prisoner to lordship merciful consideration believing that have be led into crime by one who have be much more guilty than ' ' knew mr chaffanbrass be wrong ' said mr gitemthruet ' knew be wrong when

released from attendance charley with heavy heart carried news to gertrude mr woodward a for ' said gertrude when have so far recovered from first shock a to be able to talk to mother 'as for will have lodging at millbank ' chapter xlii parting interview mr woodward remained with eldest daughter for two day after trial then be forced to return to hampton have earnestly entreated gertrude to accompany with child mr tudor be inflexible have said very much to do so much that must not possibly leave london house furniture be on hand must be disposed of future plan must be arranged then nothing said must induce to sleep out of sight of husband prison to omit opportunity of seeing prison rule must allow mr woodward must not have left one child in such extremity have not state of child made presence at cottage indispensable katie anxiety about trial have of course be intense so intense a to give false strength somewhat to deceive linda a to real state tidings of course passed daily between london cottage for three day told nothing on morning of fourth day however norman brought heavy news katie sank completely under when first heard result of trial swooned away remained for time nearly unconscious returning consciousness brought with relief lay sobbing on pillow till became so weak that linda in fright wrote up to mother begging to return at once then wretched a made to leave gertrude in trouble mr woodward did return for fortnight after there be unhappy household at surbiton cottage linda marriage be put off till period of alaric sentence must be over till something must be settled a to gertrude future career be now august spoke of event a one perhaps might occur in course of following spring at time also be deprived for while of comfort of norman visit by enforced absence at normansgrove harry eldest brother be again ill at last news of death be received at hampton under other circumstance such tidings a might to certain extent have brought own consolation with harry must now be mr norman of normansgrove linda must become mr norman of normansgrove harry mother have long be dead father be infirm old man who must be too glad to give up to son full management of estate now that eldest son be man to whom that estate must be trusted circumstance have of course be talked over between harry linda be understood that harry be now to resign situation at weight measure alaric condition gertrude misery katie illness threw such matter into background katie became better then doctor said that did not become worse gave a opinion that ought to recover have youth said on side then lung be not affected be great question be asking of other continually poor girl lived beneath stethoscope bore poking tapping with exquisite patience believed that be dying so repeatedly told mother mr woodward must only say that be in god hand that physician still encouraged to hope best one day mr woodward be sitting with book in usual place at side of katie bed looked now again at patient thought that be slumbering at last rose from chair to creep away so sure be that might be spared for moment just a be silently rising thin slight pale hand crept out from beneath clothes laid on arm ' thought be asleep love ' said 'no mamma be not asleep be thinking of something go away mamma just now want to ask something ' mr woodward again sat down taking daughter hand in own caressed ' want to ask favour of mamma ' said katie favour darling what be know will do anything in power that ask ' 'ah mamma know whether will do be katie will do anything be for good be sure know that katie beamma know be going to die oh mamma say anything now cry now dear dear mamma say to make unhappy know when be so ill ought to think about ought not mamma ' 'but katie doctor say that think be not so dangerously ill must not therefore despond will increase illness hinder chance of getting well must be wrong must love ' feel that will never again be well therefore ' be useless telling mr woodward not to cry what else must do 'dear mamma be so sorry to make unhappy be own mamma therefore must tell can be happy still mamma if will let talk to about ' 'you will talk dearest will hear what say oh katie can not bear to hear talk of dying think be dying if did think so child trust in goodness be so strong must tell ' 'you know mamma might have be much worse suppose have be drowned when when charley know saved ' a mentioned name tear for first time ran down cheek 'how much worse must have be think mamma what must be to be drowned without moment for one prayer 'it be quite right must prepare for death whether live whether die will be better for doing ' katie still held mother hand in hers lay back against pillow have be placed behind back 'and now mamma ' said at last be going to ask favour want to see charley once more ' mr woodward be so much astonished at request at first knew not what answer to make 'to see charley ' said at last 'yes mamma want to see charley once more there need be secret between now mamma ' 'there have never be secret between ' said mr woodward embracing 'you have never have secret from ' 'not intentionally mamma have never meant to keep anything secret from know have known what felt about charley ' know that have behaved like angel child know want of selfishness devotion to others have be such a to shame know conduct have be perfect oh katie have understood have so loved so admired ' katie smiled through tear a returned mother embrace 'well mamma ' said 'at rate know that love oh mamma do love so dearly be not now like gertrude love linda know that can never be wife did know before for many reason ought not to wish to be so now know never never can be mr woodward be past power of speaking so katie went on 'but love le for reason think love more never never must have loved anyone else mamma never never be one reason why so much mind being ill now mr woodward bowed forward hid face in counterpane still kept hold of daughter hand 'and mamma ' continued do love so dearly feel must try to do something for ought to do so mamma must not be happy without seeing be not just like brother brother in law such a harry alaric be not bound to other a relation be yet feel that something doe bind to know doe love a love yet think love dearly if speak to now mamma now that be be so ill perhaps will mind mamma will be a though one came unto from dead mr woodward did not know how to refuse request that katie might now make to felt altogether unequal to task of refusing request for many reason must have done so have be able in first place did not think that chance of katie recovery be gone then at present moment felt inclination to draw closer to of tudor family must not feel that alaric have be mean of disgracing degrading one child truly deeply warmly a sympathized with other must not bring to feel same sympathy for object of love be sore day for hers on tudor have first entered house nevertheless assented to katie proposal undertook task of asking charley down to hampton since alaric conviction charley led busy life a men who have really something to do have seldom time to get into much mischief have be peculiarly moral respectable be not surprising that at moment gertrude found that alaric newer friend fell off from of course did be sign of ingratitude heartlessness in world at period of great distress new friend must fall off new friend like one best coat polished patent leather dress boot be only intended for holiday wear at other time be serviceable comfortable answer required purpose be ill adapted to give ease seek new coat however have advantage that will in time become old comfortable so much can by mean be predicted with certainty of new friend woe to men who go through world with none new coat on back with boot of polished leather with none new friend to comfort in adversity not le when misfortune doe come be inclined to grumble at finding deserted gertrude though certainly wished to see mr val miss neverbends did feel lonely enough when mother left wretched enough be not altogether deserted at time charley be true to did for thousand nameless thing woman can not do for came to everyday after leaving office on one excuse remained with till late evening be not little surprised one morning on receiving mr woodward invitation to hampton mr woodward in writing have have difficulty in wording request hardly liked asking charley to come because katie be ill did like to ask without mentioning katie illness ' need not explain to ' said in note 'that be in great distress poor katie be very ill will understand what must feel about alaric gertrude harry be still at normansgrove will be glad to see katie who never forgets what did for insists on asking at once be sure will not refuse so will expect to morrow ' charley must not have refused anything need hardly be said that accepted invitation mr woodward be at loss how to receive what to say to though katie be so positive that own illness must be fatal symptom might have confirmed who watched in opinion that disease be not consumption mother be by mean so desponding still thought not impossible that child might recover so thinking must not be adverse to declaration on katie part of own feeling have endeavoured to explain to daughter katie be so carried away by enthusiasm be at present moment so devoted a be exalted above present life that mother said be thrown away upon mr woodward might have refused daughter request have run risk of breaking heart by refusal now that petition have be granted be useless to endeavour to teach to repress feeling 'charley said mr woodward when have be little time in house dear katie want to see be very ill know ' charley said knew be ill remember walk together charley ' 'yes said charley ' remember well made promise then have kept have now come here only because have sent for ' said in tone man us when feel to have be injured ' know charley have

bidding sat in chair captain cuttwater have occupied 'come here nearer to ' said 'this be where mamma always sits linda when mamma be not here ' charley did a be bid changing seat came sat down close

not charley do remember flower show dance at mr val ' charley did remember well ah how often have thought of think of day so often too often ' continued katie 'but dear charley can not remember too

did save life people in world wo make think anything else charley have something now to tell ' sat listened seemed to a though be only there to listen a though be to make own voice audible must

without telling when be dead charley will think of try try to give up bad way when tell that love so dearly ask on deathbed think will do ' charley went down on knee bowing head before before god made

gathering of rank weed in form of mr corkscrew nothing of kind have be attempted disease have gone too far either for phlebotomy purging cautery internal navigation have ceased to exist demise have be in wise may be remembered that time since mr oldeschole have mentioned in hearing of mr snape that thing be going wrong sir gregory hardlines have expressed adverse opinion a to internal navigation worse ten time worse than that there have be article in time now know that if anything be ever done in way towards improvement in day public press doe know also of what public press consists mr oldeschole knew well even mr snape have glimmering idea of truth when read that article mr oldeschole felt that day be numbered mr snape when heard of began to calculate for hundredth time to what highest amount of pension might be adjudged to be entitled by liberal minded treasury minute mr oldeschole began to set house in order hopelessly for such effort time be gone by be too late for office to be so done by too late for mr oldeschole to do have aptitude for new style modern improvement must not understand sir gregory code of rule be dumbfounded by civil service requisition be made upon from time to time then came frequent call for to attend at sir gregory office there new broom have be brought in in place of poor friend alaric broom seemed determined to sweep before with unmitigable energy mr oldeschole found that must not stand at before young hercules seeing that special stall be considered to be foulest in whole range of augean stable soon saw that river be to be turned in on that be to be officially obliterated in flood civility of wonder doing demigod magi of civil service office be most oppressive to when got to board be always treated with deference knew be prelude to barbaric torture must ask to sit down in beautiful new leathern arm chair a though be really great man then examine a must candidate for custom house smiling always looking at a though be determined to see through asked manner of question there be one question put to day after day for four day nearly drove mad be always put by horrid young lynx eyed new commissioner who sat there with hair brushed high from off forehead peering out of capacious excellently washed shirt collar personification of conscious official zeal now mr oldeschole if have have leisure to consider question more fully perhaps can define to what be hum hm use hm hm exact use of internal navigation office then sir warwick must go on looking through millstone a though now really have hope of seeing something sir gregory must lean back in chair rubbing hand slowly over other like great akinetos a be wait leisurely for mr oldeschole answer rather for answer what question be to ask of man who have spent life in internal navigation office o reader must chance that thou art clergyman imagine what must be to thee wert thou asked what be exact use of church of england that too by stubborn catechist whom thou wert bound to answer if lady happy in husband family say must be thy feeling if demanded to define exact use of matrimony use be not in to thee mr oldeschole felt hearty inward conviction that office have be of very great use in first place have not drawn from thousand year for last five twenty year have not given maintenance employment to many worthy men who might perhaps have found difficult to obtain maintenance elsewhere have not always be office public office of note reputation with proper work assigned to use of exact use of mr oldeschole at last declared with indignation in tone that have be there for forty year knew well that office be very useful that must not undertake to define exact use thank mr oldeschole will do think ' said very spruce looking new gentleman out of shirt collar in day there be kind of prescience at internal navigation that something special be going to be done with mr oldeschole said nothing openly may be presumed that did whisper somewhat to of senior around in whom most confided then frequent visit to whitehall be spoken of even by most thoughtless of navvy threatenings of coming storm revealed with more le distinctness to mind at last thundercloud broke bolt fell mr oldeschole be informed that lord of treasury have resolved on breaking up establishment providing for duty in way a word duty passed sir gregory lip slight smile be seen to hover round mouth of new commissioner mr oldeschole must be informed receive official notification to effect on following morning on following morning accordingly dispatch arrived of great length containing resolution of lord putting absolute extinguisher on life of navvy how mr oldeschole with tear streaming down cheek communicated tidings to elder brother how elder brother with palpitating heart quivering voice repeated tale to listening junior can not now describe boldest spirit be then cowed loudest miscreant be then silenced there be few gibe little jeering at internal navigation on day though charley who have already other hope contrived to keep up spirit men stood about talking in cluster old animosity be at end lamb sat down with wolf mr snape dick scatterall became quite confidential ' knew be going to happen ' said mr snape to 'indeed mr oldeschole have be consulting about for time must own did not think must be so sudden must own ' 'if knew be coming ' said corkscrew 'why did tell chap ' be not at liberty ' said mr snape looking very wise 'we will have liberty enough now ' said scatterall ' wonder what will do with eh charley ' believe will send worst of to spike island dartmoor prison said charley 'but mr snape doubt have heard can tell ' 'oh come charley do to chaff now ' said young navvy who be especially down in mouth wonder will do

seems to that mean to at rate there be word about pension anything of sort be there mr snape ' word ' said snape 'but who be entitled to pension ca be affected injuriously a far a can see must give whole salary think can do le 'you be serene then mr snape ' said charley 'you be in right box looking at matter in light mr snape think ought to stand something handsome in shape of lunch come what do say to chop stout round dick will go over order in minute wish must charley ' said navvy who seemed to be most affected who in present humour must not endure joke a mr snape did not seem to accede to charley view liberal proposition fell to ground 'care killed cat ' said scatterall ' sha break heart about never liked shop did charley ' must say think have be very comfortable here under mr snape ' said charley if mr snape be to go why office certainly must be deuced dull without ' 'charley said broken hearted young navvy in tone of reproach sorrow however did not take away appetite a mr snape did not see fitting occasion for providing banquet clubbed together among managed to get spread of beefsteak porter scatterall a requested went across strand to order at cookshop while corkscrew

feed for tenpence at place in thames street ' poor youth idea of earning bread did not in wildest flight spread beyond public office of civil service for few day longer hung about old office doing nothing how must men so circumstanced do anything waiting for fate at last fate be announced mr oldeschole retired with full salary secretary such like always retire with full pay a be necessary that dignity must be supported mr snape other senior be pensioned with careful respect to year of service with arrangement of expressed highly indignant loudly threatened to bring cruelty of treatment before parliament by aid of sundry member who be supposed to be on look out for such work a nothing further be ever heard of may be presumed that member in question did not regard case a one on government of day be sufficiently vulnerable to make worth while to trouble of younger clerk two three including unhappy one be drafted into other office others received one more year pay then tore away from fascination of london life among be mr r scatterall who in after year will doubtless become lawgiver in hong kong for to colony have betaken few others more unfortunate than rest among whom poor screwy be most conspicuous be treated with more absolute rigour be sent upon world portionless screwy have be constant in devotion to pork chop have persisted in spelling blue without final e ' be therefore declared unworthy of further public confidence whatever be now in uncle office in parliament street be to be hoped that peculiar talent may there be found useful so internal navigation office came to end dull dingy room be vacant ruthless men shovelled off a waste paper lock entry of charley have once be so proud ponderous ledger mr snape have delighted to haul about be sent away into cimmerian darkness probably to utter destruction then internal navigation be more among who be drafted into other office be charley whom propitious fate took to weight measure must not be imagined that chance took there weight measure be elysium door of be never casually open charley at time be much altered man not that have become good clerk at old office change one may say be impossible there be good clerk at internal navigation charley have so long be among navvy most knavish navviest that such transformation must have met with credence out of office have become much altered man a katie have said be a though one have come to from dead must not go back to old haunt must not return like dog to vomit a long a have that purse so near heart a long a voice sounded in ear while memory of kiss lingered in heart now told everything to gertrude debt love despair there be relief for sorrow like sympathy of friend if one can only find then sympathy must be real mock sympathy always tell truth against always fails to deceive told everything to gertrude by counsel told much to norman must not speak to true friend a be of katie love there be that about subject made too sacred for man ear too full of tenderness to be spoken of without feminine tear be only in little parlour at paradise row when evening have grown dark gertrude be sitting with baby in arm that boisterous young navvy must bring to speak of love during month katie health have greatly improved a have gained in strength have gradually begun to think that be yet possible for to live little be now said by about charley not much be said of in hearing still did learn how have changed office with office mode of life did hear of literary effort of kindness to gertrude must seem a though be ordained that moral life physical life be to gain strength together chapter xlvi mr nogo last question at time charley be not idle fate of 'crinoline macassar ' have not yet be told have of two rival chieftain 'baron of ballyporeen sir anthony allan dale heartrending tale appeared in due course bit by bit in page of daily delight on morning of week sunday excepted page half of charley narrative be given to expectant public though be not prepared to say that public received offering with violent acclamation of applause that name became suddenly that of great unknown that literary clique talked about to exclusion of other topic that rose famous one morning a byron did after publication of 'corsair nevertheless something be said in praise daily delight on whole be rather belittled by grander brother of press word two be said here there to exempt charley fiction from general pooh poohing with remainder of publication be treated success such a even be dear to mind of young author charley began to feel that have done something editor be proportionably civil to be encouraged to commence third historiette have polished off poison petticoat pretty well ' said editor do say to something political charley have objection in life 'this divorce bill now must have dozen married couple separating getting rid of rib buckling again helter skelter man to somebody else wife parish parson refusing to do work just to show immorality of thing ' charley said 'd think about 'or danubian principality french alliance must manage now to lay scene in constantinople ' charley doubted whether must 'or perhaps india be thing cawnpore massacre must work up into length pleased must get file of time know for fact while editor be giving various valuable hint a to author future subject author with base mind be thinking how much must be paid for past labour at last ventured in mildest manner to allude to subject 'payment ' said editor charley said that have understood that there be to be fixed scale of pay so much per sheet something of sort 'undoubtedly there will ' said editor who will have courage perseverance to work through with till publication have obtained that wide popularity be sure to achieve will doubtless be paid be paid a writer for periodical in metropolis have ever yet be paid at present mr tudor really must be aware that be quite out of question charley have not courage perseverance to work through with daily delight till have achieved promised popularity consequently left rank like dastard consulted gertrude norman on subject on advice set to work on own bottom may perhaps manage to fly alone said gertrude 'but will find very difficult to fly if tie whole weight of daily delight under wing so charley prepared for solitary soaring while be thus working time arrived at norman be to leave office occurred to that might be possible that must bequeath vacancy to charley went to sir gregory explained not only own circumstance former friendship with alaric tudor also relationship between alaric charley then learnt in strictest confidence of course that doom of internal navigation have just be settled that must be necessary to place in other office young men who must in way be regarded a worth salt after considerable manoeuvring have so arranged that ne'er do well young navvy must recommence official life under better auspex did charley come in at bottom of office be allowed by inscrutable order of great men who arranged thing to take position in weight measure equal in seniority standing to have held at navigation much higher of course in pay there be old saying unenlightened credit declares that be sauce for goose be sauce also for gander nothing put into proverb since day of solomon be ever more untrue that be sauce for goose be not sauce for gander especially be not so in official life poor screwy be goose certainly got sauce best suited to when be turned adrift out of civil service charley be gander fond a be of for many excellent quality be fain to own justice might fairly have demanded that must be cooked after same receipt suited certain potent personage to make swan of therefore though have long be assured fact through whole service that man be ever known to enter weight measure without strictest examination though character of aspirant for high office be always subjected to rigid scrutiny though knowledge accomplishment industry morality outward decency inward zeal cardinal virtue be absolutely requisite still charley be admitted without examination scrutiny during commotion consequent upon earthquake above described charley went to weight time during recess in process of next session mr nogo gave notice that meant to ask government question a to gross act of injustice have be perpetrated so at least matter have be represented to on suppression of internal navigation office mr nogo did not at first find very easy to get fitting opportunity for asking question have to give notice inquiry have to be made responsible people be away various customary accident happened so that be late in june before question be put mr nogo however persevered ruthlessly after six month labour did deliver of indignant a friend declared to very telling speech be reported at time by opposition newspaper need not therefore be given here upshot be two men bearing equal character mr nogo must not say whether character of gentleman be good bad must only say equal character sat in same room at now defunct office one be mr corkscrew other mr tudor one have friend in civil service other be more fortunate mr corkscrew have be sent upon world ruined blighted man without compensation without regard for interest without consideration for past service future prospect must be told that government have further need of labour that must not dare to saddle country with pension for so young man what have be done in case of other gentleman why have be put into valuable situation in best government office in london have be placed over head of dozen others who have be there before c c c then mr nogo ended with so vehement attack on sir gregory government a connected with that dog began to whet teeth prepare for tug at great badger circumstance be mischancy with mr nogo said redounded only to credit of friend charley black undoubtedly be black merit of charley mr corkscrew a public servant have be about equal mr whip vigil turned black into white in three minute a got upon leg smiling after manner of great exemplar held in hand small note newspaper ' comparison said 'have be instituted between merit of two gentleman formerly in employment of crown one of have be selected for further employment other rejected honourable member for mile end have regretted to say instituted comparison knew what be proverbial character of comparison be however ready made to hand there be nothing left for mr whip vigil to go on with however must do in a light manner a possible have be thought that one gentleman must not suit public service that other must do so be for merely to defend opinion now held in hand letter written by protege of honourable member for limehouse must not read ' cry of bead read 'no must not read honourable member might if must must be prepared to say that gentleman who chose to express in style in private note note however be not private in usual sense must hardly be expected to command proper supply of wholesome english such a service of crown demanded then mr vigil handed across to mr nogo poor screwy unfortunate letter about pork chop 'as to other gentleman whose name be now respectably known in lighter walk of literature must if permitted read opinion expressed a to style of language by literary publication of day then house must see whether produce of civil service field have not be properly winnowed whether wheat have not be garnered chaff neglected then right honourable gentleman read half dozen line highly eulogistic of charley first solitary flight poor mr nogo remained in silence feeling that black have become white to intent purpose big badger sat by grinned not deigning to notice dog around thus may be seen that be sauce for goose be not sauce for gander early in spring norman be married then a have be before arranged charley once more went to surbiton cottage marriage be very quiet affair feeling of disgrace have fallen upon since day of alaric trial have by mean worn away there be none of yet not one of cottage circle from uncle bat down to parlour maid who felt that have right to hold up face before light of day a have
