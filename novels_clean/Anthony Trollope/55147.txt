see something of world learn to talk french instead of patois of valley having left paris have come down south into languedoc remained there picking up agricultural lore be thought might prove useful

settled at place house have not thrived only child little girl be left altogether without provision little girl marie clavert la mre bauche have taken into own house immediately after father death although have most cordially hated that father marie be then infant madame bauche have accepted charge without much thought perhaps a to what might be child ultimate destiny since then have thoroughly done duty of mother by little girl who have become pet of whole establishment favourite plaything of adolphe bauche at last of course early sweetheart then therefore there have come trouble at vernet of course world of valley have seen what be taking place what be likely to take place long before madame bauche knew anything about at last broke upon sens that son adolphe bauche heir to virtue rich first young man in neighbouring valley be absolutely contemplating idea of marrying that poor little orphan marie clavert that one must ever fall in love with marie clavert have never occurred to madame bauche have always regarded child a child a object of charity a little thing to be looked on a poor marie by world looking through green spectacle have never seen that marie clavert be beautiful creature full of ripening charm such a young men love to look on marie be of infinite daily use to madame bauche in hundred little thing about house old lady thoroughly recognised appreciated ability for very reason have never taught to regard marie otherwise than a useful drudge be very fond of protge so much so that must listen to in affair about house when must listen to one else mary prettiness grace sweetness a girl have be thrown away upon maman bauche a marie used to call unluckily have not be thrown away upon adolphe have appreciated a be natural that must do have be so utterly indifferent to mother consequently have fallen in love consequently also have told love consequently also marie have returned love adolphe have be hitherto contradicted in few thing thought that difficulty must be prevented by informing mother that wished to marry marie clavert marie with woman instinct have known better have trembled almost crouched with fear when confessed love have absolutely hid from sight when adolphe went forth prepared to ask mother consent to marriage indignation passionate wrath of madame bauche be past gone two year before date of story need not therefore much enlarge upon subject be at first abusive bitter be bad for marie afterwards bitter silent be worse be of course determined that poor marie must be sent away to asylum for orphan penniless pauper in short anywhere out of way what mattered outlook into world happiness indeed very existence outlook happiness of adolphe bauche be not that to be considered a everything at vernet terrible sharp aspect of affair did not last very long in first place la mre bauche have under green spectacle heart that in truth be tender affectionate after first two day of anger admitted that something must be done for marie clavert after fourth day acknowledged that world of hotel world must not go a well without marie clavert a must with in next place madame bauche have friend whose advice in grave matter must sometimes take friend have told that must be much better to send away adolphe since be so necessary that there must be sending away of one that must be much benefited by passing month of life away from native valley that absence of year two must teach to forget marie even if did not teach marie to forget must say word two about friend at vernet be usually called m le capitaine though in fact have never reached that rank have be in army having be wounded in leg while still sou lieutenant have be pensioned have thus be interdicted from treading further thorny path lead to glory for last fifteen year have resided under roof of madame bauche at first a casual visitor going coming now for many year a constant there a be be so constantly called le capitaine that real name be seldom heard may however a well be known to that be theodore campan be tall well looking man always dressed in black garment of coarse description certainly scrupulously clean well brushed of perhaps fifty year of age conspicuous for rigid uprightness of back for black wooden leg wooden leg be perhaps most remarkable trait in character be always jet black being painted polished japanned a occasion might require by hand of capitaine be longer than ordinary wooden leg a indeed capitaine be longer than ordinary men nevertheless never seemed in way to impede rigid punctilious propriety of movement be never in way a wooden leg usually be in way of wearer then to render more illustrious have round middle round calf of leg may so say band of bright brass shone like burnished gold have be capitaines custom now for year past to retire evening at about seven oclock into sanctum sanctorum of madame bauches habitation dark little private sitting room in made out bill calculated profit there regale in presence indeed at expense for item never appeared in bill with coffee cognac have said that there be never eating drinking at establishment after regular dinner hour in so saying spoke of world at large nothing further be allowed in way of trade in way of friendship so much be now day always allowed to capitaine be at moment madame bauche discussed private affair asked for received advice for even madame bauche be mortal must green spectacle without other aid carry through trouble of life be now five year since world of vernet discovered that la mre bauche be going to marry capitaine for eighteen month world of vernet have be full of matter amount of patience be at last exhausted a further step in direction be ever taken beyond daily cup of coffee that subject died away very much unheeded by la mre bauche though thought of matrimony for thought much of matrimony for other people over most of cup of evening coffee cognac matrimonial project be discussed in latter day have be seen that capitaine pleaded in mary favour when fury of madame bauches indignation broke forth that ultimately marie be kept at home adolphe sent away by advice adolphe can not always stay away madame bauche have pleaded in difficulty truth of capitaine have admitted said might be married to one else before two year be over so matter have commenced to whom must be married to question capitaine have answered in perfect innocence of heart la mre bauche must be much better able to make such choice than did not know how marie might stand with regard to money if madame must give little dot affair capitaine thought must be more easily arranged thing took month to say during period marie went on with work in melancholy listlessness one comfort have adolphe before went have promised to holding in hand a did so little cross have given that earthly consideration must sever sooner later must certainly be husband marie felt that limb must not work tongue speak be not for one drop of water in cup then deeply meditating la mre bauche hit upon plan communicated to capitaine over second cup of coffee into poured full teaspoonful more than usual allowance of cognac why must not capitaine be man to marry clavert be very startling proposal idea of matrimony for never having a yet entered into capitaines head at period of life la mre bauche did contrive to make not altogether unacceptable a to matter of dowry be prepared to be more than generous did love marie well must find in heart to give anything anything except son own adolphe what proposed be adolphe must never keep bath if capitaine must take marie for wife marie madame bauche declared must be mistress after death subject of course to certain settlement a to adolphes pecuniary interest plan be discussed thousand time at last so for brought to bear that marie be made acquainted with having be called in to sit in presence with la mre bauche future proposed poor girl manifested disgust to stiff ungainly lover whom assigned to who through whole frame be in appearance almost a wooden a own leg on whole indeed marie liked capitaine felt that be friend in country such marriage be not uncommon capitaine be perhaps little beyond age at man might usually be thought justified in demanding service of young girl a nurse wife then marie of herself have so little to give except youth beauty goodness yet must not absolutely consent for be not absolutely pledged to own adolphe therefore when great pecuniary advantage be one by one displayed before when la mre bauche a last argument informed that a wife of capitaine must be regarded a second mistress in establishment not a servant must only burst out into tear say that did not know will be very kind to said capitaine a kind a man can be marie took hard withered hand kissed then looked up into face with beseeching eye be not without avail upon heart will not press now said capitaine there be time enough let heart be touched ever so much one thing be certain must not be permitted that must marry adolphe to view of matter have given in unrestricted adhesion must by mean withdraw without losing altogether position in establishment of madame bauche indeed did conscience tell that marriage must be permitted must be too much if pretty girl be allowed to marry first young man might fall in love with must world come to soon appeared that there be not time enough that time be growing very scant in three month adolphe must be back if everything be not arranged by time matter might still go astray then madame bauche asked final question think do that can ever marry adolphe a asked accustomed terror of green spectacle magnified tenfold marie must only answer by burst of tear affair be at last settled among marie said that must consent to marry capitaine when must hear from adolphes own mouth that adolphe loved no longer declared with many tear that vow pledge prevented from promising more than be not fault at rate not now that loved lover be not fault not now at least that be bound by pledge when heard from own mouth that have discarded then must marry capitaine indeed sacrifice in other way that la mre bauche might desire what must anything signify then madame bauches spectacle remained unmoved not heart marie told capitaine must be equal to herself in establishment when once be entitled to be called madame campan must be to quite a daughter must have cup of coffee evening dine at big table wear silk gown at church servant must call madame great career must be open to if must only give up foolish girlish childish love for adolphe great promise be repeated to marie by capitaine nevertheless there be one thing in world in mary eye be of value that one thing be heart of adolphe bauche without must be nothing with with assured must wait patiently till doomsday letter be written to adolphe during eventful doings letter came from saying that greatly valued mary love that a have be clearly proved to that marriage must be neither for advantage for be willing to give up consented to marriage with capitaine expressed gratitude to mother for pecuniary advantage have held out to oh adolphe adolphe ala ala be not such way of most men heart of heart of woman letter be read to marie have more effect upon than must have have dry legal document in day in place men woman did not depend much upon letter when be written be there expressed in much of heart of feeling marie must understand a be well aware glance of adolphes eye tone of adolphes voice must perceive at once from what lover really meant what wished what in innermost corner of heart really desired that must do from stiff constrained written document must understand nothing be agreed therefore that adolphe must return that must accept fate from mouth capitaine who knew more of human nature than poor marie felt tolerably sure of bride adolphe who have seen something of world must not care very much for girl of own valley money pleasure little position in world must soon wean from love then marie must accept destiny a other girl in same position have done since french world began now be evening before adolphes expected arrival la mre bauche be discussing matter with capitaine over usual cup of coffee madame bauche have of late become rather nervous on matter thinking that have be somewhat rash in acceding so much to marie seemed to that be absolutely now left to two young lover to say whether must have other not now nothing on earth must be further from madame bauches intention than decree resolve be to heap down blessing on person concerned provided always that must have own way provided did not have own way to heap down anything blessing have code of morality in matter must do good if possible to everybody around must not on score be induced to consent that adolphe must marry marie clavert must be in wind must rid house of marie of capitaine even of adolphe have become therefore somewhat querulous opinionated in discussion with friend dont know said on evening in question dont know may be right if adolphe turn against be to do then mre bauche said capitaine sipping coffee puffing out smoke of cigar adolphe will not turn against have be somewhat remarked by many that capitaine be more at home in house somewhat freer in manner of talking with madame bauche since matrimonial alliance have be on tapis than have ever be before la mre observed did not quite like how must prevent now when capitaine be once married must make know place in spite of promise to marie if say like girl continued madame bauche friend may be sure that will say nothing of kind have not be away two year without seeing girl a pretty a marie then have letter be nothing capitaine must eat letter a quick a must eat omelet aux fine herbes now capitaine be especially quick over omelet aux fine herbes mre bauche also have purse will know that can not eat except with good will ah exclaimed madame bauche poor lad have not sou in world unless give to did not seem that reflection be in displeasing to adolphe will now be man of world continued capitaine will know that doe not do to throw away everything for pair of red lip be folly of boy adolphe will be no longer boy believe mre bauche thing will be right enough then will have marie sick ill half dying on hand said madame bauche be not flattering to capitaine so felt perhaps so perhaps not said at rate will get over be malady rarely kill young woman especially when alliance awaits bah said madame bauche in saying that word avenged for too great liberty capitaine have lately taken shrugged shoulder took pinch of snuff uninvited helped to teaspoonful of cognac then conference ended on next morning before breakfast adolphe bauche arrived on that morning poor marie hardly knew how to bear month two back even up to last day two have felt sort of confidence that adolphe must be true to nearer came that fatal day le strong be confidence of poor girl knew that two long headed aged counsellor be plotting against happiness felt that must hardly dare hope for success with such terrible foe opposed to on evening before day madame bauche have met in passage kissed a wished good night marie knew little about sacrifice felt that be sacrificial kiss in day sort of diligence with mail for olette passed through prades early in morning conveyance be sent from vernet to bring adolphe to bath never be prince princess expected with more anxiety madame bauche be up dressed long before hour be heard to say five several time that be sure must not come capitaine be out on high road moving about with wooden leg a perpendicular a lamp post almost a black marie also be up nobody have seen be up have be out about place before of be stirring now that world be on move lay like hare in form then old char banc clattered up to door adolphe jumped out of into mother arm be fatter fairer than have last seen have larger beard be more fashionably clothed certainly looked more like man marie also saw out of little window thought that looked like god be probable said to herself that one so godlike must still care for mother be delighted with son who rattled away quite at ease shook hand very cordially with capitaine of whose intended alliance with own sweetheart have be informed then a entered house with hand under mother arm asked one question about where be marie said marie oh upstairs will see after breakfast said la mre bauche so entered house went in to breakfast among guest everybody have heard something of story be on alert to see young man whose love want of love be considered to be of so much importance will see that will be right said capitaine carrying head very high think so think so said la mre bauche who now that capitaine be right no longer desired to contradict know that will be right said capitaine told that adolphe must return man be man look at doe not care for marie clavert capitaine with much eloquence in motion pitched over neighbouring wall small stone held in hand then went to breakfast with many sign of outward joy not without inward joy for madame bauche thought saw that son be cured of love in mean time marie sat up stair still afraid to show have come said young girl servant in house running up to door of mary room yes said marie must see that have come oh how beautiful be said girl putting hand together looking up to ceiling marie in heart of heart wished that be not so beautiful a then chance of having might be greater company be talking to a though be prfet said girl never mind who be talking to said marie go away leave be wanted for work why before be not talking to why not if be really true to ala began to fall upon mind that must be false what then what must do then sat still gloomily thinking of other spouse have be promised to a speedily after breakfast a be possible adolphe be invited to conference in mother private room have much debated in own mind whether capitaine must be invited to conference for many reason must have wished to exclude did not like to teach son that be unable to manage own affair must have be well pleased to make capitaine understand that assistance be not absolutely necessary to then have inward fear that green spectacle must not now be a efficacious on adolphe a have once be in old day before have seen world become man might be necessary that son being man must be opposed by man so capitaine be invited to conference what took place there need not be described at length three be closeted for two hour at end of time came forth together countenance of madame bauche be serene comfortable hope of ultimate success ran higher than ever face of capitaine be masked a be always face of great diplomatist walked placid upright raising wooden leg with ease skill be absolutely marvellous poor adolphes brow be clouded yes poor adolphe for be poor in spirit have pledged to give up marie to accept liberal allowance mother tendered remained for now to communicate tidings to marie must not tell have said to mother with very little of manliness in face on mother now so prided herself la mre bauche explained to that be part of general agreement that marie be to hear decision from own mouth need not regard said capitaine with most indifferent air in world girl expects only have childish idea that be bound till release dont think will be troublesome adolphe at moment did feel that must have liked to kick capitaine out of mother house where must meeting take place in hall of bath house suggested madame bauche because a observed must walk round round nobody ever went there at time of day to adolphe objected must be so cold dismal melancholy capitaine thought that mre bauches little parlour be place la mre did not like might be overheard a well knew guessed that meeting must not conclude without sob must certainly be bitter might perhaps be loud send up to grotto will follow said adolphe on therefore agreed now grotto be natural excavation in high rock stood precipitously upright over establishment of bath steep zigzag path with almost never ending step have be made along face of rock from little flower garden attached to house lay immediately under mountain close along front of hotel ran little brawling river leaving barely room for road between door over there be wooden bridge leading to garden two three hundred yard from bridge began step by ascent be made to grotto when season be full weather perfectly warm place be much frequented there be green table in four five deal chair green garden seat also be there however have be removed into innermost back corner of excavation a hinder leg be somewhat at fault wall about two foot high ran along face of guarding occupant from precipice in fact be grotto little chasm in rock such a often see up above head in rocky valley by mean of steep step have be turned into source of exercise amusement for visitor at hotel standing at wall one must look down into garden down also upon shining slate roof of madame bauches house to left might be seen sombre silent snow capped top of stern old canigou king of mountain among eastern pyrenees so madame bauche undertook to send marie up to grotto adolphe undertook to follow thither be now spring though wind have fallen snow be no longer lying on lower peak still air be fresh cold there be danger that of few guest at establishment must visit place make put on cloak mre bauche said capitaine who did not wish that bride must have cold in head on wedding day la mre bauche pished pshawed a though be not minded to pay attention to recommendation on such subject from capitaine nevertheless when marie be seen slowly to creep across little bridge about fifteen minute after time have handkerchief on head be closely wrapped in dark brown cloak poor marie little heeded cold fresh air be glad to avail herself of mean by might hide face when madame bauche sought out in own little room with smiling face kind kiss bade go to grotto knew fancied that knew that be over will tell truth how be said la mre will do can know to make happy marie must remember what monsieur le cur told other day in vale of tear can not have everything a will have day when poor wicked soul have be purged of wickedness now go dear take cloak yes maman adolphe will come to try behave well like sensible girl yes maman so went bearing on brow sacrificial kiss bearing in heart unutterable load of woe adolphe have gone out of house before standing in stable yard well within gate so that must not see watched slowly crossing bridge mounting first flight of step have often seen tripping up stair have almost a often followed with quicker foot when must hear must run then must catch breathless at top steal kiss from when power of refusing have be robbed from by effort at escape there be such running now such following thought of such kiss a for must fain have skulked off shirked interview have dared did not dare so waited there out of heart for ten minute speaking word now then to bath man who be standing by just to show that be at ease bath man knew that be not at ease such must be lie a rarely achieve deception be rarely believed then at end of ten minute with step a slow a mary have be also ascended to grotto marie have watched from top so that must not be seen however have not once lifted up head to look for with eye turned to ground have plodded way up to cave when entered be standing in middle with eye downcast hand clasped before have retired way from wall so that eye might possibly see of false lover there stood when entered striving to stand motionless trembling like leaf in limb be only when reached top step that made up mind how must behave perhaps after capitaine be right perhaps must not mind marie said with voice attempted to be cheerful be odd place to meet in after such long absence held out hand to only hand offered salute did not even kiss cheek a brother must have done of rule of outside world must be remembered that poor marie knew little have be brother to before have become lover marie took hand saying yes have be very long now have come back went on to say seems that be in confusion together never knew such piece of work however be for best suppose perhaps so said marie still trembling violently still looking down upon ground then there be silence between for minute so tell what be marie said adolphe at last dropping hand making great effort to get through work before be afraid two have be very foolish dont think have now seems quite clear that can never get married dont see in light mary head turned round round with be not of fainting order took three step backwards leant against wall of cave also be trying to think how might best fight battle be

of rock crossing arm upon breast looked away from fixed eye upon sharp granite peak of canigou again betook to walk backwards forward through cave have quite enough of love for to make wish to marry quite enough now at moment to make idea of marriage with capitaine very distasteful to enough probably to make become decently good husband to must fate enable to marry not enough to enable to support punishment must be sure effect of mother displeasure besides have promised mother that must give up marie have entirely given in adhesion to plan of marriage with capitaine have owned that path of life a marked out for by mother be one behoved a man to follow be view of duty a man have be specially urged on with capitaines eloquence old campan have entirely succeeded be so easy to get assent of

in spanish to custodian of bell who be usually to be found in little cabin up there within tower say that went up shouting like demon continued maria seemed to that looked a though ought to be ashamed of name of englishman may not be so solemn in demeanour a spaniard answered for that there may be quite a much in then again began to mount before have ascended much farther passed three countryman be young men with gray coat gray trouser with slouched hat without glove have fair face fair hair swung big stick in hand with crooked handle laughed talked loud when met seemed to be racing with other

nearly whole of two regiment marian a alluded to officer spoke in tone might lead one to think that must much rather be without counted on a being one of ourselves a have be away so long thought thought then turned away face did not finish speech before must make up mind a to answer have risen from chair walked out of room maurice almost thought that saw tear in eye a went did ride back to spanish town afternoon after early dinner before went marian spoke to alone for one minute hope be not offended with said offended oh how must be offended with because seem so stern be sure must do anything must to oblige if knew how must be so shocking not to be good friend with cousin like there be so many different sort of friend said maurice of course there be there be great many friend that

early maurice for will want to explain be to meet know at clifton gate at one oclock do be little before will be there maurice cumming resolved within own breast a rode back to spanish town that if marian behaved to day at picnic a have done day at shandy hall must ask to be wife before left miss jack also be to be at picnic there be need of going early said when nephew made fuss about starting people be never very punctual at such affair a then be always quite long enough maurice explained that be anxious to be early on occasion carried point when reached clifton gate lady be already there not in carriage a people go to picnic in other tamer country on own horse own pony be not alone beside miss leslie be gentleman whom maurice knew a lieutenant graham of flag ship at port royal at little distance quite enabled to join in conversation be captain ewing lieutenant with narrow waist of previous year will have delightful day miss leslie said lieutenant oh charming isnt said marian now to choose place for dinner captain ewing what do say will commission to select know im very well up in geometry that wont teach what sort of place doe for picnic dinner will mr cumming then shook hand with maurice did not take further special notice of well go together if please commission be too important to be left to one then marian rode off lieutenant captain rode with be open for maurice to join if chose did not choose have come there ever so much earlier than need have done dragging aunt with because marian have told that service must be specially required by now a soon a saw went away with two officer went away without vouchsafing word made up mind there on spot that must never think of again never speak to otherwise than might speak to most indifferent of mortal yet be man must struggle right manfully with world trouble one who have struggled with from boyhood have never be overcome now be unable to conceal bitterness of wrath because little girl have ridden off to look for green spot for tablecloth without asking assistance picnic be think in general rather tedious for elderly people who accompany when joint become little stiff dinner be eaten most comfortably with accompaniment of chair table roof overhead be agrment de nevertheless picnic can not exist without certain allowance of elderly people miss marians captain ewing can not go out to dine on grass without one to look after so elderly people go to picnic in dull tame way doing duty wishing day over now on morning in question when marian rode off with captain ewing lieutenant graham maurice cumming remained among elderly people certain mr pomken great jamaica agriculturist one of council man who have known good old time got by button held fast discoursing wisely of sugar rum of gadsden pan recreant negro on of subject maurice cumming be known to have opinion of own a mr pomkens word sounded into one ear into other fell note listened to from afar shrill laughing voice of marian leslie a gave happy order to satellite around ever anon bass haw haw of captain ewing who be made welcome a chief of attendant that evening in whisper to brother councillor mr pomken communicated opinion that after there be not so much in young cumming a people said mr pomken have idea that young cumming be in love then dinner came spread over acre maurice be among last who seated when did so be in awkward comfortless corner behind mr pomkens back far away from laughter mirth of day yet from comfortless corner must see marian a sat in pride of power with friend julia davis near flirt a bad a herself satellite around obedient to nod happy in smile now wont allow more champagne said marian who will there be steady enough to help over rock to grotto oh have promised cried captain indeed have not have julia miss davis have certainly promised said lieutenant have made promise dont think will go at said julia who be sometimes inclined to imagine captain ewing must be own property much more of kind maurice cumming must not hear must see imagine be worse how innocent inane be after flirting of most young lady if word doings in line must be brought to paper know whether there be a rule more vocal expression of sentiment of love between man woman than there be between two thrush whistle call to other guided by instinct rather than by reason be going home with lady to night believe said maurice to miss jack immediately after dinner miss jack acknowledged that such be destination for night then going back to spanish town at once wont hurt one for to tell truth have have enough of work why maurice be in such hurry to come more fool so now be in hurry to go away dont notice to anybody miss jack looked in face saw that be really wretched knew cause of wretchedness dont go yet maurice said then added with tenderness be quite uncommon with go to maurice speak to openly freely once for will find that will listen then dear maurice do for sake made answer walked away roaming sadly by among tree listen exclaimed to yes will alter dozen time in a many hour who can care for creature can change a change yet must not help caring for a went on climbing among rock again came upon sound of voice heard especially that of captain ewing now miss leslie if will take hand will soon be over difficulty then party of seven eight scrambling over stone came nearly on level on stood in full view of leading others be captain ewing miss leslie turned on heel to go away when caught sound of step following voice saying oh there be mr cumming want to speak to in minute light hand be on arm why be running away from said marian because oh dont know be not running away have party made up be not going to intrude on what nonsense do come now be going to wonderful grotto thought so ill natured of not joining at dinner indeed know have promised did not answer looked at full in face with sad eye laden with love half understood countenance only half understood be matter maurice said be angry with will come join marian can not do if can leave come with for hour will not keep longer stood hesitating moment while companion remained on spot where have left come miss leslie called captain ewing will have dark before can get down will come with whispered to maurice wait moment tripped back in five minute returned after eager argument with friend there said dont care about grotto one bit will walk with now only will think so odd so started off together before tropical darkness have fallen upon maurice have told tale of love have told in manner differing much from that of marians usual admirer spoke with passion almost with violence declared that heart be so full of image that must not rid of for one minute must wish to do so said if must be marian own marian very own if not then explained to with lover warmth with almost more than lover liberty what be idea of being own very own in doing so inveighed against usual light heartedness in term at rate be strong enough marian bore well perhaps knew that lesson be somewhat deserved perhaps appreciated at value love of such man a maurice cumming weighing in judgment difference between ewings graham then answered well prudently with word startled by prudent seriousness a coming from begged pardon heartily said for grief have caused yet how be to be blamed seeing that have known nothing of feeling father mother have said something to of proposed marriage something very little have answered by saying that did not think maurice have warmer regard for than of cousin after answer father mother have pressed matter further a to own feeling must then say nothing for then knew nothing nothing loved one better than rather that loved one else must ask if must love must give little time for in meantime smiled sweetly at a made promise must endeavour to hing must offend then added that on evening must dance with dance that liked maurice with self denial be not very wise contented with engaging for first quadrille be to dance night in mess room of officer at newcastle scheme have be added on a adjunct to picnic therefore became necessary that lady must retire to own friend house at newcastle to

do youll lose promotion youll never live to be lady rue what will graham say know youve given promise thats not true julia never gave tenth part of promise well say so then word between young lady became little more angry nevertheless in due time came forth with face smiling a usual with hair properly brushed without sign of warfare marian have to stand attack before business of evening commenced be from le doughty antagonist than aunt miss jack miss jack soon found that maurice have not kept threat of going home though did not absolutely learn from that have gone so far towards perfecting dearest hope a to make formal offer to marian nevertheless did gather that thing be fast way tending if only dancing be over said to herself dreading unnumbered waltz with ewing violent polka with graham so miss jack resolved to say one word to marian wise word in good season said miss jack to herself how sweet thing be marian said step here moment want to say word to yes aunt sarah

one day in maurices favour have idea a declared to herself of being lectured by aunt sarah dearest marian said to a quadrille came to close be in power to make so happy so perfectly happy then people

so in tamer manner than be usual with made emulous attempt to dance down other couple when have done must sit down then consented to stand up for two quadrille with two very tame gentleman to whom

gave message then took card looked at hetta who be sitting on side of fireplace facing door went on demurely with work susan gave one glance round back be to stranger then then moved chair little nearer to wall so a to give young man room to come to fire if must did not come eye glanced upon susan bell thought that old man in new york be right that big hotel must be cold dull be pretty face to look on cold evening a turned up from stocking be mending perhaps dont wish to take winter boarder maam said aaron dunn never have done so yet sir said mr bell timidly must let young wolf in among lamb fold might be wolf who must tell mr bell seemed to think must suit said aaron have acquiesced in timidity not pressed point must have be up with widow did not like to go against big uncle so said perhaps may sir guess will finely said aaron then widow seeing that matter be so far settled put down work came round into passage hetta followed for there must be housework to do aaron gave shake settled weekly number of dollar with very little difficulty on part for have caught glance at susans face then went after bag twas thus that aaron dunn obtained entrance into mr bell house what if be wolf said to herself over over again that night though not exactly in word ay there be side to question what if be stalwart man honest minded with clever eye cunning hand ready brain broad back warm heart in want of wife mayhap man can earn own bread anothers dozen others when half dozen come must not that be good sort of lodger such question a too did flit just flit across widow sleepless mind then thought so much more of wolf wolf have taught to think be more common than stalwart honest minded wife desirous men wonder mother consented to take said hetta when be in little room together why shouldnt said susan will be help yes will be little help said hetta have done very well hitherto without winter lodger uncle bell said be to what be uncle bell to said hetta who have spirit of own began to surmise within whether aaron dunn must join baptist congregation whether phineas beckard must approve of new move be very well behaved young man at rate said susan draw beautifully did see thing be doing draw very well dare say said hetta who regarded a poor warranty for good behaviour hetta also have fear of wolf not for perhaps for sister aaron dunns work commencement of work lay at distance from spring left morning with lot of workman by early train almost before daylight morning cold wintry a morning be widow got breakfast with own hand took dollar must not leave altogether to awkward mercy of kate obrien must trust girl to attend upon young man hetta might have trusted then susan must have asked why be spared share of such hardship in evening leaving work when be dark aaron always returned then evening be passed together be passed with most demure propriety woman must make tea cut bread butter then sew while aaron dunn when cup be removed must always go to plan drawing on sunday be more together even on day there be cause of separation for aaron went to episcopalian church rather to disgust of hetta in afternoon however be together then phineas beckard came in to tea on sunday aaron got to talking on religion though disagreed pretty much must not give inch one other nevertheless minister told widow hetta too probably that lad have good stuff in though be so stiff necked must be more modest in talking on such matter with minister said rev phineas acknowledged that perhaps must be honest enough to repeat that lad have stuff in perhaps after be not wolf said widow to herself thing went on in way for above month aaron have declared to over over again that face be sweet to look upon have unconsciously promised to certain delight in talking perhaps walking with owner of walking have not be achieved even talking a yet truth be that dunn be bashful with young woman though must be so stiff necked with minister then felt angry with inasmuch a have advanced no further a lay in bed perhaps pretty hand have helped to make resolved that must be thought bolder in bearing have idea of making love to susan bell of course not why must not amuse by talking to pretty girl when sat so near evening after evening what very quiet young man be said susan to sister have bread to earn stick to work said hetta doubt have amusement when be in city added elder sister not wishing to leave too strong impression of young man virtue have now settled place in parlour hetta sat on one side of fire close to table having side to herself there sat always busy must have made dress bit of linen worn in house hemmed sheet towel so busy be always sometimes once in week so phineas beckard must come in then place be made for between hettas usual seat table for when there must read out loud on other side close also to table sat widow busy not savagely busy a elder daughter between mr bell wall with foot ever on fender susan used to sit not absolutely idle doing work of slender pretty sort talking ever anon to mother opposite to at other side of table far away from fire must aaron dunn place with plan drawing before be judge of bridge maam said aaron evening after have made resolution twas thus began courtship of bridge said mr bell oh dear sir put out hand to take little drawing aaron handed to because thats one ive planned for bit of new branch from moreau up to lake george guess miss susan know something about bridge guess dont said susan only that oughtnt to tumble down when frost come have have have more ought ill tell mcevoy mcevoy have be former engineer on line well that wont burst with frost guess oh how pretty said widow then susan of course jumped up to look over mother shoulder artful dodger have drawn coloured beautiful little sketch of bridge not engineer plan with section measurement vexatious to woman eye graceful little bridge with string of car running under must almost hear bell going well be pretty bridge said susan isnt hetta dont know anything about bridge said hetta to whose clever eye dodge be quite apparent in spite of cleverness mr bell susan have soon moved chair round to table be looking through content of aaron portfolio yet maybe wolf thought poor widow just a be kneeling down to say prayer that evening certainly made commencement though hetta went on pertinaciously with body of new dress other two lady did not put in stitch night from drawing aaron got to instrument before bedtime be teaching susan how to draw parallel line susan found that have quite aptitude for parallel line altogether have good time of that evening be dull to go on week after week month after month talking only to one mother sister be dull though one doe not recognise to be so little change in such matter be so very pleasant susan have not slightest idea of regarding aaron a even possible lover young lady do like conversation of young gentleman oh exceedingly proper prim old lady who be so shocked at a general doctrine have never occurred to that creator have so intended susan understanding little of how why knew that have have good time be rather in spirit a went to bed hetta have be frightened by dodge oh hetta must have looked at drawing be so clever said susan dont know that must have done much good replied hetta good well theyd do more good than long sermon know said susan except on sunday of course added apologetically be ill tempered attack on hetta hettas admirer then why have hetta be so snappish im sure he wolf thought hetta a went to bed what very clever young man be thought susan to a pulled warm clothes round about shoulder ear well that certainly be improvement thought aaron a went through same operation with stronger feeling of self approbation than have enjoyed for time past in course of next fortnight family arrangement altered unless when beckard be there aaron must sit in widow place widow must take susans chair two girl must be opposite then dunn must read to not sermon passage from shakspeare byron longfellow read much better than mr beckard susan have said one night of course youre competent judge have be hettas retort mean that like better said susan well that people dont think alike replied hetta then there be deal of talking widow a unconscious in respect a youngest daughter certainly did find that little variety be agreeable on long winter night talked with unaccustomed freedom beckard came there oftener talked very much when be there two young men did talking pounded other immensely still there grew up sort of friendship between mr beckard seems quite to take to said mr bell to eldest daughter be great good nature mother replied hetta be at end of second month when aaron took step in advance perilous step sometimes on evening still went on with drawing for hour so during three four evening never asked one to look at what be doing on one friday sat over work till late without reading talking at so late that at last mr bell said if youre going to sit much longer mr dunn ill get to put out candle thereby showing have known have that mother confidence in young man be growing fast hetta knew about dreaded that growth be too quick ive finished now said aaron looked carefully at card board on have be washing in water colour ive finished now then hesitated moment ultimately put card into portfolio carried up to bed room who doe not perceive that be intended a present to susan bell question aaron asked that night hardly knew how to answer be must offer drawing to susan in presence of mother sister on occasion when two might be alone together such occasion have ever yet occurred aaron thought that might probably be brought about then wanted to make fuss about first intention have be to chuck drawing lightly across table when be completed so make nothing of have finished with more care than have at first intended then have hesitated when have finished be too late now for plan of chucking over table on saturday evening when came down from room mr beckard be there there be opportunity night on sunday in conformity with previous engagement went to hear mr beckard preach walked to from meeting with family pleased mr bell be very gracious that afternoon sunday be day for picture on thing have become of importance to thing always do when be kept over before tea that evening when came down mr bell susan only be in room knew hetta for foe therefore determined to use occasion miss susan said stammering somewhat blushing too poor fool have done little drawing want to accept put portfolio down on table oh dont know said susan who have seen blush mr bell have seen blush also pursed mouth up looked grave have there be stammering blush might have thought nothing of aaron saw at once that little gift be not to go down smoothly be however in for now so picked out from among other paper in case brought over to susan endeavoured to hand to with air of indifference can not say that succeeded be very pretty well finished water coloured drawing representing still same bridge with more adjunct in susans eye be work of high art of picture probably have seen little liking for artist doubt added to admiration more admired wished for stronger be feeling that ought not to take poor susan stood for minute looking at drawing said nothing not even word of praise felt that be red in face uncourteous to lodger mother be looking at did not know how to behave mr bell put out hand for sketch trying to bethink a did so in what least uncivil way must refuse present took moment to look at collecting thought a did so woman wit came to aid oh dear mr dunn be very pretty quite beautiful picture can not let susan rob of that must keep that for of own particular friend did for said aaron innocently susan looked down at ground half pleased at declaration drawing must look very pretty in small gilt frame put over dressing table matter now be altogether in mother hand be afraid be too valuable sir for susan to accept be not valuable at said aaron declining to take back from widow hand oh be quite sure be be worth ten dollar at least twenty said poor mr bell not in very best taste be perplexed did not know how to get out of scrape article in question now lay upon table cloth appropriated by one at moment hetta came into room be not worth ten cent said aaron with something like frown on brow a have be talking about bridge thought miss susan must accept accept what said hetta then eye fell upon drawing took up be beautifully done said mr bell wishing much to soften matter perhaps more so that hetta demure be now present be telling mr dunn that cant take present of anything so valuable oh dear said hetta wouldnt be right be cold frosty evening in march fire be burning brightly on hearth aaron dunn took up drawing quietly very quietly rolling up a such drawing be rolled put between blazing log be work of four evening chef duvre in way of art susan when saw what have done burst out into tear widow must very readily have done so also be able to refrain merely exclaimed oh mr dunn if mr dunn chooses to burn own picture have certainly right to do so said hetta aaron immediately felt ashamed of what have done also must have cried for manliness walked away to one of parlour window looked out upon frosty night be dark star be bright thought that must like to be walking fast by along line of rail towards balston there stood perhaps for three minute thought must be proper to give susan time to recover from tear will please to come to tea sir said soft voice of mr bell turned round to do so found that susan be gone be not quite in power to recover from tear in three minute then drawing have be so beautiful have be done expressly for too there have be something knew not what in eye a have so declared have watched intently over four evening work wondering why did not show till feminine curiosity have become rather strong be something very particular be sure have learned that precious work have be for now that precious work be destroyed how be possible that must not cry for more than three minute others took meal in perfect silence when be over two woman sat down to work aaron have book pretended to read instead of reading be bethinking that have behaved badly what right have to throw into such confusion by indulging in passion be ashamed of what have done fancied that susan must hate fancying that began to find at same time that by mean hated at last hetta got up left room knew that sister be sitting alone in cold hetta be affectionate susan have not be in fault therefore hetta went up to console mr bell said aaron a soon a door be closed beg pardon for what did just now oh sir im so sorry that picture be burnt said poor mr bell picture doe not matter straw said aaron see have disturbed be afraid have made miss susan unhappy be grieved because picture be burnt said mr bell putting emphasis on intending to show that daughter have not regarded drawing a own emphasis bore meaning so widow perceived a soon a have spoken oh can do twenty more of same if anybody wanted said aaron if do like will let take mr bell just to show that have forgiven that be friend a be before be be not wolf be question mr bell scarcely knew how to answer hetta have given voice saying be lupine mr beckards opinion have not liked to ask directly mr beckard thought must probably propose to hetta a yet have not done so a be still stranger in family did not like in way to compromise susans name indirectly have asked question indirectly also mr beckards answer have be favourable mustnt mean anything sir be widow weak answer when have paused on question for moment oh of course not said aaron joyously face became radiant happy do beg pardon for burning young lady pardon too then rapidly got out cardboard set to work about bridge widow meditating many thing in heart commenced hemming of handkerchief in about hour two girl came back to room silently took accustomed place aaron hardly looked up went on diligently with drawing bridge must be better bridge than other acceptance be now assured of course be to mean nothing be matter of course so worked away diligently said nothing to anybody when went off to bed two girl went into mother room oh mother hope be not very angry said susan angry said hetta if anybody must be angry be mother ought to have known susan must not accept must never have offered he doing said mr bell not for said hetta yes be said mr bell have promised that will take susan a heard sank gently into chair behind eye became full of tear intimation be almost too much for oh mother said hetta particularly said that be to mean nothing oh mother make worse why must hetta interfere in way thought susan to herself have interfered when mr beckard gave testament bound in morocco have not smiled looked gratified kissed sister declared that phineas beckard be nice dear man by far most elegant preacher at spring why must hetta be so cruel dont see that dear said mother hetta must not explain before sister so went to bed on thursday evening drawing be finished not word have be said about at rate in presence have gone on working in silence there said late on thursday evening dont know that will be better if go on daubing for hour there miss susan there bridge hope will burst with frost yet be destroyed by fire gave light flip with finger sent skimming over table susan blushed smiled took up oh be beautiful said isnt beautifully done mother then three got up to look at confessed that be excellently done be sure be very much obliged to said susan after pause remembering that have not yet thanked oh nothing said not quite liking word on following day returned from work to saratoga about noon have never done before therefore one expected that must be seen in house before evening on occasion however went straight thither a chance must have widow elder daughter be out susan be there alone in charge of house walked in opened parlour door there sat with foot on fender with work unheeded on table behind picture aaron drawing lying on knee be gazing at intently a entered thinking in young heart that possessed beauty picture must posse oh mr dunn said getting up holding tell tale sketch behind skirt of dress miss susan have come here to tell mother must start for new york afternoon be there for six week perhaps longer mother be out said im so sorry be said aaron hetta too dear youll be wanting dinner ill go see about aaron began to swear that must not possibly eat dinner have dined once be going to dine again anything to keep from going must have something mr dunn walked towards door put back to miss susan said guess ive be here nearly two month yes sir believe have replied shaking in shoe not knowing way to look hope have be good friend yes sir said susan almost beside a to what be saying im going away now seems to be such time before ill be back will sir six week miss susan then paused looking into eye to see what must read there leant against table pulling to piece morsel of half ravelled muslin held in hand eye be turned to ground must hardly see miss susan continued may a well speak out now a at time too be looking towards ground clearly did not know what to do with hand truth be just love dearly with heart never saw one ever thought so beautiful so nice so good whats more never will im not very good at sort of thing know couldnt go away from saratoga for six week not tell then ceased did not ask for love in return presumption have not got so far a yet merely declared passion leaning against door there stood twiddling thumb susan have not slightest conception of way in ought to receive declaration have never have lover before have ever thought of aaron absolutely a lover though something very like love for have be crossing over spirit now at moment felt that be beau idal of manhood though boot be covered with railway mud though pantaloon be tucked up in roll round ankle be fine well grown open faced fellow whose eye be bold yet tender whose brow be full broad bearing manly love of course loved why else have heart melted with pleasure when mother said that second picture be to be accepted what be to say anything open truth well knew that open truth must not do at what must mother say hetta if be rashly to say that hetta knew must be dead against lover of mother approbation have hardly more hope why must disapprove of aaron a lover have never asked there be many nice thing seem to be wrong only because be so nice maybe that susan regarded lover a one of oh mr dunn shouldnt that in fact be that must say must not said well perhaps not there truth harm ever come of perhaps id better not ask for answer now thought better must know remember only care for one thing now in world be for love then paused thinking possibly that in spite of what have said might perhaps get sort of answer inkling of state of heart disposition towards susan have at once resolved to take at word when suggested that immediate reply be not necessary to say that loved be of course impossible to say that did not be equally so determined therefore to close at once with offer of silence when ceased speaking there be moment pause during strove hard to read what might be written on down turned face be not good at such reading well guess ill go get thing ready now said then turned round to open door mother will be in before be gone suppose said susan have only got twenty minute said looking at watch susan tell what have said to good bye put out hand knew must see again have be plan to get hand in good bye mr dunn gave hand held tight for moment so that must not draw away must not if must will tell mother asked yes answered quite in whisper guess id better tell then gave long sigh pressed hand again got up to lip mr dunn dont said did kiss god bless own dearest dearest girl ill just open door a come down perhaps mr bell will be here then rushed up stair mr bell did not come in hetta be at weekly service at mr beckards meeting house mr beckard seemed have much to say susan when left alone sat down tried to think must not think must only love must use mind only in recounting to herself perfection of demigod whose heavy step be so audible overhead a walked to fro collecting thing putting into bag then just when have finished bethought that must be hungry flew to kitchen be too late before must even reach at loaf of bread descended stair with clattering noise heard voice a spoke quickly to kate obrien miss susan said dont get anything for for im off oh mr dunn be so sorry youll be so hungry on journey came out to in passage will want nothing on journey dearest if youll say one kind word to again eye went to ground what do want to say mr dunn say god bless aaron god bless aaron said yet be sure that have not declared love however thought otherwise went up to new york with happy heart thing happened in next fortnight rather quickly susan at once resolved to tell mother resolved also not to tell hetta afternoon got mother to herself in mr bell own room then made clean breast of what did say to susan said nothing mother nothing dear mother not word told didnt want forgot how have used christian name in bidding god bless oh dear said widow be very wrong asked susan what do think child asked mr bell after while be own feeling mr bell be sitting on chair susan be standing opposite to against post of bed made answer moving from place threw into mother arm hid face on mother shoulder be easy enough to guess what be feeling darling said mother must not think that be engagement said susan sorrowfully young men say thing to amuse wolf must have said have spoken out mind freely oh mother be not like that daughter contrived to extract promise from mother hetta must not be told just at present mr bell calculated that have six week before a yet mr beckard have not spoken out there be reason to suppose that must do so before six week must be over then must be able to seek counsel from mr beckard spoke out at end of six day hetta frankly accepted hope youll love brother in law said to susan oh will indeed said susan in softness of heart at moment almost made up mind to tell hetta be full of own affair thus passed off be then arranged that hetta must go spend week with mr beckards parent old mr beckard be farmer living near utica now that match be declared approved be thought well that hetta must know future husband family so went for week mr beckard went with will be back in plenty of time for to speak to before aaron dunns six week be over said mr bell to herself thing did not go exactly a expected on very morning after departure of engaged couple there came letter from aaron saying that must be at saratoga very evening railway people have ordered down again for day special work then be to go elsewhere not to return to saratoga till june hoped so said letter mr bell must not turn into street even then though summer might have come regular lodger might be expected oh dear oh dear said mr bell to herself reflecting that have one of whom must ask advice that must decide very day why have let beckard go without telling then told susan susan spent day trembling perhaps thought mr bell will say nothing about in such case however must not be duty to say something poor mother trembled nearly a much a susan be dark when fatal knock came at door tea thing be already laid tea cake be already baked for must at rate be necessary to give mr dunn tea susan when heard knock rushed from chair took refuge up stair widow gave long sigh settled dress kate obrien with willing step opened door bade old friend welcome how be lady asked aaron trying to gather something from face voice of domestic miss hetta mr beckard be gone off to utica just man wife like so be more power to oh indeed im very glad said aaron so be very glad to have hetta demure out of way then made way into parlour doubting much hoping much mr bell rose from chair tried to look grave aaron glancing round room saw that susan be not there walked straight up to widow offered hand took might be that susan have not thought fit to tell in such case must not be right for to compromise so said never word subject be too important to mother to allow of being silent when young man stood before oh mr dunn said what be have be saying to susan have asked to be wife said drawing up looking full in face mr bell heart be almost a soft a daughter be nearly gone at moment have nothing to say oh dear oh dear may not call mother said taking hand in oh dear oh dear will be good to oh aaron dunn if deceive child in quarter of hour susan be kneeling at mother knee with face on mother lap mother be wiping tear out of eye aaron be standing by holding one of widow hand be mother too now said what must hetta mr beckard say when came back then surely be not wolf there be four five day left for courtship before hetta mr beckard must return four five day during susan might be happy aaron triumphant mr bell nervous day have said after be only evening be so left morning susan got up to give aaron breakfast mr bell got up also susan boldly declared right to do so mr bell found objection must urge after aaron be always absent till seven eight in evening when must return to tea then came hour two of lover intercourse be very tame hour widow still felt undefined fear that be wrong though heart yearned to know that daughter be happy in sweet happiness of accepted love yet dreaded to be too confident not word have be said about money matter not word of aaron dunns relative so did not leave by waited with what patience must for return of wise counsellor then susan hardly knew how to behave with accepted suitor felt that be very happy perhaps be most happy when be thinking about through long day assisting in fixing little thing for comfort waiting for evening return a sat there in parlour must be happy then too if be allowed to sit still look at not stare at raise eye now again to face for shortest possible glance a have be used to do ever since came there unconscionable lover wanted to hear speak be desirous of being talked to perhaps thought that must by right be allowed to sit by hold hand such privilege be accorded to if have be alone together walking side by side on green turf a lover must walk must soon have found use of tongue have talked fast enough doubt under such circumstance when girl shyness have given way to real intimacy there be in general end to power of chatting though there be much love between aaron susan there be a yet little intimacy then let mother be ever so motherly mother must have more of mother tenderness than mr bell still presence must be

back under pretence of asking after ailment of mr damer now at last be on sand in absolute desert making way up to very foot of most northern of two pyramid be by time surrounded by crowd of arab guide arab professing to be guide who have already ascertained that mr damer be chief of party be accordingly driving almost to madness by offer of service assurance that must not possibly see outside

believe gift have come in egypt to signify money be eternally dinned into ear of stranger by arab suppliant mr damer ought to have known better a during last six week have never shown face out of shepheards hotel without being pestered for backsheish be tired weak foolishly thought to rid herself of man who be annoying sooner have coin dropped from hand into of arab than be surrounded by cluster of beggar who loudly made petition a though must of individually be injured if treated with le liberality than first comer took hold of donkey bridle saddle leg at last arm hand screaming for backsheish in voice be sweet mild in dismay did give away sundry small coin probably that have about only made matter worse money be going man by sufficient energy might hope to get of be very energetic so frightened poor lady that must certainly have fallen have not be kept on seat by pressure around oh dear oh dear get away cried havent got more indeed havent go away tell mr damer oh mr damer then in excess of agony uttered one loud long continuous shriek up came mr damer up came abdallah up came m delabordeau up came mr ingram at last be rescued shouldnt go away leave to mercy of nasty people a to abdallah be of use to anybody why bodder de good lady dem blackguard said abdallah raising stick a though be going to lay low with blow now get noting tief arab for moment retired to little distance like fly driven from sugar bowl be easy to see that like fly must return at first vacant moment now have reached very foot of pyramid proceeded to dismount from donkey intention be first to ascend to top then to come down to banquet after to penetrate into interior must seem to be easy of performance pyramid be undoubtedly high be so constructed a to admit of climbing without difficulty lady mounting must undoubtedly need assistance man possessed of moderate activity must require aid at friend be at once imbued with tremendous nature of task before sheikh of arab came forth who communicated with through abdallah work must be done doubt said great many men must be wanted to assist lady must have four arab gentleman three then seeing that work must be peculiarly severe on special day of numerous arab must be remunerated by very large number of piastre mr damer who be by mean close man in money dealing opened eye with surprise mildly expostulated m delabordeau who be rather close man in reckoning immediately buttoned up breech pocket declared that must decline to mount pyramid at at price then mr ingram descended to combat protestation of men be fearful declared with loud voice eager action manifold english oath that attempt be being made to rob have right to demand sum be charging be shame english gentleman must come take bread out of mouth so

immediately under boy utterly ignoring guide scrambled up quicker than arab must follow mr damer started off at pace soon brought to end of tether from point be dragged up by sheer strength of assistant thereby accomplishing wish of men who induce victim to start a rapidly a possible in order that may soon find helpless from want of wind mr ingram endeavoured to attach to fanny must have be nothing loth to have at right hand instead of hideous brown shrieking one eyed arab who took hold of be soon found that such arrangement be impossible guide felt that if lost own peculiar hold must lose prey held on therefore with invincible tenacity miss dawkins looked too a though have thought to be attended to by christian cavalier christian cavalier be forthcoming m delabordeau be wisest for took matter quietly did a be bid allowed guide nearly to carry to top of edifice have so be top of pyramid be said mr damer bringing out word one by one being terribly out of breath very wonderful

further answer again sat with head resting on hand also if truth must be told be thinking of m lacordaire fondness for herself have squeezed hand have looked into face however much may have be nonsense on mimmys part to talk of such thing have not le absolutely occurred be really fact that m lacordaire be in love with if so what return must must make to passion have looked at yesterday squeezed hand to day might not be probable that must advance step further to morrow if so what answer must be prepared to make to did not think so said to herself that have particular objection to marrying again thompson have be dead now for four year friend friend world must say be wrong on score a to marrying frenchman must not say felt within absolute repugnance to doing that of own country speaking of england a such in truth knew little perhaps cared le have gone to india almost a child england have not be specially kind to on return have found dull cold stiff almost ill natured people there have not smiled on be civil a m lacordaire have done a far a england englishman be considered saw reason why must not marry m lacordaire then a regarded man must in heart say that be prepared to love honour obey m lacordaire certainly knew reason why must not do so did not know much of said to herself at first knew a much said afterwards a have known personally of mr thompson before marriage have known to be sure what be mr thompson profession what income if not one else have known for a to point be quite in dark a regarded m lacordaire personally certainly did like a said to herself more than once there be courtesy softness about be very gratifying to then appearance be so much in favour be not very young acknowledged be young be quite evident that be fond of child that must be kind affectionate father to indeed there be kindness in that did must many again put to herself quite hypothetically must look for romance in such second marriage must be content to sit down in quiet home to tame dull reality of life satisfied with companionship of man who must be kind gentle to whom must respect esteem where must find companion with whom must be more safely anticipated than with m lacordaire so argued question within own breast in manner not unfriendly to gentleman that there be a yet one great hindrance at once saw then might be remedied by word did not know what be income profession chambermaid whom have interrogated have told that be marchand to merchant generally felt that have objection baring rothschild be merchant a be also that wonderful man at bombay sir hommajee bommajee who be worth did not know how many thousand lac of rupee that must behove on own account that of daughter to take care of own little fortune in contracting such connection that felt strongly must never so commit a to put security in respect out of power then did not think that m lacordaire must ever ask to do so at rate be determined on that there must never be doubt on matter a firmly resolved on again took up book for minute two made attempt to read mamma said mimmy will m lacordaire go up to school to see lilian when go away from indeed can not say dear if lilian be good

of preventing mimmy from disclosing more of thought now dear get ready will go up to school mr thompson always dressed with care though not in especially fine clothes before went down to dinner at table dhte on occasion be more than usually particular hardly explained to herself why did nevertheless a stood before glass did in certain manner feel that circumstance of future life might perhaps depend on might be said done that evening have not absolutely decided whether must go to prince chteau if did go well if did what then have sense enough a assured more than once to regulate own conduct with propriety in such emergency during dinner m lacordaire conversed in usual manner said nothing whatever about visit to polignac be very kind to mimmy very courteous to mother did not appear to be at more particular than usual indeed might be question whether be not le so a have entered room mr thompson have said to herself that perhaps after must be better that there must be nothing more thought about before four of five course be over be beginning to feel little disappointed now fruit be on table after consumption of be practice to retire be certainly open to to ask m lacordaire to take tea with evening a have done on former occasion felt that must not do now considering immediate circumstance of case if further step be to be taken must be taken by not by else by mimmy who just a mother be slowly consuming last grape ran round to back of m lacordaires chair whispered something into ear may be presumed that mr thompson did not see intention of movement in time to arrest for did nothing till whispering have be whispered then rebuked child bade not to be troublesome with more than usual austerity in voice desired to get ready to go up stair to chamber a spoke rose from chair made final little bow to table other final little bow smile to m lacordaire be certain to who saw that smile be not a gracious a usual a walked forth m lacordaire rose from chair such being constant practice when left table on occasion accompanied to door have madame decided asked whether will permit to accompany to chteau well really dont know said mr thompson mees meemy continued m lacordaire be very anxious to see rock may perhaps hope that mees lilian must be pleased with little excursion a for myself then m lacordaire put hand upon heart in manner seemed to speak more plainly than have ever spoken well if child must really like a be so very kind said mr thompson so matter be conceded to morrow afternoon suggested m lacordaire mr thompson fixed on saturday thereby showing that be in hurry for expedition oh be so glad said mimmy when have re entered own room mamma do let tell lilian when go up to school to morrow mamma be in humour to say much to child on subject at present moment threw back on sofa in perfect silence began to reflect whether must like to sign name in future a fanny lacordaire instead of fanny thompson certainly seemed a though thing be verging towards such necessity marchand marchand of what have instinctive feeling that people in hotel be talking about m lacordaire be therefore more than ever averse to asking one question a went up to school next afternoon walked through more of street of le puy than be necessary in street looked at name saw over door of more respectable house of business looked in vain might be that m lacordaire be marchand of so specially high quality a to be under necessity to put up name at sir hommajee bommajees name did not appear over door in bombay at least thought not then came saturday morning will be ready at two said a left breakfast table perhaps must not mind calling for lilian on way m lacordaire must be delighted to call anywhere for anybody on behalf of mr thompson then a got to door of salon offered hand did so with so much french courtesy that must not refuse then felt that purpose be more tender than ever have be why not if be destiny fate have prepared for mr thompson must rather have got into carriage at other spot in le puy than at at be forced to do so chief entrance namely of htel de ambassadeurs what made worse be that appearance of special fte be given to occasion m lacordaire be dressed in more than sunday best have on new yellow kid glove coat if not new be newer than mr thompson have yet observed be lined with silk up to very collar have on patent leather boot glittered a mr thompson thought much too conspicuously a for hat be quite evident that be fresh that morning from maker block in costume with hat in hand stood under great gateway of hotel ready to hand mr thompson into carriage must have be nothing if landlord landlady have not be there also a well a man cook four waiter fille de chambre two three other pair of eye mr thompson also saw a glanced round then mimmy walked across yard in best clothes with fte day air about for mother must have liked to have whipped what did matter if be written in book that must become madame lacordaire of course world must know that there must have be preparatory love making let have laugh good husband must not be dearly purchased at so trifling expense so sallied forth with already ceremony of wedding mimmy seated opposite to mother m lacordaire also sat with back to horse leaving second place of honour for lilian pray make comfortable m lacordaire dont mind said mr thompson be firm in purpose of civility perhaps making up mind that when must in truth stand in place of papa to young lady then must be time for having back seat in carriage lilian also in best frock came down school step three of school teacher came with must have added to mr thompson happiness at moment if m lacordaire must have kept polished boot out of sight put yellow glove into pocket then started road from le puy to polignac be nearly up hill very steep bill be so that there be plenty of time for conversation girl have nearly to mimmy thought that have never found m lacordaire so stupid lilian told sister on first safe opportunity occurred that seemed very much a though be going to church do of polignac people ever live at place asked mr thompson by way of making conversation in answer to m lacordaire informed madame that place be at present only ruin then there be again silence till found under rock be informed by driver that rest of ascent must be made on foot rock now stood abrupt precipitous above head be larger in circumference with much larger space on summit than other volcanic rock in close to town then at same time be higher from ground quite a inaccessible except by single path led up to chteau m lacordaire with conspicuous gallantry first assisted mr thompson from carriage then handed down two young lady lady must have be so difficult to please a to complain of yet mr thompson thought that be not a agreeable a usual horrid boot horrid glove gave air of holiday finery that must be at ease wearing must in seeing worn be soon taken in hand by poor woman whose privilege be to show ruin for little distance walked up path in single file not that be too narrow to accommodate two m lacordaires courage have not yet be screwed to point admitted of offering arm to widow for in france must be remembered that mean more than doe in other country mr thompson felt that be silly useless if be not to be dear friend coming out fting together boot glove new hat be very foolish if be sooner understood other better so mr thompson finding that path be steep weather warm stood still for while leaning against wall with look of considerable fatigue in face will madame permit honour of offering arm said m lacordaire road be so extraordinarily steep for madame to climb mr thompson did permit honour so went on till reached top view from summit be extensive grand lilian mimmy be much pleased with place elder sister who have talked over matter with school companion expected fine castle with turret battlement romance other expected pretty smiling house such a

chimney be kitchen of family said guide oh said mr thompson said woman taking into next ruined compartment be kitchen of monsieur et madame what two kitchen exclaimed lilian upon m lacordaire explained that ancestor of prince de polignac have be very great people have therefore required culinary performance on great scale then woman began to chatter something about oracle of apollo there be said hole in rock from in past time perhaps more than hundred year ago oracle used to speak forth mysterious word there said pointing to part of rock at distance be hole if lady must follow to little outhouse be just beyond must show huge stone mouth out of oracle used to speak lilian mimmy declared at once for seeing oracle mr thompson expressed determination to remain sitting where be upon turf so guide started off with young lady will be thought surprising that m lacordaire must have remained alone by side of mr thompson must be now never mr thompson felt a regarded m lacordaire probably entertained idea of same kind mr thompson inclination though have never be very strong in matter be certainly in favour of now m lacordaires inclination be stronger have fully firmly made up mind in favour of matrimony then be not so absolutely in favour of now mr thompson mind if one must have read must have shown great objection to shilly willying a be accustomed to call m lacordaire be not for danger might thence arise must have seen objection to slight further procrastination courage be beginning perhaps to ooze out from finger end declare that girl have scampered away ever so far said mr thompson must madame wish must call back said m lacordaire innocently oh dear child let enjoy will be pleasure to to run about rock suppose will be safe with woman oh yes quite safe said m lacordaire then there be little pause mr thompson be sitting on broken fragment of stone just outside entrance to old family kitchen m lacordaire be standing immediately before have in hand little cane with sometimes slapped boot sometimes poked about among rubbish hat be not quite straight on head having little jaunty twist to one side with reference to by bye mr thompson then resolved that must make change must ever gentleman become own property still wore glove be very smart be clear to see that be not at ease hope heat doe not incommode said after few moment silence mr thompson declared that did not that liked good deal of heat that on whole be very well where be be afraid however that be detaining m lacordaire who might probably wish to be moving about upon rock in answer to m lacordaire declared that never must be so happy anywhere a in close vicinity be too good to said mr thompson almost sighing dont know what stay here must have be without great kindness be madame have be kind to said m lacordaire pressing handle of cane against heart there be then pause after mr thompson said that be french politeness that knew that have be very troublesome to that must now soon be gone then in own country must never forget great goodness ah madame said m lacordaire a said much more be expressed in face than in word then can neither accept reject gentleman by what say in face blushed too up to grizzled hair turning round walked step two away from widow seat back again mr thompson while sat quite still displaced fragment lying a did near corner of building made not uncomfortable chair have only to be careful that did not injure hat crush clothes throw in word here there to assist gentleman must occasion permit madame said m lacordaire on return from second little walk monsieur replied mr thompson perceiving that m lacordaire paused in speech madame began again then a again paused mr thompson looked up to very sweetly madame what be going to say will be afraid seem to evince by far too great audacity on part mr thompson may perhaps have thought that at present moment audacity be not fault replied however that be quite sure that monsieur must say nothing be in way unbecoming for to speak for to hear madame may have ground to hope that such may be sentiment after have spoken madame now went down absolutely on knee on hard stone mr thompson looking about into distance almost thought that saw top of guide cap madame have looked forward to opportunity a one in may declare for greatest passion have ever yet felt madame with heart soul love madame offer to homage of heart hand happiness of life posse in world then taking hand gracefully between glove pressed lip against tip of finger if thing be to be done way of doing be perhaps a good a other be one at rate left doubt whatever a to gentleman intention mr thompson must have have own way must not have allowed lover of fifty to go down upon knee must have spared much of romance of declaration so also must have spared yellow glove polished boot be part of necessity of situation therefore wisely took a matter to be passed over with indifference seeing however that m lacordaire still remained on knee be necessary that must take step toward raising especially a two child guide must infallibly upon before long m lacordaire said surprise greatly pray get up will madame vouchsafe to give small ground for hope girl will be here directly m lacordaire pray get up can talk to much better if will stand up sit down on one of stone m lacordaire did a be bid got up wiped knee of pantaloon with handkerchief sat down beside then pressed handle of cane to heart really have so surprised that hardly know how to answer said thompson indeed can not bring to imagine that be in earnest ah madame be so cruel how can have lived with so long sat beside for so many day without having received image into heart be in earnest ala fear too much in earnest then looked at with eye sighed with strength mr thompson prudence told that must be well to settle matter in one way other a soon a possible long period of love making be fit for younger people than future possible husband object must be to make comfortable if must that must do same for if also be possible a for looking sighings pressing of hand have gone through that twenty year since in india when thompson have be young be still in teen m lacordaire there be so many thing to be considered there hear child coming let walk way for minute turned behind wall placed out of sight walked on few pace till reached parapet stood on uttermost edge of high rock leaning upon continued conversation there be so many thing to be considered said mr thompson again yes of course said m lacordaire one great consideration be love madame to distraction be very much flattered of course lady must so feel m lacordaire madame be attention if must deign to make happy say that one word love m lacordaire a uttered word did not look a saying be at best mr thompson forgave knew that elderly gentleman under such circumstance look at best if consented to to to arrangement must only do so on seeing that must be beneficial at rate not injurious to child that must offer to ourselves fair promise of future happiness ah madame must be dearest wish of heart to be second father to two young lady except indeed then m lacordaire stopped flow of speech in such matter be so much best to be explicit at once said mr thompson oh yes certainly nothing can be more wise that madame happiness of household depends so much on money madame let say word two monsieur lacordaire have enough for child must marry again must not hope be felt a burden by husband must of course be duty to know what be circumstance before accepted of personally have seen nothing that like oh madame a yet know nothing of circumstance m lacordaire perhaps did feel that mr thompson prudence be of strong masculine description hardly liked le on account to give due be not desirous of marrying solely for money sake also wished for comfortable home proposed to give a much a got only have be anxious to wrap up solid cake of business in casing of sugar of romance mr thompson must not have sugar cake might not be worse on account madame not a yet will be made open at disposal said m lacordaire mr thompson bowed approvingly be in business continued m lacordaire business give eight thousand franc year four time eight be thirty two said mr thompson to herself putting franc into pound sterling in manner that have always found to be readiest well so far statement be satisfactory income of three hundred twenty pound year from business joined to own might do very well did not in least suspect m lacordaire of being false so far matter sounded well what be business asked in tone of voice intended to be indifferent nevertheless showed that listened anxiously for answer to question be standing with arm upon wall looking down upon town of le puy have so stood that must see others countenance a talked mr thompson must now perceive that m lacordaire became red in face a paused before answering be near to seeing emotion gently touched arm with hand did to reassure for saw that be ashamed of having to declare that be tradesman a for herself have made up mind to bear with if found a felt sure must find that trade be one must not degrade hitherto indeed in early day have looked down on trade of what benefit have grand idea be to when have returned to england have tried hand at english genteel society one have seemed to care for therefore touched arm lightly with finger that might encourage paused for moment a have said became red then feeling that have shown symptom of shame feeling also probably that be unmanly in to do so shook slightly raised head up somewhat more proudly than be wont looked full in face with more strength of character than have yet seen assume then declared business madame said in very audible not in loud voice madame je suis tailleur having so spoken turned slightly from looked down over valley towards le puy there be nothing more said upon subject a drove down from rock of polignac back to town immediately on receiving announcement mr thompson found that have answer to make withdrew hand felt at once that have received blow be not that be angry with m lacordaire for being tailor be angry with in being tailor have so addressed be surprised disappointed altogether put beyond ease have at rate not expected have dreamed of being banker thought that perhaps might have be wine merchant idea have never gone below jeweller watchmaker when word broke upon ear madame je suis tailleur have felt to be speechless word have not be minute spoken when lilian mimmy ran up to mother oh mamma said lilian thought be lost have searched for over chteau have be sitting very quietly here dear looking at view said mr thompson mamma do wish youd see mouth of oracle be so large so round so ugly put arm into way said mimmy at present moment mamma felt interest in mouth of oracle so walked down together to carriage though way be steep mr thompson managed to pick step without assistance of arm did m lacordaire presume to offer drive back to town be very silent mr thompson did make one two attempt at conversation be not effectual m lacordaire must not speak at ease till matter be settled already have begun to perceive that business be against why be that trade of tailor must be le honourable than of haberdasher even grocer sat next other at dinner a usual here a eye be upon made great struggle to behave in accustomed way even in failed world of htel de ambassadeurs knew that m lacordaire have gone forth to make offer to mr thompson world therefore be full of speculation world must make nothing of m lacordaire did look like rejected man mr thompson did not look like woman who have rejected that offer have be made in everybody agreed from senior habitu of house who always sat at head of table down to junior assistant garon a to reading riddle there be accord among when dessert be done mr thompson a usual withdrew m lacordaire a usual bowed a stood behind own chair did not however attempt to follow when reached door called be at side in moment then whispered in ear also will be of same business when m lacordaire regained table senior habitu junior garon intermediate rank of men at htel de ambassadeurs knew that might congratulate mr thompson have made great struggle speaking for be inclined to think that arrived at last at wise decision aaron trow must wish to declare at beginning of story that will never regard that cluster of islet call bermuda a fortunate island of ancient let professional geographer take up say that one have so accounted that ancient have never be supposed to have gotten so far westward what mean to assert be have ancient be carried thither by enterprise stress of weather must not have given island so good name that neapolitan sailor of king alonzo must have be wrecked here consider to be more likely vexed bermoothes be good name for there be getting in out of without greatest difficulty patient slow navigation be very heart rending that caliban must have lived here can imagine ariel must have be sick of place be certain governor prospero must have be willing to abandon governorship conceive to have be only natural when one regard present state of place one be tempted to doubt whether of governor have be conjuror since day bermuda a world know be british colony at maintain convict establishment most of outlying convict establishment have be sent back upon hand from colony here one be still maintained there be also in island strong military fortress though not fortress looking magnificent to eye of civilian a do malta gibraltar there be also here six thousand white people six thousand black people eating drinking sleeping dying convict establishment be most notable feature of bermuda to stranger doe not seem to attract much attention from regular inhabitant of place there be intercourse between prisoner bermudian convict be rarely seen by convict island be rarely visited a to prisoner of course be not open to must not be open to to have intercourse with prison authority there have however be instance in convict have escaped from confinement made way out among

must runagate have chance of hiding be negro so that one must be known at once clothes be marked only chance of permanent escape must be in hold of american ship what captain of american other ship must willingly encumber with escaped convict nevertheless men have escaped in one instance believe convict got away so that of further tidings be ever heard for truth of following tale will not by mean vouch if one be to inquire on spot one might probably find that lady believe old men young men know exactly how much of be false how much true that steady middle aged well to do islander be quite convinced that be romance from beginning to end reader may range with lady young men steady well to do middle aged islander a please year ago soon after prison be first established on present footing

with idea of injury lashed against bar of cage with feeling that must be well if must so lash till might perish in fury then day came in attempt be made by large body of convict under leadership to get better of officer of prison be hardly necessary to say that attempt failed such attempt always fail failed on occasion signally trow with two other men be condemned to be scourged terribly then

broken cranny on sea shore into sea beat surrounded on side one by huge broken fragment of stone at first sight seemed a though must have admitted of path down among to water edge when scanned more closely be seen to be so large in size that man must climb from one to be singularly romantic spot now well known to there for have visited over over again that morning in there said danny lund keeping well behind morton body pointing at same time to cavern high up among rock quite on opposite side of little inlet of sea mouth of cavern be not twenty yard from where stood at first sight seemed a though must be impossible to reach precipice on brink of now stood ran down sheer into sea fall from mouth of cavern on other side be a steep danny solved mystery by pointing upwards showing how have be used to climb to projecting rock over head from thence creep round by certain vantage of stone till be able to let down into aperture now at present moment be unwilling to make essay of prowess a cragsman have said be up on that projecting rock thrice there have seen eye moving in cavern be quite sure of fact of pair of eye declined to ascend rock again trace soon became visible to by knew that one have passed in out of cavern recently stone when examined bore mark of friction passage repassage over will always give at spot from whence climber left platform commenced ascent side of stone have be rubbed by close friction of man body light boy like danny lund might find way in out without leaving such mark behind heavy man must do so thus before long be satisfied that aaron

course must keep watch ward there though might be for day night be process did not satisfy morton did not indeed well satisfy of be not only that desired to inflict punishment on miscreant in accordance with law also that did not desire that miserable man must die in hole like starved dog that then must go after to take out wretched skeleton there be something in idea so horrid in way that agreed that active step must be taken warder of prison felt that must all be disgraced if must not take prisoner alive yet who must get round perilous ledge in face of such adversary touch to man while climbing there must send headlong down among wave then fancy told to what might be nature of embrace with animal a driven to despair hopeless of life armed a knew at rate with knife if first adventurous spirit must succeed in crawling round that ledge what must be reception might expect in terrible depth of cavern called to prisoner bidding come out telling that must fire in upon if did not show not sound be heard be indeed possible that must send bullet to perhaps corner of cavern if so in way might slaughter even of be not sure who must tell that there might not be protected nook in must lay secure who must tell when man be struck whether be wounded will get to said morton speaking with low dogged voice so saying clambered up to rock to danny lund have pointed many voice at once attempted to restrain one two put hand upon to keep back be too quick for now stood upon ledge of rock can see asked below can see nothing within cavern said morton look down very hard massa said danny very hard indeed down in deep dark hole then see big eye moving morton now crept along ledge rather be beginning to do so having put forward shoulder arm to make first step in advance from spot on be resting when hand be put forth from one corner of cavern mouth hand armed with pistol shot be fired there must be doubt now that danny lund be right doubt now a to whereabouts of aaron trow hand be put forth pistol be fired caleb morton still clinging to corner of rock with arm be seen to falter be wounded said one of voice from below then expected to see fall into sea did not fall after moment two proceeded carefully to pick step along ledge ball have touched grazing cheek cutting through light whisker that wore have not felt though blow have nearly knocked from perch then four five shot be fired from rock into mouth of cavern man arm have be seen indeed one two declared that have traced dim outline of figure sound be heard to come from cavern except sharp crack of bullet against rock echo of gunpowder there have be no groan a of man wounded sound of body falling voice wailing in despair for few second be dark with smoke of gunpowder then empty mouth of cave be again yawning before eye morton be now near still cautiously creeping first danger to be exposed be that enemy within recess might push down from rock with touch on other hand there be three four men ready to fire moment that hand must be put forth then morton must swim be known to be strong swimmer whereas of aaron trow be already declared by prison gaoler that must not swim two of warder have now followed morton on rock so that in event of making good entrance into cavern holding enemy at bay for minute must be joined by aid be strange to see how different men conducted a stood on opposite platform watching attack officer from prison have other thought of prisoner be intent on taking alive dead to be little nothing what became of morton be business to encounter peril be ready to do so feeling however by mean sorry to have such man a morton in advance of very little be said by have wit about remembered that word spoken for guidance of ally must be heard also by escaped convict prey be sure sooner later have not morton be so eager in pursuit must have waited till plan have be devised of trapping without danger townsman from st george of whom dozen be now standing there be quick eager

bold ambition might ultimately witness death struggle nevertheless must fain have saved that last half hour of gradually diminished hope aaron trow be now like hunted fox doomed to be dug out from last refuge with addition to misery that hound when caught prey must not put at once out of misery when first saw that throng of men coming down from hill top resting on platform knew that fate be come when called to to surrender be silent knew that silence be of avail to who be so eager to be captor matter seemed to be still one of considerable difficulty to thinking there be difficulty there be there score of men fully armed within twenty yard of if showed trace of limb must become mark for bullet then if be wounded one must come to if allowed to lie there without food till perished must not be well for to yield then called again be still silent that idea of yielding be very terrible to heart of man when worst have come to worst did not ocean run deep beneath cavern mouth a yelled at

foolish nay mad deed to do poor wretch who have first fallen must not have escaped must not even swim have therefore flung to certain destruction when took that leap from out of cavern mouth must have be sad to see perish beneath wave to watch a rose gasping for breath then to see sinking again to rise again then to go for ever life have be fairly forfeit why must one so much more precious have be flung after be surely with view of saving pitiful life caleb morton have leaped after enemy hound hot with chase will follow stag over precipice dash to piece against rock beast thirsting for blood will rush in even among weapon of men morton in fury have felt one desire burned with one passion if fate must grant to fix clutch in throat of man who have ill used love for rest might all go a must in earlier part of morning while be searching for victim have brought boat up into very inlet among rock same boat have be at hand during whole day unluckily before have come hither have be taken

be very strong man though one of arm be altogether encumbered by antagonist other arm leg be free with seemed to succeed in keeping head above water weighted a be with body of foe trows effort be also used with view of keeping above water though have purposed to destroy in taking leap now hoped for nothing better than might perish together yet struggled to keep head above wave bodily power have none left to except of holding on to morton arm plunging with leg did hold on thus head remained above surface must not last long be easy to see trows strength be nearly spent when went down morton must go with if indeed must be separated if morton must once make free from embrace into have be so anxious to leap then indeed there might be hope round little inlet rock fell sheer down into deep

because must not endure to meet ghost of aaron trow at point of road pass near cottage that ghost of aaron trow may be seen there round little rocky inlet of sea be part of creed of young woman in bermuda mr general talboys why mr general talboys first made up mind to pas winter of at rome never clearly understood to myself explained purpose soon after arrival at eternal city by declaring in own enthusiastic manner that be inspired by burning desire to drink fresh at still living fountain of classical poetry sentiment always thought that there be something more than in classical poetry sentiment be doubtless very dear to so also imagine be substantial comfort of hardover lodge general house in berkshire think that must have emigrated for winter have there not be slight domestic misunderstanding let however be fully made clear that such misunderstanding if existed must have be simply affair of temper impropriety of conduct have be very sure ever be imputed to lady general a world know be hot mr talboys when sweet river of enthusiasm be unfed by congenial water can believe make disagreeable be a may in november mr talboys came among english at rome soon succeeded in obtaining for comfortable footing in society thought more remarkable for mental attribute than for physical perfection nevertheless be in own way sightly woman have special brilliance of eye

mark antony in stigmatising a grievous fault be clear that be virtue with ambition at present have concern enthusiasm also a think lean to virtue side at least if be fault of fault be prettiest then to partake at of virtue even to be in degree pretty enthusiasm must be true bad coin be known from good by ring of so be bad enthusiasm let coiner be ever so clever at art in coining of enthusiasm sound of true gold can never be imparted to fake metal doubt whether cleverest in world can make false enthusiasm palatable to taste of man to taste of woman enthusiasm of woman be never very palatable understood at rome that mr talboys have considerable family four five child be told brought with only one daughter little girl about twelve year of age have torn asunder a told from younger nursling of heart have left to care of devoted female attendant whose love be maternal then said word two about general in term made almost think that quasi maternal love extended beyond child idea however be mistaken one arising from strength of language to be then unaccustomed have since become aware that nothing can be more decorous than old mr upton excellent headnurse at hardover lodge gentleman more discreet in conduct than general talboys may a well here declare also that there must be no more virtuous woman than general wife marriage vow be to paramount to other vow bond whatever general honour be quite safe when sent off to rome by doubt knew that be so illi robur et s triplex of believe weapon of assailant must get better nevertheless used to fancy that have repugnance to impropriety in other woman to what world generally call impropriety invincibly attached to marriage tie must constantly speak of a by mean necessarily binding on others virtuous a griffin of propriety constantly patronised at rate theory of infidelity in neighbour be very eager in denouncing prejudice of english world declaring that have found existence among to be no longer possible for be hot

american be perhaps person most qualified to be styled leader be one who absolutely did gain living ample living too by pen be regarded on side a literary lion justified by success in roaring at tone might please usual roar be not exactly that of sucking dove nightingale be good humoured roar not very offensive to man apparently acceptable enough to lady be big burly man near to fifty a suppose somewhat awkward in gait somewhat loud in laugh though nigh to fifty thus ungainly liked to be smiled on by pretty woman liked a said to be flattered by also if so must have be happy for lady at rome at time made much of conrad mackinnon of mr mackinnon one did make very much yet be one of sweetest dearest quietest little creature that ever made glad man fireside be exquisitely pretty always in good humour never stupid self denying to fault yet be generally in background must seldom come forward of own will be contented to sit behind teapot hear mackinnon do roaring be certainly much given to what world at rome called flirting did not in least annoy be twenty year junior yet never flirted with one woman must tell good natured friend how mackinnon went on received such tidings a excellent joke observing that have always done same doubt always must until be ninety do believe that be happy woman yet used to think that must have be happier there be however knowing inside of man house reading riddle of man joy sorrow have also there lion lion cub entitled to roar little of also must say something charles obrien be young man about twenty five year of age who have sent out from studio in preceding year certain bust supposed by admirer to be unsurpassed by effort of ancient modern genius be judge of sculpture will not therefore pronounce opinion many who considered to be judge declared that be goodish head shoulder nothing more merely mention fact a be on strength of head shoulder obrien separated from throng of others such a in rome walked solitary during day threw at foot of various lady when day be over have ridden on shoulder of bust into prominent place in circle there encountered much feminine admiration from mr general talboys others eighteen twenty of used to meet sunday evening in mr mackinnons drawing room many of indeed be in habit of seeing other daily of visiting together haunt in rome be best loved by art loving stranger here in drawing room be sure to come together here before end of november mr talboys might always be found not in accustomed seat moving about room a different male mental attraction of society might chance to move be at first greatly taken by mackinnon who also be think little stirred by admiration though stoutly denied charge became however very dear to before left certainly owed to love for added infinitely to joy of winter have come here to refresh said to mackinnon one evening to mackinnon for be standing together will get tea said will have something to eat mackinnon asked answered tea yes for heaven sake let nothing solid dispel association of such meeting a thought might have dined early said mackinnon now mackinnon be man whose own dinner be very dear to have seen become hasty unpleasant even under pillar of forum when thought that party be placing fish in jeopardy by desire to linger there too long early yes know not when be one dines sleep in obedience to dull clay weighs down so generally particle of spirit clay may sometimes be forgotten here can always forget thought asked for refreshment said only looked at whose small attempt at prose composition have up to time be altogether unsuccessful then addressed in reply to mackinnon be air breathe fill lung give life light be that refreshes if pure sink into stagnation if be foul let for awhile inhale breath of invigorating literature sit down mr mackinnon have question must put to then succeeded in carrying off into corner a far a must see went willingly enough at time though soon became averse to long retirement in company with mr talboys none of quite understood what be exact idea on subject of revealed religion somebody think have told that there be among one two whose opinion be not exactly orthodox according to doctrine of established english church if so be determined to show that also be advanced beyond prejudice of old dry school of theology have thrown down barrier of religion said to poor mr mackinnon be looking for sentiment of pure christianity thrown down barrier of religion said mr mackinnon in tone of horror be not appreciated indeed yes said mr talboys with exulting voice be not day for such trammel gone by yet hold by christianity pure christianity unstained by blood perjury by hypocrisy verbose genuflection can not worship say prayer among cloud pointed to lofty ceiling handsome chandelier ida go to church said mr mackinnon ida talboys be daughter now may be observed that many who throw down barrier of religion so far a barrier may affect still maintain on behalf of child yes said mr talboys dear ida soft spirit be not yet adapted to receive perfect truth be obliged to govern child by strength of prejudice then moved away for be seldom that mr talboys remained long in conversation with lady mackinnon believe soon became tired of liked flattery at first declared that be clever nice niceness be too purely celestial to satisfy mundane taste mackinnon can revel among cloud in own writing can leave sometimes in doubt whether ever mean to come back to earth when foot be on terra firma love to feel earthly substratum support weight with woman like hand can remain unnecessary moment within own eye can glisten with sparkle of champagne heart weak enough to make owner arm tremble within own beneath moonlight gloom of coliseum arch dash of sentiment while make thing sweeter sentiment alone will not suffice for mr talboys did believe drink glass of champagne a do other lady with have such pleasing effect loosened only tongue never eye arm think never trembled hand never lingered general be always safe happy perhaps in solitary safety so happened that have unfortunately among two artist who have quarrelled with wife obrien whom have before mentioned be one of in case believe to have be almost a free from blame a man can be whose marriage be in fault however have wife in ireland ten year older than though might sometimes almost forget fact friend neighbour be well aware of in other case whole fault probably be with husband be ill tempered bad hearted man clever enough without principle be continually guilty of great sin of speaking evil of woman whose name must have be anxious to protect in case friend mr talboys took warm interest in of sympathised with present husband against absent wife of consolation offered in latter instance used to hear something from mackinnon must repeat to wife to wife conversation have with poor brown must say pity with very heart blood be aware that have comforted in desolation mackinnon replied know very well to what allude think may say that be conversant with circumstance of heart blighting sacrifice mr talboys be apt to boast of thorough confidence reposed in by in whom took interest yes have sought such comfort in love a hard cruel world must allow perhaps something more than said mackinnon have family here in rome know two little baby know know said cherub angel a spoke looked up into ugly face of marcus aurelius for be standing at moment under figure of great horseman on campidoglio have seen be child of innocence if blood of howard ran in vein must not make birth more noble not if father mother of howard have never be married said mackinnon what that from mr mackinnon said mr talboys turning back with energy upon equestrian statue looking up into face first of pollux then of castor a though from might gain inspiration on subject marcus aurelius in coldness have denied to from who have so nobly claimed for mankind divine attribute of free action from who have taught mind to soar above petty bond one man in littleness contrives for subjection of brother mackinnon who be so great now looked up into face mackinnon unsay word be illegitimate said if there be landed property landed property that from american child be english know landed property time will shortly come ay see coming when hateful word will be expunged from calendar when landed property will be no more what will free soul of god born man submit for ever to such trammel a will never escape from clay so long have manacled subtler particle of divine spirit ay yes mackinnon then took by arm led to top of huge step lead down from campidoglio into street of modern rome look down upon countless multitude mackinnon looked down saw three group of french soldier with three four little men in group saw also couple of dirty friar three priest very slowly beginning side ascent to church of ara cli look down upon countless multitude said mr talboys stretched arm out over half deserted city be escaping now from trammel now now now that be speaking have escaped long ago from such trammel a of landed property said mackinnon ay from terrestrial bond continued not exactly remarking pith of last observation from bond quasi terrestrial quasi celestial full formed limb of present age running with quick stream of generous blood will no longer bear ligature past time have woven for decrepit look down upon multitude mackinnon will be free then still clutching by arm still standing at top of stair gave forth prophecy with fury of sybil will be free oh rome thou eternal one thou who hast bowed thy neck to imperial pride priestly craft thou who hast suffered sorely even to hour from nero down to pio nono day of thine oppression be over gone from thy enfranchised way for ever be clang of prtorian cohort more odious drone of meddling monk yet a mackinnon observed there still stood dirty friar small french soldier there still toiled slow priest wending tedious way up to church of ara cli be mundane view of matter view not regarded by mr talboys in ecstasy o italia continued o italia una one indivisible in thy right indivisible also in thy wrong to be given to see accomplishment of thy glory people will arise around thine altar greater in annals of world than thy scipio thy gracchi thy csars not in torrent of blood with scream of bereaved mother will thy new triumph be stained mind will dominate over matter doomed together with pope bourbon with cardinal diplomatist police spy ignorance prejudice will be driven from thy smiling terrace then rome will again become fair capital of fairest region of europe will flock artisan of world crowding into thy mart that god man can give wealth beauty innocence will meet in thy street there will be considerable change before take place said mackinnon there will be considerable change answered mackinnon to thee be given to read sign of time hast thou not read why have field of magenta solferino be piled with corps of dying hero why have water of mincio ran red with blood of martyr that italy might be united rome immortal here standing on capitolium of ancient city say that will be so thou mackinnon who hearest knowest that word be true there be not then in rome may almost say there be not in italy englishman american who did not wish well to cause for italy be be still contending a also there be hardly one who doe not now regard cause a well nigh triumphant nevertheless be almost impossible to sympathise with mr talboys a mackinnon said flew so high that there be comfort in flying with well said brown rest of be down below will go join poor brown how be that in speaking of trouble be led on to heart stirring theme yes have seen sweet angel tell also have seen mother insisted on going to when heard history from what be like mr talboys well education have done more for of than for others there be from whose moral sentiment might thankfully draw lesson whose manner outward gesture be not such a custom have made agreeable to know can understand have seen feel sure that be pure in heart high in principle have not sacrificed be not self sacrifice surest guarantee for true nobility of character must mr mackinnon object to bringing together mackinnon be obliged to declare that thought wife must object from time forth mr talboys ceased to be very close in friendship still came to house sunday evening still refreshed at fountain of literary rill special prophecy from henceforth be poured into other ear so happened that obrien now became chief ally remember that troubled much further with cherub angel with mother be inclined to think that taking up warmly a did story of obriens matrimonial wrong forgot little history of brown be that a may mr talboys obrien now became strictly confidential must enlarge by half hour together on misery of friend position to one whom must get to hear ill tell what fanny mackinnon said to wife one day to wife to mine for be together will have row in house if dont take care obrien will be making love to mr talboys nonsense said mr mackinnon be always thinking that somebody be going to make love to one somebody always be said shes old enough to be mother said mr mackinnon what doe matter to irishman said mackinnon besides doubt if there be more than five year difference between there must be more than said wife ida talboys be twelve know be not quite sure that ida be eldest if have son in guard must make difference said mackinnon there be men who consider bound to make love to woman under certain circumstance let age of lady be what may obrien be such one if sympathises with much oftener will mistake matter go down on knee ought to put on guard said addressing to wife indeed will do such thing said if be two fool must like other fool pay price of folly a rule there must be softer creature than mr mackinnon seemed to that tenderness never extended in direction of mr talboys just at time towards end be of november made party to visit tomb lie along appian way beyond most beautiful of sepulchre tomb of cecilia metella be delicious day have driven along road for couple of mile beyond wall of city enjoying most lovely view neighbourhood of rome affords looking over wondrous ruin of old aqueduct up towards tivoli palestrina of environs of rome be on fair clear day most enchanting here perhaps among world of tomb thought almost memory of old old day come upon one with greatest force grandeur of rome be best seen understood from beneath wall of coliseum beauty among pillar of forum arch of sacred way history fall become more palpable to mind more clearly realised out here among tomb where eye rest upon mountain whose shade be cool to old roman a to than anywhere within wall of city here look out at same tivoli same prneste glittering in sunshine embowered among far off valley be dear to blue mountain have not crumbled away into ruin within rome can see nothing a saw party consisted of dozen fifteen person a hamper with luncheon in have be left on grassy slope at base of tomb of cecilia metella expedition have in something of nature of picnic mr talboys be of course with ida talboys obrien also be there hamper have be prepared in mr mackinnons room under immediate eye of mackinnon therefore be regarded a dominant spirit of party wife be leagued with mr mackinnon a be usually case there seemed to be general opinion among who be closely in confidence together that something must happen in obrien talboys matter two have be inseparable on previous evening for mr talboys have be urging on young irishman counsel respecting domestic trouble sir cresswell cresswell have told be refuge why must soul submit to bond world have now declared to be intolerable divorce be not now privilege of dissolute rich spirit be incompatible need no longer be compelled to fret beneath same couple in short have recommended to go to england get rid of wife a must with little encouragement have recommended man to get rid of anything be sure that have be skilfully brought on to subject might have be induced to pronounce verdict against such ligature for body a coat waistcoat trowsers aspiration for freedom ignored bound in theory there be barrier be not willing to demolish poor obrien a now began to see have taken matter amiss have offered to make bust of mr talboys have consented expressing wish that might

must be fool enough to make avowal of love to mr talboys might be expected a thought to do now watched a made for gap in wall led through into large enclosed space of old circus have be arena for chariot game have gone down with avowed purpose of searching where might have be meta ascertaining how driver must have turned when at full speed for awhile have heard voice rather voice especially heart of man obrien must suffice for emergency have heard say have assumed strange habit of calling men by simple name a men address other when did to mackinnon who be much older than have be amused by other lady of party have taken to call mackinnon when mr talboys be not by have felt comedy to be le safe with obrien especially when on one occasion heard address a arabella did not seem to be in

must have seemed most natural thing in world to do so have nothing out of way be expected a be remained there round tomb quizzing little foible of dear friend hoping that obrien must be quick in what be doing that must undoubtedly get slap in face metaphorically felt certain for none of doubted rigid propriety of lady intention of strolled into building of got out on to road of be thinking that

perhaps simply with tone have hardly sufficed to satisfy proud spirit of girl loved by time have confessed to herself that loved with heart have made such confession to to have spoken no word granted favour that lover might rightfully regard a token of love returned have listened to a spoke bade keep such saying for drawing room of fashionable friend then have spoken out have asked for hand not

patience did not find so pleasant a first day after engagement there be something in lover manner something at first must not define by degree seemed to grate against feeling be sufficiently affectionate that being matter on did not require much demonstration joined to affection there seemed to be hardly liked to suggest to herself harsh word must be possible that be beginning to think that be not good enough for then asked question be good enough for if there be doubt about that match must be broken off though tore own heart out in struggle truth however be that have begun that teaching have already found to be so necessary now have one essayed to teach patience german mathematics with young lady free consent believe that must have be found meek scholar be not probable that

in world esteem greater man than mine be doubtless true enough that a man be richer than be a woman be doubtless also true dishonour also if thing can weigh with now patience think can hardly know what word be saying to pardon think hing that can give gift of description can weigh aught against be giving if have wealth rank of greatest lord in land must count a nothing in such scale if a have

connected that be now useful member of parliament working on committee three four day week with zeal be indefatigable sometimes not often a think of patience woolsworthy gratified smile come across face george walker at suez of spot on world surface that george walker of friday street london have ever visited suez in egypt at head of red sea be by far vilest most unpleasant least interesting there be woman there water vegetation be surrounded indeed often filled by world of sand scorching sun be always overhead one be domiciled in huge cavernous hotel seems to have be made purposely destitute of comfort of civilised life nevertheless in looking back upon week of life spent there always enjoy certain sort of triumph rather upon one day of week lends sort of halo not only to sojourn at suez to whole period of residence in egypt be free to confess be not great man at rate in earlier part of career have hankering after homage be paid to greatness must fain have be popular orator feeding on incense tendered to by thousand failing that man born to power whom around be compelled to respect perhaps to fear be not ashamed to acknowledge believe that most of neighbour in friday street must own a much be a candid open hearted a myself be now time since be recommended to pas first four month of year in cairo because have sore throat doctor may have be right will never divest myself of idea that partner wished to be rid of while made certain change in management of firm must not otherwise have shown such interest time blew nose relieved huskiness by slight cough must not have be so intimate with surgeon from st bartholomews who dined with twice at albion must have gone to work directly that back be turned have done very thing must not have done have remained at home be that a may be frightened went to cairo while there made trip to suez for week be not happy at cairo for knew nobody there people at hotel be a thought uncivil seemed to a though be allowed to go in out merely by sufferance yet paid bill regularly week house be full of company company be made up of party of two three seemed to have own friend did make attempt to overcome terrible british exclusiveness noli tangere with englishman arm in think necessary to envelop wife be in vain found sitting down to breakfast dinner day after day a much alone a must do if called for chop at separate table in cathedral coffee house yet at breakfast dinner made one of assemblage of thirty forty people thought dull a stood one morning on step before hotel bethinking that throat be a well a ever remembered to be be suddenly slapped on back never in life did feel more pleasant sensation turn round with more unaffected delight to return friend greeting be a though cup of water have be handed to in desert knew that cargo of passenger for australia have reached cairo that morning be to be passed on to suez a soon a railway must take did not therefore expect that greeting have come from sojourner in egypt must perhaps have explained that even tenor of life at hotel be disturbed four time month by flight through cairo of flock of traveller who like locust eat up that there be eatable at inn for day sat down at same table with never mixing with having separate interest hope being often a thought somewhat loud almost selfish in expression of flock consisted of passenger passing repassing by overland route to from india australia have nothing else to tell must delight to describe watched of habit manner outward bound being so different in trait from brother on return have to tell of own triumph at suez must therefore hasten on to say that on turning round quickly with outstretched hand found clasped by john robinson well robinson be holloa walker what be doing here that of course be style of greeting elsewhere must not have cared much to meet john robinson for be man who have never done well in world have be in business connected with fairly good house in sise lane have married early thing have not exactly gone well with dont think house broke did so be driven to take five child off to australia elsewhere must not have cared to come across be positively glad to be slapped on back by anybody on landing place in front of shepheards hotel at cairo soon learned that robinson with wife child indeed with rest of australian cargo be to be passed on to suez afternoon after while agreed to accompany party have made up mind on coming out from england must see wonder of egypt hitherto have seen nothing did ride on one day fifteen mile on donkey to see petrified forest guide who called dragoman took wrong cheated in way rode day over stony sandy plain seeing nothing with terrible wind filled mouth with grit at last dragoman got off dere said picking up small bit of stone dis be de forest made of stone carry home then turned round rode back to cairo chief observation a to country be that whichever way went wind blew into teeth day work cost five twenty shilling since have not a yet made other expedition be therefore glad of opportunity of going to suez of making journey in company with acquaintance at time railway be open a far a remember nearly way from cairo to suez did not run four five time day a railway do in other country four five time month in fact only carried passenger on arrival of flock passing between england eastern possession there be train passing backwards forward constantly a perceived in walking to from station a learned carried nothing labourer working on line water sent into desert for use struck forcibly at time must not have liked to have money in investment well went with robinson to suez journey like everything else in egypt be sandy hot unpleasant railway carriage be pretty fair have room enough even in dust be great nuisance travelled about ten mile hour stopped about hour at ten mile be tedious have cigar with trifle of brandy water in manner railway journey wore away in middle of night however be moved from railway carriage into omnibus a be called then be not comfortable omnibus be wooden box placed upon pair of wheel supposed to be capable of carrying six passenger be thrust into one with robinson wife five child immediately began to repent of good nature in accompanying to vehicle be attached four horse mule must acknowledge that a on railway went a slow a possible so now in conveyance dragged through sand went a fast a beast must be made to gallop remember fox tally ho coach on birmingham road when boyce drove a regard pace fox tally ho be nothing to machine in egypt on first going off be jolted right on to mr r infant for long time that lady thought that child have be squeezed out of proper shape at last arrived at suez baby seemed to to be right when be handed down into boat at robinson be allowed time to breakfast at cavernous hotel looked to like scheme to save expense of passenger meal on board ship then be off shook hand with heartily a parted with at quay wished well through trouble man who take wife five young child out into colony that with pocket indifferently lined certainly have trouble before so have at home doubt judging for must always prefer sticking to old ship a long a there be bag of biscuit in locker poor robinson have never heard word of since day sincerely trust that baby be none worse for little accident in box now have prospect of week before at suez robinson have not be gone hour before began to feel must have be better off even at cairo secured bedroom at hotel might have secured sixty bedroom have wanted then went out stood at front door gate be large house built round quadrangle looking with one front towards head of red sea with other into on sandy dead looking open square there stood for ten minute finding that be too hot to go forth returned to long cavernous room in have breakfasted in long cavernous room be destined to eat meal for next six day now at cairo must at rate see fellow creature at food so lit cigar began to wonder whether must survive week be now clear to that have done very rash thing in coming to suez with robinson somebody about place have asked name have told plainly george walker never be ashamed of name yet never have cause to be believe at day will go a far in friday street a other man may be popular may not that depends mostly on circumstance be in trifling value of name depends on way in be known at bank have never dealt in tea spoon gravy spoon name will go a far a name george walker answered therefore in tone of little authority to man who asked who sat inside gate of hotel in old dressing gown slipper be melancholy day with twenty time before dinner did wish back at cairo have be travelling night therefore hoped that might get through little time in sleeping mosquito attacked moment laid down in other place mosquito torment only at night at suez buzz around without ceasing at hour scorching sun be blazing overhead absolutely forbade to leave house stood for while in verandah looking down at few small vessel be moored to quay there be life in not sail be set not boatman sailor be to be seen very water looked a though be hot must fancy glare of sun be cracking paint on gunwale of boat be only visitor in house during long hour of morning seemed a though servant have deserted dined at four not that chose that hour because choice be given to at hotel in egypt one have to dine at hour fixed by landlord entreaty will suffice to obtain meal at other so at four dined after dinner be again reduced to despair be sitting in cavernous chamber almost mad at prospect of week before when noise a of various foot in passage leading from quadrangle be possible that other human being be coming into hotel christian human being at whom must look whose voice must hear whose word must understand with whom might possibly associate did not move however for be still hot knew that chance might be better if did not show over eager for companionship at first moment door however be soon opened saw that at least in one respect be destined to be disappointed stranger who be entering room be not christian if might judge by nature of garment in be clothed door have be opened by man in old dressing gown slipper whom have seen sitting inside gate be arab porter of hotel a marwilled new visitor into room heard pronounce sound similar to own name perceived that pointed out to most prominent person of who then entered apartment be stout portly man dressed from head to foot in eastern costume of brightest colour wore not only red fez cap everybody wear even have accustomed to fez cap turban round of voluminous fold be snowy white face be fat not le grave lower part of be enveloped in magnificent beard projected round on side touched breast a walked be grand grizzled beard acknowledged at moment that added singular dignity to appearance of stranger flowing robe be of bright colour under garment fitted close round breast then descended becoming beneath sash pair of loosest pantaloon might perhaps better describe a bag be rich tawny silk loose pantaloon be tied close round leg above ankle over pair of scrupulously white stocking on foot wore pair of yellow slipper be manifest to at glance that arab gentleman be got up in best raiment that expense have be spared on suit here can not make remark on personal bearing of arab whether be arab turk copt be always same be mean false cowardly race believe will bear blow respect man who give fear go further with than love between man man understand nothing of forbearance who doe not exact from that can exact be simply fool in estimation to extent of loses in be immeasurably inferior to who have have christian teaching in one thing beat always know how to maintain personal dignity look at friend partner judkins a stand with hand in trouser pocket at door of house in friday street what can be meaner than appearance be stumpy short podgy man then so also be arab friend at suez judkins be always dressed from head to foot in decent black cloth suit coat be ever dress coat be old shabby on head carry shining new silk hat such a fashion in metropolis demand judkins be rather dandy than otherwise piquing somewhat on apparel yet how mean be appearance a compared with appearance of arab how mean also be gait how ignoble step judkins must buy that arab out four time over hardly feel loss yet be to enter room together judkins must know acknowledge by look that be inferior personage not le must personal quarrel arise between must judkins punch arab head ay reduce to utter ignominy at foot judkins must break heart in despair rather than not return blow whereas arab must put up with indignity of sort nevertheless judkins be altogether deficient in personal dignity often thought a hour hung in egypt whether might not be practicable to introduce oriental costume in friday street at moment a arab gentleman entered cavernous coffee room felt be greatly inferior personage be followed by four five others dressed somewhat a though by mean in such magnificent colour by one gentleman in coat trouser gentleman in coat trouser came last must see that be one of least of number a for felt almost overawed by dignity of stout party in turban seeing that came directly across room to place where be seated got upon leg made sign of christian obeisance be little man not podgy a be judkins flatter showed more deportment at rate than must have exhibited made a have said christian obeisance bobbed head be rubbing hand together while expressed opinion that be fine day if be civil a hope be arab be much more so advanced till be about six pace from then placed right hand open upon silken breast inclining forward with whole body made to bow judkins never must accomplish turban flowing robe might be possible in friday street of what avail must be outer garment mere symbol if inner sentiment of personal dignity be wanting have often since tried when alone must never accomplish anything like bow arab with flowing robe bowed other arab bowed also after that christian gentleman with coat trouser made leg made leg also rubbing hand again added to former remark that be rather hot dat berry true said porter in dirty dressing gown who stood by must see at glance that manner of porter towards be greatly altered began to feel comforted in wretchedness perhaps christian from friday street with plenty of money in pocket must stand in higher esteem at suez than at cairo if so that alone must go far to atone for apparent wretchedness of place at cairo have not received that attention have certainly be due to a second partner in flourishing manchester house of grime walker judkins now a friend with beard again bowed to felt that deficiency be to be made up be clear however that new acquaintance though liked manner of must be attended with considerable inconvenience for arab gentleman commenced address to in french have always be to source of sorrow that parent did not teach french language deficiency on part have given rise to incredible amount of supercilious overbearing pretension on part of judkins who after can hardly do more than translate correspondent letter believe that must have understood that arab oration at rate did not went on to end however speaking for three four minute then again bowed if must only have learned that bow might still have be greater than judkins with french be very sorry said dont exactly follow french language when be spoken ah french said arab in very broken english dat be one sorrow how be that fellow learn language under sun afterwards found that man must talk italian turkish armenian fluently say few word in german a must also in english must not ask for dinner in other language than english if be to save from starvation then called to christian gentleman in pantaloon a far a must understand made over to duty of interpreting between there seemed however to be one difficulty in way of being carried on with efficiency christian gentleman must not speak english knew of perhaps something more than did arab by mean enough to enable to have fluent conversation have interpreter who turned out to be italian from trieste attached to austrian consulate at alexandria have interpreter spoken english with greatest ease must have have considerable difficulty in understanding digesting in bearing proposition made to before proceed to proposition must describe ceremony took place previous to discussion have hardly observed when first procession entered room that one of friend follower friend name a learned afterwards be mahmoud al ackbar will therefore call mahmoud that one of mahmouds follower bore in arm bundle of long stick that carried iron pot tray such be case two follower came forward to perform service while having be literally pressed down on to sofa by mahmoud watched in progress mahmoud also sat down not word be spoken while ceremony went on man with stick first placed

brought coffee in little tin cup black coffee without sugar full of grit of berry have be only bruised not ground took cup swallowed mixture for must not refuse wish might have asked for milk sugar nevertheless there be something very pleasing in whole ceremony at last began to find more at home with pipe when mahmoud have exhausted tobacco perceived that also have ceased to puff forth smoke

seeing in good company have not heard of well of moses before now learned that be in asia in quarter of globe to be reached by transit of red sea to be returned from by journey on camel back burned with anxiety to visit water what story must be for judkins be doubt point at israelite have passed of water have drunk almost felt that have already found one of pharaoh chariot wheel readily gave assent then with much ceremony many low salaam mahmoud attendant left be very glad came to suez said to myself did not sleep much that night for mosquito of suez be very persevering be saved from agonising despair animal so frequently produce by agreeable thought a to mahmoud al ackbar will put to of reader who have travelled whether be not painful thing to find one regarded among stranger without kindness ceremonious courtesy have on account be wretched at cairo be to be made up to at suez nothing must be more pleasant than whole conduct of mahmoud al ackbar determined to take full advantage of not caring overmuch what might be nature of previous favour to have alluded that be look out if be satisfied why must not be so also on following morning be dressed at six looking out of bed room saw boat in be to be wafted into asia being brought up to quay close under window have be arranged that must start early so a to avoid mid day sun breakfast in boat mahmoud in way engaged to provide with two refection take rest at noon in pavilion have be built close upon well of patriarch then eat dinner return riding upon camel in cool of evening nothing must sound more pleasant than

going into boat became aware that must not depend altogether for morning repast on gritty coffee friend mahmouds follower prepared have promised to be ready at six having carefully completed toilet put clean collar comb into pocket ready for dinner descended to great gateway walked slowly round to quay a passed out porter greeted with low obeisance walking on felt stepped ground with sort of dignity of have before be ignorant be not a rule man who give grace honour to position position confers grace honour upon man have often envied solemn gravity grand demeanour of lord chancellor a have seen on bench almost think that even judkins must look grave dignified under wig mahmoud al ackbar have called upon done honour felt personally capable of sustaining before people of suez honour have done a walked forth with proud step from beneath portal perceived looking down from square along street that there be already commotion in town saw flowing robe of many arab with back turned towards thought that observed identical gown turban of friend mahmoud on back head of stout short man who be hurrying round corner in distance felt sure that be mahmoud of servant have failed in preparation said to myself a made way round to water edge be only testimony how anxious be to do honour stood for while on edge of quay looking into boat admiring comfortable cushion be luxuriously arranged around seat men who be at work did not know be unnoticed must soon take place upon softest of cushion walked slowly backwards forward on quay listening to hum of voice came to from distance there be clearly something stirring in town felt certain that movement distant voice be connected in way with expedition to well of moses at last there came lad upon walk dressed in frank costume asked what be in wind be clerk attached to english warehouse told that there have be arrival from cairo knew more than have heard that omnibus have just come in must be possible that mahmoud al ackbar have heard of old acquaintance have gone to welcome also at first idea on subject be altogether pleasant by mean wished to monopolise delight of cushion must be to cause of sorrow that there must be one to share with conversational power of interpreter must guest be found might also be englishman might thus form acquaintance must be desirable thinking of thing walked quay for minute in happy state of mind by degree became impatient by degree also disturbed in spirit observed that one of arab boatman walked round from vessel to front of hotel that on return looked at a thought not with courteous eye then also saw rather heard one in verandah of hotel above be conscious be being viewed from thence walked walked nobody came to perceived by watch that be seven oclock noise too have come nearer nearer be now aware that wheel have be drawn up before front door of hotel that many voice be speaking there might be that mahmoud must wait for other friend why did not send one to inform then a made sudden turn at end of quay caught sight of retreating leg of austrian interpreter became aware that have be sent down have gone away afraid to speak to what can do said to myself can keep ground owned that feared to go round to front of hotel so still walked slowly up down length of quay began to whistle to show be not uneasy arab sailor looked at uncomfortably from time to time one peered at round corner be now fully half past seven sun be becoming hot in heaven why did not hasten to place beneath awning in boat have just made up mind must go round to front penetrate mystery when on turning saw approaching to man dressed at rate like english gentleman a came near to raised hat accosted in own language mr george walker believe said yes said with little attempt at high demeanour of firm of grime walker judkins friday street london most respectable house be sure said be afraid there have be little mistake here no mistake a to respectability of house said felt be again alone in world that

mahmoud be ashamed to face after what have occurred if wont object to withdraw with into hotel ill explain felt a though thunderbolt have fallen must say that even up to day think that consul might have be little le abrupt can get in here said evidently in hurry pointing to small door opened out from one corner of house to quay what must do follow did follow in few word learned remainder of

to get through a much work a must do interest in matter support man went sir george a be well assured have never heard word about have done so be probable that must have requested attendance mahmoud follower doubt kept own counsel a to little mistake there went gentle rippling breeze filled sail pleasantly a boat moved away into bay felt spite against of mahmoud why have avoided with such cowardice must still see when morning tchibouk be handed to sir george though wished harm did envy a lay there reclining luxuriously upon cushion more wretched day than never spent in life a went in out porter at gate absolutely scoffed at once made up mind to complain within house what must have said of dirty arab must have told that be religion national observance meant for courtesy can man do

in order to escape returning party be again on quay at six next morning on occasion stepped boldly into boat very moment that came along shore there be nothing in world like paying for what use saw to bottle of brandy cold meat acknowledged that cigar out of own case must suit better than long stick long stick might do very well for governor of pegu must be highly inconvenient in friday street well be not going to give account of day journey here though perhaps may do so day did go to well of moses if small dirty pool of salt water lying high above sand can be called well did eat dinner in miserable ruined cottage graced by name of pavilion ala for poor bone did ride home upon camel if sir george did so early started for pegu next morning be informed such be fact must have be made of iron laid in bed whole day suffering greviously be told that on journey must have slakened throat with orange not with brandy survived four terrible day remained to at suez after month be once again in friday street suffered greatly on occasion be consolation to to reflect smoked pipe of peace with mahmoud al ackbar saw hero of begum while journeying out to new triumph at pegu sailed into asia in own yacht hired for occasion that rode back into africa on camel can judkins with ill nature rob of remembrance mistletoe bough let boy have if like said mr garrow pleading to only daughter on behalf of two son pray dont mamma said elizabeth garrow only mean romping to be detestable be sure be not sort of thing that miss holmes must like always have at christmas when be young mamma world be so changed point in dispute be one very delicate in nature hardly to be discussed in bearing even in fiction very mention of between mother daughter showed great amount of close confidence between be le than must branch of mistletoe frank garrow have brought home with out of lowther wood be hung up on christmas eve in dining room at thwaite hall according to wish must permission for such hanging be positively refused be clearly thing not to be done after such discussion therefore decision given by mr garrow be against be inclined to think that miss garrow be right in saying that world be changed a touching misletoe bough kissing fear be le innocent now than used to be when grand mother be alive have become more fastidious in amusement nevertheless think that made fairly open to raillery with brother attacked honi soit qui mal y pense said frank who be eighteen nobody will want to kiss lady fineairs said harry who be just year younger because choose to be puritan there be to be no more cake ale in house said frank still water run deep know that said boy have not be present when matter be decided between mr garrow daughter have mother be present when little amenity have passed between brother sister only that mamma have said wouldnt seem to go against said frank id ask father wouldnt give way to such nonsense know elizabeth turned away without answering left room eye be full of tear must not let see that have vexed be only two day home from school for last week before coming thought have be to prepare for christmas pleasure have arranged room making everything warm pretty out of own pocket have bought shot belt for one skate for other have told old groom that pony be to belong exclusively to master harry for holiday now harry told that still water ran deep have be driven to use of eloquence in inducing father to purchase gun for frank now frank called puritan why did not choose that mistletoe bough must be hung in father hall when godfrey holmes be coming to visit must not explain to frank frank might have have wit to understand frank be thinking only of patty coverdale blue eyed little romp of sixteen who with sister kate be coming from penrith to spend christmas at thwaite hall elizabeth left room with slow graceful step hiding tear hiding emotion a latterly have taught that be feminine to do there go lady fineairs said harry sending shrill voice after thwaite hall be not place of much pretension be moderate sized house surrounded by pretty garden shrubbery close down upon river eamont on westmoreland side of river looking over to lovely

lazy literary habit have done work of life have so done a to permit of enjoying that be left to sole remaining care be establishment of child a far a must see have ground for anticipating disappointment be clever good looking well disposed young people upon whole may be said that sun shone brightly on thwaite hall of mr garrow may suffice to say that always deserved such sunshine for year past have be practice of family to have sort of gathering at thwaite hall during christmas godfrey holmes have be left under guardianship of major garrow a have always spent christmas holiday with guardian perhaps have given rise to practice then coverdales be cousin of garrows have usually be there a child at christmas last past custom have be broken for young holmes have be abroad previous to that have be child excepting now that be to meet again be no longer child elizabeth at rate be not so for have already counted nineteen winter isabella holmes be coming now isabella be two year older than elizabeth have be educated in brussels moreover be comparatively stranger at thwaite hall never having be at early christmas meeting now must take permission to begin story by telling lady secret elizabeth garrow have already be in love with godfrey holmes perhaps might be more becoming to say that godfrey holmes have already be in love with have already be engaged ala have already agreed that engagement must be broken off young holmes be now twenty seven year of age be employed in bank at liverpool not a clerk a assistant manager with large salary be man well to do in world who have money also of own who might well afford to marry two year since on eve of leaving thwaite hall have with low doubting whisper told elizabeth that loved have flown trembling to mother godfrey boy

must be separated must now put off isabella be better so in way for there be need be quarrel still like other be sure like know must not make happy a wife say be fault at rate have never told that thought from will be seen that confidence between mother daughter be very close elizabeth garrow be very good girl might almost be question whether be not too good have learned thought that have learned that most girl be vapid silly useless given chiefly to pleasure seeking hankering after lover have resolved that must not be such one industry self denial religious purpose in life be task set went about performance of with much courage such task though be excellently well adapted to fit young lady for work of living may also be carried too far thus have effect of unfitting for work when elizabeth garrow made up mind that finding of husband be not only purpose of life did very well be very well that young lady must feel capable of going through world happily without one in teaching also taught to think that there be certain merit in refusing natural delight of lover even though possession of lover be compatible with duty to herself father mother world at large be not that have determined to have lover made such resolve when proper lover came be admitted to heart declared to herself unconsciously that must put guard upon lest must be betrayed into weakness by own happiness have resolved that in loving lord must not worship that in giving heart must only so give a must be given to human creature like have acted on high resolve hence have come to pas not unnaturally that mr godfrey holmes have told that be fault be pretty fair girl with soft dark brown hair soft long dark eyelash grey eye though quiet in tone be tender lustrous face be oval line of cheek chin perfect in symmetry be generally quiet in demeanour when moved must rouse to great energy speak with feeling almost with fire fault be reverence for martyrdom in general feeling of be unconscious that became young woman to be unhappy in secret that became young woman might rather say to have source of unhappiness hidden from world in general endured without detriment to outward cheerfulness know story of spartan boy who held fox under tunic fox be biting into into very entrails young hero spake never word now bessy garrow be inclined to think that be good thing to have fox always biting so that torment caused ruining to outward smile now at moment fox within bosom be biting sore enough bore without flinching if must rather that must not come will have arranged mother have said to not for world have answered must never think well of myself again mother have changed own mind more than once a to conduct in matter might be best for to follow thinking solely of daughter welfare if come will be reconciled will be happy have be first idea then there be stern fixedness of purpose in bessys word when spoke of mr holmes have expelled hope mr garrow have for while thought better that young man must not come bessy must not permit must vex father put out of course arrangement of other people display weakness on own part must come must endure without flinching while fox gnawed at battle of mistletoe have be fought on morning before christmas day holmes came on christmas eve isabella be comparatively stranger therefore received at first greater share of attention elizabeth have once seen other for last year two have corresponded personally have never be intimate unfortunately for latter story of godfreys offer acceptance have be communicated to isabella a have of course

so pleasant to take hand so sweet so joyous that surely must be wrong be doctrine godfrey holmes though hardly analysed matter partly understood that be so yet if once be landed on green island must be so happy spoke with scorn of woman clinging to tree like ivy yet be once married woman must cling to husband with sweeter feminine tenacity than bessy garrow spoke further word to a walked home in handing down to ferry boat pressed hand for second seemed a though have returned pressure if so action be involuntary hand instantly resumed stiffness to touch be late that night when major garrow

found moment too important for special reference to little bough above head not so however patty coverdale shame said bursting out of room if id known what have done nothing on earth must have induced to go in wont enter room till know that have taken out nevertheless sister kate be bold enough to solve mystery before evening be over returning home be generally supposed that people who live at home good domestic people who love tea arm chair who keep parlour hearth rug ever warm be generally supposed that be people who value home most best appreciate comfort of cherished institution be inclined to doubt be think to who live farthest away from home to who find greatest difficulty in visiting home that word conveys sweetest idea in distant part of world may be that englishman acknowledges permanent resting place there be many others in will not call daily house home must in own idea desecrate word by doing so home be across blue water in little northern island perhaps may visit more have left at rate for life from circumstance necessity of living have banished home be still in england when speaks of home thought be there one can understand intensity of feeling who have not seen felt absence of interest in life fall to lot of many who have to eat bread on distant soil be apt to think that life in strange country will be life of excitement of stirring enterprise varied scene that in abandoning comfort of home will receive in exchange more of movement of adventure than must come in way in own tame country feeling have be sure sent many young man roaming take spirited fellow of twenty ask whether must like to go to mexico for next ten year prudence father may ultimately save from such banishment will not refuse without pang of regret ala be mistake bread may be earned fortune perhaps made in such country a be destiny of race to spread over wide face of globe be well that there must be something to gild paint outward face of lot so many be called upon to choose for life of daily excitement there be life like life in england farther one go from england more stagnant think do water of existence become if be so for men be ten time more so for woman englishman if be at guatemala belize must work for bread work will find in thought excitement what of wife where will find excitement by what pursuit will repay for have left behind at mother fireside will love husband yes at least if there be not that there will be hell indeed then will nurse child talk of home when time will come that promised return thither be within year two of accomplishment thought will be fixed on coming pleasure a be thought of young girl on first ball for fortnight before event come off on central plain of portion of central america be called costa rica stand city of san jos be capital of republic for costa rica be republic for central america be town of importance be in middle of coffee district surrounded by rich soil on sugar cane be produced be blessed with climate only moderately hot native inhabitant be cut throat cannibal may be said therefore by comparison with other spot to englishman others be congregated for gathering together of money san jos may be considered a happy region nevertheless life there be not in way desirable be dull place with little to interest either eye ear although heat of tropic be little felt there on account of altitude men woman become too lifeless for much enterprise there be society there be few german few englishman in place who see other on matter of business during day sombre a life generally be seem to care little for others company on other footing know not to what point aspiration of german may stretch to english one idea give salt to life be idea of home on day however distant may be will once more turn face towards little northern island then will be well with to certain englishman there to dear little wife prospect came few year since somewhat suddenly event tidings matter not what brought about that resolved between that must start immediately almost immediately must pack up leave san jos within four month of day on purpose be first formed at san jos period of only four month for purpose be immediately creates feeling of instant excitement necessity for instant doing consciousness that there be in few week ample work for hand thought work almost more than ample dear little wife who for last two year have be so listless felt flurried harry said to husband how will ever be ready pretty face be lighted up with unusual brightness at happy thought of so much haste with object baby thing too said a thought of various little article of dress must be needed journey from san jos to southampton can not in truth be made a easily a one from london to liverpool let think of month to be passed without aid from washerwoman greatest part of month amidst sweltering heat of west indian tropic in first month of hurry flurry mr arkwright be happy woman must see mother again sister be now four year since have left on quay at southampton while heart be broken at parting be young bride then going forth with new lord to meet stern world have then be home to look for wife have found what looked for in younger sister of partner for henry arkwright wife brother abel ring have established together in san jos now thought how there must be meeting on quay at there must be broken heart at there must be love without sorrow kiss sweet with sweetness of welcome not bitter with bitterness of parting people told few neighbour around how happy how fortunate be to get home thus early in life have be out ten twenty year still day of return be distant then pressed living baby to breast wiped away tear a thought of other darling whom must leave beneath distant sod then came question a to route home san jos stand in middle of high plain of costa rica way between pacific atlantic journey thence down to pacific be by comparison easy there be road mule on traveller must ride go steadily easily down to punta port on ocean there be inn too on way place of public entertainment at refreshment may be obtained bed fair substitute for bed then by route traveller must take long additional sea voyage must convey weary baggage down to wretched place on pacific there wait for steamer to take to panam cross isthmus reship in other water for long journey home terrible unshipping reshipping be sore burden to unaccustomed traveller when be absolutely necessary then indeed be done without much thought in case of arkwrights be not absolutely necessary there be reason turned mr arkwrights heart against journey by punt arena place be unhealthy having at certain season very bad name here on outward journey husband have be taken ill have never ceased to think of fortnight have spent there among uncouth stranger during portion of life have trembled in balance early therefore in four month begged that might not be taken round by punt arena there be route harry if love let go by serapiqui a to harrys loving there be doubt about that a well knew there be other route by serapiqui river by greytown greytown be true be quite a unhealthy a punt arena by route one baggage must be shipped unshipped into small boat there be manner of difficulty attached to perhaps direct road to from city on world surface be subject to sharper fatigue while last journeying by route also traveller leaf san jos mounted on mule so mounted make way through vast primeval forest down to bank of serapiqui river that there be track for be of course true be simply track during nine month of twelve be so deep in mud that mule sink in to belly then when river have be reached traveller seat in canoe for two day be paddled down down along serapiqui into san juan river down along san juan till reach greytown passing one night at hut on river side at greytown wait for steamer will carry first stage on road towards southampton must be connoisseur in disagreeables of kind who can say with precision whether greytown punt arena be better place for week sojourn for full month mr arkwright must not give way to wife at first conquered by declaring that serapiqui journey must be dangerous for baby heard from one that must be made le fatiguing for baby than other route baby have be carried down in litter strapped on to mule back guide at mule head must be necessary be when once in boat baby must be a well a in cradle what purpose can not woman gain by perseverance purpose in instance mr arkwright did at last gain by persevering then preparation for journey went on with much flurrying hot haste to at home who live feel life day manufacture of endless baby linen packing of mountain of clothes doe not give idea of much pleasurable excitement at san jos where there be scarcely motion enough in existence to prevent water from becoming foul with stagnation packing of baby linen be delightful for month so day went by with happy wing by degree report began to reach arkwright wife a to new route made uneasy wet season have be prolonged even though might not be deluged by rain path must be in such state of mud a to render labour incessant one two people declared that road be unfit at time for woman then river must be much swollen tidings did not reach arkwright wife together at rate not till late amidst preparation change might still have be made a be after entreaty mr arkwright did not like to ask again to alter plan having altered once be averse to change again so thing went on till mule boat have be hired thing have gone so far that change must then be made without much cost trouble during last ten day of sojourn at san jos mr arkwright have lost appearance of joy have cheered up sweet face during last few month terror at terrible journey obliterated in mind happiness have arisen from hope of being soon at home be thoroughly cowed by danger to be encountered must gladly have gone down to punt arena have be now possible that must so arrange rained rained still rained when there be now only week from time started oh if must only wait for month said to one after what have passed between husband have not heart to say such word to arkwright be man not given to much talking silent thoughtful man stern withal in outward bearing tender hearted loving in nature sweet young wife who have left come with out to dull distant place be very dear to dearer than be aware in day be thinking much of coming trouble why have given way to foolish prayer ah why indeed thus last few day of sojourn in san jos passed away from once twice during day did speak out expressing fear feeling be too much for must not restrain poor mamma said will never see then again harry know will never reach home alive fanny darling be nonsense in order that spoken word might not sound stern to took in arm kissed must behave well fanny said to day before started though heart be then very low within promised that must do best then made great resolution though must be dying on road must not complain beyond absolute necessity of nature fully recognised thoughtful tender kindness for though thus cautioned never told that danger feared be result of own choice never threw in teeth prayer have made in yielding to knew that have be weak then came morning of departure party of traveller consisted of four besides baby there be mr arkwright wife english nurse who be going to england with brother abel king who be to accompany a far a serapiqui river when have reached that real labour of journey must be over have eight mule four for four traveller one for baby spare mule laden simply with blanket so that mr arkwright might change in order that must not be fatigued by fatigue of beast two for luggage heavier portion of baggage have already be sent off by punt arena must meet at other side of isthmus of panam for last four day rain have ceased have ceased at rate at san jos who knew country well must know that might still be raining over vast forest now a matter be settled must hope for best on morning on started sun shone fairly accepted a omen of good baby seemed to lay comfortably on pile of blanket on mule back face of tall indian guide who took place at mule head pleased anxious mother not leave ever said in spanish laying hand on cord be fastened to beast head not for one moment did leave charge though labour of sticking close to be very great have four attendant guide of whom made journey on foot that be men of mixed race be probable three of must have be called spaniard spaniard be of costa rica other must be called indian one of spaniard be leader chief man of party others seemed to stand on equal footing with other indeed place of greatest care have be given to indian for first four five mile route lay along high road lead from san jos to punt arena so far group of acquaintance followed mounted on mule here where way forked road leading through great forest to atlantic separated many tear be shed on side what might be future life of arkwrights have not be absolutely fixed there be strong hope on part that might never be forced to return to costa rica from whom now parted have not seemed to be dear to in especial degree while lived together in same small town seeing other day by day now now that might never meet again certain love sprang up for old familiar face woman kissed other who hitherto have hardly cared to enter others house then party of arkwrights again started steady work began in whole of first day way beneath foot be tolerably good weather continued fine be one long gradual ascent from plain where road parted there be real labour in travelling mr arkwright rode beside baby mule at head of indian always walked two men went together in front husband have found that wife must prefer a long a road allowed of such arrangement heart be too full to admit of much speaking so went on in silence first night be passed in hut by roadside seemed to be deserted hut rancho a be called in country food have of course brought with here by common consent endeavoured in sort to make merry fanny arkwright said to be not so bad after eh darling answered only that mule tire one so will all day be a long a that have not heart to tell that a regarded hour of work first day must of necessity be shortest have risen to considerable altitude night be very cold baby be enveloped among pile of coloured blanket thing did not go very badly with only that when fanny arkwright rose from hard bed limb be more weary much more stiff than have be when arkwright have lifted from mule on second morning mounted before day have quite broken in order that might breakfast on summit of ridge separate two ocean at spot good road come to end forest track begin here also must in truth enter forest though path have for time be among straggling tree bush now again rode two two up to place of halting arkwright ring well knowing that from hence labour must in truth commence poor mr arkwright when reached resting place must fain have remained there for rest of day one word in low plaintive voice said asking whether might not sleep in large shed stand there be manifestly impossible at pace must never reach greytown spoke further word when told that must go on at about noon that day file of traveller formed into line afterwards kept during whole of journey then started by narrow path into forest first walked leader of guide then man following abel ring came next behind maid servant then baby mule with indian ever at head close at heel followed mr arkwright so that mother eye might be always on child after husband then guide on foot completed number of traveller in way went on on day after day till reached bank of serapiqui never once varying place in procession a started in morning so went on till noon day rest so again made evening march in journey there be idea of variety searching after pleasure of scenery attempt at conversation with object of interest amusement what word be spoken be simply needful produced by sympathy for suffering so journeyed always in same place with one exception began work with two guide leading before first day be over one of have fallen back to side of mr arkwright for be unable to sit on mule without daily work be divided into two stage so a to give hour for rest in middle of day have be arranged that distance for day must not be long must be very short a be thought by when talked over at san jos now hour passed in saddle seemed to be endless descent began from ridge of have spoken have sooner turned face down upon mountain slope looking towards atlantic than passage of mud began to there be cessation till found on bank of serapiqui river doubt whether be possible to convey in word adequate idea of labour of riding over path be not that active exertion be necessary that there be anything requires doing traveller have before simple task of sitting on mule from hour to hour of seeing that knee get jammed against tree at step beast ride have to drag leg out from deep clinging mud body of rider never know one moment of ease why mule die on road can not say live through appear to suffer have own way in everything for exertion on rider part will make walk faster slower than be wont on day on entered forest that being second of journey mr arkwright have asked for mercy for permission to escape that second stage on next allowed to be lifted into saddle after mid day rest without word have tried to sleep in vain have sat within little hut looking out upon desolate scene before with baby in lap have one comfort that of traveller baby suffered least have now left high ground heat be becoming great though not a yet intense then indian guide looking out slowly over forest saw that rain be not yet over spoke word two to one of companion in low voice in patois mr arkwright did not understand then going after husband told that heaven be threatening have only two league said arkwright may perhaps hold up will begin in hour said indian two league be four hour to morrow asked arkwright to morrow to morrow to morrow will still rain said guide looking a spoke up over huge primeval forest then have better start at once said arkwright before first falling drop frighten woman so mule be brought out lifted uncomplaining wife on to blanket formed pillion file again formed slowly wound way out from small enclosure by hut be surrounded out from enclosure on to rough scrap of undrained pasture ground from tree have be cleared in few minute be once more struggling through mud name of spot traveller have just left be carablanco there found woman living alone husband be away told at san jos must be back to when dry weather came to look up young cattle be straying in forest what life for woman nevertheless in talking with mr arkwright made complaint of own lot have done what little must to comfort poor lady who be so little able to bear fatigue of journey be road very bad mr arkwright asked in whisper ah yes be bad road when will be at river took four day said woman then will never see mother again a spoke mr arkwright pressed baby to bosom immediately after husband came in started path now led away across slope of mountain seemed to fall from very top of central ridge in unbroken descent down to valley at foot hitherto since have entered forest have have nothing before eye tree bush grew close around now prospect of unrivalled grandeur be opened before if only have be able to enjoy at bottom of valley ran river so great be depth looked like moving silver cord on other side of there arose mountain steep unbroken like be passing unbroken so that eye must stretch from river up to very summit not spot on mountain side on side be left uncovered by thick forest have stood there untouched by man since nature first produced be nothing to traveller be clang of macaw anything roaring of little congo ape nothing be gained by from beautiful scenery be there fear from beast of prey immediate pain of step of journey drove other feeling from thought be bounded by intense desire for evening halt then a guide have prophesied rain began at first came in such small soft drop that be found to be refreshing cloud soon gathered poured forth collected water a though have not rained for month among mountain not that came in big drop with violence wind can give beating hither thither breaking branch from tree rising up again a pattered against ground there be violence in rain fell softly in long continuous noiseless stream sinking into everything that touched converting deep rich earth on side into mud not word be said by of a came on indian covered baby with blanket closer than be covered before guide who walked by mr arkwrights side drew cloak around knee such effort be in vain there be rain will penetrate everything such be rain fell upon now nevertheless a have said hardly word be spoken poor woman finding that heat of cloak increased suffering threw open again fanny said husband have better let protect a well a can answered merely by impatient wave of hand intending to signify that must not speak in matter must have way after husband made further attempt to control must see however ever again must have slipped forward from mule fallen have not man by side steadied with hand at tree protected knee foot though there be hardly room for to move between beast bank against be thrust then at last that day work be also over fanny arkwright slipped from pillion down into husband arm at door of rancho in forest here there lived large family adding from year to year to patch of ground have rescued from wood valiantly doing part in extension of civilisation party be few step from door when left mule mr arkwright did not now a heretofore hasten to receive baby in arm when placed upon ground still leaned against mule husband saw that must carry into hut did then wet mud laden dishevelled a be laid down upon plank be to form bed there stretched out arm for infant on evening undressed tended like child then when be alone with husband repeated to sad foreboding harry said will never see mother again oh yes fanny will see talk over trouble with pleasure be very bad know will live through yet will of course will take baby home to face without darling three more day riding rather two half will bring to river then trouble will be over will be easy after ah harry know do know that be very bad girl must cheer up will be laughing at in month time on following morning allowed to be lifted up speaking word of remonstrance indeed be like child in hand having dropped dignity authority of woman demeanour rained again during whole of day heat be becoming oppressive a hour be descending nearer nearer to sea level during first stage hardly word be spoken by one when be again taken from mule be in tear poor servant girl too be almost prostrate with fatigue absolutely unable to wait upon mistress even to do anything for nevertheless did make second stage seeing that mid day resting place have be under tree of forest have there be hut there must have remained for night on following day rested altogether though place at remained have few attraction be forest hut inhabited by old spanish couple who be by mean willing to give room although paid for accommodation at exorbitant rate be one singularity of place strange out of way like such forest track a that money in small sum be hardly valued dollar there be not appreciated a sixpence be in rich country there stayed for day guide employed in making litter with long pole so that might carry mr arkwright over portion of ground poor fellow when once have thus changed mode of conveyance never again be lifted on to mule there be strong reason against day delay be to go down serapiqui along with post must overtake on bank if post must pas before got there must not wait then must be deprived of best canoe on water then also be possible if encountered further delay that steamer might sail from greytown without month residence at frightful place be thus made necessary day rest apparently did little to relieve mr arkwrights suffering on following day allowed to be put upon mule after first hour beast be stopped be taken off during hour have travelled hardly over league at time so sobbed moaned that arkwright absolutely feared that must perish in forest implored guide to use pole have prepared have declared to over over again that felt sure that must die delirious with weariness suffering have begged to leave at last hut have not yet come to flat ground over litter might be carried with comparative ease nevertheless men yielded be placed in recumbent position upon blanket supported by bough of tree in way went through day with somewhat le of suffering than before without necessity for self exertion have be worse to than suffering there be place between river at one must have said that be impossible that litter must be carried even impossible that mule must walk with load on back still went on men carried burden without complaining not word be said about money extra pay not word at least by when arkwright be profuse in offer leader told that must not have done for money for poor suffering seora must make exertion money must have bought from on next day about noon post did pas consisting of three strong men carrying great weight on back suspended by band from forehead travelled much quicker than friend must reach bank of river that evening in ordinary course must start down river close upon daybreak on following day after consultation with guide agreed to wait till noon poor mr arkwright knew nothing of hour of such arrangement now husband greatly doubted power of catching mail despatch however did not much depend on exertion that afternoon resting place be marked out for must not go beyond unless indeed must make whole journey be impossible towards evening matter seemed to improve with have now got on to ground be more open men who carried litter must walk with greater ease mr arkwright also complained le when reached resting place on night said nothing of wish to be left there to fate be place called padregal cacao plantation have be cleared in forest with much labour there be house here containing three room forty fifty acre round have be stripped of forest tree nevertheless adventure have not be prosperous one for place be at time deserted there be cacao plant there be one to pick cacao there be certain melancholy beauty about place few grand tree have be left standing near house grass around be rich park like be deserted nothing be heard roaring of congo ah indeed be melancholy place a be seen by of party afterwards on following morning be astir very early mr arkwright be so much better that offered to sit again upon mule men however declared that must finish task be placed again upon litter then with slow weary step did make way to river bank be not yet noon when saw mud fort stand there a drew into enclosure round small house stand close by river side saw three postman still busy about package thank god said arkwright thank god indeed said brother will be right with now well fanny said husband a took very gently from litter seated on bench stood outside door be over now be not answered by shower of tear be tear brought relief be aware of therefore stood by still holding by hand while head rested against side will find motion of boat very gentle said indeed there will be motion baby will sleep way down to greytown did not answer in word looked up into face must see that spirit be recovering there be almost crowd of people collected on spot preparatory to departure of canoe in first place there be commandant of fort to whom small house belonged be looking to passport of friend with due diligence endeavouring to make something of occasion by discovering fatal legal impediment to further prosecution of voyage impediment must disappear on payment of certain dollar then there be dozen costa rican soldier men with coloured cap old musket ready to support dignity authority of commandant there be guide taking payment from abel ring for past work postman preparing boat for further journey then there be certain german there with german servant to whom boat belonged also be very busy preparing for river voyage be not going down with be business to see well started singular looking man be with huge shaggy beard shaggy uncombed hair with bright blue eye gave to face remarkable look of sweetness be uncouth man to eye yet child must have trusted with in forest at place remained two hour coffee be prepared here mr arkwright refreshed child washed arranged clothes when stepped down steep bank clinging to husband arm a

fifteen thousand stranger who flock to holy sepulchre at period of year many of sleep out in open air lying on low bench run along outside wall of house even on ground wrapped in thick hood cloak slumberer such a be easily disturbed be detained long at toilet shake like dog growl stretch then be ready for day rode out of town in long file first went groom boy forget proper syrian appellation used to call mucherry sound being in sort like name then followed horse with forage blanket next to friend smith in turkish saddle be behind joseph brought up rear moved slowly down via dolorosa noting spot at saviour be said to have fallen while bearing cross passed by pilate house paused at gate of temple gate once be beautiful looking down into hole of pool in maimed halt be healed whenever water moved what name be yet there at jerusalem be bandied to fro with a little reverence a be fanciful appellation given by guide to rock stone little lake in country overrun by tourist for who must still fain believe let stay at home said friend smith for who can not divide wheat from chaff let stay at home answered then rode out through st stephen gate having mountain of men of galileo directly before mount of olive little to right valley of jehoshaphat lying between of course know place now said smith answered that did know well be not better for when knew only in holy writ asked by jove said mountain stand where ever stood same valley be still green with morning dew water course be unchanged child of mahomet may build tawdry temple on threshing floor david bought that there might stand lord house man may undo what man did even though doer be solomon here have god handiwork own evidence at bottom of steep descent from city gate came to tomb of virgin by special agreement made with joseph left horse here for few moment in order that might descend into subterranean chapel under tomb in mass be at moment being said there be something awful in chapel when a at present moment be crowded with eastern worshipper from very altar up to top of dark step by descent be made must be remembered that eastern worshipper be not like churchgoer of london even of rome cologne be wild men of various nation race maronites from lebanon roumelians candiotes copt from upper egypt russian from crimea armenian abyssinian savour strongly of oriental life of oriental dirt be clad in skin hairy cloak with huge hood head be shaved face covered with short grisly fierce beard be silent mostly looking out of eye ferociously a though murder be in thought rapine never slouch cringe in body shuffle in gait dirty fierce looking uncouth repellent a be there be always about something of personal dignity be not compatible with englishman ordinary hat pantaloon a be about to descend preparing to make way through crowd smith took hold of arm will never do dear fellow said job will be tough enough for single file must never cut way two two im broad shouldered will go first so did gradually worked way into body of chapel how be that englishman can push anywhere men be fierce looking have murder rapine a have said almost in eye one must have supposed that be not lamb dove capable of being thrust here there without anger on part too be anxious to descend approach altar yet did win way through apparently man be angry with doubt after whether ferocious eye strong smell dirt be so efficacious in creating awe obedience in others a open brow trace of soap water know at least that dirty maronite must make very little progress if attempted to shove way unfairly through crowd of englishman at door of london theatre did shove unfairly did make progress till found in centre of dense crowd collected in body of chapel having got so far next object be to get out again place be dark mysterious full of strange odour darkness mystery strange odour soon lose charm when men have much work before joseph have made point of being allowed to attend mass before altar of virgin very few minute sufficed for prayer so again turned round pushed way back again smith still following in wake men who have let pas once let pas again without opposition show of anger to occasion be very holy be stretching out hand in direction with long taper in order that might obtain spark of sacred fire be burning on one of altar a made way out passed many who with dumb motion begged to assist in object did assist getting light for taper handing to fro using authority with seemed to be invested smith observed be much more courteous in way to woman than to men a did not forget to remind when be afterwards on road together remounting horse rode slowly up winding ascent of mount of olive turning round at brow of hill to look back over jerusalem sometimes think that of spot in world one must be spot most cherished in memory of christian be there that stood when wept over city so much do know though be ignorant ever will be so of site of cross of tomb then descended on eastern side of hill passing through town of lazarus sister turned face steadily towards mountain of moab hitherto have met no bedouin interrogated dragoman about more than once always told that did not signify must meet said before danger must arise a for danger said think more of than do of arab put hand on revolver a agreed to be here here ought to be dont carry revolver smith smith said that never have done so that must take charge of mine if liked to however demurred never part with pistol to one said rather drily explained that only intended to signify that if there be danger to be encountered must be glad to encounter fully believed shant have much fighting replied if there be tool will come readiest to hand of master if mean to remain here long must advise to get one oriental be people with whom appearance go long way a rule fear respect mean same thing with pistol hanging over loin be great trouble to look a though must bite many dog go through world well by merely showing teeth then companion began to talk of did not said mean to remain in syria very long either said have done with part of world for present will take next steamer from jaffa for alexandria will only have one night in jerusalem on return after remained silent for few moment then declared that also have be intention be almost ashamed to say so however because looked a though have resolved to hook on to so answered expressing almost regret at circumstance dont let that trouble said will be delighted to have company when know better a hope will do will find that if such be not case must tell so a frankly will remain in cairo little time so beyond arrival in egypt can answer for nothing said that expected letter at alexandria must govern future movement thought seemed sad a said so imagined from manner that did not expect very happy tidings indeed have made up mind that be by mean free from care sorrow have not air of man who must say of that be totus teres atque rotundus have wish to inquire matter must have dropped have not added fear that will meet acquaintance in egypt whom will give pleasure to see then said if be must go to constantinople instead indeed anywhere rather than fall among friend who be not friendly nearer friend be more one feel that sort of thing to way of thinking there be nothing on earth so pleasant a pleasant wife then what be there so damnable a one be unpleasant be married man inquired question be put in low tone of voice seemed to give to air of special interest made one almost feel that be asked with special view to one individual welfare now fact be that be married man with family be not much given to talk to stranger about domestic concern therefore though have particular object in view denied obligation in respect said have not come to promotion yet be too frequently on move to write down a paterfamilias then know nothing about pleasantness of spoke just now of unpleasantness thank god personal experience be to come a also be presume be possible that have hampered with woman that be to meet at alexandria poor fellow thought unhappiness be not of kind said be not married be alone in world then certainly must not allow to be troubled by unpleasant acquaintance be now four hour since have left jerusalem have arrived at place at be proposed that must breakfast there be large well there shade afforded by rock under water sprung arab have constructed tank out of horse must drink so that place be ordinarily known a first stage out of jerusalem smith have said not word about saddle complained in way of discomfort so have in truth forgotten subject other matter have continually presented have never even asked how have fared now jumped from horse perceived at once that be unable to do so smiled faintly a eye caught mine knew that wanted assistance ah said that confounded turkish saddle have already galled skin see how be will have to doctor with little brandy externally applied friend lent shoulder with assistance got down very gently slowly ate breakfast with good will bread cold fowl brandy water with hard boiled egg by way of final delicacy then began to bargain with joseph for loan of english saddle saw that smith must not get through journey with monstrous turkish affair that must go on without complaining till fainted came to other signal grief frenchman seeing plight in be be disposed to drive very hard bargain wanted forty shilling price of pair of live bedouin for accommodation declared that even then must make sacrifice only out of consideration to very well said im tolerably tough ill change with gentleman chance be that will not be in very liberal humour when reach jaffa with stiff limb sore skin have very good memory joseph ill take thirty shilling mr jones though will have to groan way like condemned devil struck bargain with at last for five twenty set to work to make necessary change on horse will be just same thing to said to smith find that be a much used to one a to other how much money be to pay asked oh nothing replied give few piastre when part with at jaffa know why must have felt thus inclined to pay money out of pocket for smith man whom have only seen for first time on preceding evening whose temperament be so essentially different from own so did must have done almost anything in reason for comfort yet be melancholy fellow with good inward pluck a believed without outward show of dash hardihood confess love to see pray tell ill pay for said well make that right answered then remounted not without difficulty on part must have let rub in brandy said cant conceive how efficaciously must have done made answer at noon met caravan of pilgrim coming up from jordan there might be three four hundred number seemed to be treble that from loose straggling line in journeyed be very singular sight a moved slowly along narrow path through sand coming out of defile among hill be perhaps quarter of mile in front of passing a stood still by wayside then winding again out of sight on track over have come rode on camel whole family in many case being perched on same animal observed very old man very old woman slung in pannier over camel back not such pannier a might be befitting such purpose square basket so that head heel of of old couple hung out of rear front surely journey will be death said to joseph yes will replied quite coolly what matter how soon die now that have bathed in jordan very many rode on donkey two generally on donkey others who have command of money on horse greater number walked toiling painfully from jerusalem to jericho on first day sleeping there in tent going to bathe on second day then returning from jericho to jerusalem on third pilgrimage be made throughout in accordance with fixed rule there be tariff for tent accommodation at jericho so much per head per night including use of hot water standing there close by wayside must see not only garment face of strange people must watch gesture form opinion of what be going on within thought be much quieter tamer a be than englishman must be under such circumstance who be carried seemed to sit on beast in passive tranquillity enjoying suffering anything object have be to wash in jordan to do once in life have washed in jordan benefit expected be not to be immediately spiritual earnest prayerfulness be considered necessary after ceremony to member of greek christian church have be handed down from father to son washing in jordan once during life be efficacious towards salvation therefore journey have be made at terrible cost terrible risk for people have come from afar be from habit little capable of long journey many die under toil matter not if die before have reached jordan few there be undoubtedly more ecstatic in great deed of religion one man especially noticed on day have bound to make pilgrimage from jerusalem to river with one foot bare be of better class be even nobly dressed a though be part of vow to show to men that did deed wealthy great though be be fine man perhaps thirty year of age with well grown beard descending on breast at girdle carried brace of pistol never in life have seen bodily pain so plainly written in man face sweat be falling from brow eye be strained bloodshot with agony have stick vow presume debarring from such assistance limped along putting to ground heel of unprotected foot must see be mass of blood sore broken skin irish girl must walk from jerusalem to jericho without shoe be not penny worse for poor fellow clearly suffered so much that be almost inclined to think that in performance of penance have done something to aggravate pain around paid attention to dragoman seemed to think nothing of affair fool of greek understand christian religion said being latin roman catholic at tail of line encountered two bedouin who be in charge of caravan joseph at once addressed men be mounted one on very sorry looking jade other on good stout arab barb have gun slung behind back coloured handkerchief on head wore striped bernouse parley went on for about ten minute during procession of pilgrim wound out of sight ended in being accompanied by two arab who thus left greater charge to take care of back to city understood afterwards that have endeavoured to persuade joseph that might just a well go on alone merely satisfying demand of tariff have pointed out be particular man that under such circumstance final settlement might be doubtful so turned accompanied a matter of fact must have be a well without sun be beginning to fall in heaven when reached actual margin of dead sea have seen glitter of still water for long time previously shining under sun a though be not real have often heard of have seen how effect of light shade together will produce so vivid appearance of water where there be water a to deceive most experienced reverse be case here there be lake there have be before eye for last two hour yet looked then now a though be image of lake not real water have long since made up mind to bathe in feeling well convinced that must do so without harm to myself have be endeavouring to persuade smith to accompany positively refused must bathe said in dead sea in river jordan did not like bathing preferred to do washing in own room of course have nothing further to say begged that under circumstance must take charge of purse pistol while be in water agreed to do even in be strange almost uncivil be to bathe from farthest point of little island into there be rough causeway from land made of stone broken piece of wood exhorted to go with thither insisted on remaining with horse on mainland at little distance from island did not feel inclined to go down to water edge said confess at moment almost suspected that be going to play foul hesitated saw in instant what be passing through mind have better take pistol money with will be quite safe on clothes to have kept thing now must have shown suspicion too plainly a must not bring to do gave up have sometimes thought that be fool to do so went away by to end of island then did bathe be impossible to conceive anything more desolate than appearance of place land shelf very gradually away to water whole margin to breadth of twenty thirty foot be strewn with dbris of rush bit of timber old white withered reed whence bit of timber have come seems difficult to say appearance be a though water have receded left there have heard said that there be vegetation near dead sea such be not case for rush do grow on bank found difficult enough to get into water for ground shelf down very slowly be rough with stone large piece of half rotten wood moreover when be in nearly up to hip water knocked down indeed did so when have gone a far a knee recovered by perseverance did proceed somewhat farther must not be imagined that knocking down be effected by movement of water there be such movement everything be perfectly still fluid seems hardly to be displaced by entrance of body effect be that one foot be tripped up that one fall prostrate on to surface water be so strong buoyant that when above few foot in depth have to be encountered strength weight of bather be not sufficient to keep down foot leg then essayed to swim must not do in ordinary way a be unable to keep enough of body below surface so that head face seemed to be propelled down upon turned round floated glare of sun be so powerful must not remain long in position however have bathed in dead sea be so far satisfied anything more abominable to palate than water if be water never have inside mouth expected to be extremely salt doubt if be analysed such must be result there be flavour in kill salt attempt can be made at describing taste may be imagined that did not drink heartily merely taking up drop two with tongue from palm of hand seemed to a though have be drenched with even brandy must not relieve from then whole body be in mess felt a though have be rubbed with pitch looking at limb saw sign on of fluid seemed to dry from a usually do from other water still feeling remained however be to ride from hence to spot on bank of jordan must reach in hour at must wash so clothed prepared for departure seated in position in island be unable to see what be going on among remainder of party therefore must not tell whether pistol money be safe dressed therefore rather hurriedly on getting again to shore found that mr john smith have not levanted be seated on horse at distance from joseph arab have appearance of being in league with doubt worthy guide certainly have suspected ruse now be angry with have done so yet in london one must not trust one money to stranger whom one have met twenty four hour since in coffee room why then do with stranger whom one chanced to meet in desert thanks said a handed belonging wish must have induced to come in also dead sea be now at elbow therefore think nothing of in ten fifteen year time must be glad to be able to tell child that have bathed in will never have child to care for such tidings replied river jordan for mile above point at join dead sea run through very steep bank bank be almost precipitous be a be guarded by thick tree bush grow upon side be so much case that one may ride a did for considerable distance along margin not be able even to approach water have fancy for bathing in spot of own selection instead of going to open shore frequented by pilgrim be baffled in when did force way down to river side found that water ran so rapidly that bush bough of tree grew so far over into stream a to make impossible for to bathe must not have got in without clothes having got in must not have got out again be therefore obliged to put up with open muddy shore to bather descend at may presume that joshua passed when came over a one of twelve spy to spy out land even here must not go full into stream a must fain have done lest must be carried down so have assisted to whiten shore of dead sea with bone a to getting over to moabitish side of river be plainly impossible indeed seemed to be prevailing opinion that passage of river be not practicable without going up a far a samaria yet know that there thereabouts israelite did cross jumped from horse moment got to place once more gave purse pistol to friend be going to bathe again said certainly said dont suppose must come to jordan not wash there even if be not foul with foulness of dead sea youll kill in present state of heat said remonstrating just a one mother wife might do even have be mother wife must not have attended to such remonstrance then before have done looking at with big eye of coat waistcoat cravat be on ground be at work at brace whereupon turned from slowly strolled away into wood on occasion have base fear about money then did bathe very uncomfortably shore be muddy with foot of pilgrim river so rapid that hardly dared to get beyond mud did manage to take plunge in head foremost be forced to wade out through dirt slush so that found difficult to make foot leg clean enough for shoe stocking then moreover fly plagued most unmercifully must have thought that filthy flavour from dead sea must have saved from nuisance mosquito thereabouts be probably used to finding process of bathing to be so difficult inquired a to practice of pilgrim found that with bathing in jordan have come to be much same a baptism have with doe not mean immersion doubt do take off shoe stocking strip go bodily into water a soon a be dressed found that smith be again at side with purse pistol then went up little above wood sat down together on long sandy grass be now quite evening so that short syrian twilight have commenced sun be no longer hot in heaven must be night a rode on to tent at jericho there be difficulty a to way therefore did not hurry horse who be feeding on grass sat down together on spot from must see stream close together so that when stretched out in weariness a did before started head rested on leg ah one doe not take such liberty with new friend in england be place led one on to special thought mountain of moab be before very plain in outline moab be wash pot over edom will cast out shoe there be before very visible to eye began naturally to ask question of other why be moab wash pot edom thus cursed with indignity why have right bank of river be selected for such great purpose whereas left be thus condemned be there at time special fertility in land of promise have since departed from be told of bunch of grape took two men to carry now there be not vine in whole country side now day sandy plain round jericho be a dry arid a be of valley of moab jordan be running beneath foot jordan in leprous king have washed though bright river of own damascus be so

young who therefore hated levity of youth to character be specially odious for must fain if be possible be young even to grave smith if be clever might escape from window of room opened out upon terrace still get down to steamer must keep old man in play for time even though lost passage must be true to friend there lay joint luggage at foot in yard if smith must venture away without portion of might yet be right name sir be sir william weston began have heard of name before knew to be man of wealth family note took off hat said that have much honour in meeting sir william weston presume know object with be now here continued not exactly said do understand how possibly must know seeing that up to moment did not even know name have heard nothing concerning movement affair sir said have hitherto believed that might at rate expect from truth sir said be bold to think that will not dare to tell either now at other time that have received expect to receive from anything be not true then stood still looking at for moment two beg to assert looked a fully at there be at rate cause why must tremble before be not nephew be responsible for nephew doings towards two of servant be behind on side there stood boy girl belonging to inn however must not understand word of english saw that be hesitating at last spoke out confess now that word when be spoken did at first moment make tremble have to charge said with eloping with niece demand of to inform where be be perfectly aware that be guardian by law did tremble not that cared much for sir williams guardianship saw before so terrible embarrassment then felt so thoroughly abashed in have allowed to be so deceived came back upon in moment covered with shame even made blush have travelled through desert with woman for day have not discovered though have given thousand sign sign remembered now blushed painfully when hand be on forehead still thought that be man declare at moment felt stronger disinclination to face late companion than did to encounter angry uncle niece said speaking with sheepish bewilderment must have convinced at once of innocence have asked too whether be married man have denied how be to escape from such mess of misfortune declare began to forget trouble in own yes niece miss julia weston disgrace have brought upon must be wiped out first duty be to save unfortunate young woman from further misery if be a say exclaimed by honour of gentleman care nothing for honour of gentleman till see proved be good enough to inform sir whether miss weston be in house for moment hesitated saw at once must make responsible for certain mischief of be at rate hitherto in truth innocent if allowed to become party to concealing young lady up to period must at rate defend whether defence be believed not believed still have hope that charming julia might have escaped through window feeling that if have done so be not responsible when turned lock turned on smith for moment hesitated then walked slowly across yard opened door sir william said a did so travelled here with companion dressed a man believed to be what seemed till minute sir said sir william with look of scorn in face gave lie in teeth a plainly a word must do then entered room pole be standing in one corner apparently amazed at what be going on smith may a well call miss weston at once for baronet statement be true be sitting on sort of divan in corner of chamber hiding face in hand have made attempt at escape full explanation be therefore indispensable for own that felt ashamed of part in play ashamed even of own innocency have be le innocent must certainly have contrived to appear much le guilty have occurred to on bank of jordan that smith be lady must not have travelled with in gentleman habiliment from jerusalem to jaffa have consented to remain under protection must have done so without masquerade uncle stood still looked at niece probably understood how thoroughly stern disagreeable be own face considered that must punish crime of relative in severer way than by looking at in think be right at last there be necessity for speaking unfortunate young woman said then paused have better get rid of landlord said before come to explanation motioned to man to leave room did very unwillingly at last be gone fear that be needle to care on account who may hear story of shame said sir william looked at miss weston still sat hiding face however if did not defend be necessary must defend know how far may be at liberty to speak with reference to private matter of of niece sir william weston must not willingly interfere sir said interference have already taken place will have goodness to explain to what be intention with regard to lady intention heaven help intention of course be to leave in uncle hand indeed must hardly be said to have formed intention since have learned that have be honoured by lady presence at moment deeply regretted that have thoughtlessly stated to be unmarried man in doing so have have object at time smith have be quite stranger to have not thought necessary to declare own private concern since have talked so little of that fact of family at home have not be mentioned will have goodness to explain what be intention with regard to lady said baronet oh uncle william exclaimed miss weston now at length raising head from hand hold peace madam said when called upon to speak will find word with difficulty enough sir be waiting for answer from uncle be nothing to gentleman be nothing to by heaven above will be something will know reason why what have gone off with have travelled through country with hiding from only natural friend have be companion for week six day sir said sir said baronet again giving lie now continued addressing niece tell that be nothing to will give promise that will make wife at consulate at alexandria will destroy know who be if know who be said must know must not listen to a for madam unless make that promise then paused in threat turning round looked in face saw that also be looking at though not openly a did flattering devil be at work round heart must have persuaded that also must have heard certain answer given without dismay must even have received comfort in agony from such answer reader know how completely answer be out of power have not slightest ground for supposing said that lady must accede to arrangement if be possible acquaintance with have be altogether confined to to tell truth have not be in miss weston confidence have only taken for have seemed to be sir said baronet again looking at a though must wither on spot for falsehood be true said julia getting up from seat appealing with clasped hand to uncle a true a heaven madam said do take for fool that must take for one said must be very natural fact be a state to miss weston a now learn that be did honour of calling at hotel having heard then seemed to a though be attempting to screen by telling story against so be again silent never in life have be in position of such extraordinary difficulty duty owed to julia a woman to sir william a guardian to a father of family clashed with other be anxious to be generous honest prudent be impossible so made up mind to say nothing further mr jones said baronet have explained to only arrangement under present circumstance can permit to pas without open exposure condign punishment that be gentleman by birth education position be aware whereupon raised hat then continued that lady have three hundred year of own attraction personal mental be worth ten time money said bowed to fair friend who looked at while with sad beseeching eye confess that mistress of bosom have known thought at one moment might have have cause for anger very well continued then proposal name can not imagine be satisfactory if will make to to only amends be in power a gentleman to afford will forgive tell that will make wife on arrival in egypt must have given anything not to have looked at miss weston at moment must not help did turn face half round to before answered then felt that have be cruel in doing so sir william said have at home already wife family of own be not true said retreating step staring at with amazement there be something sir replied in unprecedented circumstance of meeting in position with regard to lady joined to advanced age will enable to regard that useless insult a unspoken be married man there be signature of wife last letter handed one have received a be leaving jerusalem coarse violent contradiction sir william have given be nothing compared with reproach conveyed in miss weston countenance looked at a though anger be now turned against yet methought there be more of sorrow than of resentment in countenance what cause be there for why must be reproached even by look did not remember at moment that when answered chance question a to domestic affair have answered a to man who be stranger to not a to beautiful woman with whom be about to pas certain day in close intimate society to at moment seemed a though have cruelly deceived in truth one person really deceived have be here must explain on behalf of lady that when first joined have other view than of seeing bank of jordan in guise have chosen to assume in order to escape from solemnity austerity of disagreeable relative have be very foolish be take that have first left uncle at constantinople on point never got certain information afterwards while be travelling together idea have come upon that might go on a far a alexandria with then know nothing further of lady intention be certain that wish be good pure uncle have be intolerable to have fled from such have be offence more then sir said baronet giving back letter must be double dyed villain sir said here julia weston interrupted uncle altogether wrong gentleman said have be kind to beyond power of word to express till told by knew nothing of secret must have known added looking down upon ground a to latter assertion be at liberty to believe a much a pleased pole now came to door informing that who wished to start by packet must go on board therefore a unreasonable old gentleman perceived be necessary that must make arrangement can not say that be such a enable to look back on with satisfaction did seem now at last to believe have be unconscious agent in niece stratagem hardly on account became civil to be absolutely necessary said that that unfortunate young woman a must call must depart at once by ship now going to proposition of course made opposition mr jones continued will at once perceive that a gentleman must allow to proceed on journey without honour of company be very dreadful what must say indeed what must do most earnest desire in matter be to save miss weston from annoyance under existing circumstance presence on board must not be burden to then if went if did go in opposition to wish of baronet must trust own prudence be better for party must remain sir william said after minute consideration if will apologise to for gross insult have offered will be a say mr jones said sir william do apologise for word used to while be labouring under very natural misconception of circumstance know be much better for apology at moment regarded sufficient thing be then hurried down to strand accompanied to ruined quay took off hat to sir william a be first let down into boat descended first so that might receive niece for jaffa now knew that be lady then gave hand for last time god bless miss weston said pressing closely god bless mr jones replied from day to have spoken to seen waited fortnight at jaffa for french

word think do love so that need make one around unhappy because circumstance forbid to marry that sort of love must be baneful ah know what love mean not boisterous heartbreaking english love herbert herbert sometimes think have better go home look for bride there though fancy that love in heart hardly approve of fancy that love do think isa that man can carry heart round to one customer after a huckster carry ware yes think can know that men do what did hero waverley do with heart in grand english novel gave to read be not flora mac ivor may find rose bradwardine really wish to do so look here herbert be bad to boast will make boast be so little selfish that desire above that must do may make most happy contented will be quite frank with love well enough to wait four year with hope of

such delay must gall day a doubt whether must not make sick of long before four year be over advice be that must let matter drop now walked up to took hand a did so there be something in gait look

herbert went away in disgust nothing in made so unhappy a feeling that isa under joint privation must not be unhappy a far a must see made difference in isa in truth have not yet read isas character very thoroughly have spoken truly in saying that knew nothing of boisterous love be now tormenting making gloomy nevertheless loved in short life have learnt many lesson of self denial now with reference to half promised husband must again have practised lesson have agreed at once to go from must have balanced own account within own breast have kept to herself suffering there must have be outward show of baffled love none even in colour of cheek for such be nature of temperament did suffer for day by day began to think that love though boisterous a have at first called be more deep seated than have believed made slightest sign that must accept of proffer have made of release though said so loudly that waiting for four year be impossibility spoke of course must be more possible except evidently impossible course of early marriage thus while with redoubled vehemence charged with coldness want of love love waxed warmer warmer happiness became chief object of thought what must do that might no longer suffer then took step be very strange to banished altogether from house going away again into lodging said on morning of departure release will never release be mine have right so to call if choose to release can not help in doing so will be forsworn nay herbert have sworn to nothing said meaning that have not be formally betrothed to can do a please be matter of conscience tell be feeling here can not stay for must go mad will see occasionally perhaps on sunday oh herbert well what must have if really care to see must not be thus ask of now be that if decide absolutely decide on throwing over will tell at once then will leave munich herbert will never throw over so parted onslow went forth to new lodging promise that must never throw over be warmest word of love

talking to uncle hatto added fear that good will come of can harm come mamma think harm can come ill tell what mamma will go to uncle hatto if will let be cross know will not be afraid of feel that

said ought to do something though isa feared that have imperfectly expressed meaning when herbert be willing to do so much to prove love when be ready to sacrifice little comfort of comparative wealth to have be accustomed in order that might be companion wife did not behove to give proof of love also must not be demonstrative a be such exhibition of feeling must be quite contrary to idea of female delicacy to very nature if called on to work for that must do a long a strength remained to there be sacrifice must be of service work must avail therefore be driven to think what might do on behalf at last resolved to make personal appeal to uncle hatto will tell papa isa asked of mother will do so said madame heine then younger member of firm be informed a to step be to be taken though said nothing to forbid attempt held out hope that must be successful uncle hatto be little snuffy man now full seventy year of age who passed seven hour of week day of life in dark back chamber behind

of dark towering rock narrow causeway roaring river trusting to friend landlady to see that luggage be duly packed upon diligence need hardly say that friend did not betray trust a one go out from switzerland towards italy road through via mala ascends somewhat steeply passenger by diligence may walk from inn at tusis into gorge make way through greater part of ravine before vehicle will overtake however mr greene with wife daughter have omitted to do when diligence passed in defile horse trotting for few yard over level portion of road saw man nose pressed close against glass of coup

small boat on leaving larger vessel have looked about deck to see that none of greene trapping be forgotten if left on steamer have be so left through intent on part of one there employed be quite possible that content of box have be ascertained through imprudence of mr greene that have be conveyed away so that might be rifled at como a to mr greene assertion that box have be put into small boat thought nothing of people at bellaggio must not have known box to steal have there be time to concoct plan in carrying box up to hotel came at last to conclusion that missing trunk have be
