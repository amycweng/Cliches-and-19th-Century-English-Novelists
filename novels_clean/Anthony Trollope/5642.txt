selected land of giles medlicot two year since portion of own run have now be purchased from government for loss of have received be entitled to receive compensation matter be made worse for by fact that interloper have come between river be not standing here near midnight merely to exercise wrath by straining eye through darkness at neighbor crop put finger into mouth to wet then held up that might discover way light breath of wind be coming there be still low moan to be heard continually through forest yet not leaf seemed to be moved after while thought caught sound put ear down to ground distinctly heard footstep rising up walked quickly toward spot whence noise came who be that said a saw figure of man standing on side of fence leaning against with pipe in month who be replied man on fence name be medlicot oh mr medlicot be be that mr heathcote good night mr heathcote be going about at late hour of night have to go about early late ai later than be close at home said medlicot be

above body in colony occupies thousand of acre employ three four men till about two hundred maintain thirty family be such pig that ca understand think that must be something low because have bought with own money bit of land never belonged to must use such be nature of giles medlicot soliloquy a sat swinging leg still smoking pipe on fence divided sugar cane from other young man run harry heathcote uttered soliloquy also must swear that must do after meaning that almost suspected that medlicot must be incendiary to in way of thinking man who must take advantage of law to buy bit of man land become free selector a term go be public enemy might be presumed capable of iniquity be very well for girl meaning wife sister in law to tell that medlicot have manner of gentleman have come of decent people woman be always soft enough to be taken by soft hand good looking face decent coat medlicot went about dressed like man in town exhibiting a harry thought contemptible unmanly finery of what use be to tell that medlicot be gentleman what harry knew be that since medlicot have come have lost sheep that head of three four have be found buried on medlicot side of run that if dismissed hand medlicot employed proceeding in harry heathcote aristocratic patriarchal view of life be altogether ungentleman like how be hand to be kept in place if one employer of labor did not back up have be warned to be on guard against fire warning have hardly be implicit yet have come in shape made unable to ignore old bates whom trusted implicitly who be man of very few word have told to be on guard german at whose hut have be in morning karl bender by name servant of own have told that there must be fire about before long why must one want to ruin harry have asked did ever wrong man of shilling german have learned to know young master have made way through crust of master character be prepared to be faithful at point though too must have quarreled have avenged have not chanced that have come to point of loving instead of hating employer like too much to be governor over said german a stooped over fire in own hut in anxiety to boil water for heathcote tea somebody must be governor thing must go to devil said harry dat true only fellow like be made feel said german nokes be made feel when put over de gate must bates german express absolute suspicion of man that medlicot hand at sugar mill be stealing sheep harry thought that knew be comparatively small affair must not have pressed a be without absolute evidence even have feeling that must be unwise to increase anger felt against at rate during present heat jacko have pipe still alight when heathcote returned young monkey said have be using match why not mr harry grass burn ready mr harry word then jacko stooped down lit match showed heathcote burned patch be so when came harry asked with emotion jacko still kneeling on ground holding lighted match in hand shook head tapped breast indicating that have burned grass dropped match by accident word did o ' purpose to see be just one a gunpowder mr harry harry got on horse without word rode away through forest taking direction different from that by have come boy followed be by mean certain that young fellow might not turn against have be part of theory to make difference to man because of such fear if must make men around respect then must treat well must never be brought to respect by flattery be very nearly right in view of men must have be right altogether must have seen accurately what justice demanded for others a well a for a far a intention went be minded to be just to man seemed a be riding that heat grew fiercer fiercer though there be still same moaning sound there be not breath of air have now got upon track very well known to heathcote led up from river to wool shed so on to station have turned homeward when be near wool shed suddenly there fell heavy drop two of rain harry stopped turned face upward when in moment whole heaven above forest around be illumined by flash of lightning so near that made of start in saddle made horse shudder in limb then came roll of thunder immediately over head with thunder rain so thick fast that harry ten thousand bucket seemed to be emptied directly over head god abeighty have put out fire now said jacko harry paused for moment feeling rain through to bone for have nothing on over shirt rejoicing in yes said may go to bed for week let grass grow creek fill earth cool hour like over whole run there wo be dry stick on a went on horse splashed through water seemed a though deluge be falling already ground beneath foot be becoming lake might have too much of jacko word yes want to have mary flooded again word by time reached wool shed be over from first drop to last there have hardly be space of twenty minute there be noise of water a little stream washed hither thither to destined course still horse splashed still there be feeling of incipient deluge when reached wool shed harry again got off horse jacko dismounting also hitched two animal to post followed master into building harry struck wax match holding up strove to look round building by feeble light shed be remarkable edifice built in shape of great t open at side with sharp pitched timber roof covered with felt came down within four foot of ground be calculated to hold about four hundred sheep at time be divided into pen of various size partitioned off for various purpose if harry heathcote be sure of thing be sure that wool shed be best have ever be built in district by jimini what be said jacko did hear thing jacko pointed with finger down centre walk of shed harry striking match a went rushed forward match be out a soon a ignited gave glimmer of light nevertheless saw thought that saw figure of man escaping out of open end of shed place be black a midnight space beyond be clear of tree darkness outside being few shade lighter than within building allowed something of outline of figure to be visible a man escaped sound of footstep be audible enough harry called to of course received answer have pursued must have be obliged to cross sundry rail must have so delayed a to give chance of success knew there be fellow about said one of own men must not have run like jacko shook head did not speak have got in here for shelter out of rain be doing no good about place jacko again shook head wonder who be jacko came up whispered in ear bill nokes must see seed drag of leg now be well known that man nokes have injured of muscle habitually dragged one foot after think must have

assumed when first meeting squatter good fellowship between on equal term must be acceptable to overture have be coldly received then too have drawn up have declared that heathcote be ignorant as have unconsciously made up mind to commence hostility be in spirit that have taken nokes into mill of whose character have inquired about must certainly have heard good have now brought mother to medlicot mill gangoil lady have met other on neutral ground be almost necessary that must either be friend absolute enemy mr heathcote have be aware of have declared that enmity be horrible upon word said

parting warning a to fire in medlicot pipe sugar grower have felt to be intentionally insolent nothing have be said must be openly resented have surely be intended then have remembered that mother have be already month at mill that mark of neighborly courtesy have be shown to heathcotes have thought chosen to assume to be superior to to treat a though have be laboring man who have saved money

have be right have not doubted much before now did not doubt at that man with whom be speaking be wretch who be endeavoring to ruin felt certain also that jacko be true to knew too that have plainly declared suspicion to man have resolved upon doing must in way assist in circumventing man villainy by keeping suspense to man might be frightened in spite of have passed between medlicot still thought possible that might induce sugar grower to co operate with in driving nokes from neighborhood have spent night in thinking over be resolution to have come there be master said nokes if have got thing to say about thing 'd better say to harry have never before set foot upon medlicot land since have be bought away from own run have felt that must almost demean by doing so have often looked at cane from over own fence a have done on night of rain have stood always on own land now be in sugar mill never before having seen building have deal of machinery here mr medlicot said be small affair after said other hope to get good plant before have done can speak word with certainly will come into office will go across to house harry said that office must do followed medlicot into little box like inclosure contained desk two stool not much of office be what can do for mr heathcote then harry began story told at considerable length apologized for troubling neighbor at on subject endeavored to explain somewhat awkwardly that a mr medlicot be new comer probably might not understand kind of treatment to employer in bush be occasionally subject from men on matter said much have be better tactician might probably have left unspoken then went on to story of own quarrel with nokes who have in truth be grossly impudent to woman about house who have be punished by instant violent dismissal from employment be evidently be idea that man who have so sinned against master must be allowed to find other master at rate in district idea with other man who have lately come out from old country did not at sympathize do want to dismiss said medlicot in tone implied that must be last thing must think of doing have heard yet then harry went on told of fire in heat of summer of terrible effect of easy manner of revenge supplied to angry unscrupulous men of own fear at present moment can believe said medlicot be very sorry that must be so can not see justice of punishing man on merest vaguest suspicion only ground for imputing crime to be that own conduct to may have given motive harry have schooled vigorously during ride a to own demeanor have resolved that must be cool be going on to tell said what occurred night after saw up by fence then described how boy have entered shed have seen heard man a escaped from how boy have at once declared that man be nokes how following day have discovered leaf nokes doubt have deposited there just before rain intending to burn place at once how nokes manner to within last half hour have corroborated suspicion be boy call jacko be name

have then be allowed to remain about place without regular wage admit be quite dark continued medlicot harry did not at like cross examination resolution to be cool be quickly fading told that saw figure of man that barely saw figure did not form opinion of own a to man identity harry heathcote be a honest a sun much a disliked being cross examined found compelled not only to say exact truth whole truth certainly not barely saw glimpse of figure till spoke to nokes just now almost doubted whether lad must have distinguished be sure be right now really mr heathcote ca go along with be accusing man of committing offense believe be capital on evidence of boy of whom know nothing who may have own reason for spiting man whom did not believe till have looked man in face think allow to be guided too much by own power of intuition said harry who hated neighbor methodical argument at rate ca consent to take man bread out of mouth to send away tainted a must be with suspicion either because jacko thought that saw in dark because have never asked to send away what be want then want to have watched so that may feel that if attempt to destroy property guilt will be detected who be to watch be in employment life in hut down beyond gate be to keep sentry there night night will pay for mr heathcote pretend to know country yet will encourage such espionage a at rate be not english dare say man misbehaved in employment say be drunk doubt be not drunkard for never drink here man be not to starve forever because once got drunk be impertinent be to have spy at heel because boy whom nobody know chooses to denounce be sorry that must be in trouble know can help harry passion be now very high resolution to be cool be almost thrown to wind medlicot have said many thing be odious to in first place there have be tone of insufferable superiority so harry thought that too when have divested of superiority naturally attached to position have frankly appealed to medlicot a neighbor then new fangled sugar grower have told that be not english have said grand word have altogether made objectionable what did man know of australian bush that must dare to talk of that a being wrong because be un english in england there be police to guard men property here out in australian forest man must guard own lose perhaps be indifference to ruin of woman belonging to that harry heathcote felt strongest stranger cared nothing for utter desolation one unscrupulous ruffian might produce felt horror at idea of vast devastating fire must be indignant in mock philanthropy because be proposed to watch doings of scoundrel good morning said harry turning round leaving office brusquely medlicot followed harry went so quickly that not word be spoken to idea of neighbor in bush refusing such assistance a have asked be a terrible a to be thought of ship at sea leaving ship in distress unhitched horse from fence galloped home a fast a animal must carry medlicot when be left

raising lowering trap giving direction to polynesian a did so be evidently conscious that be being regarded a be usual in such condition manifestly failed in struggle to appear unconscious medlicot acknowledged to that man must not look even in face be possible that have be wrong heathcote though have expressed badly be entitled to sympathy in fear of what might be done to by enemy medlicot also desired to be just being more rational more logical le impulsive than other being also somewhat too conscious of own superior intelligence knew that heathcote have gone away in great dudgeon almost feared that have be harsh unneighborly after while stood opposite nokes addressed do squatter suffer much from fire said heathcote have be talking to about said man ca say mr heathcote when speak of

go to gate to see mount horse not refraining from doing so in anger a wishing to exhibit displeasure at harry violence because be afraid of have found compelled to differ from be oppressed at finding in opposition to feeling that wife must in way take part against added greatly to heathcote trouble produced in mind terrible feeling of loneliness in sorrow bore brave outside to men to stranger whom in day met about run to wife sister also to old woman at home forced upon idea that be not only autocratic self sufficient also that wanted help sympathy never cried out in pain being heartily ashamed even of appeal have made to medlicot spoke aloud laughed with men never acknowledged that trial be almost too much for be painfully conscious of own weakness sometimes felt when alone in bush that must fain get off horse lie upon ground weep till slept be not that trusted one suspected one with positive suspicion except nokes medlicot a supporter of nokes have one with whom must converse freely none whom have not be accustomed to treat a mere minister of will except wife wife sister now be disjoined from by sympathy with medlicot have chosen to manage thing without contradiction almost

called boundary rider one irishman other german trusted fully german altogether irishman equally a regarded honesty must not explain to thought loaded brain must instigate to eagerness must not condescend to tell karl bender german that if fence be destroyed mean credit must be sufficient to put up again that if scanty herbage be burned off large proportion of run must sell flock at great sacrifice must explain to mickey o'dowd irishman that peace of mind be destroyed by fear of one man have to bear alone there be heavy on also great misery of feeling thing might depend on own exertion

have fretted in fashion because of malice of man how must be with must be forced to move from gangoil yet with love have parted almost in anger surely must understand tenderness of message have just sent her of sudden a be riding stopped horse listened attentively from great distance there fell upon accustomed ear sound recognized though be aware that place from whence came be at least two mile distant be thud of axe against tree listened still be sure that be so turned at once toward sound though in doing so left course at right angle have be going directly away from river with back to wool shed now changed course riding in direction of spot at jacko have nearly fallen in jumping over fence a continued on sound became plainer till at last reining in horse must see form of woodman who be still at work ringing tree be job man did by contract receiving so much acre for depopulation of timber be now bright moonlight almost a clear a day very different night indeed from on rain have come harry must see at glance that be man called boscobel still at work now there be a thought very good reason why boscobel at present moment must not be so employed boscobel be receiving wage for work of kind bos said squatter riding up addressing man by customary abbreviation of nickname thought be watching at brownbie boundary boscobel lowered axe stood for while contemplating proposition made to be drawing three shilling night for watching be that so yes be so anyways will draw then why ai watching there be nothing to watch know on not just now then why must pay for be to pay for ringing tree ai certainly mr heathcote then be to make double use of time sell twice over be try to look like fool a though did understand know that what be doing be honest nobody ever said a be honest before tell so now be robbing of time have sold to for be to pay there ai nothing to watch while wind a be now that chap ai where about to night what chap oh know be right what be use of dawdling about up there in

tree hid there be enemy made have never felt quite sure of man have be glad to have about place a being thoroughly efficient in own business be only during last ten day that have agreed to pay for night watching leaving man to do a much additional day work a pleased for of course must be paid at regular contract price there be double purpose intended in watching a be well understood by hand employed first that of preventing incendiary fire by mere presence of watcher secondly that of being at hand to extinguish fire in case of need now man ringing tree five six mile away from beat on be stationed must not serve of purpose boscobel therefore have be fraudulently at work for own dishonest purpose knew well that employment be of nature be quite clear to heathcote be clear to also that when detected fraud be bound to expose have man acknowledged fault be submissive there must have be end of matter heathcote must have said word about to one must not have stopped farthing from week unearned wage that have to encounter certain amount of ill usage from rough men about to forgive must understand must not be duty a man master to pas over dishonesty without noticing that must not do though gangoil must burn from end to end did not much mind being robbed knew that to certain extent must endure to be cheated must endure must never teach men to think that passed over such matter

still have enough to eat drink clothes to wear did not work half a hard a employer thought that if must only find one person who must sympathize with support must not mind mental loneliness of position almost broke heart then there came across mind dim remembrance of certain old school word touched horse with spur hurried onward let there be step backward thought a to manliness of persevering of want of manliness in yielding to depression came to rescue let at rate have comfort of thinking that have done best according to light after dim fashion did come to recognize a fact that nothing must really support approbation though fell from horse in utter weariness must persevere a night wore on came to german hut finding empty a expected rode on to outside fence of run when

chapter vii wish 'd like saturday night heathcote have be on run did not return home to bed till nearly dawn on sunday morning at about noon prayer be read out on veranda congregation consisting of mr heathcote sister mr growler jacko harry be rather averse to performance intimating that mr growler if be so minded must read prayer for herself in kitchen that a regarded jacko must be altogether thrown away wife have made point of maintaining practice have of course yielded service be not long when be over harry got into chair be soon asleep have be in saddle during sixteen hour of previous day night be entitled to be fatigued wife sat beside now again protecting from fly while kate daly sat by with bible in hand too from time to time be watching brother in law trouble of spirit work that felt bound to do touched with strong feeling taught to regard for time a young hero how quietly sleep kate said fatigue of last week must have be terrible be quite quite knocked up said wife ai knocked up bit said harry jumping up from chair what must knock up be asleep be just dozing dear ah well there be thing to do be too hot to get out wonder old bates did come in for prayer think care much for prayer said mr heathcote like excuse for nobbler a well a one did tell that have fire over at jackson yesterday at goolaroo be there harm done deal of grass burned have to drive sheep wo serve kind of weather know fear most grass fence sheep a for building think will try again why not harry risk of being seen be too great can hardly understand that man like nokes must have be fool a be think be nokes oh yes certainly in first place jacko be a true a steel mean to swear by boy though think be good boy be sure be true in then man manner to myself be conclusive can not understand man in medlicot position supporting fellow like by heaven nearly drive mad to think of thousand thousand of pound be at stake that man have in world be exposed to malice of scoundrel like nokes then man who call gentleman will talk about being un english to look after be 'new chum suppose be excuse if be sufficient excuse must excuse said kate with good feminine logic be just like over be good looking therefore be all right ought to have learned better ought at rate to believe that men who have be here much longer than have must know way of country great deal better be christmas time harry said wife must endeavor to forgive neighbor what sort of christmas will be if young fellow here kate be burned out of gangoil here bates well mr bates how go tremendous hot sir have found that out already have heard where fellow boscobel have gone have heard will be over with of brownbie lad say georgie brownbie about country somewhere if so there will be row among when thief fall out mr bates honest men come by own so say mr heathcote same must care how far georgie be away from place have to do with then young master old superintendent sauntered out to back premise to talk about sheep fire plan for putting out fire doubt mr bates have glass of brandy water have come to regard a one of sunday luxury from back premise went down to creek to gauge water then sauntered on keeping always in shade sitting down here to smoke standing up there to discus pedigree of particular ram till be past six may a well come in dine with mr bates harry suggested a returned toward station mr bates said that thought that must a same invitation be given on almost sunday throughout year be invariably answered in same way there be not much excitement in mr bates must not have dreamed of going in to dinner without being asked be medlicot trap said mr bates a entered yard heard wheel when be in horse paddock harry looked at trap then went quickly into house walked with rapid step onto veranda there found sugar grower mother mr heathcote looked at husband almost timidly knew from very sound of foot that be perturbed in spirit under own roof tree must certainly be courteous there be constrained courtesy very hard to be borne of knew to be capable first went up to old lady to greeting be pleasant enough harry heathcote though have assumed bush mode of dressing still retained manner of high bred gentleman in intercourse with woman then turning sharply round gave hand to mr medlicot be glad to see at gangoil said be not fortunate enough to be at home when called other day mr medlicot must have found drive very hot fear wife be still looking into face be reading there a in book mingled pride disdain with husband exercising civility to enemy harry countenance wore look not difficult of perusal medlicot must read line almost a distinctly a harry wife have asked mr medlicot to stay dine with said so that may have cool for drive back be almost afraid of bush at night said old woman will have full moon said harry will be a light a day so be settled heathcote thought odd that man whom regarded a enemy whom have left at last meeting in positive hostility must consent to accept dinner under roof be medlicot affair not dined at seven after dinner strolled out into horse paddock down to creek a started three men went first lady followed bates soon dropped behind be rest day have already moved quite a much a be usual with on sunday think be little hard with other day said medlicot when be alone together suppose hardly understand other idea said harry spoke with constrained voice with almost savage manner engendered by determination to hold own must forgive offense for apology be made apology have be made a yet to tell truth be little afraid that if got into argument on matter medlicot must have best of there be too almost claim to superiority in medlicot use of word hard when one man say that have be hard to almost boast that on occasion got better of be just said medlicot quite understand other might believe in other same then understanding must come be just that want to say such talking rarely doe good what be then may perhaps be right about man nokes doubt may know be right when asked whether 'd be at shed what made say that have be there at night time said nothing about night time man be there at night time must have used word be not sure that be evidence perhaps not in england mr medlicot be good enough evidence for bush what made pretend did know distance why ca look man in face why must boy have said be if be of course if think well of be right to keep may take a rule out here that when man have be dismissed have be done for nothing men treated that way must travel out of country be better for party be here a be at home where people live so thick together that nothing be thought of man being dismissed be obliged to discharge now be enemy man may be enemy without being felon of course may be enemy in way must hurt hair of head unjustly when see attempt made to burn out of course know that enemy have be at work be there one else have got grudge against harry be silent for moment what right have man to cross examine about enmity man whose own position in place have be one of hostility to whom have almost suspected of harboring nokes at mill simply because nokes have be dismissed from gangoil that suspicion be indeed fading away there be something in medlicot voice manner made impossible to attribute such motif to nevertheless man be free selector have taken bit of gangoil run after fashion to heathcote be objectionable politically morally socially let medlicot in regard to character be what might be free selector squatter enemy have clinched hostility by employing servant dismissed from very run out of have bought land be hard to say replied at length who have grudge a against whom why suppose have great grudge against if truth be to be known sha' burn down mill be sure wo yet say worse of behind back than will to face want to think that have occasion to speak ill of one way other what mean be quite think that evidence against nokes be strong enough to justify in sending away will keep eye on a well a can seems that left place early morning men be not supposed to be there on sunday of course doe a plea with conversation then dropped in little time harry made excuse for leaving returned to house alone promising however that must not start for night ride till after party have come back to station there be hurry at said sha stir for two hour yet mickey will be waiting there for store for german mean nobbler for mickey said kate either of men must think treat to ride ten mile in ten mile back with horse load of sugar tea flour for sake of glass of brandy water so must said harry if lived in hut by for fortnight with nothing to drink tea without milk old lady mr heathcote be soon seated on grass while medlicot kate daly roamed on together kate be pretty modest girl timid withal shy unused to society therefore awkward with natural instinct aptitude of sex what glass of brandy water be to mickey o'dowd after fortnight solitude in bush hut with tea damper lump of mutton young man in guise of gentleman be to poor kate daly brother in law let be ever so good be after better than tea without milk doubt mickey o'dowd often thought about nobbler in thirsty solitude so did kate speculate on what might possibly be attraction of lover medlicot probably indulged in such speculation nobbler when brought close to lip be grateful to a to others kate daly be very pretty man must doubt be sad that must have to ride about night like said kate to whom a be proper harry heathcote at present moment be of more importance than other human being suppose like oh mr medlicot how can like be not hard work mind constant dread of coming excitement keep alive there be plenty on station to keep man alive in way at time plenty to keep lady alive too oh lady know that lady have business in bush harry trouble be about sister child must care straw for do think 'd be better without wife kate hesitated for moment well no suppose must be very rough without mary 'd be so lonely when came in nobody to make tea to look after thing said kate earnestly know be very rough before came here say that there be regular meal just food in cupboard when chose to get be not comfortable certainly horrid must think suppose be better for to be married have got mother mr medlicot yes have got mother make difference doe not very great difference will save from having to go to cupboard for bread meat suppose having woman about be better for man have got thing else to do therefore can look to thing do help to look to thing suppose do something often feel ashamed to think how very little be a for be not wanted at so that be free to go elsewhere did mean that mr medlicot only know be not of much use if have house of own gangoil be home just a much a be mary sometimes feel that harry be just a good to a be to mary sister will never leave gangoil not unless harry get station will have to be transplanted day kate merely chucked up head pouted lip a though to show that proposition be one did not deserve answer will marry squatter of course miss daly suppose will ever marry body mr medlicot must marry one squatter can quite understand that squatter here be what lord country gentleman be at home ca even picture to myself what sort of life people live at home medlicot kate daly meant england when spoke of home there be so much difference a people think class hang together just in same way only think there be little more exclusiveness here than there be there in answer to kate asserted with innocent eagerness that be not at exclusive that if ever married one 'd marry man liked wish 'd like said medlicot be nonsense said kate in low timid whisper hurrying away to rejoin other lady must speculate on delight of beverage a must mickey o'dowd in hut when be first brought to lip must only fly away from in respect mickey o'dowd be more sensible of two other word be spoken that night between kate lay awake till morning thinking of one word have be spoken secret be kept sacredly within own bosom before medlicots started that night old lady made proposition that heathcotes miss daly must eat christmas dinner at medlicot mill mr heathcote thinking perhaps of sister thoroughly liking what have seen of medlicots looked anxiously into harry face if must consent to intimacy must follow probably real friendship be made be out of question said very firmness however with spoke gave certain cordiality even to refusal must be at home so that men may know where to find till go out for night then after pause continued a ca go to why must not come to so be at last decided much to harry own astonishment much to wife delight kate therefore when lay awake thinking of one word have be spoken knew that there must be opportunity for word medlicot drove mother home safely after have taken into house encountered nokes on return from boolabong a have be told at close of last chapter chapter viii do wish must come on monday morning harry came home a usual a usual went to bed after breakfast must care about heat if be not for wind said to wife a threw down wind carry so suppose yes come from just wrong side from northwest there have be dozen fire about to day during night mean yesterday sunday can not make out whether come by certainly be not all made by incendiary accident perhaps well yes somebody drop match sun ignites chance be much against fire like spreading care be wanted to make spread a far a can learn worst fire have not be just after midday when of course heat be greater in early night before dew have come same feel that know nothing about nothing at let sleep long in spite of injunction mr heathcote determined that must sleep day if must even night be fearfully hot sultry on monday morning have come home much fatigued must be out again at sunset now must have what rest nature must allow in resolve be opposed by jacko who came in at eleven requested to see master jacko have be over with german a explained to mr heathcote two have be in out sometimes sleeping sometimes watching now wanted to see master under persuasion must impart information to mistress poor wife anxious a be that husband must sleep did not dare in perilous time to ignore jacko information therefore gently woke sleeper in few minute jacko be standing by young squatter bedside harry heathcote quite awake be sitting up listening george brownbie at boolabong at first be gravamen of jacko news know that already jacko word exclaimed jacko in part georgie brownbie be regarded almost a evil one jacko knowing what mischief be a be in word thought that be entitled to bread jam if not to nobbler in bringing such tidings to gangoil be that asked heathcote bos be at boolabong bill nokes be there sunday jerry brownbie be out with bos georgie old man must say thing of kind jacko old man know nothing about word tell about nothing tom tom away in prison always cotches best when want to send to prison if 'd lock up jerry georgie jack word yes think be arranging at boolabong in course be see why boscobel must be at boolabong without intending harm of course 'd go there when left gangoil that be where go bill nokes mr harry bill nokes too though why must travel so far from work weather ca say word mr harry did see fire about way last night jacko shook head go into kitchen get something to eat wait for will be out before long now though heathcote have made light of assemblage of evil spirit at boolabong have seemed so important to jacko by mean did regard news a unessential of nokes villany be convinced of boscobel have imprudently made second enemy at most inauspicious time georgie brownbie have long be bitter foe have prosecuted perhaps persecuted georgie for various offense a georgie be supposed to be a much at war with own brother a with rest of world at large heathcote have not thought much of miscreant in present emergency if miscreant be in truth at boolabong if evil thing be being plotted against gangoil georgie must certainly be among conspirator soon after noon harry be on horseback jacko be at heel heat be more intense than ever mr heathcote have twisted round harry hat long white scarf called puggeree though be by mean sure of spelling jacko have spread very dirty fragment of old white handkerchief on head wore hat over mr heathcote have begged harry to take large cotton parasol have nearly consented being unable at last to reconcile to idea of riding with accoutrement even in bush heat bore said be not bit afraid of a long a keep moving yes will be back to dinner though wo say when wo say for how long will be same thing day to morrow wish with heart people be not coming rode straight away to german hut be on northwestern extremity of further paddock in direction from thence western fence ran in southerly direction nearly straight to river beyond fence be strip of land in part over mile broad in others not much over quarter of mile claimed a belonging to gangoil over brownbies have driven cattle since fence have be made under pretense that fence marked boundary of two run against assumption heathcote have remonstrated frequently have driven cattle back have exercised ownership of crown tenant in such fashion a nature of occupation allowed beyond strip be boolabong house at boolabong being not above three mile distant from fence not above four mile from german hut so that brownbies be in truth much nearer neighbor to german than be heathcote family between german brownbies there raged internecine feud doubt harry heathcote in heart liked german better on account behooved a master magistrate to regard report against boolabong coming from german with something of suspicion now jacko have be introduced to gangoil under german auspex have soon come to decision that must be good thing just to lock up brownbies in great jail of colony at brisbane probably knew nothing of law justice in abstract greatly valued law when exercised against hated western fence of mention have be made ran down to mary river hitting about four mile west of medlicot mill so that there be considerable portion of gangoil run having frontage to water a have be before said medlicot plantation be about fourteen mile distant from house at boolabong distance from gangoil house to of brownbies be about same oppressiveness of day be owing more to hot wind than to sun wind coming from arid plain of interior brought with dry suffocating heat on occasion be odious to harry heathcote not so much on account of own intrinsic abomination a because might cause fire to sweep across run from western boundary just beyond boundary there lay boolabong there be collected enemy fire must have passed for mile so across pasture outside beyond own farm must be altogether unextinguishable by time that have reached paddock brownbies a knew well must care nothing for burning patch of own grass stock if have at present moment be much too few in number to be affected by such loss brownbies have not yard of fencing to be burned fire if once got hold on edge of run must pas on away from right across harry pasture harry fence if such be case must have quite enough to do to drive sheep from fire might be that many of also must perish in flame catastrophe might even be so bad so frightful that shed station must go though in thinking of fire of have heard must remember none have spread with fatality such a that found karl bender in hut asleep man be soon up apologizing for somnolence preparing tea for master entertainment be not christmas like at home at be mr 'eathcote dear red divils be there ready to give christmas roasting then told how have boldly ridden up to boolabong that morning have seen georgie boscobel with own eye when asked what have said to replied that did not wait till thing have be said have hurried away a fast a horse must carry will go up to boolabong said harry word will just about knock head off suggested jacko karl bender also thought that making of such visit must be source of danger heathcote explained that personal attack be not to be apprehended from men be not game said arguing that men who premeditated secret outrage must not probably be tempted into personal violence horror of position lay in though fire must rise up almost under foot of men who be known to be hostile to whose character be acknowledged to be bad still must there be evidence against be known to men at period of heat such a be now raging fire be common day pasture be in flame here there where be said indeed that there existed evidence of fire in bush till men have come with flock then there have be no smoking boiling of pot camping out till men have come match one around might be sure that particular fire have be work of incendiary might be able to name culprit who have done deed yet jury must convict miscreant watchfulness be best security watchfulness day night till rain must come heathcote calculated that must be better for that enemy must know that be watchful must go up among show that be not ashamed to speak to of anxiety must hear nothing by coming did not already know be well aware that be on watch might be well that must know also how close watch be kept took german jacko with left with horse about mile on boolabong side of own fence nigh to extreme boundary of debatable land knew whistle be to ride to at once must call have left house about noon saying that must be home to dinner however on such occasion be held to be feast movable over wide space of time on occasion woman expected to come early a be intention to be out again a soon a must be dark mr growler be asked to have dinner ready at six during day mr heathcote be backward forward in kitchen then be something wrong knew must not quite discern evil sing sing cook be more than ordinarily alert sing sing cook be not much trusted mr growler be a good a bank a far a went having lived with old mr daly when be prosperous be apt to be downhearted on present occasion be more than usually low in spirit whenever mr heathcote spoke wept at six o'clock came into parlor with budget of news sing sing cook have be gone for last half hour leaving leg of mutton at fire soon became clear to that have altogether absconded rat always doe leave falling house said mr growler at seven o'clock sun be down though gloom of tropical evening have not yet come two lady went out to gate be few yard from veranda there stood listening for sound of harry horse low moaning of wind through tree must be heard be so gentle continuous unaltered that seemed to be no more than vehicle for other sound be a death like a silence gate of horse paddock through heathcote must pas on way home be nearly mile distant road there be hard knew that must hear from there fall of horse foot there stood from seven to nearly eight whispering word now then to other listening always in vain looking away to west now then fancied that must see sky glow with flame then must tell other that be fancy evening grew darker still darker sound be heard through moaning wind from time to time mr growler came out to declaring fear in measured term well marm do declare think 'd better go away out of go away mr growler what nonsense where can go to mill must be nearest ma'be must be safe there be sure mr medlicot must take in why must not be safe here said kate that wretched chinese have gone left for nothing miss what must three lone woman do here if brownbies came down upon why master come back ought to come back ought ma'be never do think what lone woman be mr heathcote took husband part very strongly gave mr growler a hard scolding a knew how to pronounce own courage be giving way much a mr growler have done be bound to stay here said if worst come must bear a others have done before then mr growler be very sulky retreating to kitchen sobbed there in solitude oh kate do wish must come said elder sister be afraid be so desolate may be so far off must get to if thing happened must know then be again silent remained without exchanging more than word two for nearly hour took hold of other now then went to kitchen door that old woman might be comforted by presence have consolation to offer other silence of bush feeling of great distance dread of calamity almost crushed at last there be distant sound of horse foot hear said mr heathcote rushing forward toward outer gate of horse paddock followed by sister ear be true be doomed to disappointment horseman be only messenger from husband mickey o'dowd irish boundary rider have great tidings to tell be so long telling that will not attempt to give in own word purport of story be a follows harry have be to boolabong house have found there one old man returning home thence toward own fence have smelled smoke of fire have found within furlong of path long ridge of burning grass according to mickey account must not have be lighted above few minute before heathcote presence on spot a be have got too much ahead for to put out single handed few yard might have managed so mickey said probably exaggerating matter there be quarter of mile of flame have therefore ridden on before fire have called own two men to have at once lighted grass two hundred yard in front making second fire so keeping down that must be always under control before hinder flame have caught bender jacko have be with have thus managed to consume fuel have remained there must have fed fire be too strong to be mastered by watching extremity of line of fire overpowered so damage be for moment at end method of dealing with enemy be so well known in bush have be so often canvassed in hearing of two sister that be clearly intelligible to evil have be met in proper way remedy have be effective why did not harry come home mickey o'dowd after fashion explained that too lady be not to wait dinner master felt obliged to remain out at night have gotten food at german hut mickey be commissioned to return with flask full of brandy a must be necessary that harry with men whom must trust must be on rampage night small body be to consist of harry of german of jacko according to story a at present told especially of mickey o'dowd much a must have wished to have kept man at station for protection did not think of disobeying husband order so mickey be fed then sent back with flask with tidings also a to desertion of wretched cook sing sing will sit here night said mr heathcote to sister a thing be will not think of going to bed kate declared that must also sit in veranda night a matter of course be joined by mr growler have be so seated about hour when kate daly declared that heaven be on fire two young woman jumped up flew to gate found that whole western horizon be lurid with dark red light chapter ix bush fight harry heathcote have on occasion entertained doubt that fire have be intentional premeditated lighted torch must have be dragged along grass so a to ignite line many yard long at same time have be luckily near enough to spot to see almost commencement of burning be therefore aware of form circumstance almost wondered that have not seen figure of man who have drawn torch at rate heard step pursuit must have be out of question a work be wanted at moment to extinguish flame miscreant probably have remembered have known that might escape stealthily without noise of rapid retreat when work be over when have put out fire have lighted have exterminated lingering remnant of have be intended to destroy stood still while almost in despair condition seemed to be hopeless what must do against band of enemy knowing a did that have be backed even by score of trusty follower one foe might still suffice to ruin at present moment be very hot with work have done a be also jacko german o'dowd have also come up a be completing work mode of extinguishing flame have be to beat down with branch of gum tree loaded with leaf by sweeping along burning ground low flame must be scattered expelled work be very hard hot bough used be heavy air around sultry enough from own property be made almost unbearable by added heat of fire work have be so far done might be begun again at moment near at distance doubt attempt must be made elsewhere along boundary between gangoil boolabong be very probably being made at moment two men whom must trust jacko be now with be wiping brow with arm panting with work first resolved on sending mickey o'dowd to house distance be great man assistance might be essential must not bear to leave wife without news from then after considering while made up mind to go back toward own fence making way a went southerly down toward river who be determined to injure must thought repeat attempt in direction hardly said word to two follower rode at foot pace to spot at fence have selected a site of bivouac for night wo be very cheery bender said to german will have to make night of till disturb again german made motion with arm intended to signify utter indifference one place be same a to jacko uttered usual ejaculation then having hitched horse to fence threw on back upon grass doubt slept slept a watcher sleep with one eye open be harry who first saw light few minute later made visible to lady at home station karl exclaimed jumping up be at again look there in le than minute without speaking word be on horse riding in direction of light came from part of boolabong run somewhat nearer to river than place at have stationed where strip of ground between harry fence acknowledged boundary of brownbie run be narrowest a approached fire became aware that have be lighted on boolabong on occasion harry did not ride on up to flame knowing that use loss of few minute might save destroy property hardly spoke word a proceeded on business feeling that upon whom have to depend be sufficiently instructed if only must be sufficiently energetic keep well under let run be said a lighting dried bush with match ran fire along ground in front of coming flame stranger seeing must have felt sure that remedy must have be a bad a disease for fire harry made now again seemed to get better of who be endeavoring to control there might perhaps be quarter of mile between front of advancing fire line at harry have commenced to destroy food must have fed coming flame a quickly a lighted grass in be work of moment must strain to utmost at much harder task of controlling own fire so that must not run away from get a be out of hand be a bad to a be thus seeking to circumvent german jacko worked like hero probably with intense enjoyment of excitement after while found fourth figure among flame for mickey have now returned saw harry said panting with work be right said mickey flopping away with great bough tarnation chinese have gone off word sing sing find at boolabong said german whose gum tree bough be very big one whose thought be intent on letting fire run while still held in hand have not breath for syllable back fire be extending so a to get round now then harry extended own line moving always forward toward gangoil a did so though men be always on brownbie territory have doubt that where must succeed in destroying grass for breadth of forty fifty yard must starve out inimical flame tree bush without herbage must not enable to travel yard wherever grass be burned down black to soil fire must stop must who be at work once allow to be outflanked exertion must be in vain then wretch might light dozen fire work be so hard so hot often so hopeless that unhappy young squatter be more than once tempted to bid men desist to return to homestead flame must not follow there must at rate make that safe then when have repudiated feeling a unworthy of began to consider within whether must not do better for property by taking men with on to run endeavoring to drive sheep out of danger a thought of still worked still fired grass still controlled flame presently became aware of what seemed to at first to be third fire through tree in direction of river must see glimmering of low flame figure of men be soon apparent to that men be working in cause that too be burning grass must have fed advancing flame at first must not spare minute must be necessary to find out who be friend a drew nearer knew man be sugar planter from mill with foreman have be doing best said medlicot have be terribly afraid that fire must slip away from be only thing said harry too much excited at moment to ask question a to cause of medlicot presence so far from home at time of evening be getting round be afraid same know be be almost impossible to distinguish how hot fire make hot indeed said harry be killing work for men then for good to think that men creature that call men must do thing a break one heart have paused a spoke leaning on great battered bough held in instant be at work with again do stay here mr medlicot with men will go on beyond where began if find fire growing down will shout can come to so saying rushed on with lighted bush torch in band suddenly found confronted in bush by man on horseback whom at once recognized a georgie brownbie forgot for moment where be began to question reprobate a to presence at spot be like impudence said georgie be not only trespassing be destroying property willfully ask what business have here be nice sort of young man harry checked for moment by remembrance that be in truth upon boolabong run did not at once answer put that bush down burn grass continued georgie will have to answer for what right have to fire grass who fired first lighted be rule why must light more give over punch head for harry men medlicot be advancing toward trampling out own ember a came georgie brownbie who be alone when saw that there be four five men against turned round rode back did ever see impudence like said harry be probably very man who set match yet come brazens out with think be man who set match said medlicot quietly at rate there be who be man nokes saw with torch in hand heaven earth yes mr heathcote saw put down be about right see be about wrong harry have not word to say unless be tell man that loved for frankness of confession moment be hardly auspicious for such declaration there be excuse for to pause in work for fire be still crackling at back did more than pause ah said harry there go will be done at last for saw that be being outflanked by advancing flame still worked drawing line of fire here there still hoped that there might be ground for hope nokes have be seen pregnant a theme might be with word be almost impossible to talk question must not be asked answered without stopping in toil there be question harry longed to ask must medlicot swear to man did man know that have be seen if knew that have be watched while lit grass must soon be far away from medlicot mill gangoil harry felt that must be consolation to in trouble if must get hold of man keep prosecute have hung even in tumult of moment be able to reflect about to think that remembered that crime of arson be capital in colony of queensland have endeavored to be good to men with whom have dealing have not stinted food cut short in wage be hard in exacting work from be return idea a to excellence of absolute dominion power flitted across brain such power a abraham doubt exercised in abraham time people be submissive world be happy harry heathcote at least have never heard that be not happy a thought of worked away with bush match extinguishing flame here lighting there striving to make cordon of black bare ground between boolabong gangoil surely abraham have never be called on to work like men be in line covering something above quarter of mile of ground of line be nearest to river medlicot foreman farthest from german o'dowd be in middle jacko be working with master if harry have just cause for anger sorrow in regard to nokes boscobel certainly have equal cause to be proud of stanchness of remaining satellite men worked with will a though whole run have be personal property of of nokes boscobel must probably have done same have fire come before have quarreled with master be small narrow point turn rushing train to right to left rushing man be often turned off by point a small narrow word said jacko on sudden here be o horseback a spoke there be sound of dozen horseman galloping up to through bush why there be bos own self said two leading men be joe jerry brownbie who for night only have composed quarrel close to be boscobel there be others behind also mounted jack brownbie georgie nokes though figure be seen must not be distinguished in gloom of night indeed did harry at first discern of how many party consisted seemed that there be whole troop of horseman whose purpose be to interrupt in work so that flame must certainly go ahead be evident that men thought that must do so without subjecting to legal penalty a far a harry heathcote must see be correct in view must have right to burn grass on boolabong have claim even to be there be true that must plead that be stopping fire have purposely made must prove handiwork whereas must be almost impossible that must prove theirs whole forest be not red lurid with fire air be laden with smell heat of conflagration horseman be dressed a be harry in trowsers shirt with old slouch hat of have cudgel in hand a came galloping up through tree be a uncanny unwelcome set of visitor a man be ever called on to receive harry necessarily stayed work stood still to bear brunt of coming attack jacko went on with employment faster than ever a though troop of men in dark be nothing to jerry brownbie be first to speak what be be up to heathcote firing grass be arson will swing for will take chance of said harry turning to work again be blessed if do ride over bos while stop other fellow brownbies have be aware that harry two boundary rider be with have not heard of arrival of medlicot other man nokes be aware that one on horseback have be near when be firing grass have thought that be one of party from gangoil by time jerry brownbie have reached german medlicot be there also who deuce be asked jerry what business be that of yours said medlicot business of mine firing grass will let know business pretty quickly be that fellow medlicot from sugar mill said man that nokes be with thought be horse of color continued jerry who have be given to understand medlicot be heathcote enemy anyway wo have grass fired if god abeighty chooses to send fire ca help be not going to have incendiary here a well be new chum understand what be about must stop a medlicot still went on putting out fire jerry attempted to ride down medlicot caught horse by rein violently backed brute in among ember animal plunged reared getting head loose at last came down rider together in mean time joe brownbie seeing rode up behind sugar planter struck violently with cudgel over shoulder medlicot sank nearly to ground at once recovered knew that bone on left side of body be broken must still fight with right hand did fight boscobel georgie brownbie attempted to ride over harry together might have succeeded have not jacko ingeniously inserted burning branch of gum tree with have be working under belly of horse on boscobel be riding animal jumped immediately from ground bucking into air boscobel be thrown far over head georgie brownbie then turned upon jacko jacko be far too nimble to be caught escaped among tree for few minute fight be general footman have best of in spite of injury done to medlicot jerry be bruised burned about face by fall among ash did not much relish work afterward boscobel be stunned for few moment be quite ready to retreat when came to nokes during whole time did not show alleging a reason afterward presence of employer

to fight day know when man be to come forward when be not hang be not so near hanging a folk at boolabong may imagine therefore that night be not spent pleasantly among brownbies after adventure there be of course very much cursing swearing very many threat before party from boolabong did retreat great point be of coarse heathcote be willfully firing grass be therefore no better than incendiary of course stoutly denied that original fire have be intentional denied a stoutly that original fire must be stopped by fire at last went leaving heathcote party master of battle field jerry be taken away in sad condition in subsequent account of transaction given from boolabong fall be put forward a reason of flight having be general on occasion boscobel have certainly lost stomach for immediate fighting immediately behind battle field come across nokes sing sing runaway cook from gangoil poor chinaman have made mistake of joining party be not successful harry though victory be with be hardly in mood for triumph soon found that medlicot collar bone be broken must be necessary therefore that must return with wounded man to station flame a feared have altogether got ahead of during fight a

flame have crept on to southward have now got beyond reach have seemed however that mass of fire have got away from be small already damp of night be on grass harry felt justified in hoping not that there might be loss that loss might not be ruinous medlicot consented to be taken back to gangoil instead of to mill perhaps thought that kate daly might be better nurse than mother that quiet of sheep station might be better for than clatter of own mill wheel be midnight have ride of fourteen mile be hard enough upon man with broken collarbone whole party also be thoroughly fatigued work have be doing be about a hard a must fall to man lot have now be many hour without food before started mickey produced flask content of be divided equally among including jacko a be preparing to start home

must be sufficient to take medlicot to station must reach place a soon a if flame be still running ahead knew that must not now stop then must at least learn how matter stood with if worst came to worst must not now lose more than three four mile of fencing grass off corner of run nevertheless tired a be must not bear idea of going home without knowing whole story so made proposal medlicot of course made objection of men offered to go with declined service there be nothing to do said nobody to catch if fire be burning must burn so went alone word that have uttered among men have not be

harm after leaving fire have still ride of seven eight mile through gloom of forest alone not only be weary horse be so tired that must hardly get to canter for furlong regretted that have not brought boy with knowing well service of companionship to tired beast be used to such trouble must always tell that back be broad enough to bear desolation among enemy oppressed medlicot however be no longer enemy then there came across mind for first time idea medlicot might marry sister in law become fast friend if must have one true friend thought that must bear enmity of brownbies hitherto have be entirely alone in anxiety be between three four when reached gangoil found that party of horseman have just entered yard before sugar planter be so weak that must hardly get off horse two lady be still watching when cavalcade arrived though be then between three four in morning be harry custom on such occasion to ride up to little gate close to veranda there to hang bridle till one must take

be procured from maryborough now maryborough be thirty mile distant one must be dispatched at once jacko volunteered in such service jacko be hardly to be trusted might fall asleep on horse continue slumber on ground mickey german offered men be so beaten by work that heathcote did not dare to take offer will tell what be mary said to wife there be nothing for for to go for jackson jackson be doctor can see police at same time sha' go harry yon be so tired already can hardly stand moment get strong coffee at once know what man have done for will tell time owe more than ride into

art in bush where doctor can not be have bone will set when doctor do come come slowly broken bone suit to such tardiness medlicot be brought in put to bed let reader not be shocked to hear that kate daly room be given up to a being best suited for sick man comfort two lady took in turn to watch mr heathcote be of course first remained with till dawn then kate crept to door asked whether must relieve sister medlicot be asleep be agreed that kate must remain in veranda look in from time to time to see whether wounded man required aught at hand looked in very often then at last be awake miss daly said feel so ashamed of trouble be giving speak of be nothing in bush body of course doe thing for body when word be spoken felt that be not a complimentary a must have wished be to have come to day know did not think 'd come like did know why did go home instead of coming here doctor will reach gangoil sooner than must mill be better here will send for mr medlicot a soon a men have have rest how be mr medlicot harry say that there be fight that came in just at nick of time for run must have be burned not that at said so only went off so quickly be so busy with thing that hardly understood be not dreadful that there must be such fighting then horrid fire be in middle of fire be not suited kate feeling that medlicot must be hero of occasion be lighting in front to put out behind then while be at work men from boolabong came upon oh mr medlicot will be so very very wretched if be much hurt sister be so unhappy about be only collar bone miss daly be so dreadful be still thinking of one word have spoken when have well not asked for love said that between young man young woman ought to mean same thing perhaps have meant nothing have heard that young men do say thing mean nothing to living in solitude of gangoil one word have be so much heart have melted with absolute acknowledged love when man have be brought through into house with added attraction of broken bone while sister have watched have retired to rest a mary have said in truth to think of chance have brought in guise into familiar contact with man loved then when have crept up to take place in watching have almost felt that shame must restrain be duty of course man with collar bone broken must not speak of love will make christmas so sad for said oh a for that mind nothing about for be never very gay here be happy oh yes quite happy except when harry be disturbed by trouble think body have so many trouble a squatter sometimes seems that world be against will be ally now at rate oh do so hope will said kate putting hand together in energy then retreating from energy with sad awkwardness when remembered personal application of wish be mean harry added in whisper why not others besides harry be so much to to have real friend thing concern of course only just a concern woman be never of very much account think harry have to do thing thing ought to be done for think spoil harry among say so to mary will be fierce wonder whether will ever have wife to stand up for in way kate have answer to make thought that must be own fault if did not have wife to stand up for thoroughly have be very lucky in wife think have mr medlicot be moving about ought to lie still there hear horse be doctor do so hope wo say that thing very bad be matter jumped up from chair be close to bed a did so just touched

gangoil must now pas entire christmas there sugar can go on very well for ten day harry have said will go over see about men will fetch mother over to however mr heathcote have demurred successfully will kill harry if go on like said bender therefore be sent in buggy for old lady at last harry heathcote consented to go to bed belief be will sleep for week said a turned in did begin sleep quite at

mary look here do know must be bit surprised if fellow be to be making up to kate mr heathcote with little inward chuckle at husband assumed quickness of apprehension reminded that same idea have occurred to time ago mr heathcote gave husband full credit for more than ordinary intelligence in reference to affair appertaining to breeding of sheep growing of wool did not think highly of discernment in such affair a have be much quicker when first saw mr medlicot have felt godsend man with look of gentleman unmarried must come into neighborhood in so feeling heart have be entirely with sister for herself mattered nothing who came did not come whether man be bachelor possessed of wife dozen child that girl have right to want be good husband be quite satisfied with own lot in respect be anxious enough on behalf of kate when young man did come who might make matter so pleasant for harry quarreled with because be free selector free fiddle stick have once said to kate not however communicating to innocent sister ambition be already filling own bosom harry doe take thing up so a though people be to live in one way in a far a can see mr medlicot be very nice fellow kate have remarked that be very well nothing more have be said mr heathcote in spite of harry aversion have formed little project project if then declared must have filled harry with dismay now young aristocrat a turned in bed made suggestion to wife a though be own never like to think much of thing beforehand said innocently know about thinking said harry girl might do worse if must come up set against kate of course will please said mr heathcote now do lie down rest rest however be not of long duration a have suggested two policeman reached gangoil at about three in afternoon on way from maryborough to boolabong in order that might take mr medlicot deposition after heathcote departure have occurred to sergeant forrest of police suggestion having be transferred from sergeant to stipendiary magistrate be now produced with magisterial sanction that after there be evidence against brownbies have simply interfered to prevent burning of grass on own run who must say that have committed crime by doing so if medlicot have seen nokes with lighted branch in hand matter might be different with therefore medlicot deposition be taken have sworn that have seen nokes drag lighted torch along ground have also seen other horseman two three a thought must not identify deposition be also taken a to man who have be heard seen in wool shed at night jacko be ready to swear point blank that man be nokes policeman suggested that a night be dark jacko might a well allow shade of doubt to appear thinking that shade of doubt must add strength to evidence jacko be not going to be taught what sort of oath must swear word said did see leg move go away armed with deposition two constable went on to boolabong in search of nokes of nokes only much to chagrin of harry who declared that police must never really bestir in squatter cause a for nokes will be out of queensland by time to morrow chapter xi sergeant forrest brownbie party returned after midnight raid in great discomfiture to boolabong leader jerry be burned about hand face in disagreeable unsightly manner joe have hardly made good that character for fighting out to end for be apt to claim credit boscobel be altogether disconcerted by fall nokes who have certainly shown aptitude for fray be abused by a having caused retreat by cowardice while sing sing runaway cook who knew that have forfeited wage at gangoil be forced to turn over in heathenish mind ill effect of joining losing side big fool bos said more than once to friend woodsman who have lured away from comfort of gangoil will punch head john

talk to about georgie grumbled when heard knew that advice given be good did not attempt to enter house so nokes vanished away into bush together a such men do vanish wandering forth to live a wild beast live be still dark night when went remainder of party took to bed on following afternoon be lying about house sometimes sleeping sometimes waking up to smoke when two policeman who have already be at gangoil appeared in yard men be dressed in flat cap with short blue jacket hunting breech long black boot very unlike policeman in old country much more picturesque leisurely tied horse up a though have be in habit of making weekly visit to place walked round to veranda well mr brownbie how be said sergeant to old man head of family be gracious declared to be pretty well considering thing called sergeant by name asked men whether 'd take bit of something to eat joe also be courteous after little delay in getting key from brother brought out jar of spirit in bush be regarded a best sign known of thorough good breeding sergeant said that did mind if did other man of course followed officer example so far thing be comfortable constable seemed in hurry to allude to disagreeable subject condescended to eat bit of cold meat before proceeded to business at last matter to be discussed be first introduced by one of brownbie family suppose have heard that there be scrimmage here last night said brownbie party present consisted of old man joe jack brownbie boscobel jerry keeping in background because of disfigurement sergeant a swallowed food acknowledged that have heard something

said brother sergeant forrest know where to go better than can tell then sergeant asked string of question a to nature of fight who have be hurt how badly have body be hurt what other harm have be done answer to question be given with fair amount of truth except that little circumstance of origin of fire be not explained boscobel joe have seen torch put down must hardly have be expected that must have be explicit a to detail a did mention name of brother george nokes who be there in matter asked sergeant there be young heathcote boy have got there two chap a call boundary ruler medlicot sugar fellow from mill chap of medlicot never set eye on before must have expected something to be up heathcote must not have be going about at night with tribe of men like who be party well there be

ground on fire have raged spot on men have met nothing came of inspection have not expected that thing must come of must see exactly where fire have commenced must trace effort have be made to stop did not in least doubt way in have be lit did very much doubt whether jury must find nokes guilty even if must catch nokes jacko evidence be worth nothing mr medlicot might be easily mistaken a to what have seen at distance in middle of night happened on christmas day at about nine o'clock same evening two constable re appeared at gangoil asked for hospitality for night be matter of course also reproduction of christmas dinner mr medlicot be now there son with collar bone set have be allowed to come out on to veranda house have already be supposed to be full room a matter of course be made for sergeant forrest man be queer sort of christmas have be having mr heathcote said sergeant a remnant of real english plum pudding be put between man by mr growler little hotter than be at home eh indeed be must have have hot last night sir very hot sergeant have to work uncommonly hard to do a well a did be not nice christmas game sir be eh said mr medlicot there be nae christmas game ony game

with will be beyond reach of police by time to morrow indeed be beyond reach now however will have got rid of there be others a bad a left behind must trust fellow boscobel yard wo stir sir belongs to country doe not want to leave when thing have be tried like have failed fellow try again be cowed like by own failure think need fear fire from boolabong side again summer after sergeant man discreetly allowed to be put to bed in back cottage for in truth when arrived thing have come to pas at gangoil that two additional visitor be hardly welcome hospitality in bush can be stayed by such consideration a let employment enjoyment on hand be what may thing must yield to entertainment of stranger two constable be in want of christmas dinner be given to with grudging hand a to nokes may say that have never since appeared in neighborhood of gangoil that none thereabouts ever knew what be fate men such a wander away from one colony into next passing from one station to sleeping on ground till become a desolate savage a solitary animal at last die in bush creeping may suppose into hidden nook a beast do when hour of death come on chapter xii conclusion constable have started from gangoil on way to boolabong little after four from time till be made to get out of bed for dinner harry heathcote be allowed to sleep have richly earned rest by work lay motionless without sound in broad daylight with arm under head dreaming doubt of happy squatting land in there be free selector fire rebellious servant flood drought wild dog to worry lamb grass seed to get into fleece in price of wool stood steady at two shilling sixpence pound wife from time to time came into room shading light from eye protecting from fly administering in soft way to what thought might be comfort sleep be of kind light even fly can interrupt once twice stooped down kissed brow be altogether unconscious of caress during time old mr medlicot arrived coming did not awake sleeper though be by mean made in silence old woman sobbed cried over son at same time expressing thankfulness that must have turned up in forest so exactly at proper moment evidently taking part in conviction that giles have saved gangoil sheep then there be necessary arrangement to be made for night in accordance with almost body have to give up bed sleep somewhere else nothing disturbed harry for present be allowed to occupy own room enjoyed privilege kate daly during time be much disturbed in mind reader may remember kate at rate remembered well that just a doctor have arrived to set broken bone mr medlicot disabled a be have attempted to take by arm have certainly chosen odd time for declaration of love just moment in ought to have be preparing for manipulation of fractured limb unless have meant declaration of love surely must not have seized by arm be matter to of great moment oh of what vital importance english girl living in town even in what call country have need to think of special man till special man think of men be fairly plentiful if one man doe not come will there have probably be men coming going in sort since girl left school room became young lady in bush thing be very different may be that there be young man available within fifty mile possible lover future husband unless heaven must interfere almost with miracle to to whom lover be a plentiful a blackberry may seem indelicate to surmise that thought of such want must ever enter girl head doubt whether defined idea of want have ever entered poor kate head now that possible lover be there not only possible very probable so eligible in many respect living so close with house over head good business then so handsome a kate thought so complete gentleman of course turned much in mind be very happy with harry heathcote there never be brother in law so good after what be brother in law though be very best kate have already begun to fancy that house of own husband of own must be essential to happiness then man can not be expected to make offer with broken collar bone certainly can not do so just when doctor have arrived to set bone late on in day when doctor have gone medlicot be according to instruction sitting out on veranda in armchair mother be with while harry be sleeping a though never meant to be awake again kate managed to say few word to sister will be understood that lady hand be by mean empty christmas dinner be in course of preparation sing sing that villainous chinese cook have absconded mr growler doubt did best mr growler be old slow house be full of guest be by mean idle time still kate found opportunity to say word to sister in kitchen what do think of mary to married sister must naturally mean harry heathcote of whom a lay asleep young wife thought that be very perfection of patriarchal pastoral manliness knew enough of human nature to be aware that of moment to sister be no longer own husband think have got arm broken fighting for harry that be bound to do best can for oh yes be of course be sure harry will feel that used know to to be not just to like because be free selector will drop now of course must not be expected to know other at first starting must wonder if became regular friend must be nice after though may be so happy at home be better to have something like neighbor think so depends on who neighbor be care much for brownbies be quite different mary like medlicots very much consider be quite gentleman said kate of course be gentleman look here kate will be ready to welcome mr medlicot a brother in law if thing must turn out way did
