that form of city beauty will be allowed to vanish that nothing of picturesque antiquity will be changed from age to age though stone brick be changed building be same medieval form remain delighting taste of traveller a do pride of burgher thus be that herr steinmarc clerk of magistrate in nuremberg have for use a pleasant abode a city must furnish now came to pas that during many year of residence beneath same roof there grew up strong feeling of friendship between peter steinmarc widow staubach so strong that in most worldly matter widow must be content to follow friend peter counsel without hesitation be case although peter by mean lived in accordance with widow tenet a to matter of religion be not to be understood that peter be godless man not so especially that lived life in way scandalous open to special animadversion from converted be man of world very fond of money very fond of business doing more in matter of worship than be done ordinarily by men of world one who must not scruple to earn few gulden on sunday if such earning came in way who liked beer pipe above thing liked fee perquisite of office on lived made little wealth though thus worldly be esteemed much by madame staubach who rarely on behalf put forth that voice of warning be so frequently heard by niece there be woman of class to madame staubach belonged who think that acerbity of religion be intended altogether for own sex that men ought to be grateful to who will deny such woman seem to think that heaven will pardon that hardness of heart have created in man affair of world seem almost to require that will extend such forgiveness to feminine creation may be necessary that man must be stiff necked self willed eager on world perhaps even covetous given to worldly lust for woman behoves to crush so that may be at point submissive self denying much suffering must be used to thorn in flesh to thorn in spirit too may be thing want that thing must not have if be so that in feminine weakness be not able to deny there must be around to do denial for let crush a becomes poor female to do let there be other female to crush if lack strength purity religious fervour such self crushing requires poor linda tressel have not much taste for crushing providence have supplied with one who have always be willing to do work for yet aunt have ever dearly loved niece dearly loved now in day of story if eye offend will not pluck out after sort madame staubach be plucking out own eye when led niece life of torment a will be described in page when linda be told one day by tetchen old servant that there be marriage on foot between herr steinmarc aunt charlotte linda expressed disbelief in very strong term when tetchen produced many argument to show why must be so put aside a of avail reason given by linda to show that marriage must hardly be intended linda be still incredulous know aunt charlotte tetchen not a do said linda have lived in same house with for fourteen year said tetchen angrily yet know be sure will not marry peter steinmarc will never marry anybody doe not think of such thing pooh said tetchen woman think of head be always together peter talk a though meant to be master of house tell everything about ludovic heard talking about ludovic for hour together other night must listen tetchen did listen miss when one be in out one can not stop one ear hope there be going to be anything wrong between about house aunt will never do anything wrong aunt will never marry peter steinmarc so linda declared in aunt defence in latter assertion be certainly right madame staubach be not minded to marry herr steinmarc might have done so have wished for herr steinmarc asked to take more than once at time widow staubach be woman not much over forty year of age though can hardly be said be comely yet be not without certain prettiness might have charm in judgment of herr steinmarc be very thin face be pale here there be beginning of wrinkle telling a much of trouble a of year eye be bright clear smooth hair of edge be allowed to be seen beneath cap be of a rich brown a when have married gasper staubach now more than twenty year ago teeth be white perfect oval of face have not be impaired by time step though slow be light firm voice though sad be low soft in talking to men to such man a be herr steinmarc voice be always low soft though there must be sharp note in now again when must be speaking to tetchen niece whether be gentle voice bright eye edge of soft brown hair beneath cap le creditable feeling of covetousness in regard to gabled house in schuett island will not here be even guessed be fact that herr steinmarc have more than once asked madame staubach to be wife when tetchen first imparted suspicion to linda be saying about ludovic asked linda when tetchen for third time came to linda with tidings now linda have scolded tetchen for listening to aunt conversation about ludovic tetchen thought unjust that must be interrogated on subject after being so treated told miss did hear anything only just name very well tetchen will do only hope wo say such thing of aunt charlotte anywhere else what harm have said linda surely to say of widow that be to be married to honest man be not to say harm be not true tetchen must not say then tetchen departed quite unconvinced linda began to reflect how far life must be changed for better for worse if tetchen tidings must ever be made true a have be said before tetchen tidings be never to be made true madame staubach did not resent offer made to when peter steinmarc told that be lone woman left without guidance protection allowed fact admitting that guidance must be good for when went on to say that linda also be in need of protection admitted that also be in sore need madame staubach said poor thoughtless child when herr steinmarc spoke of pecuniary condition reminding widow be left without lodger two woman must hardly keep old family roof over head madame staubach acknowledged perhaps went very suddenly to true point by expressing opinion that everything must be much better arranged if house be property of herr steinmarc be good that woman must own house said madame staubach must be enough for that be permitted to use then herr steinmarc went on to explain that if widow must consent to become wife thought must so settle thing that for life at rate house must be in care management widow must not consent even to speak of such arrangement a possible spoke word with tear in eye of human lord master who have lived with for two happy year said word with mystical allusion to heavenly husband after herr steinmarc felt that must not plead cause further with hope of success why must not linda be wife said madame staubach a disappointed suitor be about to retire idea have never struck man mind before now when suggestion be made to be for while stricken dumb why must not marry linda tressel niece gay pretty young sweet a youth prettiness gaiety must make girl than whom there be none prettier none sweeter in nuremberg real owner too of house in lived instead of aunt who be gay sweet young who though be virtuous self denying meek possessed certainly few feminine charm herr steinmarc though be man not by mean living outside pale of church to belonged be not so strongly given to religious observance a to have preferred aunt because of piety sanctity of life be not hypocrite enough to suggest to madame staubach that such feeling warmed bosom why must not linda be wife sat down again in arm chair from have risen began to consider question in first place herr steinmarc be at time nearly fifty year old linda tressel be only twenty knew linda age well for have be inhabitant of garret up stair when linda be born what must frau tressel have said that night have one prophesied to that little daughter must hereafter be offered a wife to husband penniless clerk upstairs penniless clerk often live to fill master shoe do sometimes marry master daughter then linda be known throughout nuremberg to be real owner of house with three gable herr steinmarc have idea that nuremberg magistrate must rise up against be to offer to marry young heiress there be third difficulty herr steinmarc though have knowledge on subject though suspicion be so slight that have never mentioned to old friend widow though be aware that have barely ground for idea still have idea linda tressel heart be no longer at linda own disposal nevertheless momentous question have be so suddenly asked be one certainly deserved closest consideration showed at rate that linda nearest friend must help be inclined to prosecute suit that saw nothing out of course nothing anomalous in proposition must be very nice to be husband of pretty gay sweet tempered joyous young girl must be very nice to marry heiress of house to become actual owner master must be nice also to be preferred to of whom peter steinmarc have thought a true possessor of linda heart if linda be once wife linda did not doubt must be true to in such case linda whom knew to be good girl must overcome little prejudice of girlhood other men of fifty have married girl of twenty why must not peter well to do comfortable considering age good looking town clerk of city of nuremberg must not bring to tell madame staubach that must transfer affection to niece on occasion on question be first asked must take week said to consider took week made up mind on first day of week at end of week declared to madame staubach that thought plan to be good plan after there be much discussion before further step be taken tetchen be quite sure that lodger be to be married to linda aunt there be much discussion widow shocked perhaps at own cruelty almost retreated from offer have made herr steinmarc be emboldened be now eager held to own plan be good plan be ready found that must love maiden wished to take to bosom at once for few day widow heart relented for few day there came across breast frail foolish human idea of love passion earthly joy of two young being happy in other arm for while thought with regret of what be about to do of sacrifice to be made of sorrow to be endured of deathblow to be given to dream of love doubtless have arisen though hitherto be more than dream madame staubach though be now saint have be once woman knew a well a woman of what nature be dream of love fill heart of girl be because knew so well that allowed only few hour of such weakness what must hesitate between heaven hell between god devil between world next between sacrifice of time sacrifice of eternity when disposal of own niece own child nearest dearest be concerned be not fit that world must be crushed in bosom of young girl how must be crushed so effectually a by marrying to old man one whom respected who be otherwise distasteful to one who a husband must at first be abhorrent to a madame staubach thought of heaven then girl who loved be allowed to indulge love must hardly go to heaven let be so said to peter steinmarc after few day of weak vacillation let be so think that will be good for then peter steinmarc swore that must be good for linda that must be good for linda care must be so great that linda might never doubt good peter steinmarc be thinking of soul said madame staubach be thinking of too said peter one have know to think of everything in turn then there came to be little difficulty a to manner in proposition must be first made to linda tressel madame staubach thought that must be made by peter peter be of opinion that if ice be first broken by madame staubach final success might be more probably achieved owes obedience friend owes none a yet said peter there seemed to be so much of truth in madame staubach yielded undertook to make first overture to linda on behalf of lover chapter ii linda tressel be tall light built active young woman in full health by mean fine lady very able very willing to assist tetchen in work of house rather to be assisted by tetchen in doing fit at point to be wife of young burgher in nuremberg be very pretty withal with eager speaking eye soft luxurious tress not black of so very dark brown a to be counted black in light be aunt care to have tress confined so that nothing of wayward obstinacy in curling might be seen by eye of men linda strove to obey aunt curl must sometimes be too strong for linda must be seen over shoulder across back tempting eye of men sorely peter steinmarc have so seen many time thought much of when offer of linda hand be first made to face like of aunt be oval in form complexion be dark clear perhaps greatest beauty consisted in half soft half wild expression of face while seemed to declare to world that be mild gentle for most part silent gave vague doubtful promise of something might be beyond if only nature be sufficiently awakened creating hope mysterious longing for something more than might be expected from girl brought up under severe thraldom of madame charlotte staubach creating hope perhaps might be fear linda face in respect be true reflex of character lived with aunt quiet industrious sober life striving to be obedient striving to be religious with religion of aunt have almost brought to believe that be good for heart to be crushed have quite brought to wish to believe have within heart desire for open rebellion against domestic authority world be dangerous bad world in men be dust woman something lower than dust must tell so very often strive to believe when did so for there be yearning for something beyond present life for something must be of world worldly when heard profane music must long to dance when heard girl laughing in public garden must long to stay laugh with pretty ribbon bright coloured silk be snare to when must shake out curly lock in retirement of own little chamber liked to feel to know that be pretty be wile with devil catch soul of woman there be time when believed that devil be making especial struggle to posse of there be moment in almost thought that devil must succeed that perhaps be of little use for to carry on longer futile contest must not be pleasant to give up contest to laugh talk shout be merry to dance wear bright colour be gay in company with young men a did other girl around a for other girl elder friend did not seem on account to be specially in dread of satan there be fanny heisse who lived close to who have be linda friend when went to school together fanny did just a pleased be always talking with young men wore brightest ribbon that shop produced be always dancing seemed to be bound by strict rule on life yet everybody spoke well of fanny heisse now fanny be to be married to young lawyer from augsburg must be fact that devil have made sure of fanny heisse linda have be very anxious to ask aunt question on subject have be afraid whenever attempted to discus point of theology with aunt such attempt always ended in renewed assurance of devil greediness in harder more crushing rule by devil greed might be outwitted then there came time of terrible peril poor linda be in greater doubt than ever fanny heisse who be to be married to augsburg lawyer have long be accustomed to talk to young men to one young man after so that young men have come to be almost nothing to have selected one a husband because have be suggested to that have better settle in life special one be well to do good looking pleasant mannered good tempered whole thing with fanny heisse have seemed to go a though flirting love marriage came naturally without danger without care without disappointment young man have now spoken to to linda have spoken to word that did not dare to repeat to one have spoken to twice thrice have not rebuked have not at least rebuked with withering scorn circumstance have surely required must have made know that regarded a one sent purposely from evil one to tempt now again have come upon terrible half formed idea that must be well to give up battle let evil one make free with prey in truth heart within have so palpitated with emotion when word have be spoken be repeated that have lacked strength to carry on battle properly how send daring young man from with withering scorn when there lack power to raise eye to open to close lip to think even at moment whether such scorn be deserved something very different from scorn young man have not be seen by linda eye for nearly month when peter steinmarc madam staubach settled between that ice must be broken on following morning aunt charlotte prepared for communication to be made when came in from market purchase went at once to task linda be found by aunt in lodger sitting room busy with broom brush while tetchen on knee be dry rubbing polished board round broad margin of room linda said madame staubach have wish to say to must come with for while then linda followed aunt to madame staubach own chamber a went there came over guilty fear must be that aunt have heard of word young man have spoken to linda said madame staubach sit down there in chair have proposition to make to of much importance of very great importance may lord grant that thing do will be right in sight to make to aunt said linda now quite astray a to aunt intention be sure at least that there be danger about young man have be aunt purpose to rebuke for aught that have done aunt manner look must have be very different must have be hard severe full of denunciation a be madame staubach almost hesitated in word certainly have assumed much le than accustomed austerity hope linda that know that love be sure that love aunt charlotte why do ask if there be one in world do love be child who else be there left to be not for world with trouble must be nothing to must prepare to go in peace when must be pleased to take why do say now aunt charlotte will tell why say now though be hardly old woman yet of course be not old woman wish be older might be nearer to rest be young be necessary that future life must be regarded whether go hence remain here will be proper that settlement must be made for then madame staubach paused linda began to think that aunt have on mind scheme about house when aunt have spoken of going hence remaining here linda have not be quite sure whether going remainings spoken of be wholly spiritual whether there be reference to thing worldly temporal must be that tetchen be after right in surmise be possible that aunt be about to be married to peter steinmarc said nothing after while aunt went on very slowly with proposition yes settlement for future life must be made know that house in live be own be yours mine together aunt linda house be own furniture in be yours too so that herr steinmarc be lodger be right that must understand think too well of own child to believe that will ever on account be disobedient unruly will never make difference linda be sure will not providence have be pleased to put in place of father mother to will not say have done duty by have aunt always said linda taking aunt hand pressing affectionately have found expect to find child obedience be good that young must obey elder must understand that in authority over must know better than can do what be good for linda be now altogether astray in thought anticipation aunt have very frequently spoken to in strain nay week did not often pas by without speech then speech must come without solemn prelude have be made on occasion must be caused generally by act word look movement on part of linda of madame staubach have found herself obliged to express disapprobation on present occasion conversation have be commenced without such expression aunt have even deigned to commend general tenor of life have dropped hand a soon a aunt began to talk of in authority waited with patience till gist of lecture must be revealed to hope will understand now linda that will propose to be for welfare here hereafter even though may not at first seem to to be agreeable what be aunt said linda jumping up quickly from seat sit down child will tell linda did not reseat at once terrible fear have come upon fear of knew not what found to be almost impossible to remain quiet at aunt knee sit down linda when ask then linda did sit down have altogether lost that look of quiet passive endurance face figure have borne when be first asked to listen to aunt word time in life have come dear when a guardian have to think whether be not well that must be married want to be married said linda jumping up again dearest child must be better that must listen to marriage know be honourable state yes know of course aunt charlotte hush dear girl need not be married unless like if be dead with whom must live who must there be to guard guide be not going to die linda be very wicked why can not guide because be young weak foolish because be right that who be frail timid spiritless must be made subject to who be strong able to hold dominion to exact obedience linda did not at like being told that be spiritless thought that might be able to show spirit enough be not for duty that owed to aunt a for obedience though be willing to obey aunt felt that aunt have right to transfer privilege in respect to said nothing aunt went on with proposition lodger peter steinmarc have spoken to be anxious to make wife peter steinmarc yes linda peter steinmarc old peter steinmarc be not old what have being old to do with will never marry peter steinmarc aunt charlotte madame staubach have not expected to meet with immediate positive obedience have thought probable that there might be opposition shown to plan when be first brought forward indeed how must be otherwise when marriage be suggested abruptly to such girl a linda tressel even though suggested husband have be apollo what young woman must have said oh certainly whenever please aunt charlotte to proposition feeling madame staubach must have gone to work by degree must have opened siege by gradual trench have approached citadel by parallel before attempted to take by storm have known anything of way form of such strategy though knew that there be such way form of strategy among ungodly out in world with worldly have practised none such herself knew nothing of mode in must be conducted on subject if on niece owed to obedience must claim obedience a hers of right though linda must at first be startled must probably be not le willing to obey at last if found guardian stern resolute in demand dear said have probably not yet have time to think of marriage have proposed to want time to think of nothing in life must be accepted rejected without thinking linda nothing except sin thinking can not be done without time must be sin great sin linda be very wicked of course be wicked herr steinmarc be most respectable man there be man in nuremberg more respected than herr steinmarc be doubtless madame staubach opinion of peter steinmarc may be that madame staubach be not qualified to express opinion of city in general on subject hold office father held before for many year have inhabited best room in father house be welcome to room if want said linda be welcome to whole house if choose to give to be nonsense linda herr steinmarc want nothing be not of right be not of right said linda will listen to be much mistaken if think that be because of trumpery house that honest man wish to make wife must suppose that madame staubach suffered qualm of conscience a proffered assurance that repented afterwards of sin committed in making statement must hardly have believed to be exactly true knew father before be born mother have known for many year have not lived with ever since can remember yes said linda remember ever since be very little girl a long a can remember anything seemed to be a old then a be now why must not be old why must want husband to be young foolish headstrong a be perhaps one who must drink gamble go about after strange woman want man for husband said linda there can be nothing more proper than herr steinmarc must make wife have spoken to be willing to undertake charge charge almost screamed linda in terrible disgust be willing to undertake charge say will then still live together may hope to be able to maintain god fearing household in there may be a little opening to temptation of world a may be found in well ordered house believe that peter steinmarc be god fearing man linda be very wicked to say so if be must make difference linda only know that love money better than anything in world that never give kreutzer to one that wo subscribe to hospital always think that tetchen take wine though tetchen never touch drop when have wife will look after thing will never look after said conversation be brought to end a soon after a madame staubach be able to close have done that have intended to do have done with a much of good result a have expected have probably not thought that linda must be quite so fierce a have shown have expected tear more of despair clearer protestation of abject misery in proposed marriage linda mind must now be filled with idea probably might by degree reconcile to learn to think that peter be not so very old man at rate must now be for peter to carry on battle linda a soon a be alone sat down with hand before with eye fixed gazing on vacancy in order that might realise to herself thing proposed to have said very little to aunt of nature of misery marriage seemed to offer to not because imagination made for clear picture on subject not because did not foresee unutterable wretchedness in such union picture of such wretchedness have be very palpable to thought that consideration on earth must induce to take mean faced old man to breast a husband lord a one being whom be to love beyond everybody else in world picture be clear enough have argued to herself unconsciously that description of picture to aunt must seem to suppose that consummation of picture be possible preferred therefore to declare that thing be impossible affair completion of must be quite out of question instead of assuring aunt that must have made miserable to have to look after peter steinmarc wine at once protested that never must take upon that duty be not of right have said a said resolved that must adhere to protest when be alone remembered aunt demand own submissiveness old habit of obedience above remembered fear must come over that be giving to devil in casting from obedience on subject then became very wretched told that sooner later aunt must conquer sooner later that mean faced old man with snuffy finger few straggling hair brushed over bald pate with big shoe spreading here there because of corn ugly loose square snuffy coat old hat have worn so long that never liked to touch must become husband that must be duty to look after wine old shoe old hat to have own little possession doled out to by penuriousness though continued to swear to herself that heaven earth together must never make become herr steinmarc wife yet at same time continued to bemoan certainty of coming fate if be against with lord on side how must stand against with nothing to aid nothing

little garden from court without being subject to charge of making public to passer by not what might be seen when so standing by in ruden platz on other side of river a have often be pointed out to by aunt be habit with to stand there perhaps because while so standing must often hear gay laugh of old friend fanny must thus at second hand receive impress from gaiety of world without now in musing without thinking much of whither be going went slowly down stair out of door stood leaning upon gate looking over river at men who be working in front of warehouse have not be there long when fanny ran across to from door of father house fanny heisse be bright broad faced girl with light hair laughing eye dimple on chin freckled somewhat with pug nose large mouth for fanny heisse be known

peter first cousin when died ludovic have in sort fallen into hand of relative town clerk ludovic father be still alive be thriftless aimless man who have never be of service to wife child at moment one knew where be living what be doing one knew unless be son ludovic who never received much encouragement in nuremberg to talk about father at present moment peter steinmarc cousin though have not

modicum of salary from city chest a servant in employment of city magistrate of late ludovic have left uncle office have entered service of certain brewer in nuremberg who be more liberal in view a to

from whence have be promoted to arm chair have almost taken upon to promise that good fortune of ludovic must be a great a own if only ludovic for present must be content with stool young valcarm who by time be four twenty told cousin very freely that stool in town hall suited no longer that liked work wage indeed went further than told kinsman that liked society of office a little a did wage work may naturally be supposed that be not said till there have be unpleasant word spoken by town clerk to assistant till authority of elder have be somewhat stretched over head of young man may be supposed also that when such word have once be spoken peter steinmarc did not again press ludovic valcarm to sit upon official stool ludovic have never lived in garret of red house a peter have done when suggestion that must do so have year since be made to madame staubach prudent lady foreseeing that linda must soon become young woman have be unwilling to sanction arrangement ludovic therefore have housed elsewhere have be free of authority of town clerk when away from office have be often in cousin room there have grown up acquaintance between aunt charlotte linda have be very slight so thought aunt charlotte have be a slight a precaution must make ludovic nevertheless have spoken such word to linda that linda have be unable to answer though madame staubach be altogether ignorant that such iniquity have be perpetrated peter steinmarc have shrewdly guessed truth rumour of very ill sort have reached red house respecting ludovic valcarm when linda have interrogated tetchen a to nature of thing be said of ludovic in conversation between peter madame staubach tetchen have overheard have not asked without cause knew that evil thing be said of young man that evil word regarding have be whispered by peter into aunt ear that such whispering have be going on almost ever since day on ludovic have declined to return again to official stool knew thought that knew that such whispering be not altogether undeserved there be set of young men in nuremberg of whom be said that have bad name among elder that drank spirit instead of beer that be up late at night that played card among that be very unfrequent at house of prayer that belonged to turbulent political society have to grief of old burgher be introduced into nuremberg from munich that talked of woman a woman be talked of in paris vienna other stronghold of iniquity that despised altogether old habit mode of life of forefather be known by dress wore high round hat like chimney pot such a be worn in paris satin stock tight fitting costly coat of fine cloth long pantaloon carried little cane in hand gave air be very unlike what young men of nuremberg used to be linda knew appearance well thought that be not altogether unbecoming knew also for have often be so told that be dangerous men be grieved that ludovic valcarm must be among number now now that aunt have spoken to of horrid plan in reference to peter steinmarc what must ludovic valcarm be to not that must ever have be anything knew that have known from first when have be unable to answer with scorn word have deserved how must such one a be mated with man so unsuited to aunt taste to own mode of life a ludovic valcarm yet must have wished that might be otherwise for moment once perhaps for moment more than once there have be idea that mission must be more fitting for one a than of bringing back to right path young man a ludovic valcarm then how to begin to bring young man back knew that must not be allowed to accept love now now that horrid plan have be proposed to such scheme be more impracticable more impossible than ever ah how hated peter steinmarc a thought of for four five day after not word be said to linda by one on hated subject kept out of peter steinmarc way a well a must made busy through house with almost frantic energy be very good to aunt doing behest be put upon going through religious service with zeal almost seemed to signify that liked did not leave house once except in aunt company restrained even from leaning over wicket gate listening to voice of fanny heisse there be moment during day in thought that opposition to aunt plan have have desired effect that be not to be driven mad by courtship of peter steinmarc surely five day must not have elapsed without word have not plan be deserted if be case how good must be if be case must resolve on aunt behalf to be very scornful to ludovic valcarm though have never gone outside house without aunt though have never even leaned on front wicket yet have seen ludovic have be no fault of hers that have spied from ruden platz have kissed hand to have made sign to have only half understood by have thought that have meant to imply that must come to soon came from fault of hers knew that centre warehouse in ruden platz opposite belonged to brewer sach brother by whom valcarm be employed of course be necessary that young man must be among workman who be always moving barrel about before warehouse that must attend to employer business need not have made sign kissed hand when stood hidden from eye hers beneath low dark archway for matter of need eye have be fixed upon gateway after have once perceived that ludovic be on ruden platz what must happen to if be to declare boldly that loved ludovic valcarm intended to become wife not wife of old peter steinmarc in first place ludovic have never asked to be wife on head have almost doubt at ludovic must ask quickly enough be very sure if only received sufficient encouragement a far a understood law of country in lived one must thought prevent from marrying in such case must have terrible battle with aunt aunt must not lock up starve into submission must be very dreadful doubt good people whom have be accustomed to regard a good must throw over point at a one abandoned aunt heart must be broken world world a knew must pretty nearly collapse around nevertheless must do be to do so must not simply be that must have allowed devil to get victory that must have given for ever ever body soul to evil one then made compact with compact hoped be not compact with satan also if on one side must not strive to make marry peter steinmarc on other side must say nothing not word to ludovic valcarm soon learned however that have not a yet achieved object by few word have spoken to aunt word have be spoken on monday on evening of following saturday sat with aunt in own room down stair in chamber immediately below occupied by peter steinmarc be summer evening in august linda be sitting at window with household needlework in lap engaged rather in watching warehouse opposite than in sedulous attention to needle eye be fixed upon little doorway not expecting that one must be seen there full of remembrance of figure of who have stood there have kissed hand aunt a be wont on saturday be leaning over little table intent on large book of devotional service with prepared for sabbath close a be attention now always to volume must not on ordinary occasion have allowed linda eye to stray for so long time across river without recalling by sharp word of reproof on evening sat read said nothing did not see niece so intent be on good work else seeing chose for reason of own to be a one who did not see linda be too intent upon thought to remember that be sinning with sin of idleness must have still gazed across river have not heard heavy footstep in room above head fall of creaking shoe on stair sound knew full well stump bump dump peter steinmarc be descending from own apartment to of neighbour below then immediately linda withdrew eye from archway began to ply needle with diligence madame staubach looked up from book became uneasy on chair linda felt sure that peter be not going out for evening stroll be not in quest of beer friendly pipe at rothe ross be much given to beer friendly pipe at rothe ross linda knew that must creep down stair somewhat softly when mind be way given not so softly what must hear step know whither be wending now from nature of sound be quite sure that be not going to inn frequented threw hurried glance round upon aunt be quite sure that aunt be of same opinion when herr steinmarc paused for minute outside aunt door then slowly turned lock linda be not bit surprised be madame staubach surprised closed book with dignity sat awaiting address of neighbour good evening lady said peter steinmarc good evening peter said madame staubach be many year now since people have first known other town clerk be always called peter by old friend linda spoke not word of answer to lover salutation have be beautiful summer day said peter lovely day said madame staubach through lord favour to have fraulein be out asked peter have not be out said linda almost savagely will go leave together said madame staubach getting up from chair aunt said linda go away pray go away be fitting must do so said madame staubach a with one hand gently pushed back linda who be pressing to door after will stay linda hear what friend will say remember linda that speaks with authority with heartfelt prayer that may prevail will never prevail said linda madame staubach peter steinmarc heard what said linda have already perceived perturbed a be in mind that herr steinmarc have prepared carefully for interview have brought hat with into room be not hat have so long be distasteful to have got on clean bright shoe a large indeed a old dirty one because herr steinmarc be not man to sacrifice corn for love still shoe be decidedly intended to be worn only on occasion have changed ordinary woollen shirt for white linen have taken out new brown frock coat always wore on high day in nuremberg on magistrate appeared with civic collar perhaps effect linda noted most keenly be debonair fashion in straggling hair have be disposed over bald pate for moment two stranger might almost have believed that pate be not bald dear young friend began town clerk aunt have think spoken to of wish linda muttered something knew not what though word be not intelligible look be so be not of kind to have be naturally conducive to much hope in bosom of herr steinmarc of course can understand linda how much must have taken by surprise at first surprise will wear off trust that may gradually come to regard a future husband without without without anything like fear know feeling of kind still did not speak if become wife linda will do best to make always happy will never become wife never never never speak so decidedly a linda must speak decidedly do speak decidedly ca speak other way know very well herr steinmarc that ought to ask be very wrong of very wicked why be wrong linda why be wicked if want to get married must marry one a old a linda be not so be always thought becoming that man must be older than wife be three time a old a be be not becoming be cruel on linda part word also be untrue linda must be twenty one at next birthday whereas herr steinmarc have not yet reached fifty second birthday herr steinmarc be man who have temper of own who be little touchy on score of age linda knew that be touchy on score of age have exaggerated statement with view of causing pain be probably appreciation of fact caused herr steinmarc to continue solicitation with more of authority in voice than have hitherto used be not three time a old a linda may be age aunt who have charge of think that marriage be fitting one must remember that can not fly in face without committing great sin offer to honest household respectable position a madame staubach think that must accept must know that be wrong to answer with scorn ribaldry have not answered with ribaldry be not ribaldry to say that be old man have answered with scorn do scorn herr steinmarc when come to pretending to make love like young man with sunday clothes on hair brushed smooth new shoe do scorn may go tell aunt say so if like a for being old man be old man old men be very well in way daresay must go about making love to young woman herr steinmarc have not hoped to succeed on first personal venture certainly have not expected to be received after fashion linda have adopted towards have doubtless looked very often into linda face have listened very often to tone of voice have not understood what face expressed have known what compass voice must reach have be wise man man wise a to own future comfort must have abandoned present attempt after lesson be now learning a have before be said have temper be now angry with linda be roused be disposed to make know old a be bald forced to wear awkward shoe to stump along heavily still must force to become wife to minister to want understood knew what be own deficiency be a wide awake a be linda to natural desire of young girl madame staubach be perhaps equally awake connected desire directly with devil because be natural that young woman must love young man therefore according to religious theory of madame staubach be well that young woman must marry old man so that might then be crushed made malleable susceptible of teaching tell that suffering in world be good for now peter steinmarc be by mean alive to truth of such lesson a religion be very well be outward sign of respectable life of life in men be trusted receive comfortable wage beyond be innocent occupation for enthusiastic woman have idea that human being be bound to undergo crushing in world for soul sake have not wished to marry linda might be very well that linda must marry young man now that linda so openly scorned have treated with such plain spoken contumely thought must be well that linda must be crushed yes thought also that might probably find mean of crushing suppose miss said after pausing for moment that meaning of be that have got young lover have got young lover said linda if have why must what must be to must be very much to if be young man think yes understand blush now very well will know now how to manage aunt will know have got lover said linda in great anger be very wicked old man to say so then have better receive a future husband if will be good obedient will forgive great unkindness of what have said to have not meant to be unkind can not have for husband how be to love will come will never come be not unkind when said be three time a old a did not mean to be unkind since allusion have be made to younger lover from linda have gathered that peter steinmarc must know something of ludovic passion for have be in part quelled be not able now to stand up bravely before suitor fight a have done at first with weapon have at command man knew something be almost ruinous to that must know something by if aunt knew must be quite ruined how must be that herr steinmarc must have learned anything of ludovic wild love have not be in house have be in town hall sitting in big official arm chair when ludovic have stood in low arched doorway blown kiss across river from hand yet did know knowing must of course tell aunt did not mean to be unkind said be very unkind beg pardon then herr steinmarc will let address then a lover oh because of young man be oh have said nothing to young man not word be nothing to be not that linda see understand everything now unless will promise to give up do a aunt bid must tell aunt everything there be nothing to tell linda have done nothing ca help young man be only over there because of brewery have told secret now be nothing to herr steinmarc if choose to tell aunt charlotte must will tell aunt charlotte that if will let keep out of way will promise to keep out of if come then then then know what may do after escaped went away back into kitchen while peter steinmarc stumped up again to own room well friend how have gone said madam staubach entering peter chamber at door of have knocked have found out truth said peter solemnly what truth peter shook head not despondently so much a in dismay thing have to tell be so very bad felt so keenly not on own account so much a on account of friend be expressed by manner in peter shook head what truth have found out peter tell at once said madame staubach have got lover who linda believe have owned lover whereupon peter steinmarc lifted up hand what lover who be how doe know when have seen can not believe have never be false to lover be ludovic valcarm cousin cousin ludovic who be good for nothing spendthrift fellow without florin fellow play card on sunday who fear god satan said madame staubach peter steinmarc believe child can hardly have spoken to have better ask madame staubach then with exaggeration peter told linda aunt that did know something more than linda have confessed before conversation be over have agreed that let tidings be true in much in little true not at exertion must be used to force linda into proposed marriage with a little delay a possible overheard speaking to out of street window when thought be out said town clerk in whisper before left madame staubach have to come back home for key of big chest never knew that have be in house have be one of occasion on linda have be addressed have wanted breath to answer bold young man who have spoken to chapter iv on following morning being sunday morning linda positively refused to get up at usual hour declared intention of not going to church be said so ill that must not go to church late on preceding evening madame staubach after have left peter steinmarc have spoken to linda of what have heard be not surprising that linda must have headache on following morning linda madame staubach said peter have told that ludovic valcarm have be making love to linda be true linda have be unable to say that be not true aunt put matter to in more cunning way than steinmarc have done linda felt unable to deny charge then let tell that of young woman of whom ever heard be most deceitful continued madame staubach say that aunt charlotte pray say that do say oh that must have come to between have not deceived indeed have not want to see ludovic again never if wish have said word to oh aunt pray believe have never spoken word to in way of what mean will consent to marry peter steinmarc linda hesitated moment before answered tell miss will promise to take peter steinmarc a husband can not promise aunt charlotte then will never forgive never god will never forgive did not think possible that sister child must have be so false to have not be false to said linda through tear terrible young man too one who drink gamble be rebel one of whom world speaks ill penniless spendthrift to whom decent girl must betroth perhaps be to be light of love be shame great shame for to say such thing said linda sobbing bitterly wo wait must go must sooner be dead than hear say such thing to so must ca help if be wicked make say then linda escaped from room went up to bed on next morning be too ill to eat breakfast to go to church of course saw nothing of peter on morning heard creaking of shoe a went forth after morning meal fear that good wish for sunday work did not go with on sabbath morning three four time aunt be in room to aunt linda must say no more than that be sick must not leave bed madame staubach did not renew revilings have poured forth so freely on preceding evening partly influenced by linda headache partly perhaps by statement have be made to by tetchen a to amount of love making have taken place lord bless ma'be in other house than must go for nothing over at jacob heisse among girl must even have be counted at such few word a just compliment of day more tetchen must not have heard must hardly have talked of compliment of day when ludovic have told linda that be fairest girl in nuremberg that never must be happy not for hour unless might hope to call own even tetchen whose notion about young men be not over strict must not have taken such word a simply meaning compliment of day there be linda sick in bed be sunday morning nothing further must be said done on instant moreover such love making a have taken place did in truth seem to have be perpetrated altogether on side of young man therefore be that madame staubach spoke with gentle voice a prescribed to linda pill potion might probably be of service then went forth to church madame staubach prayer on sunday morning be long affair usually left house little after ten did not return till past two soon after be gone on present occasion tetchen came up to linda room expressed own desire to go to frauenkirche for tetchen be roman catholic be if mean to get up miss will go said tetchen linda turning in bed thought that head must be better now that aunt be gone promised that must get up in hour be alone in kitchen down stair tetchen have started to frauenkirche to whatever other place be more agreeable to for occupation of sunday morning be by mean uncommon occurrence that linda must be left alone in house on part of sunday must naturally have seated with book at parlour window a soon a have completed what little there might be to be done in kitchen on occasion there came upon feeling of desolateness a thought of present condition not only be alone now must be alone for ever have friend left aunt be estranged from peter steinmarc be bitterest enemy did not dare even to think of ludovic valcarm have sauntered now into parlour a be telling that did not dare to think of young man looked across river there be standing on water edge retreated back in room so far back that be impossible that must see felt quite sure that have not seen a yet for back have be turned to during single moment that have stood at window what must do now be quite certain that must not see a stood far back in room within gloom of dark wall then there be river between so stood watched a one might watch coming enemy lover who be too bold there be little punt raft moored against bank just opposite to gateway of warehouse often lay there a linda knew be used in affair of brewery now a stood watching ludovic stepped into punt without unfastening from ring pushed loose end of across river a far a willow bottom must allow still there be considerable distance between garden of red house distance so great that linda felt that water made safe there be pole in boat linda saw young man take up pole prepare for spring in moment be standing in narrow garden a landed flung pole back into punt remained stranded in middle of river be ever such leap seen before then thought how safe must have be from peter steinmarc have peter steinmarc be in boat what must ludovic valcarm do next might remain there day before must go to be now standing under front of centre gable be out of linda sight there be low window close to where stood opened from passage ran through middle of house on other side of passage opposite to parlour madame staubach occupied be large room not now used filled with lumber linda a soon a be aware that ludovic be in island within few foot of that something must be done retreated from parlour back into kitchen a went thoughtfully drew bolt of front door have not thought of low window into passage in summer day be always opened if have thought of must have taken precaution in direction to have attempted to close window must have be to throw into young man arm there be bolt inside kitchen door that drew then stood in middle of room listening have be thief who have come when be left in charge of house be thus must have protected own property aunt be thief why must run from man whom knew whom knew must have trusted have be left to own judgment of be coward be to face man must fear personal danger from must offer insult thought that must protect even be to insult be not that that feared that aunt must be able to say that have received lover in secret on sunday morning when have pretended that be too ill to go to church be ear must hear that be within house have thought of window moment that have barred kitchen door knew that must be within house must hear knock at parlour door then enter parlour did not stay there moment then heard at foot of stair with low voice called to by name linda be there of course did not answer might be that must fancy that be not within house must retreat must hardly intrude into bedroom might be that must go a far a cousin apartment said again linda know that be in house that wicked tetchen must not be that tetchen have be traitor went three four step up stair then bethinking of locality came down again knocked at once at kitchen door linda said when found that door be barred linda know that be here go away said linda why have come here know that must not be here open door for one moment that may listen to open door will tell will go instantly when have spoken to linda will indeed then opened door why must be barred up prisoner in own house what be there that need fear have done nothing be wrong must hing wrong of course must tell aunt if man must force way into house climbing in through open window how must help if aunt chose to misbelieve let be so there be need now that must call upon for strength heaven earth together must not make marry peter steinmarc must earth evil one combined make give herself to young man after fashion must disgrace mother memory father name if aunt doubted sorrow must be great must bear have right here said a soon a be confronted with young man know that must not be here go away linda love want love now tell that cousin peter be to be husband will never be husband will promise that will never be husband thanks dearest thousand thanks for aunt be friend be not true of course be friend must give to be not hers to give be not to be given away at choose to stay a be know that be very wicked to be here believe

linda remember that will always love always be thinking of always hoping that will day love little now be gone way said linda can not jump back to boat pole be gone at door will see from window nobody will see god bless linda then again took hand though did not on occasion succeed in raising a far a lip after that ran down passage having glanced way from window in minute be again in garden linda of course hurried into parlour that might watch in half minute be down over little wall into river in three stride have gained punt water in truth on side be not much over knee linda thought must be very wet then looked round to see if there be eye watching a far a must see there be eye linda when be alone be by mean contented with yet there be sort of joy at heart must not explain to herself of being keenly alive to felt in great dread what must be more wicked more full of sin than receiving on sunday morning clandestine visit from young man young man a ludovic valcarm aunt have often spoken to with fear trembling of mode of life in neighbour opposite lived daughter of jacob heisse be allowed to dance talk flirt according to madame staubach be living in fearful peril for how much must such man a jacob heisse who thought of nothing working hard in order that four girl might always have fine dress for how much must be called upon to answer in last day of what comfort must be to then that girl in foolish vain world have hovered about bringing pipe slipper filling glass stoup for kissing forehead a stood over easy chair in evening jacob heisse daughter have ever be used a example of worldly living by madame staubach none of jacob heisse girl must ever have done thing a flirted indeed did openly under father nose linda have often heard old man joke with daughter about lover must linda joke with one touching visit from ludovic valcarm yet there be something in be joy to joy must not define since aunt have be so cruel to since peter have appeared before a suitor have told that have friend heretofore have acknowledged peter a friend in spite of creaking shoe objectionable hat there be old custom in favour have not be unkind to a inmate of same house with aunt have loved dearly now aunt cruelty be so great that shuddered a thought of have felt to be friendless then young man have come to though have said to hard thing of must think because of coming yet yet yet liked because have come be other young man in so handsome must other young man have taken that leap have gone through river that might speak one word to even though be to have nothing in return for word so spoken have asked to love have refused of course have refused of course have known that must refuse must sooner have died than have told that loved thought did love little did not so love what must give up what must swear never to set eye upon again if a part of such agreement might be set free from peter steinmarc solicitation be matter of course because without reference to peter quite acknowledged that be not free to have lover of own choice without aunt consent to give up ludovic must be duty duty thought must perform must not perform unless a part of compact let look to if duty be expected from let duty be done to then sat thinking a thought kissed own hand where ludovic have kissed object of thought be what must do now when aunt came home be at once to tell aunt have occurred that comparison have made between heisse girl so much to own disfavour must not be true comparison in case must have received clandestine young man must not be imputed to a fault at rate not imputed by justice of heaven ludovic valcarm have jumped out of boat got in at window must put right at rate before just tribunal simply by telling story truly immediately aunt charlotte ludovic valcarm have be here jumped out of boat got in at window followed into kitchen kissed hand swore loved then scrambled back through river must help now know about telling of tale a must thought be only way of making quite right before just tribunal felt a tried telling of to herself that task must be very difficult then aunt must only half believe must turn fact joined a must be with own unbelief into additional ground for urging on marriage with peter steinmarc how can one plead one cause justly before tribunal be manifestly unjust be determined to do injustice moreover be not bound to secrecy have not secrecy be implied in forgiveness have promised to ludovic a condition of going have accepted condition gone after must not be treacherous to betray why be that at moment seemed to treachery to to who have treated with such arrogant audacity must be of guilt most guilty be true that must not put right without telling of not to put right in extremity must be to fall into so deep depth of wrong injury to herself must now be better than treachery to have not risked much in order that might speak to that one word of love for that did not make up mind for time must be governed by thing a went tetchen came home first to tetchen linda be determined that must say not word that tetchen be in communication with young valcarm did not doubt must not tell servant what have be result of wickedness when tetchen came in linda be in kitchen went at once into parlour there awaited aunt tetchen have bustled in in high good humour have at once gone to work to prepare for sunday dinner mr peter be to dine with to day linda have said aunt think there be nothing like making one family of linda have left kitchen without speaking word have fully understood importance of domestic arrangement tetchen have announced no stranger ever dined at aunt table certainly aunt must have asked guest to do so on sunday one whom intended to regard a part of own household peter steinmarc be to be one of therefore might be allowed to eat dinner with even on sabbath between two three aunt came in peter be with a be usual on sunday madame staubach be very weary till dinner be served be unable to do much in way of talking peter went up into own room to put away hat umbrella then if ever must have be moment for linda to have told story did not tell then aunt be leaning back in accustomed chair with eye closed a be often wont linda knew that thought be far away wandering in world of be ever thinking living in dream of bliss with singing angel not happy not sure because of danger must intervene linda must not break in at time a with story of young man wild leap from boat certainly must not tell story before peter steinmarc must go untold to dying day before must whisper word of in presence when sat round table aunt be very kind in manner to linda have asked after headache a though nothing doubting fact of ailment when linda have said that have be able to rise almost a soon a aunt have left house madame staubach expressed displeasure when dinner be over peter be allowed to light pipe madame staubach slept appeared to sleep linda seated in furthest corner of room kept eye fixed upon book peter sat smoked with eye closed great big shoe stuck out before in way remained for hour then peter got up expressed intention of going out for stroll in nonnen garten now nonnen garten be close to house to be reached by bridge across river not fifty yard from jacob heisse door must linda go with linda declined have better dear said madame staubach seeming to awake from sleep air will do good do linda said peter then intended to be very gracious in what added will not say word to tease just take out bring back again be sure being sabbath must say nothing of hope to day said madame staubach not word said peter lifting up one hand in token of positive assurance even so assured linda must not go with town clerk went off alone now again have come time in linda must tell tale must certainly be told now never be to tell now must easily explain why have be silent so long be not to tell now such explanation must ever afterwards be impossible linda dear will read to said aunt then linda took up great bible turn to eighth ninth chapter of isaiah child linda did a be bidden read two chapter indicated after that there be silence for few minute then aunt spoke linda child yes aunt charlotte think must willingly be false to then linda turned away face be silent be not that offence to must be great who be a be poor weak misguided creature that sin against lord be so great seeing that have placed here a guide protector linda made promise in answer to even then did not tell tale how must have told at moment tale must now go untold for ever chapter v week passed by linda tressel heard nothing of ludovic began at last to hope that terrible episode of young man visit to might be allowed to be a though have never be week passed by during day of linda have feared have half expected to hear question from aunt must nearly crush to ground such question have be asked for aught linda knew one ludovic be aware of wonderful jump have be made out of boat on to island during week little almost nothing be said to in reference to courtship of peter steinmarc peter spoke never word madame staubach have merely said in reference to certain pipe of tobacco be smoked by town clerk in madame staubach parlour must heretofore have be smoked in town clerk own room that be well that peter must learn to make at home with linda have said nothing in reply have sworn inwardly that must never make herself at home with peter steinmarc in spite of pipe of tobacco linda be beginning to hope that might even yet escape from double peril perhaps be beginning to have hope even beyond when be suddenly shaken in security by word be spoken to by fanny heisse linda said fanny running over to gate of madame staubach house very early on one bright summer morning linda be to be to morrow will not come no dear never go out here be so sad solemn that know nothing of gaiety need not be solemn unless like know what do like fanny have become so used to be a grave a owl come of

world to have prevented doing what did never mean to speak to again if can help oh linda suppose think expected because stayed at home alone well did think that possibly expected something must have gone to church with aunt though head be splitting have thought that herr valcarm must have come here while be away mind have not blamed be great shame to give girl old lover like peter steinmarc ask to marry must have married peter steinmarc for uncle aunt in creation yet for father though father must never have thought of such thing think girl must choose lover for though how be to do so if be to be kept moping at home always can not tell if be treated a be think must ask somebody to jump over river to have asked nobody fanny how did know little bird saw fanny do tell max saw get across river with own eye max bogen be happy man who on morrow be to make fanny heisse wife heaven earth linda need not be afraid of max of men in world be very last to tell tale fanny if ever whisper word of to one will never speak to again of course will not whisper can not explain to about how must ruin think must kill outright if aunt be to know yet did nothing wrong must not encourage man to come

when to stay away be ashamed to think did not dare to speak to so opened door be very angry with still perhaps like just little be not that true linda know know want ever to see again come linda never be long time let be ever so long what say be true worst of ludovic be that be ne'er do well spends more money than earns be one of wild spirit who be always making up plan of politics who live with one foot inside state prison a be like lover to be gay be not well to have one young man carried off locked up by burgomaster linda be unhappy be sure that will not tell a for max bogen tongue be not own must like to hear say word about thing when tell to be silent linda believed friend still be great trouble to that one must know what ludovic valcarm have done on sunday morning a thought of seemed to to be almost impossible that secret must remain secret be known to three person for be sure that tetchen knew to three person besides immediately concerned thought of aunt word to when madame staubach have cautioned against deceit think that must willingly be false to because sin against lord must be so great linda have understood well how much have be meant by caution aunt have groaned over in spirit once when found to be fact that ludovic valcarm have be allowed to speak to have be allowed to speak though be dozen word dozen word have be spoken have not be revealed madame staubach having heard of sin have groaned in spirit heavily how much deeper must be groan if must come to know ludovic have be received in absence have be received on sabbath morning when niece be feigning to be ill linda still fancied that aunt might believe if be to tell own story be certain that aunt must never believe if story be to be told by in case there must be nothing for linda perpetual war a thought perpetual disgrace a aunt must in such circumstance range force on side of propriety so must range hers on side of impropriety must become necessary that must surrender a be to satan that must make up mind for evil life that must cut altogether cord bound to rigid practice of present mode of living aunt have once asked if meant to be light of love of young man linda have well known what aunt have meant have felt deep offence yet now thought that must foresee state of thing in though degradation might yet be impossible infamy of such degradation must belong to did not

weaker vessel subject to stronger one linda said nothing thought that old town clerk be not vessel strong enough to hold in subjection be woman must bring home to herself linda when first think of marriage of course must think of if be going to be married young woman too often allow to imagine that wedlock must mean pleasure diversion instead of that be simply entering into state of life in woman can best do duty here below life here must be painful full of toil moistened with many tear linda be partly prepared to acknowledge truth of teaching thought that there be great difference in bitterness of tear be to marry ludovic valcarm tear with must doubtless be very bitter tear must be so bitter a must be called upon to shed a wife of peter steinmarc of course continued madame staubach wife must love husband must not love peter steinmarc will listen to how can understand if will not listen to wife must love husband young woman such a see to be because have be so instructed

thing to be to only that can say must so speak to young woman if be given to speak to more than to one talk of love aunt never talk of love young woman do think of not knowing what love for husband must mean woman must revere husband obey be subject to in everything be supposed linda thought that must revere being a peter steinmarc what must be aunt idea of reverence if doe that will love also yes if doe said linda will not be much more likely if husband be older than wife year two said linda timidly not year two only so much so a to make graver wiser fit to be in command over will not woman so ruled be safer than who trust with one who be perhaps a weak inexperienced a madame staubach paused linda must not answer question did not wish for such security a be here proposed to be not that of have to think safety here so that if possible may be safe hereafter linda answered to herself within own bosom not for security here hereafter even be such to be found by such mean must consent to become wife of man proposed to madame staubach finding that spoken reply be given to question at last proceeded from generality to special case have under consideration linda said trust will consent to become wife of excellent man linda face became very hard still said nothing danger of have spoken be close upon must feel to be so youth perhaps most notorious in nuremberg for wickedness aunt say yes youth be spoken of openly a lover one have right to say so be said have so addressed to own ear have confessed tell that will do a must have then will know that be safe then will trust in everything for will be sure that will be well with linda will be so will not be so aunt charlotte be thus answer nothing will make marry man whom hate hate oh linda nothing will make marry man whom can not love fancy then that love that reprobate linda be silent be so tell have right to demand answer to question do love said linda using moment for reflection allowed to a best must

will remain here even with to be so called have done nothing to deserve if will cease to press upon odious scheme will hing to disgrace if be perplexed by herr steinmarc suit will not answer for consequence then turned back upon aunt walked slowly out of room on very evening peter came to linda while be standing alone at kitchen window tetchen be out of house linda have escaped from parlour a soon a hour arrived at in day steinmarc be wont to seat in aunt presence slowly light huge meerschaum pipe on occasion followed into kitchen linda be aware that be done before aunt have have opportunity of explaining to what have occurred on morning fraulein said a be alone here have ventured to come in join be proper place for herr steinmarc replied now be certainly case that peter rarely passed day without standing for twenty minute before kitchen stove talking to tetchen here must always take off boot when be wet here on more than one occasion on more probably than fifty have sat smoked pipe when there be other stove light in house to comfort with warmth linda therefore have strong point in favour when pointed out to suitor that be wrong to intrude upon kitchen wherever be must be good for said peter trying to smirk to look pleased linda be determined to silence even if must not silence aunt herr steinmarc said have explained to aunt that kind of thing from must cease must be made to cease if be man will not persecute by proposal have told already be altogether out of question if there be not man in nuremberg must not have may perhaps make hate worse than anybody in world can not possibly do anything else go to aunt will find have told same then walked off to own bedroom leaving town clerk in sole possession of kitchen peter steinmarc when be left standing alone in kitchen did not like position be man not endowed with much persuasive gift of word have certain strength of own have will firmness in pursuing thing desired be industrious patient honest with sort of second class honesty liked to earn what took though have strong bias towards believing that have earned whatever in way might have taken after same fashion be true with second class truth be unwilling to deceive be usually able to make believe that must have be deceit from to be not deceit from to be friendly in nature to certain degree understanding good office to ward must not be expected unless also be prepared to do good office to others on matter kept accurate mental account sheet on strove hard to be able to write balance always on right side be not cruel by nature have tenderness of heart delicacy of perception must forgive offence against comfort a when tetchen must burn soup even against pocket a when after many struggle must be unable to enforce payment of municipal fee be vain must not forgive offence against person linda have previously told to face that be old have with premeditated malice falsehood exaggerated age now threatened with hatred if persevered in asking to be wife must hate too began to hate hatred be unconscious thing of be unaware still purposed that must be wife must break spirit bring to foot punish with life long punishment for saying that be sixty when a well knew be only fifty two must beg for love who have threatened with hatred if held out against must lead such life by mean of tale told to madame staubach that must gladly accept change a release never thought of misery might be forthcoming to in possession of young wife procured after such fashion man requires power of imagination to enable to look forward to circumstance of untried existence peter steinmarc be not imaginative man be thoughtful man cunning withal conscious that various resource might be necessary to there be certain packer of cask named stobe in employment of brewer who owned warehouse opposite stobe be often to be seen on other side of river in ruden platz with man steinmarc have made acquaintance not at first with reference to linda tressel because be desirous of having private information a to doings of relative ludovic valcarm from stobe however have received first intimation of ludovic passion for linda now on very evening of be speaking obtained further information shocked frightened pained exceedingly yet gave keen gratification stobe also have seen leap out of boat rush through river when late on evening peter steinmarc sore with rebuff have received from linda pottered over to ruden platz thinking that must be well that must be very cunning that must have spy with eye always open that must learn everything must be learned by one who might watch red house watch ludovic also learned of sudden by speech of moment ludovic valcarm have on sunday morning paid wonderful visit to island so mean that saw said peter with own eye said stobe who have reason beyond peter moderate bribe for wishing to do evil turn to ludovic saw at parlour window watching when came back through water how long be with asked peter groaning yet exultant matter of hour not le anyways be two sunday since said peter remembering well morning on linda have declined to go to church because of headache remember well be feast of st lawrence said stobe who be roman catholic mindful of festival of church peter tarried for further discourse with brewer man hurried back again round by bridge to red house a went applied mind firmly to task of resolving what must do might probably take most severe revenge on revenge must for moment be most severe by summoning to presence of aunt by there exposing vile iniquity by there declaring that be out of question that man so respectable a must contaminate by marrying so vile creature be to do linda must never be in power red house must never be in possession moreover though continued to tell that linda be vile though be prepared to swear to villany did not in truth believe that have done anything disgraceful that have seen lover did not doubt that in peter own estimation be thing to be expected must no doubt on occasion pretend to view matter with eye of madame staubach in punishing linda must so view thought that upon whole bearing of case must not be incumbent upon dignity to abandon for ever bride bride property because have be indiscreet must marry still before did so must let know how thoroughly be in power how much must owe to if now took to bosom point on must not at once quite make up mind be must tell madame staubach first must endeavour to use power over linda knowledge gave by threat to might not say to with much strength give way to at once will reveal to aunt story of vileness doubt must be best course must trust in success must not succeed must then have injured position be afraid that linda must be too high spirited too obstinate resolved that safest course must be to tell everything at once to madame staubach a passed between back of jacob heisse house river saw upholsterer ruddy face looking out from open window belonging to workshop good evening peter said jacob heisse hope lady be well pretty well thank said peter a be hurrying by tell linda that take amiss that did not come to girl wedding truth be peter keep too much moped up there among must remember peter too much work make jack dull boy linda will give slip day if be kept so tight in hand peter muttered something a passed on to red house linda must give slip must be not improbable thought that must try to do so must keep such watch on that must be very difficult widow must watch a closely a must do give slip yes might be possible therefore must lose time when entered house walked at once up to madame staubach parlour entered without of ceremony of knocking be usual to be not that intended to put ceremony aside that in eager haste forgot usual precaution when entered room linda be there with aunt have again to turn whole subject over in thought must tell tale in linda presence behind back gradually became apparent to that must not possibly tell before face did not arrive at conclusion without delay minute be so occupied be full of agony seated in accustomed chair looked from aunt to niece then from niece to aunt give slip must well perhaps must must be very clever if did thought must have be in earlier peter said madame staubach be coming saw fraulein in kitchen ventured to speak word two there reception received drove away linda what be did not think aunt that kitchen be proper place for room in house be proper place for said madame staubach in enthusiasm linda be silent peter replied to expression of hospitality simply by grateful nod will not have give air linda continued madame staubach kitchen not proper place what harm must peter do in kitchen tormented so left when torment will always leave then linda got up stalked out of room aunt called more than once must not return life be becoming so heavy to that be impossible that must continue to endure went up now to room looking out of window fixed eye upon low stone archway in have more than once seen ludovic valcarm be not there now knew indeed that be not in nuremberg tetchen have told that have gone to augsburg on pretence of business connected with brewery tetchen have said in truth with reference to diabolical political scheme a to tetchen expressed strong opinion that who dabbled in be child of very devil though ludovic be not in nuremberg linda stood looking at archway for more than hour considering circumstance of life planning if might be possible to plan future scheme of existence to live under upas tree of peter steinmarc courtship must be impossible to how must avoid a thought of eye be continually fixed on low archway why did not come out from give counsel a to future there stood looking out of window till be called by aunt voice linda linda come down to aunt voice be very solemn almost a though came from grave then solemnity be common to aunt linda a descended have not on mind special fear when reached parlour madame staubach be alone there standing in middle of room for moment two after entered widow stood there without speaking then linda knew that there be cause for fear did want aunt charlotte said linda what be doing on morning of sabbath before last when went to church alone leaving in bed linda be well aware now that aunt knew be aware also that steinmarc have be informer idea of denying truth of story of concealing anything crossed mind for moment be quite prepared to tell everything now feeling doubt that everything have be told there be longer hope that must recover aunt affectionate good will in what word be to tell tale be now immediate difficulty aunt be standing before hard stern cruel expecting answer to question how be answer to be made on spur of moment did nothing aunt charlotte man came here while be absent what man ludovic valcarm be standing looking other full in face on madame staubach countenance there be written degree of indignation angry shame seemed to threaten utter repudiation of niece on linda be written resolution to bear without flinching have hope now with aunt other hope than of being able to endure for moment of spoke then linda finding difficult to support aunt continued gaze commenced defence young man came when be alone made way into house when door be bolted have locked into kitchen when heard voice opened door thinking that did not become to be afraid of presence why did not tell at once linda made immediate reply to question when madame staubach repeated be obliged to answer told that if must go must forgive then went thought be bound by promise to be silent madame staubach having heard turned round slowly walked to window leaving linda in middle of room there stood for perhaps minute then came slowly back again linda have remained where be without stirring limb mind have be active have determined that must submit in silence to rebuke command from aunt save one must endeavour to obey from accusation a to impropriety of conduct must defend with unabashed spirit aunt came up close to putting out one hand with palm turned towards raising a high a shoulder seemed to wave away linda said madame staubach be castaway be castaway aunt charlotte said linda almost jumping from foot screaming in self defence will not frighten by wicked violence have lied to have lied to yes that after said to a to heinousness of such wickedness linda be belief that knew that be coming when kept bed on sabbath morning if choose to have such thought of in heart aunt charlotte can not help knew nothing of coming must have given have to prevent though coming must do real harm good name be more precious to than anything short of self esteem nothing even that can say will rob of madame staubach be almost shaken by girl firmness by by own true affection for sinner in bosom what remained of softness of womanhood be struggling with hardness of religious martinet with wilfulness of domestic tyrant have promised to steinmarc that must be very stern steinmarc have pointed out to that nothing hardest severity must be of avail in telling story have taken for granted that linda have expected lover have remained at home on purpose that might receive lover have lived life of deceit with aunt for month past when madame staubach have suggested that young man coming might have be accidental have treated idea with ridicule a girl injured suitor be declared obliged to treat such suggestion a altogether incredible although be willing to pardon injury done to if course of intense severity discipline be at once adopted if be followed by repentance to must appear to be sincere when took high ground a man having authority a one who knew world have carried madame staubach with have not ventured to say word in excuse for niece have promised that severity must be at rate forthcoming if possible discipline a for repentance that said meekly must be left in hand of god ah said peter in bitterness must make repent in sackcloth ash then madame staubach have again promised that sackcloth ash must be there remembered a thought of relenting a perceived that to relent must be sweet to made rigid with fresh resolve if man coming have be accidental why have not story be told to must understand nothing of forgiveness of linda have spoken have not linda confessed that loved man must not rather have hated who have so intruded upon have there be real intrusion in visit have done that said must destroy character of girl in nuremberg if mean aunt charlotte that thing have happened must destroy character of girl in nuremberg may perhaps be true if so be very unfortunate have not told that love do do do one can not help one love to love a do be misfortune there be nothing misery around have heard whole truth now may a well spare further rebuke do not know how such misery must be met linda shook head have prayed to be forgiven terrible sin what sin said linda again almost screaming in energy terrible sin of receiving man in absence of friend be sin be sinful know very one perhaps more so there be sin there must help coming aunt charlotte if believe about be better that must never speak to again if so must live apart how can that be can not rid ourselves of other will go anywhere into service away from nuremberg where will will not be told that be liar yet madame staubach be sure that linda have lied thought that be sure if so if be case that young woman have planned infamous scheme for receiving lover on sunday morning fact that be on sunday morning that hour of church service have be used greatly enhanced atrocity of sin in estimation of madame staubach if young woman have intrigued in order that lover might come to of course must intrigue again in spite of linda solemn protestation a to self esteem thing must be going on infamous young man who in madame staubach eye be beginning to take proportion of evil one must be coming there beneath very nose seemed to that life must be impossible to unless linda must consent to be married to respectable suitor who be still willing to receive that only way in to exact consent must be to insist on degradation to linda have subjected linda have talked of going into service let go into service be now offered to by whom be bound to obey of course herr steinmarc know said madame staubach regard in least what herr steinmarc know replied linda be still willing to overlook impropriety of conduct upon condition overlook let dare to say such word to must tell that opinion in matter be of le moment to than of other creature in what be to who come to be for must bid young man come day linda talk to about peter steinmarc aunt charlotte will go mad must talk about must hear about be now more than ever necessary that must be wife nuremberg will hear of of course will a peter steinmarc know how will cover from shame will not cover at if be ashamed of will go away if will not say that be not ashamed of will go away have done nothing to disgrace will hear nothing about shame having made brave assertion burst into tear then escaped to own bed when madame staubach be left alone sat down closed eye clasped hand began to pray a to what must do in terrible circumstance have light unless such light might be given to from above certain trust have in peter steinmarc because peter be man not young man be not trust made confident thought that peter be very good in being willing to take linda at after have happened have begun to be aware that be not able to make own goodness apparent to linda did not in heart blame peter for want of eloquence rather imputed increased degree of culpability to linda in eloquence be necessary for conviction on matter eloquence in affair of marriage in reference to preparation for marriage arrangement be one of devil bait of madame staubach be especially afraid ludovic valcarm doubt must be eloquent must talk of love throw glance from eye sigh do worse thing perhaps even than trick of satan to ensnare soul of young woman peter must perform such trick therefore be that task be so difficult to must not regard a deficiency that be unable to do very thing when done in presence be abominable to sight when spoken of be abominable to ear when thought of be abominable to imagination yet how be to arrange marriage if peter be able to say nothing for so sat down clasped hand prayed earnestly assistance might be given to if pray that mountain will be moved will have faith mountain will certainly be stirred so told told in agony of spirit because still doubted feared that doubted that thing must not be done for by heaven aid oh if must only make herself certain that heaven must aid then thing must be done for must not be certain therefore felt to be wretched sinner in mean time linda be in bed up stair thinking over position making up mind a to what must be future conduct a far a might be possible must enter room in peter steinmarc be present must not go into parlour when be there even though aunt must call must follow into kitchen must instantly leave on pretence must speak to have always refuge of own bedroom must venture to follow there thought that must know how to defend a to rest must bear aunt thought if necessary aunt hard word also be very well to talk of going into service where be house must receive then a to ludovic valcarm in regard to be not easy for to come to resolution still thought that must be willing to make compact if aunt on other side must be willing to make also chapter vi september went by october life in red house in island in nuremberg be very sad life indeed during time linda tressel never spoke to ludovic valcarm of saw once standing among beer cask opposite to warehouse have not so seen must have thought that have vanished altogether out of city that be to be no more heard of seen among be such man belonged to set that vanishing in fashion must have be thing to create surprise might have joined father two might be together in quarter of globe on spot more distant more probable be one of linda trouble that knew really nothing of life of man loved have always heard thing evil spoken of such evil speaking have come from who be enemy from cousin who have be angry because ludovic have not remained with on stool in town hall from madame staubach who thought ill of almost young men who have be specially prejudiced against young man by peter steinmarc linda did not know what must believe have heard that brother sach be respectable tradesman be in valcarm favour that be employed by have thought that have left now seeing again among barrel have reason to presume that life must not be altogether unworthy of be working for bread what more must be required from young man than nevertheless when saw sedulously kept from sight went almost at once back to kitchen from whence there be view on to ruden platz during week life be very sad in house madame staubach said little to niece of past iniquity in matter of ludovic visit not much of peter suit so bore that glance of eye tone of voice nod of head be separate rebuke hardly ever left linda alone requiring company when went out to make little purchase in market always on more momentous prolonged occasion when attended public prayer meeting linda resolved to obey in such matter did obey went hither thither by aunt side at home sat with aunt always with needle in hand never leaving room except when peter steinmarc entered did perhaps on other evening when did so linda always arose went up to own chamber speaking word to man a passed when aunt have rebuked for laying upon command that must remain when steinmarc appeared protested that in matter obedience be impossible to in other thing must do a be bidden nothing said force must induce to stay for five minute in same room with peter steinmarc peter who be of course aware of must look at when passed met on stair in passage a though be something too vile for to touch madame staubach a saw must groan aloud then peter must groan latterly too tetchen have taken to groaning so that life in house have become very sad linda paid back peter scorn with interest lip must curl nostril must be dilated eye must flash fire on a passed also prayed little in day linda might be given into hand if ever must be so given must teach what be to scorn offer of honest man for month six week linda tressel bore with patience when october be half gone patience be almost at end life if prolonged much further must make mad absence of smile from face of with whom lived be terrible to be surrounded by solemnity a of grave came to doubt almost whether be living creature if be to be scorned always to be treated ever a one unfit for pleasant intercourse of life might be a well that must deserve such treatment be possible that by deserving might avoid at first during solemn wearisome week must tell that because aunt have condemned not therefore need feel assured that be condemned of heavenly father be not castaway because aunt have so called gradually there came upon feeling springing from imagination rather than from judgment that be thing set apart a vile bad there grew upon conviction that be one of non elect rather one of who be elected to eternity of misery religious observance a came to now be odious to that supposed to be certain sign that devil have fought for soul have conquered must not be that must be so terribly wretched if be not also very wicked must tremble now at sound though still curled lip poured scorn upon peter from eye a moved away at approach be almost so far beaten a to be desirous to succumb must either succumb to aunt to else must fly how be to live without word of sympathy from human being have be careful to say little nothing to tetchen having indistinct idea that tetchen be double traitor that tetchen have on one occasion be in league with ludovic be sure thought that since that woman have be in league with peter also league with ludovic have be very wicked might be forgiven league with peter be sin to be forgiven never therefore linda have resolutely declined of late to hold converse with tetchen other than affair of house demanded when tetchen who in matter be most unjustly treated must make little attempt to regain confidence of young mistress effort be met with repellant silence thus there be one in house to whom linda must speak at last became so dreadful to desolation of position be so complete that have learned to regret sternness to tetchen a far a must now see there be alliance between tetchen peter might be case thought that suspicion have be unjust to old woman one evening about beginning of november when have already become dark at hour in peter must present in madame staubach parlour have entered room a be usual with a usual linda have at once left peter a passed have looked at with more than usual anger with aggravated bitterness of condemnation in eye have be weeping in silence before have appeared have power left to throw back scorn at still weeping went up into room throwing on bed began in misery to cry aloud for mercy end must be brought to burden on shoulder must be heavier than must bear have gone to window for moment a entered chamber have thrown one glance in despair over towards ruden platz night be dark full of rain have be there must not have seen there be one to befriend then threw on bed wept aloud be still lying there when there came very low tap at door started up listened have heard no footfall on stair be thought impossible that one must have come up without hearing step peter steinmarc creaked whenever went along passage did aunt tetchen tread with foot a light a sat up then knock be repeated very low very clear still paused moment resolving that nothing must frighten nothing must startle change must come to must thought be change for worse hastened up from off bed stood upon floor then gave answer be usual to summons come in said spoke low with clear voice so that

will speak to heaven earth be ludovic ludovic in aunt house ludovic at chamber door ludovic there within very penetralia of abode while aunt peter steinmarc be sitting in chamber below have resolved that in event must be startled in making that resolve have not almost hoped that must be voice must greet must not now again say come in man who have have audacity to advance so far be not bold enough to advance farther though invited stepped quickly to door placing hand upon lock knew not whether to close against intruder to confront man there can be moment linda will not speak to said lover what must aunt do to her what peter steinmarc must world do worse than have be done already have told that be castaway have half believed in moment of deepest misery have believed if be so how must fall lower must not be sweet to to hear one word of kindness in trouble to catch one note must not be laden with rebuke opened door stood before in gloom of passage linda dear dearest linda before knew that be so near have caught hand hush be below will hear must be up among rafter before one must be on first landing one must hear motion linda in surprise looked up through darkness a though must see passage of spoke in narrowing stair amidst roof what terrible man be who have come to bedroom door must thus talk of escaping amidst rafter why be here whispered because love better than light of heaven because must go through fire water to be near linda dearest linda be not true that be in sorrow indeed yes said shaking head while still left hand in will not find escape for be impossible will try at least said can hing for nothing love linda say that love remained silent hand be still within grasp must not lie to say that loved not linda be world to sweetest music must hear must be one word to say that be dear to said not word knew now that loved knew well be instinct of lover to know that mistress have given heart heartily when doe not deny gift with more than sternness with cold cruelty yes knew secret now pulling close to by hand by arm wound own arm round waist tightly pressed face close to hers linda linda own own o god how happy be suffered spoke not word hot kiss be rained upon lip gave never kiss in return pressed with muscle of body simply bore pressure uncomplaining uncomplying hardly thinking half conscious almost swooning hysterical with blood rushing wildly to heart lost in agony of mingled fear love oh linda oh own one kiss be still raining on lip cheek brow have heard aunt footstep on stair have heard creaking shoe of peter steinmarc must hardly have moved to save from wrath pressure of lover arm be very sweet to still through there be consciousness that in very knowledge of sweetness devil be claiming own now in very truth be castaway love life said ludovic there be few moment for can do to comfort be still in arm pressed closely to bosom not trusting at to support of own leg made one little struggle to free be in vain opened lip to speak there came sound from then there came again upon storm of kiss be bound round by arm a though be never again to be loosened water fell upon be sweeter than rain of heaven knew there be still enough of life in to remember that be foul with sulphur brimstone of pit of hell linda said be leaving nuremberg will go with go with whither be to go how be to go going that spoke of be not thus usually with castaway if be true that be in very fact already castaway why must not go with yet be half sure that such going on part be thing quite out of question a actor will say of when decline proffered character must not see in part though must tell that be castaway very child of devil because must thus stand listen to lover at chamber door yet must not think of sin must really make so without abhorrence made that sin frightful to be not allured hardly tempted by young man offer a made yet what else be there for to do if be true that be castaway why must struggle to be better than others who be of same colour with herself linda say will be wife wife oh yes must be wife if be possible even now in moment of agony there came to vague idea that might do service if be wife because have property of own be ready to acknowledge to herself that duty to be stronger than duty to woman below who have be so cruel to must be wife if be possible even though must drag through mud of poverty through gutter of tribulation must walk down to aunt presence moment real wife must do so bear must be said to must be so that storm have be bitter with brimstone from lowest pit must at once become sweet with air of heaven how must be knew that must not be marriage be thing difficult to be done hedged in with manner of impediment hardly to be reached at by one a unless might be such marriage a proposed to with peter steinmarc for girl with sweet loving parent for fanny heisses of world marriage might be made easy be very well for ludovic valcarm to ask to be wife in asking must have known that must not if must yet sound of word be sweet to if might be so even yet must not be castaway did not answer question struggling hard to speak muttered prayer to that must leave say that love demanded demand be only whispered word came hot into ear do love replied then will go with be impossible will make take man for husband will never do never never in making assertion linda found strength to extricate from lover arm to stand alone how will come to again said ludovic must not come again must not have come now must not have be here have thought possible must have come linda then went on to show to how very unsatisfactory courtship must be if now that be together nothing must be arranged a to future meeting soon became clear to linda ludovic knew everything be going on in house have learned from tetchen tetchen at moment be quite aware of presence up stair be prepared to cough aloud standing at kitchen door if sign be made that steinmarc madame staubach be about to leave parlour though have seemed to linda that lover have come to through darkness aided by power thereof assistance have really brought there be simply that of old cook down stair certainly be on card tetchen might help again after same fashion ludovic felt that such help must be of little avail unless linda now that have acknowledged love must do something to help also with ludovic valcarm be quite proper course of thing that must jump out of boat disappear into roof among rafter escape across tile down spout in darkness a preliminary step in love affair in special love affair such movement must only be preliminary therefore a be now standing face to face with linda a there certainly have be difficulty in achieving position be anxious to make positive use of then a explained to

with that there must be married if must meet at railway station in time for early train certainly must reach without impediment linda must find difficulty in leaving house tetchen must take care even door must be open for linda listened to by degree impossibility of assenting to such iniquity became le palpable though wickedness of scheme be still manifest to though felt that be to assent to must in doing so give up finally body soul to evil one yet be not angry with ludovic for proposing nay loving well enough before loved better a pressed to go with must not go have nothing to say be impossible be conscious after certain fashion that leg must refuse to carry to railway station on errand that physical strength must have failed that be to make ever so binding promise when morning

though necessity for movement be so close upon must not leave linda hand till have again pressed kiss upon mouth now at last in perilous moment there be slightest movement on linda lip flattered might take a response then in moment be gone door be shut be escaping after own fashion into darkness knew not whither knew not how except there be bitter flavour of brimstone about seated at foot of bed lost in amazement must first think be bound first to think of safety yet what in way of punishment must do to comparable to torment must inflict upon listened soon heard peter steinmarc creaking in room below tetchen have coughed because peter be a usual going to room have ludovic remained at door one must have be bit wiser doubt ludovic up among rafter be thinking same thing there must be renewal of intercourse that night therefore linda bolted door a did so swore to herself that must not unbolt again that evening at ludovic request such encroaching request be made to sat for nearly hour at foot of bed waiting listening fearing thinking hoping hardly hoping when step be heard on stair in passage step well knew to be that of aunt charlotte then arose a aunt drew near pulled back bolt opened door little oil lamp held threw timid fitful light into gloom linda looked up unconsciously into darkness of roof over head have be custom to return to aunt parlour a soon a heard peter creaking in room below have still meant to do so on evening hitherto have be unable to move at rate so to compose a to have made possible for to go into aunt presence have not have whole world of own love story to fill mind heart linda have be expecting to come down to said aunt gravely yes aunt charlotte be coming be late now linda then if please will go to bed said linda who be by mean sorry to escape necessity of returning to parlour must not go to rest said madame staubach without doing duty by seeing telling again that be very wicked of to leave room whenever friend enters linda do ever think of punishment pride will bring down upon be not pride yes linda be worst pride in world will sit with evening if will promise never again to ask to be wife time will perhaps come linda when will be only too glad to take will tell that be not fit to be wife of honest man then having uttered bitter curse for such be madame staubach went across to own room linda a knelt at bedside tried to pray that might be delivered from temptation felt that prayer be not prayer indeed even when be on knee with hand clasped together a though towards god very soul be full of presence of arm have be so fast wound round waist when be in bed gave up to sweetness of love with what delicious violence have that storm of kiss fallen on then prayed for strove very hard that prayer might be sincere chapter vii

hot fevered suspicious full of dangerous excitement twice again have seen ludovic once meeting in kitchen once have met at certain dark gate in nonnen garten to have contrived to make escape for hour on false plea thing be much changed with linda tressel when must condescend to do have received from lover dozen note always by hand of tetchen have written to more than once few short incoherent startling word in must protest that loved protest also at same time that love must be in vain be of use write pray come if go on will kill know that will never give to anybody else be in answer to proposition made through tetchen that must come again to must come take away with have come there have be that interview in kitchen have not succeeded in inducing to leave home there have be many project discussed between a to tetchen have given much advice be be opinion that if linda must declare to aunt that meant at once to marry ludovic valcarm make master of house in lived madame staubach must have alternative to submit quietly that must herself go forth instruct clergyman to publish banns linda might thus become valcarm acknowledged wife before snow be off ground ludovic seemed to have doubt about still signifying preference for marriage at munich when tetchen explained to that linda must lose character by travelling with to munich before be wife merely laughed at old wife tale have not seen fanny heisse max bogen in train together between augsburg nuremberg long before be married who have thought of saying word against fanny character everybody knew about said linda let everybody know about said ludovic linda must not go must not go even though ludovic told that be imperative that must quit nuremberg such matter be in training did not tell what matter a must make going quite imperative still must take step towards going with advice of tetchen be much more in accordance with desire if must act upon then might have happiness before thought that must make up mind bring to declare purpose to aunt if ludovic must allow to do so ludovic declared that must not be done a preparatory to being married at nuremberg at last be almost angry with did not trust oh yes must trust with everything with happiness heart house with that world have left for there be still that feeling left within bosom that if did thing proposed must be trusting with very soul ludovic said word to about house tetchen said many word when linda expressed opinion though house might not belong to aunt legally be ought to be aunt property in point of honour tetchen only laughed at let bother about peter then if chooses to live here on favour said tetchen a linda came to think of did appear hard to that must be tormented about peter steinmarc in own house be not madame staubach child slave indeed be of childish age gradually idea grew upon that might assert right to free from tyranny to be made subject there be always joined to consciousness that though according to law of world might assert right claim property acknowledge to everybody love to ludovic valcarm must do none of thing in accordance with law of god have become subject to aunt by circumstance of life a though aunt be in fact parent fifth commandment be a binding on a though be in truth daughter of guardian who have have in charge since infancy once said word to aunt about house be struck with horror by manner in madame staubach have answered have simply said that a house be partly hers have thought that might suggest expediency of getting lodger in place of peter steinmarc madame staubach have arisen from chair have threatened to go at once out into street bare naked destitute a expressed if ever tell again said madame staubach that house be yours will never eat meal beneath father roof linda shocked at own wickedness have fallen at aunt knee promised that must never again be guilty of such wickedness a reflected on what have done did believe herself to have be very mean very wicked have known life that though house be hers to live in be subject to guidance of aunt so have be subject till have grown to be woman must not quite understand that such subjection for whole term of life need be duty to when be term of duty to be completed between own feeling on one side tetchen continued instigation on other became aware that truly needed be advice secret interview clandestine correspondence be terrible to very soul must not even yet be castaway if might be possible to save there be two thing fixed for fixed even though by certainty must become castaway must never marry peter steinmarc must never cease to love ludovic valcarm might be possible that assured fact must be reconciled to duty if only there be somebody whom might trust to tell linda father have have many friend in nuremberg must still remember whom a child have seen from time to time in father house name of be still familiar to memory of face even of one two who have suffered to play at knee when be little more than baby be present to manner have so changed at red house since day few if of alliance have be preserved peculiar creed of madame staubach be not popular with burgher of nuremberg know how family friendship will die out when be not kept alive by warmth of familiar intercourse there be still few among most respected in city who must bow to madame staubach when met in street must smile nod at linda a remembered old day when must be merry with decorous mirth in presence of father there be none in town not one who must interfere a friend in affair of widow staubach household who ever thought of asking linda to sit at friendly hearth close neighbourhood school acquaintance have made fanny heisse friend be very rarely indeed that have set foot over threshold of jacob door peter steinmarc be only friend friendship have arisen from mere fact of residence beneath same roof be necessary that house must be divided with in way peter have become lodger linda certainly must not go to peter for advice must have gone to jacob heisse that jacob be man slow of speech somewhat timid in matter beyond making of furniture little inclined to meddle with thing out of own reach fancied that counsel required must be sought for from one wiser more learned than jacob heisse among name of who have loved father still rested in memory be that of herr molk man much spoken of in nuremberg one rich of great repute who be have be burgomaster who occupied house on egidien platz known to linda well because of picturesque beauty even peter steinmarc who must often speak of town magistrate a though be greatly inferior to in municipal lore general wisdom must mention name of herr molk with almost involuntary respect linda have seen from time to time in platz on market place father old friend have always smiled on expressed hope that be well happy ah how vain have be that hope what if must now go to herr molk ask for advice must not speak to tetchen because tetchen must at once tell to ludovic in matter a linda felt must not act a ludovic must bid yes must go to noted pundit of city if must allow so to do must tell to story then made resolve must not do without informing aunt that be about to be done on occasion even though aunt must tell to remain in house must go forth aunt must not throw in teeth that have acted on sly one day one cold november morning when hour of early dinner be approaching went up stair from kitchen for hat cloak then equipped for walk presented before aunt linda where be going demanded madame staubach be going aunt charlotte to herr molk in egidien platz to herr molk why have bidden come to then linda told story with much difficulty be unhappy said wanted advice remembered man that be friend of father be sorry linda that must want other advice than can give dear aunt be just that want to marry man here can not do have made miserable miserable be not true that be not happy a used to be certainly be not happy how can be happy when see wandering astray how can be happy when tell that love man in nuremberg whom believe of to be most wicked ungodly how can be happy when threaten to expel from house because be own only man whom love honour respect never said so aunt charlotte never thought of saying such thing what will ask of stranger must find in presence will tell everything ask what must do will tell truly certainly aunt charlotte will tell truth in everything if bid marry man whom have chosen a husband linda when suggestion be made to became silent truly be impossible that wise man in nuremberg must tell such sacrifice a be necessary then madame staubach repeated question if bid marry peter steinmarc will do a bid surely must not be so bidden by father friend will endeavour to do a bid said linda then go to child may god so give grace that may soften hardness of heart prevail with to put down foot temptation of satan that may quell spirit of evil within god forbid must think that there be wisdom in nuremberg fitter than mine to guide if man be man of god will give good counsel then linda wondering much at aunt ready acquiescence went forth walked straightway to house of herr molk in egidien platz chapter viii walk of ten minute took linda from schuett island to egidien platz placed before door of herr molk house egidien platz be perhaps most fashionable quarter of nuremberg if nuremberg may be said to have fashion in such matter be near to rathhaus to st sebald church be not far distant from old burg castle in emperor used to dwell when visited imperial city of nuremberg large open place have church in centre around be house almost large built with gable turned towards street quaint picturesque eloquent of much burgher wealth there must be such square in city be not have not be very rich among house in egidien platz there be house to exceed in beauty of ornament in quaintness of architecture in general wealth comfort that be inhabited by herr molk linda stood for moment at door then putting up hand pulled down heavy iron bell handle be gem of art representing ancient discreet burgher of town wrapped in cloak almost hidden by broad brimmed hat heard bell clank close inside door then portal be open a though very pulling of bell have opened lock at least be open so linda must push door with hand enter over threshold did found within long narrow court yard round one above there ran gallery open to court guarded with heavy balustrade of carved wood from narrowness of enclosure house on side seemed to be very high linda looking round with astonished eye must see at point wood be carved waterspout be ornamented with grotesque figure huge broad stair led to open gallery on left hand be of polished oak made so slippery with polisher daily care that be difficult to tread upon without falling around bottom of court there be open granary warehouse for there seemed to be nothing must be called room on ground floor beyond porter lodge open warehouse seemed to be filled full with mass of stacked firewood linda knew well value of such store in nuremberg lost none of veneration for herr molk because of such nature be sign of domestic wealth a timidly looked around saw old woman within gate of porter lodge inquired whether herr molk be at home disengaged woman simply motioned to wicket gate by broad polished stair be guarded linda hesitating to advance into so grand mansion alone yet knowing that must do a be bidden entered wicket ascended carefully to first gallery here be bell ready to hand handle of consisted of little child in iron work also pulled waited one must come presently there be scuffling heard of quick foot in gallery three child ran up to in middle be elder girl dressed in dark silk at side be two boy habited in black velvet have long fair hair large blue eye soft peach like cheek such a who love child always long to kiss linda thought that have never seen child so gracious so fair asked again whether herr molk be at home at liberty to see stranger quite stranger said poor linda with what emphasis must put upon word little girl said that grandfather be at home must see visitor a matter of course must linda follow then child still leading little brother tripped up stair to second gallery opening door led into one of large front room communicated to old gentleman who seemed to be taking exercise in apartment with hand behind back that be wanted by lady wanted be pretty one well here be then little girl giving long look up into linda face retreated taking brother with closing door thus linda found in room along with old gentleman who still kept hand behind back be singular apartment nearly square very large panelled with carved wood not only throughout wall up to ceiling also floor be polished even brighter than be stair herr molk must have be well accustomed to take exercise there must surely have slipped fallen in course there be one small table in room stood unused near wall there be perhaps not more than dozen chair high backed covered with old tapestry looking a though must hardly have be placed there for ordinary use on one of linda sat at old man bidding placed on with hand still behind just seating on edge of chair be linda tressel said poor linda saw at glance that must not have known herr molk whom have never before met without hat perceived also that have not recognised linda tressel so be dear dear knew father well very well lord how long be ago be dead ever so many year how many year sixteen year said linda sixteen year dead be younger man than much younger let see not so much younger younger linda tressel father daughter be welcome to house glass of wine will not hurt cold weather declined wine old man must have way went out be absent perhaps five minute then returned bearing small tray in own hand with long necked bottle glass curiously engraved insisted that linda must clink glass with now dear what be can do for so far linda mission have prospered well now that story be to be told found very much difficulty in telling have to begin with whole history of red house of term upon aunt have come to reside in have one point at least in favour herr molk be excellent listener must nod head pat one hand upon other say yes yes without slightest sign of impatience seemed a though have other care before than of listening to linda story when experienced encouragement came from nodding of head patting of hand went on boldly told how peter steinmarc have come to house how aunt be woman peculiar from strength of religious conviction yes dear yes know that know said herr molk linda did best to say nothing evil of aunt then came to story of peter courtship be quite old man know said poor linda thoughtfully then be interrupted by herr molk worthy man know well well well peter steinmarc be clerk at rathhaus very worthy man be peter steinmarc father dear be clerk at rathhaus peter followed be not young not just young very worthy man go on dear linda have resolved to tell did tell be difficult to tell came out perhaps there must be listener more encouraging to girl a linda than patient gentle mannered old man with whom be closeted have lover whom loved dearly said young man oh lover said herr molk there seemed to be anger in voice received information a though be important not astonishing then linda even told how lover have come across river on sunday morning how have happened that have not told aunt how angry aunt have be yes yes said herr molk be better that elder must know such thing always better go on dear then told also how lover have come down have gone up through rafter old man smiled perhaps have hidden among rafter fifty year ago have sweet remembrance of feat now linda wanted to know what be to do how ought to act house be own must not for world drive aunt out of loved lover very dearly must not love peter steinmarc at not in way have young man mean to support wife asked herr molk linda hesitated knowing that there be still thing to be told have not a yet dared to mention knew too that must be told herr molk a hesitated asked second question on very point what be young man name dear depends on name character whether have mean to support wife name be ludovic valcarm said linda whispering word very low old man jumped from seat with alacrity linda have certainly not expected ludovic valcarm said why dear man be in prison moment signed committal yesterday in prison said linda rising also from chair be terrible young man said herr molk very terrible young man doe manner of thing ca explain what dear young woman must not think of taking ludovic valcarm for husband must not indeed have better make up mind to take peter steinmarc peter steinmarc can support wife be very respectable have known peter life ludovic valcarm oh dear must be very bad very bad indeed linda distress be excessive be not only that tidings heard of ludovic be hard to bear seemed that herr molk be intent on ranging altogether with enemy respecting peter steinmarc in fact old man advice to respecting peter be more important in mind that denunciation of ludovic did not quite credit what said of ludovic be doubtless true that ludovic be in prison probably for political offence such men thought be not kept in prison long be bad fact of lover imprisonment not so bad a advice counsellor gave knew must be bound to repeat to aunt herr molk sir if love peter steinmarc if hate oh dear dear be terrible thing there be not such ne'er do well in nuremberg a ludovic valcarm support wife can not support will be well if doe not die in jail oh dear oh dear for father sake fraulein for father sake must go distance to save from father be good man credit to city peter steinmarc be good man need not marry peter steinmarc herr molk can not do better dear indeed can not see what aunt say remember dear that must submit to elder better peter be not so old be not old at be one of city magistrate when peter be little boy remember well began life in father office nothing can be more respectable than have be then ludovic valcarm oh dear if ask advice must counsel to accept peter steinmarc there be nothing more to be got from herr molk with terrible recommendation still sounding in ear linda sadly made way back from egidien platz to schuett island chapter ix linda tressel a returned home to house in schuett island became aware that be necessary for to tell to aunt have passed between herr molk have be half stunned with grief a left magistrate house for while have tried to think that must keep back from madame staubach at rate purport of advice have be given to a came to conclusion that must be impossible to that must come out various wild plan flitted across brain must not run away without returning to red house at whither be to run with whom only one who must have helped in wild enterprise have be sent to prison by ill conditioned old man who have made so miserable at moment there be longer hope in bosom that must save from being castaway nay there be hardly wish there be disreputable life so terrible to thought infamy so infamous in idea to a must be respectability in form of matrimony with peter steinmarc now a walked along painfully going far out of way that might have little time for reflection turning in mind began almost to fear that if went back to aunt aunt must prevail that in very truth peter steinmarc must become lord master then there be plan a impracticable a scheme of running away what if be to become sullen decline to speak at be well aware that in such contest aunt tongue must be very terrible to a idea crossed mind told that be so to act people must treat a mad woman even that thought must be better than being forced to marry peter steinmarc before have reached island knew that one scheme be a impossible a other entered house very quietly turning to left went at once into kitchen linda aunt be waiting dinner for hour said tetchen why did not take to by herself said linda crossly how must do when must not have have better go in now at once linda doe anything ail very much ail said linda then tetchen came close to whispered have heard anything about what have heard tetchen tell at once be in trouble be in prison linda said with little hysteric scream then began to sob cry turned back to tetchen hid face in hand have heard that too said tetchen say burgomaster have caught with letter on from terrible rebel up in prussia that have be plotting to have city burned down believe fraulein be in prison know be in prison said linda wish be there too so do dead 'd rather be dead then madame staubach having perhaps heard lock of front door when be closed came into kitchen linda said be waiting for want dinner said linda still standing with face turned to wall then madame staubach took hold of arm led across passage into parlour linda said not word a be being thus conducted be thinking whether might not even yet serve purpose to be silent sullen be still sobbing striving to repress sob allowed to be led without resistance in instant door be closed be seated on old sofa with aunt beside have seen herr molk demanded madame staubach yes have seen what have said to then linda be silent told that must seek counsel that must act a might advise did not say that linda did not promise made promise linda surely did promise when asked whether must do a might bid said that must be ruled by then knowing that be wise of repute in city let go linda be not so linda must not remember what word have in truth be spoken between did remember that in anxiety to go forth thinking to be impossible that burgomaster must ask to marry man old enough to be father have in way assented to aunt proposition yet thought that have made definite promise that must marry man hated did not believe that must absolutely have promised that under possible circumstance must do so must not however answer aunt question so continued to sob endeavoured again to hide face did tell man everything child demanded madame staubach yes did what have said to know know linda can not be true be not yet hour since know what herr molk said to did tell of wish about friend peter yes did did tell of foolish fancy for wicked young man yes did what did say linda be still silent be almost impossible for to tell aunt what man have said to must not bring to tell story of what have passed in panelled room have madame staubach be in way different from what be have be at le stubborn le hard le reliant on efficacy of religious conviction to carry over obstacle must have understood something of suffering of poor girl with whom be dealing with only idea present to mind be absolute necessity of saving linda from wrath to come by breaking spirit in regard to thing of world crushing into atom here that atom might be remoulded in form must be capable of future better life instead therefore of shrinking from cruelty madame staubach be continually instigating to be cruel knew that image of town clerk be one simply disgusting to linda therefore be determined to force image upon knew that girl heart be set upon ludovic valcarm with warmth of young love therefore conceived to be duty to prove to girl ludovic valcarm be one already given up to satan satanic agency linda must be taught not only to acknowledge in very fact to understand perceive that world be vale of tear that path be sharp to foot that who walk through must walk in mourning tribulation what though young heart must be broken by lesson be broken after fashion in human heart be made to suffer to madame staubach mind broken heart contrite spirit be pretty much same thing be good that heart must be broken that inner humanity of living being must be a be crushed on wheel ground into fragment so that nothing must be left capable of receiving pleasure from delight of world such according to theory of life be treatment to young woman must be subjected system needed for men might probably be different be necessary that must go forth work madame staubach conceived to be possible that work of world must not be adequately done by men who have be subjected to crushing process be requisite for woman therefore be that admitted peter steinmarc to confidence a worthy friend though peter be by mean man enfranchised from thrall of earth of young woman there be one with whom must herself deal in regard to one madame staubach be resolved that softness of heart must deter from duty linda said after pausing for while desire to know from what herr molk have said to then there be short period of silence linda did sanction love for ludovic valcarm said linda sullenly must think not indeed linda did bid be rebellious in other matter linda paused again before answered be for moment then replied in same voice did tell that have better take peter steinmarc for husband linda must not bring to answer sat beating floor with foot with face turned away eye fixed upon wall be no longer sobbing now be hardening against aunt be resolving that must be castaway that must have nothing more to do with godliness even with decency have found godliness decency too heavy to be borne in life have not that moment in ludovic have held tight bound by arm round waist be happiest have not be to one single morsel of real bliss be thinking now whether must fly round upon aunt astonish tyrant by declaration of principle must be altogether new then came question again in same hard voice did not tell that have better take peter steinmarc for husband wo take peter steinmarc for husband said linda did in part effect that flying round of have be thinking wo take peter steinmarc for husband let man say what may how can marry if hate be beast then madame staubach groaned linda have often heard groan have never known to groan a groaned now be very deep very low prolonged with cadence caused linda to tremble in limb linda understood thoroughly be a though aunt have be told by angel that satan be coming to house in person that day linda did that reader also must do gave to aunt full credit for pure sincerity in feeling madame staubach did believe that satan be coming for niece if not actually come be close at hand if not arrived crushing if done at must be done instantly so that satan must find spirit so broken torn to paltry fragment a not to be worth acceptance stretched forth hand took hold of niece linda said do ever think of bourne to wicked one go who be wicked a now be wicked can not help said linda did not bid take man for husband will not do bidding then must kill do not know that love ludovic better than world be in prison will cease to love for reason came to once up stair at night when be sitting here with beast swore to then must never love man must never marry anybody else came to once up stair at night to own chamber yes did may know about if please may know everything want anything to be secret came to when have arm round told be own own own how can be wife of man after madame staubach be so truly horrified by what have first heard be so astonished that omitted even to groan valcarm have be with wretched girl up in own chamber hardly even now believed that seemed to that be called upon to believe having never a yet for moment doubted real purity of niece even when be most vehemently denouncing a reprobate castaway child of satan reader will know to what extent linda have be imprudent to what extent have sinned madame staubach did not know have nothing to guide word of poor girl who have be so driven to desperation by misery enveloped that almost wished to be taken for worse than be in order that might escape terrible doom from saw other mean of escape nobody be true must have forced to marry peter steinmarc there be law custom in nuremberg must have assisted aunt peter even much esteemed venerable herr molk in compelling to submit to such nuptials be free to exercise own choice if only have have strength to assert freedom youth rebel so often against authority wisdom of age be also subject to much tyranny from age linda did not know strength of own position have not learned to recognise fact of own individuality feared power of aunt over through aunt power of man whom hated feared now provoked authority of herr molk who have be with weak a child be weak counselling to submit to suitor unfitted for because man who loved be also unfit moreover linda though be now willing in desperation to cast aside religious scruple of own still feared with aunt be armed unless did something at least said something to separate entirely from aunt terrible domestic tyrant must overcome by fear of denunciation must terrify soul even though have dared to declare to herself that in stress of misery must throw overboard consideration of soul welfare though intended no longer to live in accordance with religious belief feared what religion must say to dreaded to very marrow of bone threat of god anger of satan power with aunt must harass if only must rid of therefore though perceived that story have told of have filled aunt mind with horrible false suspicion said nothing to correct error therefore said nothing further though aunt sat looking at with open mouth eye full of terror hand clasped pale cheek in house in very house said madame staubach not knowing what might best become to say in such strait a house be a much mine a yours said linda sullenly too in saying have not known what meant to say what ought to have said aunt have alluded to house there seemed to in distress to be something in on must hang word for while aunt sat in silence looking at linda then fell upon knee with hand clasped to heaven what be matter of prayer may not here venture to surmise such a be be sincere then arose went slowly a far a door returned before have reached threshold wretched child said yes have made wretched said linda listen to linda if so much grace be left to after what have told can not suppose that hope of happiness comfort in world be over for for wish be dead said linda have thought of what will come after death oh child repentance be still possible to with repentance there will come at length grace salvation mary magdalene be blessed be specially blessed among woman pshaw said linda indignantly what have to do with mary magdalene reality of position then came upon not fact of position have for moment almost endeavoured to simulate do not hate for what have done hate peter steinmarc hate herr molk if be so cruel to will hate have done nothing wrong must not help if came up stair came because loved because must not let come in proper way nobody else love must do anything for now have thrown into prison case be so singular in bearing that madame staubach must make nothing of linda seemed to have confessed iniquity yet after confession spoke of herself a though be injured person of herself lover a though be ill used according to madame staubach own idea linda ought now to have be in dust dissolved in tear wiping floor with hair utterly subdued in spirit hating a vilest of god creature there be not even outward sign of contrition then in midst of real tragedy tetchen brought in dinner two woman sat down together of spoke word linda did eat something morsel two madame staubach must not touch food on table then tetchen be summoned to take away unused plate tetchen when saw how have be said nothing looked from face of one to face of other have heard about scamp ludovic said tetchen to herself a carried dish back into kitchen have be late when dinner have be brought to dusk of evening came upon a soon a tetchen clatter with crockery be done madame staubach sat in accustomed chair with eye closed hand clasped on lap before stranger might have thought that be asleep linda knew that aunt be not sleeping also sat silent till thought that time be drawing near at steinmarc might probably enter parlour then arose to go must not leave aunt without word aunt charlotte said be ill very ill head be throbbing will go to bed madame staubach merely shook head shook hand remained silent with eye still closed have not even yet resolved upon word with must be expedient that must address niece then linda left room went to own apartment madame staubach when be alone sobbed cried kneeled prayed walked length breadth of room in agony of despair doubt also be in want of counsellor to whom must go in present misery there be such counsellor seemed to to be impossible that must confide everything to peter steinmarc yet be no more than honest that peter must be told before be allowed to continue courtship even now though have seen linda misery madame staubach thought that marriage have be so anxious to arrange must be safest way out of trouble if only peter might be brought to consent to after hearing truth fancied that trait in peter character appearance demeanour be so revolting to linda must be additional mean of bringing linda back from slough of despond if only marriage might still be possible crushing must be more severe than have hitherto be intended weight imposed must be heavier human atom smaller more like dust while be meditating on there came usual knock at door steinmarc entered room greeted a be wont with word two sat down lighted pipe observant man might have known even from sound of breathing that something have stirred madame staubach more than usual peter be not observant man having something on own mind paid little attention to widow at last having finished first pipe filled again spoke madame staubach said have be thinking about linda tressel so have peter said madame staubach yes of course be natural be niece have interest in common what interest peter ah wish have of course be all right that must say nothing about madame staubach like to be made fool of particularly object to be made fool of if linda be to become wife there be not time to be lost then peter recommenced smoking of new lighted pipe with great vigour madame staubach at moment became martyr to great scruple be duty be not duty to tell peter at moment that have heard to day rather thought that be duty to do so yet be restrained by feeling of feminine honour from disgracing niece by feeling of feminine honour for afterwards did penance with many inward flagellation of spirit must not be too hard upon peter said madame staubach with trembling voice be very well saying think that be man to be hard upon one fact be that young woman have got lover be thing of approve approve of at madame staubach person who stand very high indeed in city indeed may say that none in nuremberg stand higher have asked to day whether be engaged to marry linda tressel what answer be to make when be so asked madame staubach one of leading burgomaster be good enough to say that hoped be so for young woman sake madame staubach little a knew of world of nuremberg be well aware who be burgomaster be very well friend if be so that linda will not renounce lover who by by be at moment locked up in prison so that can not do harm just now why then in case madame staubach must renounce having uttered terrible word peter steinmarc smoked away again with fury fortnight ago have peter steinmarc ventured to speak to in strain madame staubach must have answered with feminine pride must have told that niece be not suppliant for hand did not dare to do now be at fault a to fact did not know what personage of nuremberg might be saying in respect to linda be to quarrel altogether with steinmarc thought that there must be left to mean of bringing upon linda that salutary crushing alone might be efficacious for salvation be therefore compelled to temporise let peter be silent for week at end of week let speak again if thing must not then be arranged to satisfaction linda must be regarded a altogether castaway very well madame staubach then will ask for last time day week in coarsest sackcloth with bitterest ash did madame staubach on night do spiritual penance for own sin for of linda tressel week have nearly passed to duration of peter steinmarc have assented at end of be to be settled whether linda must renounce ludovic valcarm peter must renounce linda with manly propriety omitted spoken allusion to subject during smoking visit still paid on alternate day to parlour of madame staubach though said nothing look feature motion of limb be eloquent of importance dignity during period of waiting must salute madame staubach when entered chamber with majesty of demeanour have not before affected must say few word on subject of public interest such a weather price of butter adulteration of city beer in false note in tone did not belong to in truth disgusted madame staubach who be sincere in thing madame staubach though be disgusted did not change mind abandon purpose linda be to be made to marry peter steinmarc not because be pleasant man because discipline must be for good of soul madame staubach therefore listened said little nothing when peter on certain thursday evening remarked a be leaving parlour that week must be over on following morning that must do honour of asking for fraulein decision on return from town hall at five pm on morrow apologising at same time for fact that must then be driven to intrude on irregular day madame staubach merely answered by assenting motion of head by utterance of usual benison god in mercy be with peter steinmarc with too madame staubach then peter marched forth with great dignity holding pipe a high a shoulder linda tressel have kept bed during nearly whole week have in truth be very ill hitherto have be aunt scheme of life to intermit in slight degree acerbity of usual demeanour in period of illness at such time must be very constant with reading of good book by bedside with much ghostly advice to sufferer must not take amiss if patient succumbed to sleep while be thus employed believing sleep to be pardonable at such time of bodily weakness perhaps salutary must be softer in general manner must sometimes descend to saying of tender little word must administer thing agreeable to palate might at same time be profitable to health so thus there have be moment in linda have felt that must be comfortable to be always ill now during whole of week madame staubach have be very doubtful a to conduct at first have seemed to that tenderness must be misplaced in circumstance so terrible till there have be actual resolution of repentance till spirit have be made to pas seven time through fire till heart have lost human cord fibre gradually that before second day have elapsed there came upon conviction that have in way mistaken meaning of linda word that matter be not a have supposed did not now in least doubt linda truth be convinced that linda have intentionally told falsehood that must tell none there be question must not ask must not ask at rate except by slow degree something however learned from tetchen something from linda thus there came upon conviction that there might be frightful story to tell to peter that in probability there be such story to be told what believed at time be in fact about truth if be a believed then be more incumbent on to see that marriage did not slip through finger became very busy in eagerness went to herr molk herr molk have learned something further about ludovic promised that must come down see child must see child ill a be in bed perhaps say word two might assist madame staubach found that burgomaster be quite prepared to advocate steinmarc marriage being instigated thereto apparently by civic horror at valcarm crime must shake head swing whole body blow out breath from behind cheek knitting eyebrow assuming look of terror when be suggested to that daughter of old friend undoubted owner of house in nuremberg be anxious to give herself property to ludovic valcarm madame staubach must be must not be dear madame rebel traitor know what young man have done must be confiscated confiscated dear dear only to think of josef tressel daughter let marry peter steinmarc good man very good man followed father know doe work very well city be not what used to be madame staubach still peter doe work very well then herr molk promised to come down to red house did come down madame staubach must not trust everything to herr molk be necessary that must do much before came much probably after went a conception of true state of thing became strong a be convinced also that linda be really far from well manner became kinder assumed that sickbed tenderness admitted of sleep during reading of sermon be essential that must not forget work for hour gradually linda be taught to understand on day steinmarc be to demand answer when linda attempted to explain that answer have be already given must not be altered aunt interrupted declaring that nothing need be said at present moment so that question remained open question linda understood that be so regarded then madame staubach spoke of ludovic valcarm putting up hand with dismay declaring what horrid thing herr molk have told of be at moment that linda be told that be to be visited in day two by burgomaster linda endeavoured to explain that though might be necessary to give up ludovic not saying that must give up still be not on account necessary also that must marry peter steinmarc madame staubach shook head implied that necessity did exist thing have be said thing have be done herr molk be decidedly of opinion that marriage must be solemnised without delay linda of course did not submit to in silence gradually became more more silent a aunt continued in low tone to drone forth wish conviction at last linda must almost sleep while salutary position of peter steinmarc wife be being explained to reader must understand that be in truth ill prostrated by misery doubt agitation weak from effect of illness in condition herr molk paid visit to spoke in first place of civil honour have inherited from respected father of that owed to nuremberg on account then spoke also of other inheritance red house explaining to that be duty a citizen to see that must not be placed by in evil hand after that took up subject of peter steinmarc merit according to herr molk a now drew picture peter be little short of municipal demigod prudent be confidential man deep in city trust with money laid out at interest strong healthy be indeed lusty for age if herr molk spoke truth poor linda gave little kick beneath clothes when be said spoke word of reply then peter be man not given to scolding of equal temper who knew place must not interfere with thing did not belong to herr molk produced catalogue of nuptial virtue endowed peter with when be completed came to last head of discourse last head most important ludovic valcarm be still in prison there be knowing what might be done to to be imprisoned for life in horrible place among rat seemed to be least of linda when heard gave one slight scream said nothing because herr molk be burgomaster need not on account believe word fell from mouth cruellest blow of be at end when ludovic be taken there have be young woman with what young woman said linda turning sharply upon burgomaster not young woman a young man ought to be seen with said herr molk what matter name said madame staubach who during whole discourse have be sitting silent by bedside believe word of said linda saw young woman in company dear have felt hat blue frock child know nothing of life of such young men a must not astonish if knew dozen young woman suppose that one a ever mean to be true be sure meant to be true to said linda t sh t sh t sh dear child know world how must if want to marry husband who will remain at home live discreetly be true to must take such man a peter steinmarc of course must said madame staubach one a ludovic valcarm must only waste property drag into gutter more more said madame staubach will think better of madame staubach will not be so foolish so wicked a said burgomaster may lord in mercy give light to see right way said madame staubach then herr molk took departure with madame staubach at heel linda be left to own consideration first assertion to herself be that did not believe word of knew what sort of man must love a husband without having herr molk to come teach must not love peter steinmarc let be ever so much respected in nuremberg a to what herr molk said that owed to city be nothing to city did not care for for city if wished to take house from let do be quite sure that ludovic valcarm have not loved because be owner of paltry old house a to ludovic being in prison deeper be dungeon more true behoved to be to if be among rat must willingly be there also when tried to settle in thought matter of young woman with felt hat blue frock then mind became more doubtful knew well enough that herr molk be wrong in picture drew of peter be not so sure that be wrong in other picture about ludovic there be something very grand that have gratified spirit amazingly in manner in lover have disappeared among rafter at same time acknowledged to herself that there be much in be dangerous young man who can disappear among rafter so quickly must have have much experience knew that ludovic be wild very wild wild young men make good husband to have have arm once round waist be to almost joy for ever have nearly come to believe that if be to have arm often round waist must become castaway then to be castaway sharing treasure with who be blue frocked woman with felt hat who seemed to have be willing to do so much more for ludovic than have done who have gone with into danger be sharing with peril though made great fight against wisdom of herr molk when be first left to herself word of burgomaster have effect enemy be becoming too strong for heart be weak within have eaten little nothing for last few day blood be running thinly through vein be more difficult to reply to tenderness from aunt than to harshness there came upon feeling after signified little there be choice between one misery only really good thing must be to die to have done with to die before have utterly thrown away hope chance of happiness in future world in thoroughly believed be ill now if might be that illness must bring to death must bring slowly so that might yet repent must be right madame staubach said nothing more to about peter till morning of day on peter be to come for answer little before noon madame staubach brought to niece weak broth a have done once before on that morning linda who be sick faint at heart must not take try dear said madame staubach can not try said linda wish particularly to speak to now at once will give strength to listen to linda declined to

almost a own oh linda will pray for in vain sank upon knee a spoke prayed with might that god must turn heart of child so even yet might be rescued from burning with arm extended loud voice dishevelled hair streaming tear shrieking to heaven in agony now again kissing hand of poor sinner besought lord god that must give to thing for asked that thing prayed for with such agony of earnestness be consent from linda to marry peter steinmarc be very strange woman be a sincere in prayer a be faith must have cut with knife have swallowed ash whole must have believed that by doing so must have be nearer object have end of own in view peter a master of house must be thorn in own side have learned to believe thorn in side of woman be thought good for be necessary to linda that must be stuck full of thorn so that base human desire might a be fall from bone perish out of way once twice thrice linda besought aunt to arise half frantic woman have said to herself that must remain on knee on hard board till thing be granted to have not be said by lip must not lie that faith must move mountain must not faith real faith do for smaller thing then there came question to mind whether

woman be so closely muffled so fast asleep that linda throughout whole morning did not know whether fellow traveller be young old nevertheless presence of woman be in sort comfort to there be two men in carriage little boy hardly understood why felt that be better for to have fellow traveller of however spoke above word two to to lover at first sat at little distance from ludovic rather induced to allow that there must be space between gradually suffered to come closer to dozed with head upon shoulder very little be said between whispered to from time to time sundry little word of love calling queen own one life joy of eye told little nothing of future plan a must have wished that must do asked however question none at least till journey be nearly over more that conduct warranted want of trust more unwilling did become to express diffidence suspicion after while became very cold so cold that now became for moment greatest cause of suffering be mid winter though cloak have brought be warmest garment that possessed be very insufficient for such work a present night have brought upon besides cloak have nothing wherewith to wrap foot became like ice then chill crept up body though clung very close to lover must not keep from shivering a though in ague fit have hesitation now in striving to obtain warmth by close proximity seemed to a though cold must kill before must reach augsburg train must not be due there till nine in morning be still dark night a thought that must be impossible for to sustain such agony of pain much longer be still dark night violent rain be pattering against glass damp came in through crevice wind blew bitterly upon then a turned little to ask lover to find comfort for mitigation of pain perceived that be asleep then tear began to run down cheek told that must be well if must die after what did know of man who be now sleeping by side man to whom have intrusted everything more than happiness very soul how many word have ever spoken to what assurance have even of heart why be asleep while suffering be so very cruel to have encountered evil of elopement to escape what have appeared to greater evil of detested marriage steinmarc be very much to be hated might not be that even must have be better than poor girl illusion even of love be being frozen cold within during agony of morning while train went thundering on through night now rushing into tunnel now crossing river at change in sound of carriage almost hoped that something might be amiss oh cold have gathered foot up be trying to sit on for moment two have hoped that movement must waken ludovic so that might have have comfort of word have only tumbled with head hither thither have finally settled in position in leaned heavily upon thought that be heartless to sleep while be suffering forgot that have watched at window while have slumbered upon sack in warehouse at length however must bear weight no longer be forced to rouse be so heavy said can not bear when at last succeeded in inducing to sit upright dear oh ah yes how cold be think have be asleep cold be killing said poor darling what will do let see where do feel most over do not feel how shiver oh ludovic must get out at next station impossible linda what must do there what will do at augsburg oh dear wish have not come be so cold be killing then burst out into flood of sobbing so that old man opposite to be aroused old man have brandy in basket made drink little then after while be quieted be taken by station after station without demanding of ludovic that must bring weary journey to end gradually day dawned two must look at other in grey light of morning linda thought of own appearance rather than of lover have be taught that be required of woman that must be neat felt now that be dirty foul inside out thing to be scorned a companion also bestirred in daylight be afraid to meet eye strove to conceal face sack in warehouse have in lieu of better bed be acceptable be aware now a must see skirt of own dress shoe a glanced eye gradually round upon shoulder that stain of place be upon knew to be unclean that sense of killing cold have passed off from having grown to numbness did not amount to present pain though must hardly leave without return of agony misery of disreputable appearance be almost a bad to a cold have be be not only that be untidy dishevelled be that condition must have be such without company of elder female friend whose presence must have said young woman be respectable even though dress be soiled with dust meal a be friend by side be one who by very appearance must condemn one must suppose to be wife then worst of be that also must judge a others judged also must say to that one must suppose woman to be wife if once must learn so to think of how must expect that must ever persuade to become husband how wished that have remained beneath aunt roof now occurred to a though for first time that one must have forced to go to church on thirtieth of january become peter steinmarc wife why have not remained at home simply told aunt that thing be impossible at last be within hour of augsburg even yet knew nothing a to future plan be very odd that must not have told what be to do at augsburg said that must be queen that must be a happy a day be long that everything must be right a soon a reached augsburg now be at augsburg did not a yet know what first step be to take when reached town have much wished that must speak without being questioned at last thought that be bound to question ludovic where be going to at augsburg to black bear first will be best at first be inn yes dear not great big house like rothe ross at nuremberg very quiet retired in back street do expect well not exactly wo matter how long will stay there ah that must depend on tidings from berlin munich may be that will be compelled to get away from bavaria altogether then paused for moment while be thinking what other question must ask by by said father be in augsburg have heard of father a man altogether worthless one ever in difficulty who must never work who have never seemed to wish to be respectable when great sin of ludovic father have be magnified to by madame staubach by peter with certain wise hint swan never came out of egg of goose linda must declare with pride of spirit that son be not like father that son have never be known to be idle have not attempted to defend father of whom seemed to be acknowledged by common consent of nuremberg that be utterly worthless disgrace to city have produced linda now felt very thankful for assurance of even presence have be be mother how much better must have be that must be received even by father by father be much to in desolate condition will be at station linda asked oh no doe expect well see linda only got out of prison yesterday morning doe father live in augsburg hardly life anywhere go come at present a be wanted by cause be quite on card that must find that police have nabbed hope not think not when have seen made comfortable when have have something to eat drink will know where to seek while be doing so have better lie down be afraid to ask whether father knew must suspect aught a to bringing companion whether old man must welcome such companion for son indeed hardly knew how to frame question have application to herself merely assented to proposition that must go to bed at black bear then waited for end of journey early in morning fellow passenger have left be now alone ludovic distressed more by vehemence of caress also be tired fagged cold jaded be not improbable that have be meditating whether in present walk of life have done well to encumber with burden of young woman at last be at platform at augsburg move quite yet said one have to be little careful when attempted to raise found to be so numb that quickness of motion be out of question ludovic paying attention to sat back in carriage with cap before face looking with eager eye over cap on to platform may not go now said linda when saw that other passenger have alighted be in hurry girl by god there be ruffian gendarmerie be up by jove yes be up be hard after did at nuremberg ludovic look here linda get out at once take letter make way to black bear wait for never mind do a be told in moment will be too late if be noticed to be together will be too late how be to get to black bear heaven earth have tongue here be be up so be railway porter opened door behind railway porter be two policeman linda in dismay have not even taken paper have be offered to valcarm a soon a be sure that police be upon have stuffed down receptacle made in door for fall of window fate of valcarm of paper be at present moment not of so much moment to a be that of linda tressel valcarm be carried off with without paper after hurried word be unintelligible to in dismay found upon platform amidst porter message have come from nuremberg by wire to augsburg requiring arrest of ludovic valcarm wire have said nothing of companion might be with therefore linda be left standing amidst porter on platform asked one of men about black bear shook head told that be house of very bad sort of very bad sort indeed chapter xii dozen time during night linda have remembered that old friend fanny heisse now wife of max bogen lived at augsburg a remembered have asked what must do be to meet fanny in street must fanny condescend to speak to must fanny husband allow wife to hold communion with castaway how might dare to hope that old friend must do other than shun at very least scorn pas a thing unseen yet through day of life there have be in linda world supposition that linda be good young woman that fanny heisse be if not castaway one who have made frivolity of world so dear to that must be accounted a little better than castaway linda conclusion a thought of have be that must be better that must keep out of way of wife of honest man who knew fellowship hereafter with wife daughter of honest men must be denied to have felt very strongly when have first seen in dawn of morning now there have fallen upon trouble of kind almost crushed in be not a yet able to see that by god mercy salvation from utter ruin might yet be extended to what must do now now at moment black bear to lover have directed be so spoken of did not dare to ask to be directed thither when compassionate railway porter pressed to say whither must go must only totter to seat against wall there lay down sob have friend said home protector except who have just be carried away to prison porter asked whether man be husband then again be nearly choked with sob even manner of porter be changed to when perceived that be not wife of who have be companion handed over to old woman who looked after station old woman at last learned from linda fact that wife of max bogen lawyer have once be friend about two hour after be seated with max bogen in small close carriage be being taken home to lawyer house max bogen asked hardly question only said that fanny must be so glad to have fanny said be so soft so good so clever so wise always knew exactly what ought to be done linda heard marvelling in dumb half consciousness be fanny heisse of whom aunt have so often told that one so given to vanity of world must never come to good max bogen handed linda over to wife then disappeared oh linda what be why be here dear linda then old friend kissed within hour whole story have be told do mean that eloped with from aunt house in middle of night asked max a soon a be alone with wife of course did said fanny so must have be treated a have be have be fault of wicked old saint aunt then put head together a to step must be taken fanny proposed that letter must be at once sent to madame staubach explaining plainly that linda have run away from marriage with steinmarc stating for present be safe comfortable with old friend must hardly be said that linda assented to because accepted be done for a child might accept knelt upon floor with head upon friend lap kissing fanny hand striving to murmur thanks oh if must leave there for three day so that might recover something of strength will leave for three week linda said other madame staubach be not emperor that be to have own way in everything a for peter pray talk of pray said linda shuddering comfort be at end about seven o'clock on evening second train in day from nuremberg be due at augsburg at six max bogen though said nothing on subject to linda have thought probable that messenger from former town might arrive in quest of linda by train at seven there came little carriage up to door before name must be announced madame staubach be standing in fanny bogen parlour oh child said oh child may god in mercy forgive child linda cowered in corner of sofa did not speak have done anything in least wrong said fanny nothing on earth be going to make marry man hated so came away if father have done same to must have stayed hour linda still cowered on sofa be still speechless madame staubach when heard defence of niece be hardly pushed to know in what way be duty to answer must be very expedient of course that story must be told for linda might save from ill report of world that excuse must be made might now instantly remove from linda name blight must make otherwise to be thing scorned defamed useless hideous truth be truth even to save child from infamy madame staubach must not listen to lie without refuting punishment of linda infamy have be deserved be right that must be endured hereafter a fact came to disclose must be for peter steinmarc to say whether must take such woman for wife whether took whether rejected must not be well that linda must be screened by lie from part of punishment have deserved let go seven time seven through fire if by such suffering there might yet be chance for poor desolate half withered soul done nothing wrong fanny heisse said madame staubach who in spite of great fatigue be still standing in middle of room do say so who have become wife of honest god fearing man fanny be determined that must not be put down in own house by madame staubach doe matter whose wife be said be sure max will say same a do have done anything wrong made up mind to come away because must marry peter steinmarc came here in company with own young man a used to come with max a soon a got here sent word up to here be if there be anything very wicked in be not religious enough to understand tell can understand madame staubach there be nothing on earth so horribly wicked a trying to make girl marry man whom loathes hate detests abominates there madame staubach be what have got to say now hope will stop have supper with max linda linda felt to be blushing in darkness of corner a heard excuse for conduct have not made journey to augsburg with ludovic in such fashion a fanny have perhaps more than once travelled same route with present husband fanny have not come by night without father knowledge have not escaped out of window have fanny come with such purpose a have be hers there be salve to conscience in though felt very grateful to friend who be fighting battle for be not right must argue matter with said madame staubach with touch of true dignity ala know that know perhaps will allow to say word in privacy to unfortunate child max bogen have not paid wife false compliment for cleverness perceived at once that longer interview between aunt niece must be delayed longer that must be delayed now that be in other company lighter must be storm on linda head when did come after supper madame staubach linda want supper pet linda answered nothing must not even look up so a to meet glance of aunt eye fanny bogen succeeded in arranging thing after own fashion must not leave room though in presence at preparation of supper might have be useful came to be understood that madame staubach be to sleep at lawyer house great change be made in order that aunt niece might not be put in same room early in morning be to return together to nuremberg then linda short hour of comfort must be over have hardly a yet spoken word to aunt when fanny left in carriage together there be three four others there said fanny to husband wo have much said to before get home when be at home fanny only shrugged shoulder truth be know said max that be not at proper sort of thing to do who doe proper sort of thing do dear must have run away with if father have wanted to marry nasty old fellow who care for nothing pipe beer if have 'd never have spoken to again

chamber linda said madame staubach who followed linda did a be bid went in stood by side of aunt bed kneel down with linda let pray that great gift of repentance may be given to said madame staubach then linda knelt down hid face upon counterpane sin be recapitulated to during prayer whole heinousness of thing have done be given in full detail detail be repeated more than once be acknowledged in prayer that though god grace might effect absolute pardon in world to come deed a have be done by young woman be beyond pale of pardon in world giver of mercy be specially asked so to make thing clear to poor sinful creature that might not be deluded into idea that thing have done must be justified be told in prayer that be impure vile unclean infamous yet probably did not suffer from prayer half so much a must have suffered have same thing be said to face to face across table recognised truth of prayer be thankful that allusion be made in to peter steinmarc endeavoured to acknowledge that conduct be that aunt represented to be in strong language when prayer be over madame staubach stood before linda for while put two hand on girl arm lightly kissed brow linda said with lord nothing be impossible with lord be never too late with lord punishment need never be unto death linda though must utter articulate word acknowledged to herself that aunt have be good to almost forgot evil thing that aunt have worked for chapter xiii linda tressel before have gone to bed on night have passed at augsburg have written short note be to be delivered if such delivery must be possible to ludovic valcarm condition of lover have of course be added trouble to be more especially own during last three four hour have passed with in train tenderness for have be numbed by own suffering have allowed for while to think that be not sufficiently alive to great sacrifice be making on behalf when be removed from have be taken a well knew to prison of city something of softness of love returned to tried to persuade that owed to that duty wife must owe when spoke to fanny on subject declared that even if be possible to must not go back to ludovic see differently now said see how bad be still though declared that be very firm in resolve did not like to be carried back to old home without doing something making attempt might be at least token to herself that have not be heartless in regard to lover wrote therefore with much difficulty following few word fanny promised that husband must endeavour to convey to hand of ludovic valcarm dear ludovic aunt have come here for take back to nuremberg to morrow when left at station be too ill to go to place told so sent to house dear dear friend fanny heisse got husband to come for be in house now then aunt came will take home to morrow be so unhappy that must be in trouble hope that coming with did not help to bring about a for know be best must go back though think that will kill be very wicked to come feel that now know that even will have ceased to respect dear ludovic hope that god will forgive will be better that must never meet again though thought that must be so be almost more than can bear have always felt be different from other girl that there never must be happiness for in world god bless ludovic think of sometimes never never try to come for again l t have cost hour of hard toil to write little letter when be written felt that be cold ungrateful unloving very unlike word must feel that have right to expect from nevertheless such a be gave to friend fanny with many injunction that might if possible be placed in hand of ludovic thus a told repeatedly on way home romance of life be over after journey to augsburg must have be serviceable to must be serviceable although character must be infamous for ever in town knew if by journey must be saved from further mention of name of peter steinmarc disgrace must be so bad a prospect of marriage therefore a journeyed homeward sitting opposite to aunt endeavoured to console by reflecting that suit to must surely be at end must ever reach dull heart that have consented to destroy own character to undergo ill repute scorn of honest people in order that might not be forced into horror of marriage with must be made to understand in flight from nuremberg great motive have be to fly from on second morning after return even consolation be taken from learned from aunt that have not given up hope in direction of town clerk on first day after return not word be said to linda about peter must have have notice of presence in house have not heard shoe creaking up down stair be name of ludovic valcarm so much a mentioned in presence between tetchen there be not word passed unless such a be spoken in presence of madame staubach linda found that be hardly allowed to be for moment out of aunt presence at time be unable not to be submissive seemed to that aunt be so good to in not positively upbraiding from morning to night that be impossible for not to be altogether obedient in thing did not therefore even struggle to escape long reading longer prayer austere severity of aunt presence except in prayer in prayer delivered out loud by aunt in niece presence direct mention be made of great iniquity of linda have be guilty linda be called no heartrending name to face be required to join did join over over again in petition to throne of mercy that poor castaway might be received back again into pale of who be accepted at time must have be content to continue to live like to join in such prayer day after day to have own infamy continually brought forward a needing special mercy if by such mean might be allowed to live in tranquillity without sight mention of peter steinmarc such tranquillity be not to be hers on afternoon of second day aunt went out leaving linda alone in house with tetchen linda at once went to chamber endeavoured to make busy among possession of own have so lately thought that be leaving for ever took out article of wardrobe little treasure opened sweet fold of modest raiment refolded weeping while a thought of wreck have made of be not who have made wreck have be ruined by cruelty of man whose step at moment heard beneath clenched fist pressed little foot against floor a thought of injury man have done there be not enough of charity in religion to induce even to think that must ever cease to hate with vigour of heart then tetchen came to told that aunt have returned desired to see linda instantly went down to parlour up to moment be a child in aunt hand sit down linda said madame staubach who have taken off bonnet be already stiffly seated in accustomed chair sit down dear while speak to linda sat down at distance from aunt awaited dumbly speech be to be made to linda continued madame staubach have be afternoon to house of friend herr molk linda said nothing out loud declared to herself that herr molk be friend of hers friend indeed herr molk have shown to be one of bitterest enemy thought best to see after what have be done especially a have be with when be ill before went still linda said nothing what be there that must possibly say madame staubach paused not expecting niece to speak collecting own thought arranging word peter steinmarc be there also said madame staubach upon hearing linda heart sank within have suffering then be for nothing have passed that terrible night terrible day with result might be useful to even yet might there not be hope be not possible that aunt be about to communicate to fact that peter steinmarc declined to be bound by engagement to sighed deeply almost sobbed a clasped hand together aunt observed then went on with speech will hope have understood linda have not wished to upbraid have be very good aunt charlotte must know that have done be be be thing altogether destructive of young woman name character madame staubach voice a said be tremulous with excess of eagerness if be peter steinmarc decision linda must bear without complaint bowed head in token that accepted disgrace of aunt have spoken of course linda continued madame staubach recovery from so lamentable position be very difficult be almost impossible mean to say word of what have be done believe be believe herr molk peter also belief care what peter steinmarc belief exclaimed linda unable to hold peace longer linda linda must be thing to be shuddered at woman without name byword for shame for ever madame staubach have be interrupted in statement a to belief entertained in respect to linda journey by herself two colleague did not recur to special point in narrative when linda made answer to last appeal broadly stated conclusion to friend have come in consultation together in panelled chamber of herr molk house may a well make story short said herr molk have explained to peter that thing be not a bad a have seemed to be muscle fibre in linda body be convulsed when heard shuddered shivered so that must hardly keep seat upon chair peter have declared that will be satisfied if will at once agree that marriage will take place on thirtieth of month if will do will make promise that will go nowhere without sanction before day will forget have be done linda answered not word burst into tear fell at aunt foot madame staubach be woman who must bring to pardon sin have be committed be done a be accomplished hoping in charity that must be followed by repentance therefore have forgiven after fashion even last tremendous trespass of niece have be guilty have contented with forcing linda to listen to prayer repentance might be forthcoming must forgive fault conduct seemed to herself to be in slightest degree wrong while be in course of action have abstained from hard word against linda from rebuke since have found that young man be gone that niece be willing to return to home must be prepared to exercise power linda position have given to be a severe a austerity of nature must permit if girl must persist in obstinacy regarded a linda positive duty to submit to peter steinmarc a husband have be betrothed with linda own consent banns have be already once called have asked for god protection over a man wife then how much be there not due to peter who have consented not without much difficult persuasion from herr molk to take soiled flower to bosom in spite of darkness of stain there will be provoking difficulty made about house peter have said in corner to burgomaster then burgomaster have undertaken that in circumstance a now existed there must be provoking difficulty herr molk understood that linda must give up something on receiving position of honest man wife be now hardly entitled to expect thus bargain have be made madame staubach be of opinion that be first duty to see that must not be again endangered by obstinacy on behalf of linda obstinate indeed how must be obstinate after have done have now fallen at aunt foot be weeping sobbing praying for mercy madame staubach must have mercy on girl in position such mercy must in be sin sin done must forgive sin doing must be crushed put down burnt out extinguished let agony coming from such process be a severe a might be there must be softness for linda while linda be obstinate can not suppose said that mean to hesitate after have taken place oh aunt charlotte dear aunt charlotte what be meaning of love ca love will do anything else that please may have house if want will promise promise never to go away again to see anybody might a well have addressed such prayer to figure of stone on matter a madame staubach must not be other than relentless even while linda be kneeling at foot convulsed with sob told poor girl with severity of language must use of vileness of iniquity of night proceeding linda have be false to friend false to vow false to god immodest unclean have sinned against law by woman bind together for good conduct have in fact become castaway in very deed there be nothing that female must do more vile more loathsome than linda have done madame staubach believed that time have come in must be wicked to spare did not spare linda grovelled at foot must only pray god might take to at once will never take never never never said madame staubach satan will have for own prayer will be of avail there be two day such a linda be still alive still bore on third day be fifth after return from augsburg herr molk came to at own request be alone with did not vituperate a aunt have done did express special personal horror at sin insisted very plainly on position have made for see dear only thing for be to be married out of hand at once then nobody will say anything about what be difference if be little old girl forget to think about after month two then see will put end to trouble to trouble such be argument of herr molk must be acknowledged that such argument be not lacking in strength be altogether without truth little story of linda journey to augsburg have be told throughout city there be not wanting many who said that peter steinmarc must be very good natured man indeed if after have passed must still accept linda tressel a wife must remember of course dear said herr molk how be possible that linda must stand alone against such influence a have be brought to bear against be quite alone for must not admit of intimacy with tetchen must hardly speak to old woman be quite aware that tetchen have arranged with ludovic manner of elopement though felt anger with still be angry with servant whose duplicity have helped to bring about present misery have not fled with lover might then so thought now have held ground against aunt against peter a thing have gone with since such obstinacy have become impossible to on morning of seventh day bowed head though did not speak gave aunt to understand that have yielded will begin to purchase what may be necessary to morrow said madame staubach even now have not made up mind that must in truth marry man have simply found again impossible to say that must not do so there be still chance of escape might die for instance might run away again if did that surely man must persecute further at last moment might stolidly decline to move might refuse to stand on leg before altar might be a dead thing even though be alive a thing dead speechless oh if must only be without ear to hear terrible word aunt must say to then there came scheme into mind must make one great personal appeal to steinmarc feeling a man if implored not to make wife kneeling before submitting to preferring to with earnestness one great prayer surely must not persevere hitherto since return from augsburg peter have done very little to press own suit have again have hand placed in since have yielded have accepted a present from great glass brooch to eye be ugliest thing in guise of trinket world of vanity have ever seen have not be moment in company without aunt presence there have not be slightest allusion made by to elopement peter have considered that such allusion have better come after marriage when power must a thought be consolidated be surprised when be told early in morning after second hand pledging by linda herself that wanted to see linda came to door made request in person of course be delighted to welcome future bride to own apartment begged with a soft smile a must assume to seat in own arm chair took humbler seat however motioned to to take to be accustomed looked at a did so perceived that very nature of face be changed have lost plumpness of cheek have lost fresh colour of youth have lost much of prettiness eye be brighter than ever have be there be something in expression almost made peter uneasy though have lost so much of prettiness be not on account moved to doubt value of matrimonial prize there did come across mind idea that eye might perhaps bring with discomfort into household be very glad to see linda said be very good of to come to here be there anything can do for there be one thing peter steinmarc that can do for what be dear let alone a spoke clenched small fist brought down with energy on table be close to looked into face a did so eye quailed before glance then repeated demand let alone know what mean linda of course be going to be wife now wish to be wife know if be man will not force have intended to be gentle with to entreat to win by humility softness to take hand even kiss if must be good to there be so much of tragedy in heart earnestness of purpose in mind that must not be gentle a spoke seemed to that be threatening be settled linda can not be changed now can be changed must be changed tell be not good enough need not fear if will say so will never be angry with for word will bless for linda did nothing so very much amiss did then there came across mind idea that must lie to degrade with double disgrace hesitated be not actress enough to carry on part winked at a continued to speak know said be just foolish business worse than oh heaven how hated must have stabbed to heart moment have weapon be there have possessed physical energy necessary for such enterprise be thing to so foul that feminine nature recoiled from closeness of presence flesh crept a felt that same atmosphere encompassed man be to be husband must speak to speak out speak very plainly must be possible that man must wish to take woman to bosom who have told to face that be loathed peter said be sure that think that love see why must linda not least can promise that never will never think what must be to have wife who doe love bit must not that be bad oh will never know that love somebody else very dearly on hearing there came something of darkness upon peter brow something indicated that have be touched linda understood will never speak to again never see if will let alone see linda be in prison will be sent to quarry to work will never be free man again have have need not fear dear will fear yes will lead life peter steinmarc will make rue day first saw will wish that be at quarry will disgrace make name infamous will waste everything that have there be nothing so bad will not do to punish yes may look at will do think that be to trample under foot will not have revenge said be foolish business did will make worse than foolish stood with hand in pocket of broad flap looking at not knowing how to answer be coward not coward a to be intimidated at moment by girl violence being now thoroughly angry word have not worked upon a have intended that must work desire be to conquer get best of thought worked slowly did not know how to answer well what do say to if will let escape will always be friend will not let escape said expect that will be wife do expect will die first yes die first to be wife oh there be not beggar in street of nuremberg whom must not sooner take for husband paused again be at loss for word come peter think of drive poor weak girl to desperation have be very unhappy very know how unhappy have be make worse for then chord have be strung so tightly be broken asunder strength failed burst into tear will make pay dearly for one of day fraulein said peter a with hand still in pocket left room watched a creaked down stair went into aunt apartment for moment felt disposed to go confront there before aunt together two of must not force to marry courage failed though must face peter steinmarc without flinching feared word aunt must say to have not scrupled to threaten steinmarc with own disgrace must not endure to be told by aunt that be degraded chapter xiv peter steinmarc when went into madame staubach parlour found that lady on knee in prayer have entered room without notice having be urged to unwonted impetuosity by severity of provocation have received madame staubach raised head when saw did not rise stood there for second looking at expecting to get up greet when found that such be not purpose turned angrily on heel went out of house up to office in town hall service be not of much service to city on day on day on two following day be using mental faculty in endeavouring to decide what might be best for to do in present emergency red house be chattel of great value in thing very desirable possession of peter did desire with heart then even in regard to house be not to be arranged that peter be to become sole immediate possessor of on marriage madame staubach be to live there during life prize must be half half possession madame staubach be younger than though have once thought of marrying be not sure that be now desirous of living in same house with for remainder of life have wished to marry linda tressel because be young be acknowledged to be pretty girl still wished to marry if not now for reason still for others be quite a potent wanted to be master to get better of to punish for disdain of to bring to foot be not man so carried away by anger by spirit of revenge a to be altogether indifferent to own future happiness there have already be among fellow citizen perhaps citizenesses kind enough to compliment on good nature have be asked whether linda tressel have told about little trip to augsburg whether intended to ask cousin ludovic valcarm to come to wedding now linda have said thing to made doubt whether be fit to be wife of man so respectable so respected a be to do thing threatened where must be then town must laugh at must be reduced to live for remainder of day in sole company of madame staubach a result of enterprise be sufficiently desirous of being revenged on linda be cautious man began to think that might buy even pleasure too dear have be egged on to marriage by herr molk one two others of city pundit by very men whose opposition have feared when idea of marrying linda be first suggested to have told that linda be right that elopement have be in point of fact nothing young girl will be young before be settled herr molk have said then extreme desirability of red house have be mentioned so peter have be persuaded now a day drew near a linda word sounded in ear hardly knew what to think of on evening of third day of contemplation went again to friend herr molk nonsense peter said magistrate must go on now there be reason why must not be man of standing to be turned aside by few idle word from young girl told ca understand what told be be away with young fellow once said a much a that 'd go again pshaw have have to do with woman a have must

in kitchen asking question of tetchen tetchen did not answer with perfect truth when peter appeared among madame staubach said that vagabond ludovic valcarm have just be here in house went away minute since said madame staubach just so that be exactly what mean be thing not to be borne not to be endured show that niece linda be altogether beyond reach of good impression peter steinmarc yes be very well of course expect that will take part although with high idea of religion sort of thing be almost unaccountable that must do so a far a be concerned there must be end of be not going to make

steinmarc have misbehaved grossly have appeared at last interview in guise must not have made fascinating to young woman on account merit of submitting to must be so much greater there must hardly be moral sackcloth ash too coarse too bitter for correction of sinful mind in world for special correction of mind sinful a linda have be marriage with man a peter steinmarc must be sackcloth ash of most salutary kind objection linda must feel for man must be exact antidote to poison with have be infected by influence of evil one madame staubach acknowledged when be asked question that woman must love husband must always go on to describe required love a feeling must spring from dutiful submission be of opinion that virtuous child must love parent that virtuous servant must love mistress that virtuous woman must love husband even in spite of austere severity on part of who might be in authority when therefore linda must refer to what have taken place in parlour must ask whether be possible that must love man who have ill used so grossly madame staubach must reply a though love forgiveness be one same thing be be duty to pardon ill usage to kiss rod have smitten hate so deeply that blood
