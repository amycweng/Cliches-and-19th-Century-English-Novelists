day sincerely trust that baby be none worse for little accident in box now have prospect of week before at suez robinson have not be gone hour before began to feel must have be better off even at cairo secured bedroom at hoteli might have secured sixty bedroom have wanted themand then went out stood at front door gate be large house built round quadrangle looking with one front towards head of red sea with other into on sandy dead looking open square there stood for ten minute finding that be too hot to go forth returned to long cavernous room in have breakfasted in long cavernous room be destined to eat meal for next six day now at cairo must at rate see fellow creature at food so lit cigar began to wonder whether must survive week be now clear to that have done very rash thing in coming to suez with robinson somebody about place have asked name have told plainlygeorge walker never be ashamed of name yet never have cause to be believe at day will go a far in friday street a other man may be popular may not that depends mostly on circumstance be in trifling value of name depends on way in be known at bank have never dealt in tea spoon gravy spoon name will go a far a name george walker answered therefore in tone of little authority to man who asked who sat inside gate of hotel in old dressing gown slipper be melancholy day with twenty time before dinner did wish back at cairo have be travelling night therefore hoped that might get through little time in sleeping mosquito attacked moment laid down in other place mosquito torment only at night at suez buzz around without ceasing at hour scorching sun be blazing overhead absolutely forbade to leave house stood for while in verandah looking down at few small vessel be moored to quay there be life in not sail be set not boatman sailor be to be seen very water looked a though be hot must fancy glare of sun be cracking paint on gunwale of boat be only visitor in house during long hour of morning seemed a though servant have deserted dined at four not that chose that hour because choice be given to at hotel in egypt one have to dine at hour fixed by landlord entreaty will suffice to obtain meal at other so at four dined after dinner be again reduced to despair be sitting in cavernous chamber almost mad at prospect of week before when noise a of various foot in passage leading from quadrangle be possible that other human being be coming into hotelchristian human being at whom must look whose voice must hear whose word must understand with whom might possibly associate did not move however for be still hot knew that chance might be better if did not show over eager for companionship at first moment door however be soon opened saw that at least in one respect be destined to be disappointed stranger who be entering room be not christiansif might judge by nature of garment in be clothed door have be opened by man in old dressing gown slipper whom have seen sitting inside gate be arab porter of hotel a marwilled new visitor into room heard pronounce sound similar to own name perceived that pointed out to most prominent person of who then entered apartment be stout portly man dressed from head to foot in eastern costume of brightest colour wore not only red fez cap everybody wearseven have accustomed to fez capbut turban round of voluminous fold be snowy white face be fat not le grave lower part of be enveloped in magnificent beard projected round on side touched breast a walked be grand grizzled beard acknowledged at moment that added singular dignity to appearance of stranger flowing robe be of bright colour under garment fitted close round breast then descended becoming beneath sash pair of loosest pantaloonsi might perhaps better describe a bagswas rich tawny silk loose pantaloon be tied close round leg above ankle over pair of scrupulously white stocking on foot wore pair of yellow slipper be manifest to at glance that arab gentleman be got up in best raiment that expense have be spared on suit here can not make remark on personal bearing of arab whether be arab turk copt be always same be mean false cowardly race believe will bear blow respect man who give fear go further with than love between man man understand nothing of forbearance who doe not exact from that can exact be simply fool in estimation to extent of loses in be immeasurably inferior to who have have christian teaching in one thing beat always know how to maintain personal dignity look at friend partner judkins a stand with hand in trouser pocket at door of house in friday street what can be meaner than appearance be stumpy short podgy man then so also be arab friend at suez judkins be always dressed from head to foot in decent black cloth suit coat be ever dress coat be old shabby on head carry shining new silk hat such a fashion in metropolis demand judkins be rather dandy than otherwise piquing somewhat on apparel yet how mean be appearance a compared with appearance of arabhow mean also be gait how ignoble step judkins must buy that arab out four time over hardly feel loss yet be to enter room together judkins must know acknowledge by look that be inferior personage not le must personal quarrel arise between must judkins punch arab head ay reduce to utter ignominy at foot judkins must break heart in despair rather than not return blow whereas arab must put up with indignity of sort nevertheless judkins be altogether deficient in personal dignity often thought a hour hung in egypt whether might not be practicable to introduce oriental costume in friday street at moment a arab gentleman entered cavernous coffee room felt be greatly inferior personage be followed by four five others dressed somewhat a though by mean in such magnificent colour by one gentleman in coat trouser gentleman in coat trouser came last must see that be one of least of number a for felt almost overawed by dignity of stout party in turban seeing that came directly across room to place where be seated got upon leg made sign of christian obeisance be little man not podgy a be judkins flatter showed more deportment at rate than must have exhibited made a have said christian obeisance bobbed head be rubbing hand together while expressed opinion that be fine day if be civil a hope be arab be much more so advanced till be about six pace from then placed right hand open upon silken breastand inclining forward with whole body made to bow judkins never must accomplish turban flowing robe might be possible in friday street of what avail must be outer garment mere symbol if inner sentiment of personal dignity be wanting have often since tried when alone must never accomplish anything like bow arab with flowing robe bowed other arab bowed also after that christian gentleman with coat trouser made leg made leg also rubbing hand again added to former remark that be rather hot dat berry true said porter in dirty dressing gown who stood by must see at glance that manner of porter towards be greatly altered began to feel comforted in wretchedness perhaps christian from friday street with plenty of money in pocket must stand in higher esteem at suez than at cairo if so that alone must go far to atone for apparent wretchedness of place at cairo have not received that attention have certainly be due to a second partner in flourishing manchester house of grime walker judkins now a friend with beard again bowed to felt that deficiency be to be made up be clear however that new acquaintance though liked manner of must be attended with considerable inconvenience for arab gentleman commenced address to in french have always be to source of sorrow that parent did not teach french language deficiency on part have given rise to incredible amount of supercilious overbearing pretension on part of judkinswho after can hardly do more than translate correspondent letter believe that must have understood that arab oration at rate did not went on to end however speaking for three four minute then again bowed if must only have learned that bow might still have be greater than judkins with french be very sorry said dont exactly follow french language when be spoken ah french said arab in very broken english dat be one sorrow how be that fellow learn language under sun afterwards found that man must talk italian turkish armenian fluently say few word in german a must also in english must not ask for dinner in other language than english if be to save from starvation then called to christian gentleman in pantaloon a far a must understand made over to duty of interpreting between there seemed however to be one difficulty in way of being carried on with efficiency christian gentleman must not speak english knew of perhaps something more than did arab by mean enough to enable to have fluent conversation have interpreterwho turned out to be italian from trieste attached to austrian consulate at alexandriahad interpreter spoken english with greatest ease must have have considerable difficulty in understanding digesting in bearing proposition made to before proceed to proposition must describe ceremony took place previous to discussion have hardly observed when first procession entered room that one of friend followersmy friend name a learned afterwards be mahmoud al ackbar will therefore call one of mahmouds follower bore in arm bundle of long stick that carried iron pot tray such be case two follower came forward to perform service while having be literally pressed down on to sofa by mahmoud watched in progress mahmoud also sat down not word be spoken while ceremony went on man with stick first placed on ground two little pansone at foot then one at foot of master after that loosed ornamented bag carried round neck producing from tobacco proceeded to fill two pipe did with utmost gravity apparently with very peculiar care pipe have be already fixed at one end of stick to other end man have fastened two large yellow ball a afterwards perceived be mouth piece made of amber then lit pipe drawing up difficult smoke by long painful sucking at mouthpiece then when work have become apparently easy handed one pipe to other to master bowl have first placed in little pan on ground during time word be spoken be left altogether in dark a to cause have produced extraordinary courtesy there be stationary sofathey called there divanwhich be fixed into corner of room on one side of angle sat mahmoud al ackbar with foot tucked under while sat on other remainder of party stood around felt so little master of occasion did not know whether must become to bid be seated be not master of entertainment be not pipe be coffee saw one of follower preparing in distant part of room indeed be much confused a to management of stick amber mouth piece with have be presented with cigar be a much at home a man in city can nibble off end of smoke to last ash when be three part asleep have never before be invited to regale with instrument a be to do with huge yellow ball so watched new friend closely have manifestly be part of urbanity not to commence till have done so seeing difficulty at last raised ball to mouth sucked at looked at envied gravity of countenance dignity of demeanour sucked also made sputtering noise must confess that did not enjoy smoke curled gracefully from mouth nostril a sat there in mute composure be mute a regarded speech coughed a smoke came from in convulsive puff then attendant brought coffee in little tin cupsblack coffee without sugar full of grit of berry have be only bruised not ground took cup swallowed mixture for must not refuse wish might have asked for milk sugar nevertheless there be something very pleasing in whole ceremony at last began to find more at home with pipe when mahmoud have exhausted tobacco perceived that also have ceased to puff forth smoke spoke in italian to interpreter interpreter forthwith proceeded to explain to purport of visit be done with much difficulty for interpreter stock of english be very scantybut after awhile understood thought understood a followsat previous period of existence have done deed have given infinite satisfaction to mahmoud al ackbar whether however have done whether father have done be not quite clear to father then time deceased have be wharfinger at liverpool be quite possible that mahmoud might have found at port mahmoud have heard of arrival in egypt have be given to understand be coming to suezto carry away in ship a interpreter phrased must not understand let pas having heard agreeable tidingsand mahmoud sitting in corner bowed low to a be saidhe have prepared for acceptance slight refection for morrow hoping must not carry away in ship till have be eaten on subject soon made quite at ease then proceeded to explain that a there be point of interest at suez mahmoud be anxious must partake of refection somewhat in guise of picnic at well of moses over in asia on other side of head of red sea mahmoud must provide boat to take across party in morning camel on must return after sunset else must go return on camel go on camel return in boat indeed arrangement must be made that preferred if be afraid of heat disliked open boat must be carried round in litter provision have already be sent over to well of moses in anticipation must not refuse

point at israelite have passed of water have drunk almost felt that have already found one of pharaoh chariot wheel readily gave assent then with much ceremony many low salaam mahmoud attendant left be very glad came to suez said to myself did not sleep much that night for mosquito of suez be very persevering be saved from agonising despair animal so frequently produce by agreeable thought a to mahmoud al ackbar will put to of reader who have travelled whether be not painful thing to find one regarded among stranger without kindness ceremonious courtesy have on account be wretched at cairo be to be made up to at suez nothing must be more pleasant than whole conduct of mahmoud al ackbar determined to take full advantage of not caring overmuch what might be nature of previous favour to have alluded that be look out if be satisfied why must not be so also on following morning be dressed at six looking out of bed room saw boat in be to be wafted into asia being brought up to quay close under window have be arranged that must start early so a to avoid mid day sun breakfast in boatmahmoud in way engaged to provide with two refectionstake rest at noon in pavilion have be built close upon well of patriarch then eat dinner return riding upon camel in cool of evening nothing must sound more pleasant than plan knowing a did that hamper of provision have already be sent over did

repast on gritty coffee friend mahmouds follower prepared have promised to be ready at six having carefully completed toilet put clean collar comb into pocket ready for dinner descended to great gateway walked slowly round to quay a passed out porter greeted with low obeisance walking on felt stepped ground with sort of dignity of have before be ignorant be not a rule man who give grace honour to position position confers grace honour upon man have often envied solemn gravity grand demeanour of lord chancellor a have seen on bench almost think that even judkins must look grave dignified under wig mahmoud al ackbar have called upon done honour felt personally capable of sustaining before people of suez honour have done a walked forth with proud step from beneath portal perceived looking down from square along street that there be already commotion in town saw flowing robe of many arab with back turned towards thought that observed identical gown turban of friend mahmoud on back head of stout short man who be hurrying round corner in distance felt sure that be mahmoud of servant have failed in preparation said to myself a made way round to water edge be only testimony how anxious be to do honour stood for while on edge of quay looking into boat admiring comfortable cushion be luxuriously arranged around seat men who be at work did not know be unnoticed must soon take place upon softest of cushion walked slowly backwards forward on quay listening to hum of voice came to from distance there be clearly something stirring in town felt certain that movement distant voice be connected in way with expedition to well of moses at last there came lad upon walk dressed in frank costume asked what be in wind be clerk attached to english warehouse told that there have be arrival from cairo knew more than have heard that omnibus have just come in must be possible that mahmoud al ackbar have heard of old acquaintance have gone to welcome also at first idea on subject be altogether pleasant by mean wished to monopolise delight of cushion must be to cause of sorrow that there must be one to share with conversational power of interpreter must guest be found might also be englishman might thus form acquaintance must be desirable thinking of thing walked quay for minute in happy state of mind by degree became impatient by degree also disturbed in spirit observed that one of arab boatman walked round from vessel to front of hotel that on return looked at meas thought not with courteous eye then also saw rather heard one in verandah of hotel above be conscious be being viewed from thence walked walked nobody came to perceived by watch that be seven oclock noise too have come nearer nearer be now aware that wheel have be drawn up before front door of hotel that many voice be speaking there might be that mahmoud must wait for other friend why did not send one to inform then a made sudden turn at end of quay caught sight of retreating leg of austrian interpreter became aware that have be sent down have gone away afraid to speak to what can do said to myself can keep ground owned that feared to go round to front of hotel so still walked slowly up down length of quay began to whistle to show be not uneasy arab sailor looked at uncomfortably from time to time one peered at round corner be now fully half past seven sun be becoming hot in heaven why did not hasten to place beneath awning in boat have just made up mind must go round to front penetrate mystery when on turning saw approaching to man dressed at rate like

quay at six next morning on occasion stepped boldly into boat very moment that came along shore there be nothing in world like paying for what use saw to bottle of brandy cold meat acknowledged that cigar out of own case must suit better than long stick long stick might do very well for governor of pegu must be highly inconvenient in friday street well be not going to give account of day journey here though perhaps may do so day did go to well of mosesif small dirty pool of salt water lying high above sand can be called well did eat dinner in miserable ruined cottage graced by name of
