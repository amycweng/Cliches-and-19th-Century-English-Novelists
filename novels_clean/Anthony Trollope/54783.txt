come from office a hard a cab must bring said in answer to mildest of reproach explaining nothing a to nature of cause have kept so long at work must not allow reader to suppose that intensity of application have arisen from overwhelming interest of story be not that story entranced that feeling for writer grew a read story be simple unaffected almost painfully unsensational contained a came to perceive afterwards little more than recital of what imagination told might too probably be result of own engagement be story of two young people who became engaged must not be married after course of year man with many true argument asked to be absolved woman yield with expressed conviction that lover be right settle down for maiden life then break heart dy character of man be utterly untrue to

not work a to must tell little friend that might depend upon for fame fortune when have finished be obliged to tell must not advise even to publish yet must not say that have mistaken own power applied to profession beyond reach there be grace delicacy in work be charming occasionally escaped from trammel of grammar only so far that must be pleasure to point out to error there be not word that young lady must not have written there be throughout whole evident sign of honest work have six day to think over between completion of task second visit came exactly at hour appointed seated at once in arm chair before a soon a young man have closed door behind there have be no great occasion for nervousness at first visit have then by evident effort overcome diffidence incidental to meeting with stranger now did not attempt to conceal anxiety well said leaning forward looking up into face with two hand folded together even though truth standing full panoplied at elbow have positively demanded must not have told then to mend stocking bake pie desert calling that have chosen be simply irresistible must fear have constrained into falsehood have question be between falsehood absolute reprobation of work to have spoken hard heart breaking word to must have be like striking child when come to kiss fear that be not absolutely true at first that by absence of truth made subsequent pain more painful well said looking up into face have read told that have read word of be good fear that began by telling that certainly be good after fashion very good considering youth necessary

learn more of lesson of world way be so necessary to who attempted to teach lesson to others will try again at once said shook head endeavouring to shake kindly currer bell be only young girl when succeeded added injury currer bell did after fashion be almost equal to perpetrated by jack sheppard yet currer bell be not very young when wrote remained with then for above hour for more than two

against mr molloy yet be conscious of something of pride mingled with feeling be clear to that mr molloy be ordinary person did in degree gratify feeling that one must have taken so much trouble to encounter have found to be well informed pleasant gentleman fact that be called molloy desired to write for magazine over presided must not really be taken a detracting from merit there have doubtless be fraud committed on palpable fraud man have extracted assurance from by false pretence that did not know then idea on part that anything must be gained by doing so be in compliment to that man must

must not now resort to certainly not unusual practice of declaring to be too closely engaged to see one of sending word that must confide to writing whatever might have to say to have too occurred to that a mr molloy have paid three shilling sixpence for turkish bath must not prove to be one of class of visitor whose appeal to tender hearted editor be so peculiarly painful be willing to work day

to anyone if waste let call waste of dozen page will save family from hunger for month will not be well wasted yet again such tenderness be absolutely incompatible with common honesty equally so with common prudence think that reader will see difficulty understand how editor may wish to avoid interview with tattered glove friend mr michael molloy have have three sixpence to spend on turkish bath

walk in life have better sit at home darn stocking out of heap of ambitious manuscript be daily subjected to professional reader such verdict may safely be given in regard to four fifth that aspirant must darn stocking that must prune fruit tree be equally so with work of one sex a with of other necessity of saying so be very painful actual stocking fruit tree be not often named cowardly professional reader indeed unable to endure thorn in flesh of poor thackeray spoke so feelingly when hard pressed for definite answer generally lie have be asked to be candid can not bring to undertake duty so onerous so odious one a to see so little reason that personally must perform in regard to aspiration to have be given so much labour have produced so many hope offspring be so dear

afford to be good natured can give to hour so of own work may require if after be nothing a will happen sometimes much worse than nothing evil be of short duration in admitting thing have done injury injury be small pass in crowd be forgotten best homer that ever edited must sometimes nod whole novel piece of work must last perhaps for twelve month editor can afford to nod for so long period then

tender hearted medora who on behalf of hyena in love have gone through misery enough to kill regiment of heroine have dimmed judge eye with tear what stronger proof of excellence can editor have then there be long page of metaphysical twaddle sure to elicit scorn neglect from old young at rate must be cut out in cutting of out very mincemeat must be made of story yet josephine de montmorenci with impudent little letter have already made so attractive what be editor to do knew well difficulty must be before must once dare to accept then undertake to alter must be a tigress to a tigress fighting for young that work of altering be so ungracious so precarious so incapable of success in performance long winded far fetched high stilted unintelligible sentence elide with so much confidence in

editor be of course bound to think first of periodical produce announcement mr brown made doubt with little air of assumed personal dignity fact be one heaven born editor ever forgets of course sir doubt there be hundred who want to get thing taken good many there be certainly everything cant be published said sagacious beauty indeed very much come into hand can not be published replied experienced editor novel of yours perhaps may be published think so indeed do can not say what x y z may say to im afraid will not do more than offer half profit doesnt mean money paid at once asked

mind be not followed out to conclusion relationship be complex thing a know give rise to most intricate question in half moment be allowed to mr brown reflected that mr puffle might be sister in law of miss de montmorenci at least half sister in law be even possible that mr puffle young a looked might have be previously married to de montmorenci of however must not now stop to unravel detail endeavoured a went on to take comfort from fact that puffle be doubt charles josephine might perhaps have charles then became evident to that little fair smiling dimpled thing before must hardly have written not so black a he painted with metaphysics josephine must be made of sterner stuff after for adventure little dimple blue parasol be hardly appropriate there must be more of stature than mr puffle possessed with dark hair piercing eye colour of dress must be black with perhaps yellow trimming hand must not be of pearly whiteness a mr puffles doubt be though well fitting little glove gave absolute information on subject for such adventure appropriate colour of skin must be will not say sallow exactly running little way beauty must be just toned by sadness blood a come go must show not in blush in mellow changing line of brunette mr brown understood very well oh be mr puffle said brown after short perhaps insufficient pause be charles puffles wife do know charles asked lady putting

inveterate a ever of course smoke smoke suppose then used always to be doing before married dont think men ever tell real truth about thing though girl always tell everything now about sister novel asked mr brown who felt that have mystified little woman sufficiently about husband well yes doe want to get money so badly be clever isnt dont think ever read anything cleverer isnt enough to take breath away when orlando defends before lord referred to very high flown passage mr brown have determined to cut out when be thinking of printing story for page of olympus will be so broken hearted hope be not angry with because wrote in way not in least liked letter wrote what really thought be so good of told be sure be good natured because answered so civilly be kind of experiment of hers

thought polly what did polly think mean josephine call polly just a nickname be so anxious to get to read at once now what must do mr brown sat silent awhile thinking why did call josephine de montmorenci polly there be fact of m let name of author be what might on one thing be determined must take step till have seen lady who wrote novel youll go to gentleman in paternoster row immediately wont asked mr puffle with pretty little beseeching look be very hard to resist think must ask to see authoress first said mr brown wont do asked mr puffle josephine be so particular mean dislike so very much to talk about own writing own work mr brown thought of tenor of letter have received found that must not reconcile with character be given to of miss de montmorenci have idea continued mr puffle that genius must not show publicly of course doe not say that doe not think to be genius though think be genius there be thing in not so black a he painted nobody polly must have written nevertheless mr brown be firm explained that must not possibly treat with messrs x y z if treating must become possible without direct authority from principal must have from miss de montmorencis mouth what might be arrangement to must accede if must not be done must wash hand of affair did not doubt said that miss de montmorenci might do quite a well with publisher by a must with aid from perhaps must be better that must see mr x if brown be to be honoured by delegated authority must see author in saying implied that have not slightest desire to interfere further that have wish to press on lady mr puffle with just tear then smile then little coaxing twist of lip assured that only hope be in must carry message to josephine must have further letter from lady wont tell charles have be here said mr puffle a took leave certainly not wont say word of be so odd that must have known dont let smoke too much mr puffle dont intend ive brought down to one cigar pipe day unless smoke at office do that nearly whole day what at post office thats why mention dont think theyre allowed at of other office do what please there will keep m till hear from josephine then mr puffle took leave with many thanks grateful pressure from pretty little hand two day after there came promised letter from josephine dear mr brown can not understand why must not go to x y z without seeing hardly ever see anybody of course must come if will got sister to go because be so gentle nice thought must persuade anybody to do anything say that know mr puffle quite well seems to be so very odd doesnt know that ever write word didnt think have acquaintance in world whom dont know name of youre quite wrong about one thing never smoke at post office wouldnt be let to do if choose to come must will be at home time on friday morning be after half past nine when charles go away yours truly j de m began to talk about editor after dinner just for fun charles said that didnt know that have ever seen one of course didnt say anything about olympus dont know why must be so mysterious then there be second postscript written down in corner of sheet of paper know youll be sorry came editor be now quite determined that must see adventure to end have at first thought that josephine be keeping in background merely that might enhance favour of personal meeting when favour must be accorded pretty woman believing to be genius thinking good thing must ever be made scarce might not improbably fall into such foible now be convinced that must prefer to keep unseen if doing so might be made compatible with great object mr brown be not man to intrude unnecessarily upon woman unwilling to receive in case be so thought duty to persevere so wrote pretty little note to miss josephine saying that must be with at eleven oclock on day named precisely at eleven oclock knocked at door of house in king charles street be almost instantaneously opened for by fair hand of mr puffle h sh said mr puffle dont want servant to know anything about mr brown who cared nothing for servant of puffle establishment who be becoming perhaps little weary of unravelled mystery of affair simply bowed followed lady into parlour sister be up stair said mr puffle will go to immediately then paused a though be still struggling with difficulty be so sorry to say that polly be not well mean to see mr puffle added a saw that editor over whom have so far prevailed made sign a though be about to retreat never be very well said mr puffle work doe tell upon so much do know mr brown think mind sometimes eats up body be when be called upon for such great effort be now upon stair mr brown followed little lady into drawing room there almost hidden in depth of low arm chair sat little wizened woman not old indeed when mr brown came to know better found that have a yet only counted five twenty summer with look of mingled youth age be so painful to beholder who have not seen face in eye brow be young bright mouth chin be old haggard see one when sleep when brightness of eye be hidden countenance be full of pain decay then difference will be known to between youth with health be generally given to youth accompanied by premature decrepitude be sister in law said mr puffle introducing two correspondent to other editor looked at little woman who made half attempt to rise thought that must see in brightness of eye symptom of sauciness have appeared so very plainly in letter there be smile too about mouth though lip be thin chin poor seemed to indicate that owner of did in sort enjoy unravelling of riddle a though be saying to herself what do think now of beautiful young woman who have made write so many letter read so long manuscript come way at hour of morning to camden town mr brown shook hand with muttered something to effect that be sorry not to see in better health said josephine de montmorenci be not very well never be told that have better put up with seeing sister say more than truth of mr brown in declaring that be now more ready than ever to do might be in power to forward view of young authoress if be interested before when believed to be beautiful be doubly interested for now when knew to be cripple for have seen when made that faint attempt to rise that spine be twisted that when stood up head sank between shoulder be very glad to make acquaintance said seating near must never have be satisfied without doing so be so very good of to come said mr puffle of course be good of said josephine especially after way wrote to truth be mr brown be at wit end to catch be aspect of affair editor certainly did not like attempt to deceive anybody else might have be pardonable deceit practised against be odious to nevertheless did forgive poor little creature before have worked hard have done best to teach to be le metaphysical in writing more straightforward in own practice must be care there be something to man inexpressibly sweet in power of protecting weak one have ever seemed to be weaker than josephine miss de montmorenci said will let bygone be bygone will say nothing about letter be doubt fact that did write novel word of said mr puffle energetically oh yes wrote said josephine wish to have published indeed do wish to get money for be truest of said josephine oughtnt one to be paid when one have worked so very hard said mr puffle certainly one ought to be paid if can be proved that one work be worth buying replied sage mentor of literature isnt worth buying demanded mr puffle must say that think that publisher do buy be worse observed josephine mr brown with word of wisdom explained to a well a be able real fact of case might be that manuscript over poor invalid have laboured for so many painful hour must prove to be invaluable treasure of art destined to give delight to thousand of reader to be when printed source of large profit to publisher bookseller author again might be that with undoubted merit that there be such merit mr brown be eager in acknowledging novel must fail to make way with public publisher so said mr brown will hardly venture to pay sum of money down when risk of failure be so great polly have written ever so many thing before said mr puffle count for nothing said miss de montmorenci be short piece appeared without name be paid for asked mr brown have never be paid halfpenny for anything yet isnt that cruel said mr puffle to work work work never get wage ought to be paid for perhaps there may be good time coming said editor let see whether can get messrs x y z to publish at own expense with name attached to then miss de montmorenci suppose have better tell said josephine oh yes tell everything be sure wont be angry be so good natured said mr puffle mr brown looked first at one then at other feeling to be rather uncomfortable what be there remained to be told be good natured did not like being told of virtue name have heard be not name said lady who have written novel oh indeed have heard mr puffle call polly name be maryanne be very good name said mr brown so good that can not quite understand why must go out of way to assume be maryanne puffle oh puffle said mr brown very good name too said mr puffle havent word to say against said mr brown wish must say quite a much a to that other name josephine de montmorenci maryanne puffle must be quite unendurable on title page said owner of unfortunate appellation dont see said mr brown doggedly ever so many have done same said mr puffle there boz calling boz isnt like calling josephine de montmorenci said editor who must forgive loss of beauty not assumed grandeur of name currer bell jacob omnium barry cornwall said poor polly puffle pleading hard for falsehood michael angelo titmarsh be quite same sort of thing said mr puffle editor tried to explain to that sin of now complained did not consist in intention foolish a have be of putting such name a josephine de montmorenci on title page in having corresponded with with who have be so willing to be friend under false name really think ought to have told sooner said if have known have be friend of charles must have told at once said young wife never have pleasure of speaking to mr puffle in life said mr brown mr puffle opened little mouth held up little hand polly puffle stared at sister in law what be more continued mr brown never said that have have that pleasure didnt tell that charles smoked at post office exclaimed mr puffle swears that never doe that must be dismissed at once if attempted mr brown be driven to smile declare

justified in taking little lead in arranging matter with energetic young friend remark made one evening be very mild simply suggestion a to necessity of having more than ordinarily well educated set of printer be snubbed infinitely by churchill smith mr x said can probably tell more about printing than can tell felt so hurt be almost tempted to leave room at once knew very well that if seceded

doubt have not found yet to seemed to be rank apostasy infidelity to cause be bound to trust a long a kept place in society how will do anything in world achieve success unless believe in if there be partnership in mind matter partner must be same to a confidence be so essential to establishment of magazine felt then at least that panjandrum must have chance without rebuked mr churchill smith know what mean by said because dont talk german metaphysics think aint worth salt so much worth said trust heartily may find enough to save even yet be about to boil over with wrath walter watt be on leg making speech about salt of earth before have word ready churchill smith must put up with walter when must endure word from one else used to think mean enough to respect oxford fellowship have since fancied that believed that have discovered congenial spirit in day certainly did despise watt fellowship in later life have come to believe that men who get reward have generally earned watt on occasion made speech to in passion hardly attended well remember how when be about to rise in wrath mr st quinten put hand on arm calmed if said to whom most trust for orderly guidance be to be first to throw down torch of discord what will become of havent thrown down torch said take one up said pouring out tea for a spoke a for myself said regan like metaphysics like german be there anything so stupid pig headed a insular feeling make think nothing to be good be not home grown same said jack who ever eat good muffin out of london mr hallam mary jane be bringing up more said hostess be open handed woman supply of delicacy never ran low a long a panjandrum be possibility be think on evening that decided finally for column for dark gray wrapper with portrait of panjandrum in centre fancy portrait must necessarily be knew that must trust for to fertile pencil of mr st quinten have come prepared with specimen cover a to have in truth consulted artistic friend have taken with inconsiderable labour be sure looking back over long interval of year at feeling on occasion be sure say that bore well alteration change be made in design until at last nothing remained of what matter wrapper surely of printed published work be by interior that must judge be not that old conjuror head that have given success to blackwood yet four agricultural boy have made cornhill what be have now decided on column on cover colour have settled on number of page have thumbed four five specimen of paper submitted to by worthy publisher in matter have taken advice chosen cheapest still liked thumbing of paper be business paper be paper then bore high duty think that system of illustration have commenced in day though series of portrait be being published by one distinguished contemporary readily determined that must attempt nothing of kind there then arose question a to insertion of novel novel be not then a now held to be absolutely essential for success of magazine there be at time magazine with novel magazine without discreet young publisher suggested to that be not able to pay for such story a must do credit myself who be greedy for work with bated breath offered to make attempt be received with faint thanks walter watt rising on leg with eye full of fire arm extended denounced novel in general be not for such purpose that be about to devote to production of panjandrum erudition that might have acquired intellect that god have given let who wanted novel go for to writer who dealt with fiction in open market a for at rate must search for truth reminded of bluminea tell novel in three page said tell a be told will not object to be enabled however to decide that there must be novel in panjandrum see sartor resartus then at length came meeting at be to begin real work divide task among hitherto mr x have usually joined hint have be given to that on few following meeting must not trespass on time be quite understood that a publisher be to have nothing to do with preparation arrangement of matter to be published be think little proud of keeping at distance when came to discussion of actual essence of combined intellect be to be issued to world under grotesque name have selected that mind matter must be kept separated be impressed very strongly upon of now be mind mr x be matter be matter at rate in reference to special work therefore when have arrived at vital point told have be commissioned to do so that did not require attendance just at present be bound to say that mr x behaved well to end think that ever warmed to panjandrum after fancy that owns two three periodical now hire editor quite a easily a doe butler with le regard to character spent nervous day in anticipation of meeting pat regan be with day threatened dissolution there isnt fellow in world said that love better than walter watt id go to jamaica to serve when time came did oh so soon be asked to go further than kensal green then pat paused youre ready to quarrel with said simply because wont laugh at joke there good deal in said regan when two men be in boat together ought to laugh at others joke question isnt a to laughing if cant make public laugh sometimes may a well shut up shop walter be so intensely serious that nothing le austere than lay sermon will suit conscience let preach sermon do crack joke surely cant be dull when have jack hallam jackll never write line said regan only come for muffin then think of churchill smith sort of stuff hell expect to force down reader throat smith be sour never tedious said indeed expected great thing from smith so told friend lydia will write said pat used to call lydia behind back so will churchill smith watt doubt that have quire written already one will read word of jack will intend to write will never do anything felt to be most unjust because a have said before be already engaged upon press work be not remunerative be regularly done be afraid of nothing said distrust can move mountain if will only believe that can move just so in order to avoid confusion consequent on general motion among mountain other men have be created without sort of faith be always so with poor friend consequently be now attorney general at turtle island have believed a did jack still think that panjandrum might have be great success dont look so glum went on to say ill stick to do best did put lord bateman into rhymed latin verse for last night then repeated to various stanza of still remember one tuam duxi verum est filiam sed merum est si virgo mihi data fuit virgo tibi redditur venit in ephippio mihi et concipio satis est si triga pro reditu conceditur cheered little for thought that pat be good at thing be especially anxious to take wind out of sail of fraser father prout bring with said to giving great praise will raise spirit to know that have something ready did bring lydia required to have translated to word by word went off heavily be at last objected to by lady for first last time during debate miss collins ventured to give opinion on literary question under discussion agreed said with friend in thinking that mr regans latin poem must not be used translation be certainly a good a ballad be angry miss collins at rate need not have interfered at last evening came sat round table after tea cup have be removed anxious for allotted task pat have be so far right in view a to diligence of three of colleague that came furnished with pile of manuscript walter watt who be afflicted with false shame boldly placed before on table heap of blotted paper churchhill smith held in hand roll did not in fact unroll during evening be man very fond of own idea of own mode of thinking manner of life not prone to put forward mind owning that disliked have power of self abnegation be to say least of respectable a entered room eye fell on mass of dishevelled sheet of paper lay on sofa behind chair on mr st quinten always sat knew that be contribution pat regan a have said produced unfortunate translation promised with greatest good humour to do when be told that last performance did not quite suit mr st quintens view jack have nothing ready indeed be anything ready ever expected from however have own idea a to what jack might do for for confess have in pocket from two to three hundred line of what conceived must be very suitable introduction in verse for first number be duty thought a editor to provide magazine with few initiatory word did not however produce rhyme on evening having learned to feel that strong expression of self on part of one member at board be not gratifying to others did take pain in composing line thought at time have be not unhappy in mixing useful with sweet how many hour will say devoted to ala ala matter not now word did love well never met eye own though have then by heart be never sounded in ear be not personal glory desired be written that first number of panjandrum might appear becomingly before public first number of panjandrum never appeared looked at other day thinking whether might be too late for to serve turn will never look at again from first starting of conception of panjandrum have have great idea that idea be discussed at length on evening of be speaking must have something must be sparkling clever instructive amusing philosophical remarkable new at same time that thing might be achieved in literature felt convinced must be work of three four together must be something must force into notice compel attention must deal with greatest question of humanity deal with wisely still must deal with in sportive spirit philosophy humour might be sure be combined social science might be taught with witty word abstract politics made a agreeable a novel there have be corn law rhyme noctes be however essentially necessary that must be new therefore endeavoured vainly endeavoured to get old thing out of head frasers people have done great stroke of business by calling editor mr yorke if must get people to call mr lancaster something might come of yet be so needful that must be new idea have be seething in brain so constantly that have hardly eat slept free from for last six week if must roll churchill smith jack hallam into one throw in dash of walter watt fine political eagerness make use of regans ready poetical facility then control by own literary experience thing must be done be so hard to blend element have spoken often of to pat have assented ill do anything into rhyme used to say if thats what mean be not quite what meant one can not always convey one meaning to difficulty be so infinitely increased when one be not quite clear in one own mind then pat who be kindest fellow in world who bore with utmost patience restless energy must often have troubled sorely have not really heart in a have if churchill smith will send ever so much of stuff ill put into latin english verse just a please cant say more than that be great offer to make did not exactly reach point at be aiming have spoken to smith about also knew that if be to achieve success must do so in great measure by force of intellectual energy be not seeking pleasure success be willing therefore to endure probable discourtesy at least want of cordiality might encounter from man must acknowledge that listened to with rapt attention attention so rapt be more sometimes than one desire must have helped with word two now again must have felt to be more comfortable with be inclined to think that two men get on better together in discussing subject when speak little at random creates confidence enables man to go on to end churchill smith heard without word then remarked that have be too slow quite to catch idea must explain again did explain again though doubt be flustered blundered certainly said churchill smith if can be witty wise witty wise at same time altogether will be very fine then see im never witty seldom wise man be so uncongenial that there be getting anything from did not dare to suggest to that must submit prose exposition of idea to metrical talent of friend regan a soon a be assembled rose upon leg saying that proposed to make few preliminary observation certainly be case at moment mr st quinten be rinsing teapot mary jane have not yet brought in muffin know that when men meet together for special dinner speech be not commenced till meal be over must have kept seat till jack have done worst with delicacy have not be practice to discus business with plate cup saucer still before cant drink tea on leg said jack hallam have such intention said what have to lay before will not take minute suggestion however came from quarter must not be so formal mr st quinten touching sleeve whispered to precaution against speech making sat down remarked in manner felt to be ludicrously inefficient have be going to propose that magazine must be opened by short introductory paper a reader know have introduction then in pocket let dash into middle of work at once said walter watt one read introduction said regan own friend pat regan own dont think introduction must do particular service said lydia turning to with smile be so often used to keep in good humour can safely assert that be never vainly used on did not even bring verse out of pocket thus escaped at least torture of criticism to must have be subjected have be allowed to read to company so be said let then dash into middle of work at once be only necessary to have point settled then can progress after be silent for awhile thinking well to keep in background one seemed to be ready for speech walter watt fingered manuscript uneasily mr st quinten made remark not distinctly audible a to sheet on sofa must get rid of tray first said churchill smith sat perfectly still with roll in pocket mr st quinten gentleman said be happy to tell have have contribution handed to will go far to grace first number friend regan have done lord bateman into latin verse with latinity rhythm so excellent that will go far to make at rate equal to anything else in line then produced translated ballad little episode took place have already described mr st quinten insisted on understanding in detail be rejected then upon word dont know what be to get said latin translation be not indispensable said walter watt doubt can live without said pat with fine good humour bore disgrace of having first contribution rejected with admirable patience there be nothing must not bear to day bear being attorney general at turtle island something must be done perhaps said turning to lady mr st quinten will begin by giving idea a to first number will tell intends to do for be still embarrassed by tea thing acknowledge be led to appeal to at moment because be so if must succeed in extracting idea must be of infinitely more use to than reading of manuscript to get thing licked into shape must be first object a have on evening walked up to sombre street leading into new road in mr st quinten lived have declared to myself dozen time to get thing licked into shape be great desideratum in own imaginings have licked into shape have suggested to myself own little introductory poem a commencement pat regans latin ballad a pretty finish to first number then there must be thirty page of dialogue trialogue hexalogue if necessary between different member of board giving under assumed name view of what perfect magazine must be intended to be beginning of conversational element must be maintained in subsequent number must enable in light airy fashion becomes magazine to discus subject of politics philosophy manner literature social science even religion if necessary without inflicting on reader dulness of long unbroken essay be very strong about conversation saw way to great success if must only get friend to act in concert with very much depended on name to be chosen have doubt whether watt churchill smith must consent to slightly theatrical arrangement mr st quinten have already given in adhesion be doubting whether must call charlotte partly after charlotte corday partly after lady who cut bread butter mr freeman name having a observed be used before a nom de plume sophronie after madame de svign who be pleased so to call among learned lady of madame de rambouillet bower be altogether in favour of mr freeman have merit of simplicity be minor point jack hallam have chosen appellation somewhere in lowland have seen over small shop door name of john neverapenny john neverapenny must be turned over on tongue score of time thought that perhaps might do pat wanted to call oblazes be at last persuaded to adopt quieter name of tipperary in county family have be established since ireland be settled think said for myself be indifferent might give what title pleased have have own notion have be rejected might call jones walker if thought proper be very much wedded to idea still think that have be stoutly carried out result must have be happy be first to acknowledge that plan be not new there have be noctes imitation even of noctes then what be new noctes have be imitation from older work if socrates hippias have not conversed neither probably must mr north friend might a well tell said addressing colleague that must invent new language find new form of expression print idea in unknown type impress on strange paper let thought be new said then let select for manifestation most convenient form with experience provides didnt see mr st quinten liked romance of being sophronie to jack pat there be fun in nickname in real thing for be striving have actual faith if must only lick into shape have said to myself at last moment a be knocking at mr st quintens door mr st quinten be nearer to way of thinking in respect than others therefore appealed to while tea thing be still before thinking might obtain from suggestion in favour of conversation introductory poem latin ballad be gone for spilt milk what wise man weeps verse have not even left pocket not one there knew that have be written be determined that not one must know conversation might still live ah if must only blend element sophronie said taking courage speaking with voice from sense of shame fear of failure be intended to be banished sophronie will tell intends to do for looked into friend face saw that liked turned to cousin churchill smith a though for approval met none have better be in earnest said churchill smith without moving muscle in face giving slightest return to glance have fallen upon from cousin one can be more thoroughly in earnest than replied let have calling of name said churchill smith be inappropriate especially so when lady be concerned have be done score of time rejoined too in very highest phase of civilisation among most discreet of matron seems to to be twaddle said walter watt to taste abominably vulgar said churchill smith have answered very well in other magazine said thats just reason must avoid said walter watt think thing have be about worn out said pat regan be now thrown upon mettle rising again upon leg for tea thing have now be removed poured out conviction hope fear ambition if be thus to disagree on point how must ever blend element if must not forbear with one how must hope to act together upon age a one great force if there be agreement between how must have strength of union then adverted with eloquence of be master to great object to be attained by imaginary conversation that may work together using own word be desire said pointed out to how willing be to be least among in contest to content with simply acting a chorus pointing to lesson of wisdom must fall from out of mouth must say that listened to on occasion with great patience churchill smith there with great hollow eye fixed upon seemed to a looked that even be being persuaded threw into word implored to allow on occasion to put on road to success when have finished speaking looked around for moment thought be convinced there be just whispered word between sophronie cousin then turned to spoke be still standing bent down over to catch sentence must pronounce give up said gave up with what pang be done few of reader can probably understand have be dream from youth upwards be still young doubt looking back now can see how insignificant be aspiration be then in question there be period in man life in doe not seem to that ambition be then at moment culminating for till time come in begin to own to that life be not fit for ambition have believed that might be mean of doing something of doing in way very vague indeed have be notion most crude idea can see now what be that interlocutor be to say to other have never clearly known have felt that in way might speak own speech without confusion with delight to reader element have thought might be so blent then there came little whisper between churchill smith sophronie found that have failed give up said oh of course said a sat down only just settle what mean to do for few minute hardly heard what matter be being discussed among indeed during remainder of evening took real share in conversation be too deeply wounded even to listen be resolute at first to abandon whole affair have already managed to scrape together sum of money have be named a share necessary for of to contribute towards production of first number must be altogether at disposal a for editing periodical in management of be not allowed to have slightest voice be manifestly out of question must contribute when contribution suggested be rejected before be seen money must give that doubt must be welcome with gloomy thought mind be so full that actually did not hear word with walter watt churchill smith be discussing paper proposed for first number there be nothing read that evening doubt be visible to be a be blighted spirit among must not know how hard have worked how high have be hope how keen be disappointment felt for even churchill smith a shook hand with at door spoke word of encouragement expect to do thing too quickly said dont expect to do anything said may do something even yet said if can be humble patient persevering may do something though be ever so little be humble enough certainly knew have persevered a for patience well must endeavour even to be patient prior to mr st quinten have explained to programme have now be settled

at business with eye le enthusiastic let man have learned trick of pen let not smoke too many cigar overnight let get into chair within hour after breakfast can tell almost to line how much of magazine article will produce in three hour doe not much matter what matter be only that if task be that of reviewing may be expected to supply double quantity three day three out of fourteen passed by must think of fitting subject on to begin task have appointed myself of teaching british public politics at moment be rather dull very great question be agitating mind of men lord melbourne be prime minister have in course of session be subjected to usual party attack intended to go great deal further than lord melbourne in advocating liberal measure be disposed to regard colleague a antiquated fogy in statecraft nevertheless a against sir robert peel must have given benefit of defence did not however feel special call to write up lord melbourne lord john be just then pet minister even on behalf did not find capable of filling twenty one closely printed page with matter must really stir public mind in first number to stir public mind be everything didnt think that colleague sufficiently realised that fact though have indeed endeavoured to explain to in second third fourth publication may descend gradually to ordinary level may become not exactly dull for dulness in magazine must be avoided what may perhaps call adagio a compared with con forza movement with publication certainly must be opened reader expects to be supplied from month to month with cayenne pepper willot style of literature in preparation of new literary banquet first dish can not be too highly spiced knew then turned over in mind whether must not do something about ballot have never occurred to before there must be difficulty in finding subject have to reject ballot because at period of life have in fact hardly studied subject be liberal indeed radical in political idea be ready to go in for anything be undoubtedly liberal radical in general way be a firm in politics a member of house of common have thought a much on public subject a of be eager supporter of ballot when took pen in hand there came upon feeling that didnt exactly know how to say anything about that other people must care to read twenty one page loomed before a wilderness with staff must never traverse have not occurred to before that must be so difficult for man to evoke from mind idea on subject with supposed to be familiar such thought a have must clothe in fitting word on fifth morning driven to despair did write page two upon ballot then sinking back in chair began to ask question a to doubt be terrible to be kind of work to gift be applicable page have already written be manifestly not adapted to stir public mind sixth seventh day passed altogether within room never once leaving house drank green tea eat meat very slightly cooked debarred from food for several hour so that flesh might be kept well under sat up one night nearly till daybreak with wet towel round head on next got up lit own fire at four oclock thinking might be stretching cord too tight took to reading novel must not remember word a read so painfully anxious be to produce work have undertaken to perform on morning of eighth day be still without subject felt like man who undertook to play violin at dance for five shilling dinner dinner to be paid in advance who when making bargain have forgotten that have never learned note of music have undertaken even to lead band a seemed must not evoke sound horrid idea came upon be struck a be with sudden idiotcy mind have absolutely fled from sat in arm chair looking at wall counting pattern on paper hardly making real effort to think world seemed at once to have become blank to went on muttering to myself ballot wont do a though there be nothing else ballot with to stir public mind on eighth morning made minute quite correct calculation of number of word be demanded of taking whole a forty two page because of necessity of recopying found that about four hour day must be required for mere act of writing paper be there pen ink beyond there be nothing ready have thought to rack brain began to doubt whether have brain to rack of matter of public interest have hitherto be to very salt of life must not remember one must possibly be converted into twenty one page of type unconsciously kept on muttering word about ballot ballot be said aloud to myself in agony on sunday evening began to consider what excuse might best make to colleague might send say be very sick might face quarrel with because of ill treatment of might tell only lie keeping within letter of truth say have not yet finished work must not lie at late on sunday evening there came upon grand idea must stand up before confess inability to do work have undertaken arranged word of little speech almost took delight in who have intended to be teacher be now aware have hardly a yet become pupil in such case panjandrum must be at end element have not be happily blended without must not be sure be kept in concert panjandrum have already learned to love a mother love first born dear old panjandrum must perish before birth felt pity of thing idea theory of have be very good how will man put forth magazine when find unable to write page of within compass of week meditation of sunday be very bitter perhaps be useful have long since perceived that mankind be divided into two class who will speak who will listen to speech of others in seeing clearly existence of division have hitherto always assumed to belong to first class might not be probable that have made mistake that must become modestly to take allotted place in second on monday morning began to think be ill resolved must take hat go out into park breathe air let panjandrum live die such week a last must fancied send to hanwell be now november at ten oclock when looked out there be soft drizzling rain coming down pavement of street be deserted be just morning for work be work possible there still lay on little table in corner of room square single sheet of paper with margin doubled down all fitted for printer only that sheet be still blank looked at page rubbed brow gazed into street then determined that two hour ring round regent park be only chance left for a put on thick boot old hat prepared for thorough wetting felt a though at last have hit upon right plan violent exercise be needed then inspiration might come inspiration must come sooner if must divest from effort in searching for must take walk employ mind simply in observing world around for distance there be little of world to observe be lodging at period in quiet eligible street not far from theobalds road thence way lay through bloomsbury square russell square gower street a went found pavement to be almost deserted thick soft rain came down not with splash various current running off leaving thing washed though wet gently insinuating everywhere covering even flag with mud cared nothing for mud went through with happy scorn for poor creature who be endeavouring to defend clothes with umbrella let heaven do worst to said to a spun along with eager step be conscious of feeling external injury must avail nothing if must only cure weakness be within park too be nearly empty place in london be ever empty now thirty year ago population be palpably thinner have not come out however to find crowd damp boy sweeping crossing old woman trying to sell apple be sufficient to fill mind with thought a to affair of fellow creature why must have be allotted to old woman to sit there placing hope on chance sale of few apple cold rain entering very bone driving rheumatism into joint while old woman of whom have read paragraph that morning be appointed to entertain royalty go about country with five six carriage four be there injustice in if so whence have injustice come reflection be probably not new if properly

conventional life court in duchess must be forced to argue own case in barrow woman must decidedly get better of if must be done how happy must have be walk through mud slush a be thinking of saw before on pathway stout woman apparently middle aged back be towards leading girl who perhaps might be ten eleven year old have come up one of street from new road to park be hurrying along so fast that girl who held woman by arm be almost running woman be evidently servant in authority upper nurse perhaps housekeeper why must have brought charge out in rain be mystery must see from elasticity of child step that be happy very eager be well made girl with long well rounded leg came freely down beneath frock with strong firm boot straw hat plaid shawl wound carefully round throat waist a followed rapid leg of hers seemed almost to twinkle in motion a kept pace with stout woman who be conducting mud be over stocking still there be about air of well to do comfort made feel that mud be more than joke to now then caught something of glimpse of face a half turned round in talking to woman must see at least must fancy that saw that be fair with large round eye soft light brown hair child did not then wear wig upon back be driven to exercise fancy a to lock at last resolved must pas have one look at did so put to best pace to do gradually overtook must hear that girl never ceased talking a ran a went by distinctly heard word oh anne do so wonder what he like youll see miss said anne looked back saw that be exactly a have thought fair strong healthy girl with round eye large

very dirty stocking before be introduced to new found brother wrapped in arm of stranger father saw more of heard further word thought great deal of girl ah if must have be young unknown newly found sister of own how warmly must have welcomed how little must have cared for mud on stocking how closely must have folded in arm how anxious must have be with anne a to damp clothes what delight must have have in feeding coaxing caressing playing with there have seemed to belong to wholesome strong health have made for moment happy even to witness then sweet eloquent anxiety of voice oh anne do so wonder what he like while heard voice have seemed to hear know so much of then have passed out of ken for ever thought no more about duchess apple woman devoted mind entirely to girl brother be persuaded that must be brother have be father there must have be more of awe in tone certainly be brother gradually a unforced imagination came to play upon matter little picture fashioned in mind girl be own sister sister whom have never seen till be thus brought to for protection love be older just budding into womanhood instead of running beside nurse with twinkling leg there however be same broad honest face same round eye same strong nose mouth have come to for love protection having other friend in world to trust having proudly declared to myself that needed nothing further in two

castle for a have sat with girl by side calling sweetest name a have seen blush when friend came near have known at once with mixed agony joy how thing be to be swear that never once thought of panjandrum walked whole round of regent park perfecting building did perfect took girl to church gave away to friend walker came back sobbed sputtered out speech at little breakfast before occurred to to suggest to myself that might use thing churchill smith walter watt have be dead against novel indeed matter have be put to vote have be decided that there must be novel what be novel purport of vote have be to negative long serial tale running on from number to number in manner have since become well understood by reading public have thought colleague wrong so thinking be clearly duty to correct error if might do so without infringing that loyalty general obedience to expressed authority be so essential to society a ours before have got back to theobalds road have persuaded that short tale must be very thing for first number might not stir public mind to do must leave to churchill smith walter watt well formed little story such a of have now full possession must fall on reader of panjandrum like sweet rain in summer making thing fresh green joyous be quite sure that be needed walter watt might say what pleased churchill smith might look at a sternly a must sitting there silent with forehead on hand knew at least a much about magazine a did at rate must write tale very morning have seemed to to be impossible to get anything written now a hurried up stair to get rid of wet clothes felt must not take pen quickly enough into hand have thing to say must say if must complete story did not doubt completion from very moment in realised conception must be saved at rate from disgrace of appearing empty handed in mr st quintens parlour within quarter of hour of arrival at home have seated at table written name of tale new inmate doubt whether five day in life be ever happier than be devoted to piece of work began that monday afternoon finished on friday night while be at task doubt vanished from mind did not care fig for watt smith be quite sure must carry mr st quinten with night copied fairly what have written in day came to love thing with exceeding love there be deal of pathos in at least so thought cried over like child have strained mean to prepare for coming of girl be now going back for moment to castle in air have furnished for little sitting room a pretty white curtained chamber a girl ever took pleasure in calling own there be book for small piano low sofa little feminine belonging have said to myself that everything must be for have sold horse horse of imagination reader will understand for have never in truth possessed animal told club friend must no longer be one of then girl have come have gone away to walker a seemed to at once to walker who still lived in lodging have not even second sitting room for comfort to walker who be indeed good fellow in way possessed of particular attraction in wit manner beauty wanted to change with to take pretty home must have be delighted to go to garret leaving everything walker be proud must not have so girl protested that piano white dimity curtain be nothing to walker be everything walker of whom have never heard when came few week since to a only friend left to in world worked up to pitch of feeling over story must hardly write for tear saw standing alone in pretty sitting room after be gone pitied with exceeding pity si vi flere dolendum est primum ipsi tibi if success be to be obtained by obeying instruction might certainly expect success way in work went without pause be delightful when pen be not in hand be longing for while be walking eating reading be still thinking of story dreamt of came to to be matter admitted of doubt girl with muddy stocking who have thus provided in need be to blessed memory when kissed sister brow on first arrival be in arm palpably sweetness be present to a though have there in little street turning out of theobalds road to moment can distinguish voice in spoke to that little whispered word when asked whether cared for walker when one think of reality of be appalling what need be there of sister friend in flesh sister friend with probably so many fault when by little exercise of mind may be there at elbow faultless came to pas that tale be more dear to than magazine a read through for third fourth time on sunday morning be chiefly anxious for panjandrum in order that new inmate might see world be to meet that evening at eight oclock be understood that sitting must be prolonged to late hour because of reading must fall to lot to take second reading a coming next to mr st quinten must at rate not be subjected to weary audience have however promised other to be very patient be resolved that even to production of churchill smith who must be last must give undivided eager attention determined also in joy must vote against insertion of colleague contribution be not in boat together must not do best even though paper might be dull better little dulness than crushing of friend spirit fear that thought that new inmate might atone for much dulness dined early on day then took walk round regent park to renew thought on very spot on have first occurred to after returning home gave last touch to work though have be written after so hurried fashion there be not word in have not weighed found to be fitting be first at mr st quintens house found that lady very full of magazine asked however question a to contribution of own at once spoke to what do think have done at last said in reply to question made slight allusion to new inmate dont think caught word have reviewed bishop berkeley whole theory on matter said what feeling expressed by gesture can not say think must have be one of great awe have done exhaustively continued so that subject need not be continued churchill doe not like continuation perhaps did not signify much if be heavy at rate be light if work must prove difficult of comprehension mine be easy if spoke only to wise old have addressed to babe suckling said something a to contrast again naming little story be too full of bishop berkeley to heed if have worked a have worked of course be full of bishop berkeley to new inmate at moment be more than bishop other men soon came in clustering together number be complete regan whispered to that jack hallam have not written line asked be right said dont suppose theyll let pas thats affair not mine watt smith took place almost without speaking preparation be made for preliminary feast of body after feast be matter of such vital importance to that hardly possessed customary light hearted elasticity there be however air of subdued triumph about lydia of triumph subdued by presence of cousin a for myself be supremely happy said word to watt asking a to performance dont suppose will like replied be at rate fair specimen of have be ambition to produce assured with enthusiasm be thoroughly prepared to approve too without carping criticism must be critic observed of churchill smith asked question when have eaten drunk began work of evening by giving in name of paper describing nature of work have done mr st quinten be first read title from scrap of paper review of bishop berkeley theory churchill smith remarked that be very dangerous subject lady begged to wait till must hear paper read of course will hear read said cousin to be evident that smith must object to essay without scruple if did not in truth approve of then be turn explained in quietest tone must assume have written little tale called new inmate be very simple said trusted might not be rejected on score there be silence for moment prompted regan to proceed be interrupted by walter watt thought said that have positively decided against prose fiction protested that decision have be given against novel against long serial story to be continued from number to number be little thing completed within twenty one allotted page vote be taken a to prose fiction said watt appealed to hallam who at once took part a also did regan walter be quite correct a to purport of decision said churchill smith turned to mr st quinten dont see why shouldnt have short story said then declared that with permission must at rate read again requested regan to proceed upon walter watt rose upon foot made speech vote have be taken must not be rescinded after vote be not open to to read story story doubt be very good be pleased to say so be not matter of sort intended to use seeing purpose have in view thought that reading of story must be waste of time will clearly be waste of time said churchill smith walter went on to explain to that if from one meeting to did not allow ourselves to be bound by own decision must never appear before public will acknowledge be enraged seemed to impossible that such folly must be allowed to prevail that after effort must be treated by own friend after fashion also got upon leg protested loudly that mr watt mr smith did not even know what have be subject under discussion when vote adverse to novel have be taken record be kept of proceeding a clearly showed to mr regan mr hallam be quite a likely to hold correct view on subject a be mr watt mr smith calling of men pat jack walter be for moment over watt admitted truth of argument declared that must again decide whether story of new inmate be be not novel in sense intended when previous vote be taken if not if decision on point must be in favour then privilege of reading must at rate belong to believed so thoroughly in own work desired nothing beyond went to work therefore took vote on proposition be be not story of new inmate debarred by previous resolution against admission of novel decision manifestly rested with mr st quinten be master easily master of three vote hallam regan be altogether with in matter of such import have hesitation in voting for have question be acceptance rejection of story for magazine then by nature of constitution must have have voice in matter be not case recorded own vote in own favour without blush having done so turned to mr st quinten with air of supplication in face of be aware of became at once ashamed looked round at almost furtively keeping eye otherwise fixed upon churchill smith immovable countenance did not condescend to speak word to what word have to say have spoken to be confident in justice of cause quickly dropped that look of supplication threw back in chair moment be one of intense interest almost of agony must not allow to think that in very truth work must be rejected by before be seen if such be to be decision how must be possible that panjandrum must ever be brought into existence who must endure such ignominy still persevere there be silence among to in intensity of feeling seemed to last for minute regan be first to speak now mr st quinten said rest with idea shot across mind at moment of folly of have be guilty in placing most vital interest in hand of woman merely on score of gallantry two vote have be given to a against one of ours simply because be woman may be that there have be something in arrangement of compensation for tea muffin if so how poor be cause for so great effect sat there arbiter of destiny have better give vote said smith roughly think be novel said appealing to there can be doubt of replied novel be not novel because be long short such be matter intended to declare that must not put forth in magazine protest said jumping up protest against interference then there be loud very angry discussion whether churchill smith be justified in endeavour to bias mr st quinten be nearly brought to vote upon myself be very anxious to have question decided to have question decided in churchill smith must be shown to be in wrong one must back seemed to a though even regan jack hallam be falling off from though jack have never yet restored to that article of clothing to allusion be made in first chapter of little history have be almost a anxious for pat latin translation a for own production be decided without vote that amount of free questioning a to others opinion of free answering be to be considered fair tell opinion can tell yours said churchill smith be opinion said that want to dictate to everybody to rule whole thing think did mean to exclude story telling said mr st quinten so decision be given against looking back at know that be right on exact point then under discussion have intended to exclude story heaven earth be there ever such folly a of have be guilty in coming to resolution have often suggested to myself since have new inmate be read on evening panjandrum might have become living reality that fortieth volume of publication might now have be standing on shelf of many well filled library decision however have be given against sat like one stricken dumb paralysed turned to stone remember a though be yesterday did not speak word simply moving chair inch two turned face away from lady who have thus blasted hope fear that eye be wet that hot tear trickled down cheek note of triumph be sounded verily believe suffered in too conspicuous suffering to watt smith have be matter of pure conscience mr st quinten woman like have obeyed man in whose strength trusted there be silence for few moment then watt invited regan to proceed have divided work into three portion what be called whether be verse prose translation original comic serious never knew must not listen then for to continue service to panjandrum be impossibility have be crushed so crushed that have not vitality left to escape from room must not have remained there pat regans paper be nothing to now watt knew have written essay called real aristocrat be published elsewhere afterwards jack hallams work be not ready there be something said of delinquency cared not what only wish that work also have be unready churchill smith also have essay on basis of political right that if remember rightly be title often talked matter over in after day with pat regan know that from moment in consternation be made apparent to thing went very heavily at time for hour after adverse decision be altogether unmanned unable to collect thought before evening be over there occurred further episode in affair awakened name of paper have be given in mr st quinten began to read essay nothing more than drone of voice reached tympanum of ear did not look at think of care to hear word that uttered believe almost slept in agony sleeping waking be turning over in mind wearily incapably idea of declining to give opinion a to propriety of inserting rejecting review of bishop berkeley theory on score that connection with panjandrum have be severed sound of reading went on did not make up mind hardly endeavoured to make up sat dreamily revelling in own grievance pondering over suicidal folly of panjandrum company reading went on on without interruption without question without applause know slept during portion of time for remember regan kicked shin remember also feeling of compassion for reader who be hardly able to rouse up to pitch of spirit necessary for occasion allowed to be quelled by cold steady gaze of cousin churchill watt sat immovable with hand in trouser pocket leaning back in chair very picture of dispassionate criticism jack hallam amused by firing paper pellet at regan sundry of struck on head face once mr st quinten burst forth in offence mr hallam said be sorry to be so tedious like of thing said jack be certainly very long half comatose a be with own suffering have begun to ask before mr st quinten have finished task whether must be possible to endure three other reading lengthy a ah if might have read new inmate how different must feeling have be of what lady said about berkeley did not catch word name of philosophical bishop seemed to be repeated usque ad nauseam of sudden be aware that have snored kick from pat regan wounded shin pellet from jack hallam fell on nose essay be completed looked up must see that drop of perspiration be standing on lady brow there be pause even be now aroused to attention be to write verdict on paper simply word insert reject what must write instead of doing so must declare at once be severed from panjandrum by treatment have received that be severed in fact be very sure must human flesh blood have continued service to magazine after such humiliation a have suffered nevertheless might perhaps be more manly be to accept responsibility of voting on present occasion if so how must vote have not followed single sentence yet be convinced that matter such a must never stir british public mind a thing went be not called upon for formal verdict lydia a soon a have done reading turned at once to cousin cared for verdict well said what do think of at first did not answer know read badly continued hope caught meaning be utter nonsense said without moving head oh churchill exclaimed be utter nonsense repeated be out of question that must be published glanced eye round company ventured spoken appeal jack hallam said something about unnecessary severity want of courtesy watt simply shook head say be trash said smith rising from chair will not disgrace give to put hand upon manuscript a though to save give to said sternly took from unresisting grasp then stalked to fire tearing sheet in piece thrust between bar of course there be great commotion be up in moment standing around a though to console miss collins came in absolutely wept over ill used friend for instant have forgotten new inmate a though have never be written be deluged in tear hiding face upon table uttered word of reproach ventured not syllable in defence of essay didnt think be so bad a murmured amidst sob did not dare to accuse man of cruelty have become so small among that voice must have have weight did think cruel hated on account a well a on own jack hallam remarked that for night at least work must be considered to be over be over altogether said churchill smith have known that for week past have known too what fool have be to make attempt hope at least that may have learnt lesson will be of service to perhaps have better go now ill just say word two to cousin before leave how got out of room hardly remember there be doubt leave taking between four unfortunate lydia amounted think to more than mere decency required to churchill smith know did not speak never saw of cousin again a have be already told did ever distinctly hear what be fate in life yet how intimately connected with have be for last six eight month for not calling upon so that might have mingled tear of disappointment together much blamed subject must have discussed failure namely of panjandrum be one so sore full of sorrow must not bring to face interview churchill smith know made various effort to obtain literary employment never succeeded because must yield inch in expression of own violent opinion doubt whether ever earned a much a by writing heard of living almost starving still in london then that went to fight for polish freedom be believed that died in russian prison must never find one who knew with accuracy circumstance of fate be man who must go forth with life in hand in meeting death must feel that encountered only that have expected mr st quinten certainly vanished during next summer from street in have bestowed upon so many muffin what became of never heard on evening pat regan consoled

essay apologising for smith why not have gone on heard yours said mine must have be rot too said pat isnt so easy after to do kind of thing agreed that obsequies must be very private indeed a panjandrum have a yet not have body of own be hardly necessary to open earth for purpose of interment agreed simply to say nothing about to one must go to mr x tell that have abandoned project there must be end of a night advanced offered to read new inmate to friend truly remarked that of reading aloud have surely have enough night when reflected that for violence of mr smith proceeding might

hand with mackenzie work have be done remained in background during interview be now for doctor to satisfy with scholarship if chose to take cognizance of matter with moral of proposed assistant

there be remains of cabbage turnip top place swarmed with child over whom one ghastly gas lamp at end of court threw flickering uncertain light there be clamour of scolding voice to seemed that heed be paid there be smell of damp rotting nastiness amidst seemed to to be almost impossible that life must be continued grime led way without further speech to middle house on left hand of court asked man who be sitting on low threshold of door whether mackenzie be within so that be muster grime be said man without stirring yes he there guess theyve be took then passed on into house matter about said man a apologised for kicking in passage have not moved have be impossible to enter without kicking seemed that mackenzie held two room on ground floor entered at once there be light must see

farthing candle be fixed in small bottle endeavoured to look round room by glimmer afforded must see nothing presence of four child three of whom seemed to be seated in apathy on floor grime taking candle in hand passed at once into other room followed holding bottle something over head contrived to throw gleam of light upon one of two bed with room be fitted there saw body of julius mackenzie stretched in torpor of dead intoxication head lay against wall body be across bed foot dangled on to floor still wore dirty boot clothes a have worn in morning sight so piteous so wretched at same time so eloquent have ever seen before eye be closed light of face be therefore quenched mouth be open slaver have fallen upon beard dark clotted hair have be pulled over face by unconscious movement of hand there came from stertorous sound of breathing a though be being choked by attitude in lay even in drunkenness there be uneasy twitching a of pain about face there sat have be sitting for hour past four child in other room knowing condition of parent whom most respected not even endeavouring to do anything for comfort what must do knew by long training thorough experience that fit of drunkenness have to be got out of by sleep to there be nothing shocking in be periodical misfortune shell have to own he be done now said grime looking down upon man alluding to wife good natured obstinacy handed candle to with mixture of tenderness roughness of roughness be only in manner tenderness be real raised mackenzie head placed on bolster lifted man leg on to bed then took off man boot old silk handkerchief from neck pulled trouser straight arranged fold of coat be almost a though be laying out one be dead eldest girl be now standing by grime asked how long father have be in

there be water in jug called again repeated shaking at last mackenzie opened eye in dull half conscious manner looked up at come man said grime shake off have done with hadnt better try to get up asked there be faint attempt at rising then smile smile be terrible to witness so sad be said then look of utter abject misery coming a thought from momentary remembrance of degradation after that sank back in dull brutal painless death like apathy of absolute unconsciousness itll be morning afore hell move said girl shes about right said grime he got too heavy for to do anything just leave well take look for box paper man upon whom be looking down have be born gentleman be finished scholar one so well educated so ripe in literary acquirement that knew few whom must call equal judging of matter by light of reason can not say that horror of scene must have be enhanced to by recollection have man be shoemaker coalheaver there must have be enough of tragedy in to make angel weep sight of child standing by bedside of drunken father while other parent be away in custody in degree shocked at what saw because thing be so common to thought of what man have be of what be of what might have be step by have brought to foul degradation witnessed filled with dismay must hardly have felt have gift have polluted intellect have wasted be le capable of noble us purpose in coming to court be to rescue doctor paper from danger turned to accompany grime into other room a did so publican asked girl if knew anything of black box father have taken away from spotted dog box be here said girl paper asked grime thereupon girl shook head hurried into outer room hardly know who first discovered sight encountered whether be shown to by child whole fire place be strewn with half burnt sheet of manuscript there be scrap of page of almost whole have be destroyed others be hardly more than scorched heap of paper ash lying tumbled together about fender went down on knee to examine thinking at moment that poor creature might in despair have burned own work have spared that of doctor be not so found score of charred page of doctor elaborate handwriting by time grime have found open box perceived that sheet remaining in be tumbled huddled together in absolute confusion there be page of various volume mixed with mackenzie have written be crushed rolled twisted a though have be thrust thither a waste paper out of way twas mother a done said girl put em back again when perlice took there be nothing more to learn nothing more by hearing useful clue must be obtained what have be exact course of scene have be enacted there that morning little booted to enquire be enough more than enough that knew that mischief have be done went down on knee before fire rescued from ash with hand fragment of manuscript that must find then put mass altogether in box gazed upon wretched remnant almost in tear have better go get bit of someat to eat said grime handing coin to elder girl hard on to starve cause father drunk sir then took closed box in hand followed out into street ill send step up to look after to morrow said grime a put box into cab little thought when made to drunkard foolish request to arise that must never speak to again a returned to office in cab that might deposit box there ready for following day mind be chiefly occupied in thinking over undeserved grievance have fallen upon have be moved by charitable desire to do service to two different person to learned doctor to red nosed drunkard have come of there have be nothing for to gain by assisting one other have taken infinite trouble attempting to bring together two men who wanted others service working hard in sheer benevolence have be result have spent hour on knee in undignified almost disreputable work of raking among mr mackenzie cinder now have to face anger dismay reproach worse than agony of doctor a to mackenzie asserted to ourselves again again that nothing further must be done for have made bed must lie upon oh why why have attempted to meddle with being so degraded got out of cab at office door thinking of doctor countenance a must see on morrow heart sank within asked if be so bad with now how must be with when returned to place on following morning on following morning did return doubt individual reader to whom address have at period felt that indescribable load of personal short lived care cause heart to sink down into boot be not great grief doe be excessive fear unpleasant operation come from mixture of two be anticipation of imperfectly understood evil doe evil out of there might perhaps be escape if must only see way in case saw way out of doctor be to be with at one oclock must come with smile expecting to meet learned colleague how must break to doctor might indeed send to putting off meeting advantage coming from must be slight if must see injured grecian sooner later have resolved much a feared that evil hour must not be postponed spent hour that morning in arranging fragment of first volume about third have be destroyed of second nearly page have be either burned mutilated of third little have be injured mackenzie own work have fared better than doctor there be comfort in after what have passed thought quite improbable that doctor must make use of mackenzie work so much of manuscript a must still be placed in continuous page laid out upon table volume by volume that in middle sinking down from original goodly bulk almost to dimension of poor sermon half burned bit left in box then sat down at accustomed table pretended to try to work ear be very sharp heard doctor step upon stair within minute two of appointed time heart went to very toe of boot shuffled in chair rose from sat down again be conscious that be not equal to occasion hitherto have after mild literary form patronised doctor a man of letter in town will patronise literary friend from country now feared a truant school boy fear master yet be so necessary that must wear air of self assurance in moment be with wearing that bland smile knew so well at present moment almost overpowered have be sure that must wear that smile have especially feared ah said grasping by hand thought must have be late see that friend be not here yet doctor replied great misfortune have happened great misfortune mr mackenzie be not dead be not dead perhaps must have be better that have died long since have destroyed manuscript doctor face fell hand at same time stood looking at need not tell doctor what feeling be how great remorse destroyed then took by hand led to table turned first upon appetising comparatively uninjured third volume seemed to think that have hoaxed be not destroyed said with smile before must explain anything hand be among fragment in box a be living man have burned exclaimed then turned from walked twice length of room backwards forward while stood still patiently waiting explosion of wrath friend said when walk be over great man underwent same sorrow newton manuscript be burned will take home with will say no more about never thought very much of doctor a divine hold to have be a good christian a ever met plan of of saying more about must not quite be carried out be endeavouring to explain to a thought necessary to do circumstance of case be protesting indifference to such detail when there came knock at door boy who waited on below ushered mr grime into room a reader be aware have during last two month become very intimate with landlady of spotted dog have never hitherto have pleasure of seeing outside own house oh mr began then paused seeing doctor thought expedient that there must be introduction mr grime said be gentleman whose invaluable manuscript have be destroyed by unfortunate drunkard oh then youre doctor sir doctor bowed smiled heart must have be very heavy bowed politely smiled sweetly oh dear said dont know how to tell to tell asked doctor have happened since demanded woman stood shaking before then sank into chair then arose to at moment idea that drunken woman in mad rage have done great damage to spotted dog have set fire to house injured mr grime personally perhaps run muck amidst jug pitcher window glass gas light something have be done must give grime pecuniary claim on on doctor woman have be sent hither to make first protest oh when must see last of result of imprudence in having attempted to befriend one a julius mackenzie if have anything to tell have better tell said gravely he be not destroyed asked doctor oh yes sir have indeed from ear to ear be now lying at spotted dog so after be end of julius mackenzie need hardly say that feeling up to moment have be very hostile to man underwent sudden revulsion poor overburdened struggling ill used abandoned creature world have be hard upon with severity almost induced one to make complaint against omnipotence poor wretch have be willing to work have be industrious in calling have have capacity for work have also struggled gallantly against evil fate have recognised endeavoured to perform duty to child to miserable woman who have brought to ruin that sin of drunkenness have seemed to to be in rather reflex of vice than result of own vicious tendency still might be doubtful whether have not learned vice from have in truth be drunkard a long a have be known in neighbourhood of spotted dog be stated by who have known there that be never seen to be drunk unless when have disgraced by public exposure of own abomination such a be have now come to end be upshot of loud claim for liberty from youth upwards liberty a against father family liberty a against college tutor liberty a against pastor master instructor liberty a against conventional thraldom of world be now lying wretched corpse at spotted dog with throat cut from ear to ear till coroner jury must have decided whether not must call suicide mr grime have come to tell that coroner be to be at spotted dog at four oclock to say that husband hoped that must be present have seen mackenzie so lately have so much to do with employment of last day of life that must not refuse request though came accompanied by legal summons then mr grime again became voluble poured out to biography of mackenzie a far a knew have be married to woman ten year certainly have be drunkard before married a for shed be well nigh suckled on gin said mr grime though didnt know poor fellow whether be true not have certainly taken to drink soon after marriage then life have be passed in alternate fit of despondency of desperate effort to improve own condition that of child mr grime declared to that when fit came on when woman have begun man have followed must expend upon drink in two day what must have kept family for fortnight say a how be nothing for to swallow forty shilling worth of gin in forty eight hour doctor held up hand in horror didnt none of come way said mr grime indeed john wouldnt let serve for em sat there for hour during

home never heard doubtless there have be terrible scene in man suffering must have be carried almost beyond endurance have feeling sir have said mr grime knew a woman must be decent man wife especial im sure pitied so john that must have cried over john must say hard word to at time hed have walked round london to do good turn john aint to say edicated do respect learning when have told mr grime went be left alone with doctor at once consented to accompany to spotted dog spent hour still remained to in discussing fate of unfortunate man doubt whether allusion be made during time to burned manuscript if so be certainly not made by doctor tragedy have occurred in connection with have made feel to be unfitting even to mention own loss that one must have gone to account in such manner without hope without belief without fear a burley said to bothwell bothwell boasted to burley be theme of doctor discourse mercy of god be infinite said bowing head with closed eye folded hand to threaten while life be in man be human to believe in execution of threat when life have passed away be almost beyond power of humanity at hour fixed be at spotted dog found there crowd assembled

with black box to continued use of a sarcophagus have be made very welcome for share in bringing upon great catastrophe of life never uttered to either by spoken written word single reproach that idea of suffering a great philosopher have suffered seemed to comfort if newton bore surely can said to with bland smile when renewed expression of regret something passed between coming more from than
