not yet fifty might have be taken to be over sixty put out hand to greet a came up to silverbridge said tell that go back to london to morrow thought must be best duke presence here can be of comfort to will not say that anything can be of comfort of course be right that must go can have excuse for asking to remain while there be yet hope for then stopped unable to say word further in direction yet there be sign of tear sound of sob of course must stay duke if must be of service mr finn will expect to return to perhaps must be better must say must stay be not that know can be of real service what do mean by mr finn lady mary must have with at time other friend there be none other whom mother loved a loved none none said almost with energy there be one lately duke with whom circumstance caused mother to be so closely intimate even that perhaps be unfortunate never thought so be great compliment a to lady mary will not be a well that must have with a soon a possible someone perhaps someone of own kindred if be possible if not at least one of own kind who be there whom do mean mean one be hard duke to say what do mean perhaps have better try there will be probably there have be among friend who have regretted great intimacy chance produced between lost friend while be with such feeling must have sufficed to drive from have chosen for herself if others disapproved choice be nothing to a regard lady mary will be better think that from beginning must be taught to look for friendship guidance to to who be more naturally connected with be not thinking of guidance said duke of course not with one so young where there be intimacy there will be guidance there must be somebody with be almost last thought occupied mother mind must not tell duke can tell can not with advantage to girl be that somebody cora wished wish probably be sudden hardly fixed who must be then asked father after pause who be duke must answer question after there be pause then conference be ended by request from duke mr finn must stay at matching for yet two day longer at dinner met father three child mr finn how far young people among have be able to throw off something of gloom of death need not here be asked in presence of father be sad sombre almost a be on next day early in morning younger lad returned to college lord silverbridge went up to london where be supposed to have home perhaps must not mind reading letter duke said to mr finn when again went to in compliance with message from asking for presence then sat down read two letter one from lady cantrip other from mr jeffrey palliser of contained invitation for daughter expressed hope that lady mary must not be unwilling to spend time with writer lady cantrip letter be long went minutely into circumstance if lady mary must come to must abstain from having other company in house till young friend spirit must have somewhat recovered nothing must be more kind proposed in sweeter fashion there have however be present to duke mind a read feeling that proposition to bereaved husband to relieve of society of only daughter be not one must usually be made to father in position child company must probably be best solace knew at moment painfully remembered that be not a be other men acknowledged truth of be not le grieved irritated by reminder letter from mr jeffrey palliser be to same effect be much shorter if must suit mary to come to for month six week at place in gloucestershire must be delighted must not choose to go there said duke a mr finn refolded latter letter cousin wife be very good woman mary must not be happy with lady cantrip be excellent friend for excellent know one whom esteem more than lady cantrip must wish to go there duke there came wistful piteous look over father face why must be treated a other father must be treated why must be supposed that must desire to send girl away from yet felt that must be better that must go be present purpose to remain at matching through portion of summer what must do to make girl happy what comfort must there be in companionship suppose ought to go somewhere said have not thought of said mr finn understood to say replied duke almost angrily that ought to go to someone who must take care of be thinking of friend coming to who must come who be there must possibly ask will not stay certainly must stay if be for good be thinking duke that perhaps might ask grey to come to must not come said after pause when be told that be for sake must come think then there be pause must not ask said for sake must not have put to in way perhaps mary have better go to lady cantrip perhaps have better be alone here for time think that be fit to have human being here with in sorrow chapter ii lady mary palliser may a well be said at once mr finn knew something of lady mary be not known to father be not yet prepared to make known to last winter abroad have be passed at rome there lady mary palliser have become acquainted with certain mr tregear francis oliphant tregear duchess who have be in constant correspondence with friend have asked question by letter a to mr tregear of whom have only known that be younger son of cornish gentleman who have become lord silverbridge friend at oxford in there have certainly be little to recommend to intimacy of such girl a lady mary palliser have duchess when writing ever spoken of a probable suitor for daughter hand have never connected two name together mr finn have be clever enough to perceive that duchess have become fond of mr tregear must willingly have heard something to advantage did hear something to advantage something also to disadvantage at mother death young man must inherit property amounting to about fifteen hundred year be told said mr finn that be quite likely to spend money before come to there have be nothing more written specially about mr tregear mr finn have feared not only that young man loved girl that young man love have in imprudent way be fostered by mother then there have be fitful confidence during few day of acute illness why must not girl have man if be lovable duchess referred to own early day when have loved to great ruin have come upon heart when have be severed from man have loved not that have be for best have said not that plantagenet have be to that husband must be only if can be spared what suffered let be spared even when thing have be said to mr finn have found unable to ask question must not bring to inquire whether girl have in truth given heart to young tregear one be nineteen other a yet two twenty though asked question almost knew that must be so knew also that father a yet be quite in dark on matter how be possible that in such circumstance must assume part of girl confidential friend monitress be to do so must immediately tell father everything in position one must be better friend than lady cantrip mr finn have already almost made up mind must lady cantrip occupy place must tell ladyship have passed between duchess on subject of what hope might have what fear about girl duchess have said word to husband when have believed that thing of world be fading away from when be sitting by bedside dumb because at moment knew not how to express tenderness of heart holding hand trying so to listen to word that might collect remember wish have murmured something about ultimate division of great wealth with have be endowed have never said even tried to remember what arrangement have be made by lawyer hoped that mary might be so circumstanced that if happiness depended on marrying poor man want of money need not prevent duke suspecting nothing believing to be not unnatural expression of maternal interest have assured that mary fortune must be ample mr finn made proposition to lady mary in respect to lady cantrip invitation lady mary be very like mother especially in having exactly mother tone of voice quick manner of speech sharp intelligence have also mother eye large round almost blue full of life full of courage eye never seemed to quail mother dark brown hair never long very copious in thickness be however taller than mother very much more graceful in movement must already assume personal dignity of manner have never be within mother reach have become aware of certain brusqueness of speech in mother certain aptitude to say sharp thing without thinking whether sharpness be becoming to position held taking advantage of example girl have already learned that might gain more than must lose by controlling word papa want to go to lady cantrip said think must like just for present lady mary though there have be closest possible intimacy between duchess mr finn have hardly be so a to intercourse between mr finn child of mr finn must be acknowledged that be perhaps fastidiously afraid of appearing to take advantage of friendship with duke family must tell that though circumstance have compelled to be closest nearest friend of duchess still natural place be not among duke child therefore in intercourse with girl did not at first assume manner bearing position in house must have seemed to warrant hence lady mary why doe want to send away mr finn be not that want to send away that think will be better for to be with friend here must be so much alone why stay suppose mr finn want to be back in london be not that only to speak truth not that at mr finn must come here if be suitable for week two might do very well without there be other reason there be one whom mother respected more highly than lady cantrip never heard speak word of lady cantrip be father intimate friend doe papa want to be alone here be not of whom be thinking therefore must think of mr finn wish to be alone be sure must be better must stay with feel that must not be well that must live without companionship of lady then let find lady must be best because know so well however be not afraid of being alone be sure ought not to be here quite by if bid go must go then of course will go where sends wo say that think best must go certainly want to go to lady cantrip said with great decision a though matter be one on have altogether made up mind then added in lower voice why doe papa speak to about be thinking only of what may be best for must be best for to stay near whom else have got mr finn repeated to duke a closely a must then of course father be obliged to speak to daughter send away papa said at once life here mary will be inexpressibly sad must be sad anywhere can not go to college like gerald live anywhere just a please like silverbridge do envy that sometimes papa only will think more of poor mamma by being alone must like to be thinking of always shook head mournfully mean that will always be unhappy a be now dear be too young for that be only old who suffer in way will suffer le if be with wo papa want to go to lady cantrip hardly remember at be very good oh yes be what used to say to mamma about lady midlothian papa pray send to lady cantrip of course be decided that must not go to lady cantrip at once to mr jeffrey palliser after short interval of doubt be decided also that mr finn must remain at matching for at least fortnight duke declared that must be glad to see mr finn knew that in present mood society of one man to whom must feel called upon to devote time must be burden to plainly said that mr finn have better not come to matching at present there be old association said will enable to bear with a will with butler groom be not a yet quite able to make happy with company bore with perfect equanimity then a be handed over daughter to mr finn care very quickly there came to be close intimacy between mr finn lady mary for day two elder woman though place filled be one of absolute confidence rather resisted than encouraged intimacy always remembered that girl be daughter of great duke that position in house have sprung from circumstance must not perhaps in eye of world at large have recommended for such friendship knew reader may possibly know that nothing have ever be purer nothing more disinterested than friendship knew also one knew better that judgment of men woman doe not always run parallel with fact entertained too conviction in regard to herself hard word hard judgment be to be expected from world be to be accepted by without strong feeling of injustice because have be elevated by chance to possession of more good thing than have merited weighed with very fine balance even after encouragement have received from duke be intent on confining to position about girl inferior to friend a lady cantrip might have occupied girl manner girl speech about own mother overcame be unintentional revelation of duchess constant reference to way in lady mary must assert that mamma used always to say of mamma always knew that must think so so mamma used to say that have told be feeling thus conveyed that mother who be now dead have in daily dealing with own child spoken of a nearest friend mainly served to conquer deference of manner have assumed then gradually there came confidence at last absolute confidence whole story about mr tregear be told yes loved mr tregear have given heart have told so then dear father ought to know said mr finn not yet mamma knew did know that have told yes mr tregear spoke to said that papa ought not to be told quite yet mr finn must not remember that friend have lost be not among woman one best able to give girl good counsel in such crisis why not yet dear well because be very hard to explain in first place because mr tregear doe not wish be very bad reason worst in world of course will say so of course everybody must say so when there be one person whom one love better than rest for whom one must be ready to die to whom one be determined that everything will be devoted surely wish of person so dear a ought to have weight not in persuading to do be acknowledged to be wrong what wrong be going to hing wrong very concealment of love be wrong after love have be not only given declared girl position in such matter be so delicate especially that of girl a know about said lady mary with something almost approaching to scorn in tone of course have to be delicate quite know what word mean be not bit ashamed of being in love with mr tregear be gentleman highly educated very clever of old family older believe than papa be manly handsome just what young man ought to be only be not rich if be that say ought not to trust papa if approve of must give money of course must be told not now be nearly broken hearted about dear mamma must not bring to care about anything of kind at present then be mr tregear must speak to first not now mary how do mean not now if have mother must talk to about mamma knew if be still living must tell father did tell though did know did mean to tell quite yet wanted to see mr tregear here in england first of course will hing till papa doe know will not see how can see here will not come here if mean that correspond with here for first time girl blushed oh mary if be writing to father ought to know have not written to when heard how ill poor mamma be then wrote to twice may see letter be about one worshipped mamma a did gradually whole story be told two young person considered to be engaged have agreed that engagement must not be made known to duke till something have occurred time have arrived a to mr tregear be to be judge in mr finn opinion nothing must be more unwise said much to induce girl to confess everything to father at once in argument be opposed by girl reference to mother mamma knew did certainly seem to mr finn a though mother have assented to imprudent concealment when endeavoured in own mind to make excuse for friend felt almost sure that duchess with courage have be afraid to propose to husband that daughter must marry commoner without income in thinking of that there must now be nothing gained what ought to do at once girl in telling have exacted promise of secrecy must have given such promise yet did not like idea of telling tale behind girl back be evident that lady mary have considered to be safe in confiding story to mother old friend lady mary doubt have have confidence with mother confidence from have be intended by that father must be excluded now seemed naturally to expect that new ally must look at great question a mother have looked at father have be regarded a great outside power must hardly be overcome might be evaded made inoperative by stratagem be not that daughter did not love loved venerated highly veneration perhaps being stronger than love duchess too have loved dearly more dearly in late year than in early life husband to have always be outside power have in many case to be evaded lady mary though did not express evidently thought that in new friend have found woman whose wish aspiration for must be mother have entertained mr finn be much troubled in mind thinking that be duty to tell story to duke be not only daughter who have trusted father also father confidence have be not only first by far holier of two question be one so important to girl future happiness there must be doubt that peril of present position be very great mary said one morning when fortnight be nearly at end father ought to know must feel that have betrayed be to go away leaving in ignorance mean to say that will tell said girl horrified at idea of such treachery wish must induce to do so day that be kept in dark be injury to be doing nothing what harm can come be not a though be seeing day harm will come father of course will know that became engaged to mr tregear in italy that fact so important to have be kept back from if there be anything in evil have be done already of course poor mamma did mean to tell can not tell now therefore ought to do what must have done can not break promise to always meant mr tregear have told must not do so till have consent will not be very dreadful to mr finn yet be most unwilling to take upon part of stern elder declare under circumstance must tell tale story have be told to under supposition that be not stern elder that be regarded a special friend of dear mother who be gone that might be trusted to assist against terrible weight of parental authority must not endure to be regarded at once a traitor by young friend who have sweetly inherited affection with duchess have regarded yet if be to be silent how must forgive duke certainly ought to know at once said repeating word merely that might gain time for thinking pluck up courage to declare purpose must resolve on betraying secret if tell now will never forgive said lady mary be bound in honour to see that father know thing be of such vital importance to to having heard have right to keep from if mr tregear really love lady mary smiled at doubt implied by suggestion ought to feel that for sake there must be secret from father then paused moment to think will let see mr tregear talk to about to lady mary at first demurred when found that in other way must prevent mr finn from going at once to duke telling everything consented under mr finn direction wrote note to lover mr finn saw then undertook to send with letter from herself to mr tregear address in note be very short be indeed dictated by elder lady with dispute however a to certain term in younger lady have way be a follows dearest frank wish to see mr finn who a know be dear mamma most particular friend please go to a will ask to do when hear what say think ought to do what advises yours for ever always m p mr finn sent enclosed in envelope with few word from asking gentleman to call upon in park lane on day at hour fixed chapter iii francis oliphant tregear mr francis oliphant tregear be young man who might not improbably make figure in world must circumstance be kind to a to whom might be doubted whether circumstance must be sufficiently kind to enable to use serviceably unquestionable talent great personal gift have taught to regard a young english gentleman of first water qualified by birth position to live with be most noble most elegant must have lived in sphere naturally gracefully be not that part of sphere specially affected requires wealth a well a birth intellect wealth have not yet did not abandon sphere a consequence of be possible that prediction of friend a to figure be to make in world might be disappointed have be educated at eton from whence have be sent to christ church at school at college have be most intimate friend of son heir of great wealthy duke lord silverbridge have be always together who be interested in career of young nobleman have generally thought have chosen friend well tregear have gone out in honour having be second class man friend silverbridge know have be allowed to take degree at terrible practical joke by whole front of dean house have be coloured scarlet in middle of night have be carried on without assistance from tregear two young men have then be separated for year immediately after taking degree tregear at invitation of lord silverbridge have gone to italy have there completely made good footing with duchess with what effect on member of palliser family reader already know young man be certainly clever when duchess found that must talk without shyness that must speak french fluently that after month in italy must chatter italian at rate without reticence shame when perceived that woman liked lad society impudence that young men be anxious to know be glad to find that silverbridge have chosen so valuable friend then be beautiful to look at putting almost in mind of man on whom eye have once loved to dwell be dark with hair be almost black yet be not black with clear brown eye nose a regular a apollo mouth in be ever to be found that expression of manliness of characteristic be one woman love best be five foot ten in height be always well dressed yet always so dressed a to seem to show that outside garniture have not be matter of trouble to before duchess have dreamed what might take place between young man daughter have be urgent in congratulation to son a to possession of such friend for though now then must catch glimpse of outer man must remind of other beautiful one whom have known in youth though a glimpse came must remember how poor in spirit how unmanly that other one have be though must confess to herself how terrible have be heart shipwreck that other one have brought upon still be able completely to assure that man though not superior in external grace be altogether different in mind character be old enough now to see to appreciate young tregear have own idea about politics of day be idea with sympathised though be antagonistic to politics of life have idea about book too a to manner of life a to art even ethic whether in there be not much that be superficial only be not herself deep enough to discover must have be deterred from admiring have be told that be tinsel such be acquirement such charm that loved here be young man who dared to speak have always something ready to be spoken who be not afraid of beauty daunted by superiority of rank who if have not money must carry on equal term among who have in way won duchess heart having done be odd that must win heart of daughter also father be cornwall squire of comfortable mean having joined property of wife to own for period of own life have possessed land also in cornwall supposed to be worth fifteen hundred year own paternal estate at polwenning be said to be double that value being prudent man lived at home a country gentleman thus be able in county to hold head a high a richer men frank tregear be only second son though frank must hereafter inherit mother fortune be by mean now in position to assume right of living a idle man yet be idle elder brother who be considerably older than frank be odd man much addicted to quarrelling with family who spent time chiefly in travelling about world frank mother who be not mother of heir also must sometimes surmise in frank hearing that entire property must ultimately come to that other tregear who be now supposed to be investigating mountain of crim tartary must surely never marry frank be favourite also with father who paid debt at oxford with not much grumbling who be proud of friendship with future duke who did not urge a ought to have urged that vital question of profession who when allowed son four hundred pound year be almost content with son protestation that knew how to live a poor man among rich men without chagrin without trouble such be young man who now in lieu of profession have taken upon responsibility of engagement with lady mary palliser be tolerably certain must be able to overcome parental obstacle must no doubt find in path money must be forthcoming sufficient for purpose of matrimonial life duke wealth be fabulous a great part of if not greater have come from wife there must probably be ample provision for younger child when duchess have found out how thing be going have yielded to daughter after opposition never have appearance even of being in earnest have taken upon to say that must use influence to prevent great weight of trouble from pecuniary matter frank tregear young bright full of hearty ambition be certainly not man to pursue girl simply because of fortune be weak enough to be attracted simply by glitter of rank be wise enough with worldly wisdom to understand thoroughly comfort of good income be sufficiently attached to high position to feel advantage of marrying daughter of duke of omnium when duchess be leaving italy have be declared purpose to tell husband story a soon a be at home in england be on understanding frank tregear have explained to girl that must not a yet ask father for permission to be received into family a suitor everyone concerned have felt that duke must not easily be reconciled to such son in law that duchess must be one to bell cat there be one member of family who have hitherto be half hearted in matter lord silverbridge have vacillated between loyalty to friend certain feeling a to impropriety of such match for sister be aware that something very much better must be expected for still be unable to explain objection to tregear have not at first be admitted into confidence by sister by tregear have questioned friend when saw what be going on certainly love sister tregear have said do object lord silverbridge be weaker of two much subject to influence of friend must on occasion be firm did at first object did not object strongly allowed at last to be content with declaring that duke must never give consent while tregear be with love near hope fear be sufficient to occupy mind immediately on return world be nothing to except a far a world be concerned with lady mary palliser have come back to england somewhat before ducal party pleasure occupation of london life have not abated love enabled to feel that there be something in life over beyond love whereas to lady mary down at matching there have be nothing over beyond love except infinite grief desolation produced by mother death tregear when received note from mr finn be staying at duke house in carlton terrace silverbridge be there on leaving matching have asked duke permission to have friend with duke at time be not well pleased with son a to matter of politics gave son friend credit for evil counsel have produced displeasure still have not refused assent to proposition have done so silverbridge must probably have gone elsewhere though there be matter in respect to tregear of duke disapproved be not matter a thought must have justified in expelling young man from house young man be strong conservative now silverbridge have declared purpose of entering house of common if did enter a one of conservative party have be terrible blow to duke believed that came from young tregear still must do duty not more than duty knew nothing against tregear that tregear must be conservative be perhaps natural enough at rate be not disgraceful that must have political creed sufficiently at heart to be able to persuade man be to credit be gentleman well educated superior in many thing to silverbridge there be who said that silverbridge have redeemed from contempt from sort of contempt might be supposed to await young nobleman who have painted residence of head of college by fact of having chosen friend duke be essentially just man though at very moment in request be made heart be half crushed by son apostasy gave permission asked know mr finn tregear said to friend one morning at breakfast remember life used to be great deal with grandfather believe left lot of diamond money that must have know whether diamond be not locked up somewhere now so that can take when plea what singular woman be odd have fad about what make ask about mr finn want to go see what about think have heard mother speak of a though loved dearly said tregear know about loving dearly be intimate mr finn used to be with very much when be in country be at matching just now when poor mother died why doe want to see have written to from matching want to see well to tell truth know what have to say to though can guess what do guess be something about sister will have to give up tregear think not yes will father will never stand know what there be to stand be not noble be rich be a good gentleman a be dear fellow said young lord know very well what think about that fellow be not better to because have got title yet because owns county men have idea feeling about father be rich man of course will want daughter to marry rich man father be noble will want daughter to marry nobleman ca very well marry mary without permission therefore have better let alone have even asked permission a yet even mother be afraid to speak to about never knew to be afraid to say anything else to will not be afraid said tregear looking grimly must be difference between ca very well eat even bite will abuse can look at can say word two will find very hard to bear governor be quietest man know have way of making disagreeable when wish that never saw equalled at rate have better go see mr finn then tregear wrote line to mr finn made appointment chapter iv park lane from beginning of affair tregear have found necessity of bolstering up inwardly in great attempt by motto proverb instigation to courage addressed to none brave deserve fair de l'audace et encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace be man naturally of good heart in such matter who be not afraid of brother men yet of woman sister in affair knew very much persistence must be required of that even with such persistence might probably fail unless must find more than ordinary constancy in girl that duke must not eat indeed that nobody must eat a long a carried a honest man gentleman be to inward assurance on leaned much yet be conscious almost with feeling of shame that in italy have not spoken to duke about daughter because be afraid lest duke might eat in affair must have be careful from first to keep own hand thoroughly clean have not be duty a gentleman to

though love of have arisen from sweetness of meeting in london idea have be dissipated by great misfortune of death of lady mary mother from be driven to acknowledge to that silence in italy have be wrong that have be weak in allowing to be guided by counsel of duchess that have already armed duke with one strong argument against did not doubt that mr finn must be opposed to of course must not doubt that world must now be opposed to except girl herself must find other friend so generous so romantic so unworldly a duchess have be be clear to that lady mary have told story of engagement to mr

have never seen have heard much also of husband there have be kind of mystery about people did not quite understand how be that have be so intimate with duchess why late duke have left to enormous legacy a yet have never be claimed there be supposed too to have be something especially romantic in marriage with present husband be believed also that be very rich rumour of thing together have made person of note tregear when found alone in drawing room looked round about a though special interest be to be attached to belonging of such woman be pretty room somewhat dark because curtain be almost closed across window furnished with pretty taste now in early april day filled with flower have to apologise mr tregear for keeping waiting said a entered room fear be before time know that be after mine few minute said lady told that though be not young woman yet be attractive be dark still wore black hair in curl such a be now seldom seen with lady perhaps reduced light of chamber have be regulated with regard to complexion to age effect however be good frank tregear felt at once interested in have just come up from matching said yes only day before yesterday be very good of to come to so soon of course came when sent for be afraid duke felt loss severely how must not loss a be few people knew how much trusted how dearly loved silverbridge have told that be awfully cut up have seen lord silverbridge then just at present be living with at carlton terrace in duke house asked with surprise yes in duke house silverbridge have be very intimate of course duke know that be there be there chance of coming to town not yet fear be determined to be alone wish be otherwise a be sure must better bear sorrow if must go about among other men doubt must suffer le said tregear then there be pause wished that other must introduce matter knew be to be subject of conversation tregear must not begin when left at florence said little thought must never see again have be intimate with mr tregear yes think may say have be intimate with have be at eton at christ church with silverbridge have always be much together have understood have duke be good friend have never be enemy suppose not

to ride oh yes lord silverbridge lord gerald duchess used to drive one of must always be with so became intimate with whole family so became intimate with whole family especially so with lady mary said in sweetest possible tone with most gracious smile especially so with lady mary replied will be very good of mr tregear if endure forgive cross questioning from who be perfect stranger to be not perfect stranger to be of course now if will allow will explain to exactly what footing with be when duchess returned when found to be so ill a passed through london went down with into country quite a matter of course so understand there died in arm will not try to harass by telling what few day be how absolutely be struck to ground how terrible be grief of daughter how boy be astonished by feeling of loss after few day went away be think father wish that must go too be going away have felt indeed directly spirit have parted from be only in way in house stayed at request because did not wish daughter to be alone can easily understand that mr finn wanted to go to lady cantrip who have invited must not in way be thrown together in closest intercourse for two three week then told story of engagement be natural suppose surely so think of position left a be without mother be incumbent on to tell someone there be however one other person in whom must have be much better that must have confided what person father rather fancy that be who ought to tell a far a understand thing mr tregear indeed be very imperfectly think be natural that girl must at once tell mother when gentleman have made understand that love did so mr finn suppose generally mother must tell father did not therefore position of young lady be now one of great embarrassment duchess have gone from must now make up mind a to what have better be done be out of question that lady mary must be allowed to consider to be engaged that father must be kept in ignorance of position paused for reply a said nothing continued must tell duke must do so must do so suppose told in confidence doubt told presuming must not betray will if be betrayal duke must know will be infinitely better that must know through through than through must be told ca quite see why said tregear for sake whom suppose love certainly love in order that may not suffer wonder see mr tregear perhaps have sister have sister a happens can imagine what feeling must be must like to think of sister a being engaged to man without knowledge of of family be not so duchess knew present condition of thing be altogether accident be accident must be brought to end of course must be brought to end be not such fool a to suppose that can make wife without telling father mean at once mr tregear seems to that be rather dictating to mr finn owe apology of course for meddling in affair at a will be more conducive to success that duke must hear from than from a feel that be bound by duty to to lady mary to see that be not left in ignorance think that be doing service like to have constraint put upon that mr tregear be what gentleman fancy very often feel in regard to lady constraint of speak be necessary for protection be unwilling to see duke be very unwilling must not confess so much gave various reason for delay urging repeatedly that question of marriage be one must not press upon duke so soon after death of duchess when assured that be matter of importance so great that even death of man wife must not be held by to justify delay became angry for awhile insisted that must be allowed to follow own judgment gave promise that must see duke before week be over nevertheless left house in dudgeon having told mr finn more than once that be taking advantage of lady mary confidence hardly parted a friend feeling be on whole hostile to to love must not thought be for happiness of one a lady mary that must give to one who seemed to have so little to recommend when have left be angry with own weakness have not only promised that must make application to duke that must do so within period of week who be that must exact term from after fashion prescribe day hour now because strange woman have spoken to be compelled to make journey down to duke country house seek interview in must surely be snubbed occurred on wednesday resolved that must go down to matching on next monday said nothing of plan to one not word passed between lord silverbridge about lady mary during first two three day on saturday silverbridge appeared at breakfast with letter in hand governor be coming up to town said immediately in course of next week say that think will be here on wednesday immediately struck tregear that sudden journey must have reference to lady mary engagement do know why be coming because of vacancy in parliament why must

annoy kind of thing what deuce be fellow to do if man have got political conviction of own of course must stick to young lord said with good deal of self assurance a though by light of own reason have ascertained on side truth lay in political contest of day there be good deal to be said on side of question boy at particular moment tregear felt that duke ought to be propitiated must have give up conviction seat in parliament be great thing can probably secure whichever side take thought be so devilish hot against radical so be then be a be bound by family allegiance will be shot if be one never know how to understand nowadays used to be great doctrine with that nothing must induce man to vote against political opinion so be if have really got however a father be coming to london need not go down to matching mean to say that be going to matching have intended to beard lion in country den now lion will find in own town den must beard here then tregear wrote most chilling note to mr

first blow have fallen upon be quite sure that must disapprove of thing be quite sure that must be very angry knew that be peculiarly just man yet thought that in must be unjust have be called upon to sing praise of father must have insisted above thing on absolute integrity of mind yet knowing a did that must be opposed to marriage with mr tregear assured day hour that have right to make such objection man loved be gentleman honest man by mean fool subject to vice father have right to demand that must give heart to rich man to one of high rank rank a for rank told that have most supreme contempt for thought that have seen near enough already to be sure that ought to have special allurement what be doing for simply restraining choice among comparatively few who seemed to by mean best endowed of god creature of one thing be very sure that under pressure whatsoever must abandon engagement with mr tregear that to have become bond almost a holy a matrimony must be have told man that loved after there must be no retreat have kissed have returned caress have told that be a arm be round have acknowledged that be so that belonged to must not be taken away from be to compact so sacred

said duke angrily thought that two side be be going to express opinion that two party might be supposed to stand a equal in respect of country when interrupted pallisers have always be liberal will be blow to indeed if silverbridge desert colour know that a yet have have deep thought on subject unfortunately doe not give much to thinking in matter be being talked over by young man whose position in life have hardly justified great intimacy have existed be very far from being comfortable to of course said nothing in defence of tregear politics at present be disposed to say anything a to position in life though at future time might not be so silent few day later be again walking together when spoke to about herself can not bear that must be left here alone while be away said will not be long

about five o'clock in afternoon immediately went to study intending to dine spend evening there alone son have already pleaded engagement for afternoon have consented to devote following morning to father wish of other sojourner in house duke have thought nothing other sojourner have thought very much of duke frank tregear be fully possessed of courage induces man who know that must be thrown over precipice to choose first possible moment for fall have sounded silverbridge about change in politics have found friend quite determined not to go back to family doctrine such being case duke ill will hardness general severity must probably be enhanced by interview with son tregear therefore thinking that nothing must be got by delay sent name in to duke before have be hour in house asked for interview servant brought back word that grace be fatigued must see mr tregear if matter in question be one of importance frank heart quailed for moment only for moment took up pen wrote note dear

son have taken way of making communication to respecting political creed overture demand be to be preferred through tregear if so be proof of certain anxiety a to matter on son part be not displeasing to be not left long in mistake after tregear have entered room sir said speaking quite at once a soon a door be closed behind still speaking very slowly looking beautiful a apollo a stood upright before wished for father in law sir have come to to ask to give hand of daughter few word have be all arranged beforehand be now spoken without appearance of fear shame one hearing must have imagined that almost penniless young gentleman be asking in marriage daughter of richest greatest nobleman in england hand of daughter said duke rising from chair know how very great be prize said frank how unworthy be of a think worthy what lady mary think worthy yes grace believe on hearing frank simply bowed head beg pardon mr tregear mean to say that believe never yet gave lie to gentleman hope never may be driven to do so there must be mistake in be complying with lady mary wish in asking permission to enter house a suitor duke stood for moment biting lip in silence can not believe said at last can not bring to believe there must be mistake daughter lady mary palliser again young man bowed head what be pretension simply regard of course be impossible be not so ignorant that must have known a much when came to there be so much scorn in word in tone in be uttered that tregear in turn be becoming angry have prepared to bow humbly before great man before duke before croesus before late prime minister before man who be to be regarded a certainly one of most exalted of earth have not prepared to be looked at a duke looked at truth lord duke be said that daughter love that be engaged to other a far a engagement can be made without sanction a father can not have be made at said duke can only hope can of only hope that little time may soften be out of question there must be end of altogether must neither see hear from in way communicate with be altogether impossible believe sir that have mean very little at present duke how did think be to live be altogether unnecessary to speak of such matter a that there be so many reason to make impossible that must be useless to discus one a being more important than others have other one of family known of added wishing to ascertain whether lord silverbridge have disgraced by lending hand to disposition of sister oh yes said tregear who have known duchess sir have sympathy approval believe word of said duke becoming extremely red in face be forced to do now that have just declared that have never done in life driven by desire of heart to acquit wife have lost of terrible imprudence worse than imprudence of be now accused be second time lord that have found necessary to tell that have not believed direct assertion made luckily for two assertion be capable of earliest most direct proof will believe lady mary will confirm in one other duke be almost beside with emotion grief did know though now at moment be most loath to own to that be so that dear wife have be most imprudent of woman recognised in encouragement of most pernicious courtship if have encouraged repetition of romantic folly by have so nearly brought to shipwreck in own early life if have be so even whether have be so not have be wrong to tell man that did not believe man have rebuked with dignity at rate be impossible repeated can not allow that be impossible be for to judge sir trust that will excuse when say that also must hold to be in degree judge in matter if be in place must feel must not possibly be in place if grace be in place must feel that a long a be assured by young lady that affection be valued by must not be deterred by opposition of father that must yield to of course expect that lady mary must be persistent in present feeling when know mind perhaps have right to hope must be so persistent a to make feel that happiness depends a mine doe on marriage then will believe that will yield at last never said duke never will never believe that daughter happiness can be assured by step must regard a disgraceful to disgraceful be violent word lord be only word will express meaning one must be bold enough to say be not justified in using must become wife to morrow one in england must think have disgraced queen must receive on marriage friend must hold out hand to presuming that have goodwill must not have disgrace must not depend upon lord must daughter so dispose of a to disgrace think to be impossible countenance must not set right can withdrawal of countenance condemn before world if doe that with other lady might do remain lady duke when heard even in midst of wrath be very violent in midst of anger be very acute felt that have to deal with man with one whom must not put off from into gutter there leave a buried in mud there came too feeling upon have time to analyse of be part aware that terrible indiscretion on part of daughter of late wife be le wonderful than have at first appeared to be not on account be le determined to make young man feel that parental opposition must be invincible be quite impossible sir think that need say anything more then while tregear be meditating whether to make reply duke asked question have better have be left unasked asking of diminished somewhat from ducal grand ducal quasi archducal almost godlike superiority have assumed showed curiosity of mere man have anybody else be aware of said still wishing to know whether have cause for anger against silverbridge in matter mr finn be aware of answered tregear mr finn exclaimed duke a though have be stung by adder be woman whom have prayed to remain awhile with daughter after wife have be laid in grave in order that there might be someone near whom must trust very woman whom have so trusted whom in early association with have disliked distrusted have taught to like to trust because wife have loved woman be pandarus who have managed matter between tregear daughter wife have be too much subject to influence that have always known now in last act of life have allowed to be persuaded to give up daughter by baneful wile of most pernicious woman such be working of duke mind when young man told that mr finn be acquainted with whole affair a reader be aware nothing must have be more unjust mentioned name said tregear because thought have be friend of family will do sir have be greatly pained a well a surprised by what have heard of real state of case can form opinion till see daughter of course will hold further intercourse with paused a though for promise tregear did not feel called upon to say word in one direction in other will be care that will not do so good morning sir tregear who during interview have be standing then bowed turned upon heel left room duke seated crossing arm upon chest sat for hour looking up at ceiling why be that for world of misery

matching must content with simply telling that wish on part be disgraceful that must never be fulfilled must argue matter with endeavouring a did so to persuade gently that be wrong to place affection so low so to obtain from assurance that idea must be abandoned latter course must be infinitely better if only must accomplish be conscious of own hardness of manner be aware that have never succeeded in establishing confidence between daughter be thing for have longed a plain girl might long to posse charm of acknowledged beauty a poor little fellow five foot in height might long to have cubit

course be to have be asked papa be that in accordance with idea of what must be conduct of young lady in position nobody meant to conceal anything from papa have be so far concealed yet young man have self confidence to come to to demand hand a though be matter of course must accede to so trivial request be a matter of course quite impossible understand that do not when did not answer at once repeated question ask whether feel that be altogether impossible papa said in lowest possible whisper still in such whisper that must hear word with so much clearness that must judge from voice of obstinacy of mind then mary becomes duty to tell that be quite impossible will not have thought of there must be end of why papa why be astonished that must ask why must not have allowed papa to go to unless have unless have loved then must conquer love be disgraceful must be conquered disgraceful yes be sorry to use such word to own child be so if will promise to be guided by in matter if will undertake not to see more will if not forget at rate pardon be silent will excuse because be young be thrown imprudently in way there have believe be someone at work in matter with whom ought to be more angry than with say that will obey there be nothing within father power will not do for to make life happy be thus that strove not to be stern heart indeed be tender enough there be nothing tender in tone of voice in glance of eye though be very positive in what said yet be shy shamefaced even with own daughter too have blushed when told that must conquer love that must be told that have disgraced be terrible to that father must speak of marriage with man a event be impossible made very unhappy that must talk of pardoning a for great fault be in misery have not on account least idea of giving up lover young a be have own peculiar theory on matter own code of conduct honour from did not mean to be driven of course have not expected that father must yield at first word doubt must wish that must make more exalted marriage have known that must have to encounter opposition though have not expected to be told that have disgraced a sat there resolved that under pretence must give up lover be so far abashed that must not find word to express too have be silent for few moment before again asked for promise will tell mary that will not see again think that can say that papa why not oh papa how can when of people in world love best be not without pang that one can be told that who be of dearest have other one who to be dearest such pain father mother have to bear though think arrow be never so blunted that leaf something of wound behind there be in most case if not perfect salve still ample consolation mother know that be good that child must love man better than world beside that must be taken away to become wife mother father when delight of eye cease to assure that be nearest dearest though abandon treasure of nearestness dearestness with soft melancholy still know that be a must be of course that other be person love best in world be not so how evil thing must be that must marry be not so with reference to how void must her life be now to poor duke wound have salve consolation when be told that young tregear be owner of girl sweet love be treasure of heart shrank a though arrow with sharp point be pricking over will not hear of such love said what be to say papa say that will obey then sat silent do not know that be not fit to be husband papa then can not have thought much of position of mine be gentleman papa so be private secretary there be not clerk in one of public office who doe not consider to be gentleman curate of parish be gentleman medical man who come here from bradstock word be too vague to carry with meaning ought to be serviceable to in thinking of matter know other way of dividing people said showing thereby that have altogether made up mind a to what ought to be serviceable to be not called upon to divide people that division requires so much experience that be bound in matter to rely upon to whom obedience be due can not think must have known that be not entitled to give love to man without being assured that man must be approved of by by by be going to say parent be stopped by remembrance of wife imprudence saw be too noble to plead mother authority be not too dutiful to cast reproach upon when be so stern to have be so little with papa be true said after pause be true have be fault will mend be reason for forgiveness will forgive must tell that there will be end to papa what do mean that a love mr tregear a have told so a have promised will be true to can not let there be end to suppose that will be allowed to see again hope so most assuredly not do write to papa never never since have be

must do must not wish so to guard that must have power of sending letter by permission must not like will have to be so if do write will tell show what write papa not will tell have written then occurred to that bargaining be altogether derogatory to parental authority by mean likely to impress upon mind conviction that tregear must be completely banished from thought began already to find how difficult must be for to have charge of such daughter how impossible that must conduct charge with sufficient firmness yet with sufficient tenderness at present have done no good have only be made more wretched than ever by obstinacy surely must pas over to charge of lady of lady who must be a determined a be that must not throw away by marrying mr tregear there will be no writing said visiting communication of kind a refuse to obey now have better go to room chapter ix in medias re perhaps method of rushing at once in medias re be of way of beginning story separate branch of story least objectionable reader be made to think that gold lie so near surface that will be required to take very little trouble in digging for writer be enabled at rate for time till neck have become a be warm to collar to throw off from difficulty danger tedium prolixity of description rushing in medias re have doubtless charm of ease certainly when threw from garret window to stony pavement below did not anticipate that must fall so far without injury to life limb when story have be begun after fashion without prelude without description of garret of pavement of lady thrown of speaker great amount of trouble seems to have be saved mind of reader fill up blank if erroneously still satisfactorily know at least that heroine have encountered terrible danger have escaped from with almost incredible good fortune that demon of piece be bold demon not ashamed to speak of own iniquity that heroine demon be so far united that have be in garret together there be drawback on system that be almost impossible to avoid necessity of doing sooner later that must naturally be done at first answer perhaps for dozen chapter to carry reader pleasantly for dozen chapter be great matter after that certain nebulous darkness gradually seems to envelope character incident be going on in country be in town perhaps in colony how old be be tall be fair be heroine like in form gait after how high be garret window have always found that detail must insist on being told at last that by rushing in medias re be simply presenting cart before horse a reader like cart best will do once again trying only for branch of story will endeavour to let a little a possible of horse be seen afterwards so poor frank have be turned out of heaven said lady mabel grex to young lord silverbridge who told have said nothing about to anybody of course told said young beauty be aware that in word beauty perhaps also in word young little bit of horse be appearing be already sure that will have to show head neck even if not very tail poor frank did hear heard nothing lady mab know nothing know that awful governor wo let stay longer in carlton terrace yes know why not must lord grex allow percival to have friend living here earl grex be lady mabel father lord percival be earl son earl lived in belgrave square be little bit of horse certainly not in first place be here that make difference certainly of course make difference must be wanting to make love to doubt must know therefore must do for to live here then papa be living here then permission never have be given suppose frank did not go there at first without duke knowing daresay that have mentioned might a well tell about be cousin know frank tregear through mother family be second cousin to lady mabel a be also lord silverbridge one of grexes having at remote period married palliser be bit of horse governor merely seemed to think that must like to have own house to like other people what as tregear be to say anything to about think be as at of course have to tell that be changing residence say that be going to take back bedroom somewhere near seven dial have got very nice room in duke street have seen then of course have poor fellow wish have little money be so nice now lord silverbridge do mean to say that there be not something in wind about lady mary if there be must not talk about said lord silverbridge be very innocent young gentleman be very interesting young lady ought to think so for interest very much about be duke very angry about not standing for county be vexed do think be so odd that man must be expected to be that in politics because father happened to be so before understand how must expect that must remain with party so utterly snobbish down in world a radical everybody be worth anything be leaving have not left suppose must have never belonged to lady mab never will hope always told papa that must certainly be one of took place in drawing room of lord grex house there be lady grex alive there lived with earl certain elderly lady reported to be in distant way cousin of family named miss cassewary who in matter of looking after lady mab did what be supposed to be absolutely necessary now entered room with bonnet on having just returned from church what be text asked lady mab at once if have gone to church a ought to have done dear must have heard a did think text alone will do good probably forget dear how do do lord silverbridge be conservative miss ca of course be be quite sure that young nobleman of so much taste intellect must take better side forget that be saying be against father family miss cassewary dare say be different when father be young man father too be not very long since at head of government contained many conservative look upon father a radical though perhaps must not be justified in calling conservative well certainly not think now be necessary that nobleman in england must rally to defence of order miss cassewary be great politician be one of who be always foreseeing ruin of country dear will go take bonnet off perhaps will have tea when come down go said lady mabel when silverbridge got up to take departure always do when tea come be going to dine here not that know of in first place nobody have asked in second place be engaged thirdly care about having to talk politics to miss ca fourthly hate family dinner on sunday in first place ask secondly

know what mean be that like troubling father leave to will tell be coming frank too of course can bring then can talk to when papa go down to club can arrange politics with miss ca so be settled at eight o'clock lord silverbridge reappeared in belgrave square with frank tregear earl grex be nobleman of very ancient family grexes having held parish of grex in yorkshire from time long prior to conquest in saying be know allowing horse to appear wholesale find that can not be kept out may a well go on to say that present earl be better known at newmarket beaufort where spent large part of life in playing whist than in house of lord be grey haired handsome worn out old man who through long life of pleasure have greatly impaired fortune for earl have never be magnificent who now strove hard not always successfully to remedy that evil by gambling a must no longer eat drink a have used to do a cared no longer for light lie in lady eye there be not much left to in world card racing nevertheless be handsome old man of polished manner when chose to use staunch conservative much regarded by party for whom in early life have done work in house of common silverbridge be very well

walked down alone lord silverbridge followed with daughter frank tregear gave arm to miss cassewary if woman ca clear soup better than might a well go to d said earl upon remark one in company made observation a there be two men servant in room when be made cook probably have advantage of may be almost unnecessary to add that though earl have polished manner for certain occasion must sometimes throw off in bosom of own family lord said miss cassewary always called lord lord silverbridge be going to stand for duke borough in conservative interest did know duke have borough said earl have one till thought proper to give up said son taking father part be going to pay off for what have done by standing against be just sort of thing for son to do in day if have borough percival must go down

there have be little difference of opinion between father son a to signing of deed father doe not take in bad part at said silverbridge perhaps be ratting said earl when man lends to coalition be a good a half gone think that in england there be so thorough liberal a father said lord silverbridge when say that doe take badly mean that doe vex know vexes doe quarrel with even wrote down to barsetshire to say that expense at silverbridge be to be paid call very bad politics said earl seems to to be very grand said frank perhaps sir know what be good what be bad in politics said earl trying to snub guest be difficult to snub frank know gentleman when see think said of course silverbridge be right to be conservative nobody have stronger opinion about than have duke be behaving so well that if be must almost regret so do said silverbridge when lady be gone old earl turned round to fire having filled glass pushed bottle away from a though meant to leave two young men to sat

pallisers be obstinate be silverbridge obstinate asked stiff necked a bull if take into head to be so must have thought because be so soft in manner often find easier to be led by others than to direct then remained silent for few second be thinking of same thing wishing to speak of word came to first wonder what think of whereupon tregear only smiled suppose have spoken to about why do ask why why must tell suppose must have said to in confidence of friendship that think ugly stupid be sure have not said that have eye to see ear to hear though be ugly stupid need like do want to like

then unless friend tell that thing be suitable love such a to be out of question a be fit must be married wish to be married well will love after fashion yes after very sterling fashion will make wish wish way way party party home home ambition ambition honour honour a said stood up with hand clenched head erect eye flashing do not know well enough to be sure must be loyal to yes think that must be loyal whether loved not must love think that silverbridge must do yes think that silverbridge must do doubt will say that be flying high not too high why must not fly high if can justify surely can not accuse be hardly same thing frank of course there be not girl in london to whom lord silverbridge must not be best match that must make have choice of most girl must think twice before refusing very few must think twice before accepting perhaps wish to add to wealth by marrying richly a father did thought on subject will ever trouble will be a happens a soon a take sufficient fancy to girl will ask straight off say that might not change afterwards must mean at time if have once said word to must not change then what right have to expect have ever said about very little have said much

glad to see wife said a must be somebody wife not mine can not be yours frank can not mine repeated will endeavour to be glad who can explain feeling in such matter though most truly love girl hope to marry yet heart go back to former thing open to past regret know whispered must be too wise to permit to be tormented by such foolish melancholy a said took hand half with purpose of bidding good bye partly with idea of giving expression to tenderness of feeling a did so door be opened old earl shambled into room what deuce be doing here said have be talking to lady mabel for about hour indeed know for how long papa be going to be married when said frank tregear turned round looked at almost in anger going to be married be who be fortunate woman think will let tell not yet think said frank

intimacy with frank tregear be now nearly two year since have be assured over over again by miss cassewary that need not be afraid of frank tregear have in sort of way assented to young man visit

have gone deep with thing go deep with have said too from other source have heard something of girl be afraid that must go deep be thousand pity then asked whether marriage ought to be regarded a impossible duke have be very positive have declared again again that be quite impossible have so expressed a to make aware that intended to understand that must not yield whatever suffering of girl might be lady cantrip knew world well be aware that in such matter daughter be apt to be stronger than father have declared tregear to be young man with very small mean intent on such pleasure a require great mean for enjoyment worse character must be given to gentleman who have proposed a son in law lady cantrip thought possible that duke might be mistaken in have never seen mr tregear fancied that have heard name that name have be connected with character different from duke have given lady cantrip who at time be young looking woman not much above forty have two daughter of whom be married younger about year since have become wife of lord nidderdale middle aged young man who have be long about town cousin of late duchess heir to marquisate member of parliament marriage have not

laughing well see so much of a used to do tregear be not bad fellow at be always with silverbridge when silverbridge doe what tregear tell go along pretty straight unfortunately there be man called

grex last year lady cantrip be inclined from what now learned to think that duke must be wrong about young man before lady mary joined made further inquiry too knew lady mabel knowing lady mabel knew miss cassewary contrived to find alone with miss cassewary asked further question about mr tregear be cousin of lord said miss ca so thought wonder what sort of young man be be good deal with lord silverbridge then miss cassewary spoke opinion very plainly if lord silverbridge have nobody worse about than mr tregear must not come to much harm suppose be not very well off certainly not will have property of kind believe when mother dy think very well of mr tregear only wish that have profession why be asking about lady cantrip nidderdale be talking to about saying that be so much with lord silverbridge lord silverbridge be going into parliament now a be beginning world must be thousand pity that must get into bad hand may however be doubted whether miss cassewary be hoodwinked by little story early in second week in may duke brought daughter up to horn at same time expressed intention of remaining in london when did so lady mary at once asked whether might not be with must not permit house in london must said be more gloomy even than matching be quite ashamed of giving so much trouble lady mary said to new friend be delighted to have dear know that have be obliged to leave london because be with there be nothing like so much a place father have be kind enough to lend a for london there be nothing now to make like being there girl be married therefore regard a old woman who have done work think place very much nicer than london at time of year know london at have only just be brought out when poor mamma went abroad life led be very quiet must probably have be felt to be dull by lady cantrip in spite of old age desire for retirement place be very lovely may of month of year be in england most insidious most dangerous most inclement greatcoat can not be endured without greatcoat who can endure may wind live of month be prettiest grass be then greenest young foliage of tree while have glory colour of spring vegetation doe not hide form of branch a do heavy mass of

row of flowering ash drooping bough of in place touched water be one of spot when be first seen make beholder feel that to be able to live there look at always must be happiness enough for life at end of week there came visitor to see lady mary very pretty carriage be driven up to door of horn servant asked for lady mary palliser owner of carriage be mr finn now must be explained to reader that there have never be friendship between mr finn lady cantrip though lady have met other great political intimacy have existed between duke lord cantrip have created intimacy also between wife duchess lady cantrip have be friend after fashion mr finn have never be cordially accepted by among whom lady cantrip chiefly lived when therefore name be announced servant expressly stating that visitor have asked for lady mary lady cantrip who be with guest have to bethink what must do duke who be at time very full of wrath against mr finn have not mentioned lady name when delivering up charge of daughter to lady cantrip at moment occurred to that not improbably mr finn must cease to be included in intimacy of palliser family from time of death of duchess that duke must not care to maintain old relation that must be a little anxious to do for daughter a for if so must be right that mr finn must come down here to house be now in occupation of lady with whom be not on inviting term in order that might thus force on duke daughter mr finn have not left carriage have sent in to ask if lady mary must see in there be considerable embarrassment looked round at guest who have at once risen from chair must wish to see asked lady cantrip oh yes certainly have seen since since came home from italy oh dear yes be down at matching when poor mamma died papa persuaded to remain afterwards of course will see then servant be desired to ask mr finn to come in while be being done lady cantrip retired mr finn embraced young friend asked after welfare after welfare of house in be staying house with mr finn have be well acquainted said dozen pretty little thing in own quiet pretty way before spoke of matter have really brought to horn on day have have correspondence with father mary indeed unfortunately one have be far from agreeable to be sorry for mr finn so be very sorry may say with perfect truth that there be man in world except own husband for whom feel so perfect esteem a do for father if be not that like to be carried away by strong language must speak of more than esteem through dear mother have watched conduct closely have come to think that there be perhaps other man at same time so just so patriotic now be very angry with most unjustly angry be about yes be about have not be altogether about must not have troubled about yes about mr tregear also when tell that there have be correspondence must explain have written one long letter to duke that in answer have received very short one have be whole correspondence here be father letter to then brought out of pocket note lady mary read covered with blush a did so note be a follows duke of omnium understands from mr finn letter mr finn while be duke guest at matching be aware of certain circumstance affecting duke honour happiness circumstance certainly did not communicate to duke duke think that trust have be placed in mr finn must have made communication imperative duke feel that further correspondence between mr finn on matter must lead to good result do understand asked mr finn think so simply mean that when at matching have thought worthy of having for time charge of of welfare that have trusted who be friend of dear mother to take for time in regard to place have be so unhappily left vacant by death mean also deceived betrayed that trust by being privy to engagement on part of disapproves of be not then aware suppose doe mean that yes lady mary be what mean mean further to let know that a did so foully betray trust have placed in that a have consented to play part of assistant to in secret engagement therefore cast off a altogether unworthy of esteem acquaintance be a though have told in so many word among woman have known none more vile more false than not that mr finn yes that of that tell that then say that there will be no more word spoken written about can hardly submit to so stern judgment know truth lady mary call lady mary quarrel with if father have quarrelled with must not be fit that must be friend duty to must forbid must not have come to now did not feel that be bound to justify thing of be accused be so repugnant to that be obliged to do something to say something even though subject be one on must so willingly be silent what can do mr finn be mr tregear who first told that father be angry with knew what have done why be bound to tell in order might have opportunity of setting right with duke then wrote explained everything how have told of engagement how have then urged mr tregear that must not keep such matter secret from father in answer to letter have received that will write tell papa must be made to understand that from moment in heard of engagement be urgent with with mr tregear that must be informed of will remember what passed remember did not conceive to be duty to tell duke did conceive to be duty to see must be told now writes a though have known secret from first a though have be concealing from at very moment in be asking to remain at matching on behalf consider to be hard unjust can not deny what say did know of while be at matching for be at matching that told implies that knew before when told story did feel that be duty to see that matter be not kept longer from did duty now father take upon to rebuke take upon at same time to forbid to write to again will tell mr finn let understand wish to write to again after what have passed can not say wish to see again think must acknowledge to that have be mistaken need not then fear that will trouble with reply will know that have acquitted of fault of can not bear to think must be accused then took somewhat formal though still affectionate farewell of girl want to see papa a soon a possible said lady mary when be again with lady cantrip reason for wish be soon given then whole story told think that must have gone to papa at once lady mary asked be point of moral law on elder woman who have have girl of own found hard to give immediate answer certainly be expedient that parent must know at once of engagement by daughter may seek to contract be expedient that must be able to prevent secret contract lady cantrip felt strongly that mr finn having accepted confidential charge of daughter must not without gross betrayal of trust allow to be depositary of such secret did not allow herself said lady mary pleading for friend left house without telling dear be because of what did that be told be true doubt whether must have left hour in ignorance be who told must have betrayed be not fit recipient for confidence mary wish to accuse seems to be high minded woman think that papa have be hard upon mamma knew always said mary to lady cantrip must give answer cause for anger duke might have against mr finn there have be cause for much more against wife have freed from accusation by death lady mary wrote to father declaring that be most particularly anxious to see talk to about mr finn chapter xiii duke injustice advantage be obtained by lady mary interview with father persisted that mr finn have be untrue to when left matching without telling that knew of daughter engagement with mr tregear doubt by degree that idea at first entertained be expelled from head idea that have be cognisant of whole thing before came to matching even be done so slowly that there be moment at became aware of lessened feeling of indignation to thinking have betrayed trust must not be got by daughter to say that must forgive certainly must not be got to say that must apologise for accusation have made be nothing le that daughter asked must hardly refrain from anger when asked there must not have be moment said before came to told poor lady mary position be certainly uncomfortable enough great sin sin be so great that to have known for day without revealing be in damning sin on part of mr finn be lady mary sin differed so entirely from father a to think that sin of own be virtue that to have spoken of to must have be on part of mr finn treachery so deep that woman ought to have forgiven when spoke of matter deeply affected honour must hardly refrain from asserting that honour be quite safe in daughter hand when in heart declared that must have be mr finn first care to save from disgrace lady mary did break out papa there must be disgrace that for moment will be laid aside said with manner by even peer in council have never be able not to be awed if communicate with mr finn at must make understand that regard conduct a inexcusable nothing have be gained poor lady mary be compelled to write few line be to most painful in writing dear mr finn have seen papa think that ought to have told when told occurs to that must have be cruel thing to do most unfair to mr tregear who be quite willing to go to papa have only put off doing so because of poor mamma death a have told mamma of course be right that must tell papa then told because be so kind to be so sorry have got into trouble what can do told must write to suppose be better must although what have to say be so unpleasant hope will all blow over in time because love dearly may be quite sure of one thing will never change in assurance writer be alluding not to friendship for friend love for lover so friend understood hope thing will be settled day then may be able to meet very affectionate friend mary palliser mr finn when received be alone in house in park lane husband be down in north of england on subject have not spoken to fearing that must feel bound to take step to support wife under treatment have received even though must quarrel with duke be most anxious that husband must not be compelled to do so connection have be political rather than personal there be many reason why there must be open cause of disruption between husband be hot headed be to be told that letter shown to duke have written there must be word between duke must probably make impossible further connection between troubled very much be by mean not alive to honour of duke friendship throughout intimacy with duchess have abstained from pressing on not because have be indifferent about that have perceived that might make way with better by standing aloof than by thrusting forward have known that have be successful must tell with pride that conduct towards have be always such a must become lady of high spirit fine feeling knew that have deserved well of that in intercourse with with uncle with wife have given much have taken little be last woman in world to let word on matter pas lip not le be conscious of merit towards have be led to act a have done by sincere admiration for man in political trouble have understood better than duchess have done looking on from distance have understood man character a have come to both from wife from own husband that be unjust to cruelly unjust be quite sure accused of intentional privity to secret behoved to know of being party to secrecy whereas from moment in have heard secret have determined that must be made known to felt that have deserved good opinion in thing in nothing more than in way in have acted in matter yet have treated with imperious harshness amounted to insolence what letter be that have written to very tip of ear tingled with heat a read again to herself none of ordinary courtesy of epistle craft have be preserved either in beginning in end be worse even than if have called madam without epithet duke understands duke think duke feel feel that must not be troubled with letter conversation upshot of being that duke declared to have shown unworthy of being treated like lady after that have done must not bear at present be that must say to herself be not angry with lady mary did not doubt that girl have done best in power to bring father to reason because lady mary have failed mr finn be not going to put up with so grievous injury be forced to bear alone there be none with whom must communicate one from whom must ask advice must not bring husband into quarrel might be prejudicial to position a member of political party there be one else to whom must tell secret of lady mary love yet must not bear injustice done to then wrote a follows to duke mr finn present compliment to duke of omnium mr finn find to be essential to that must see duke in reference to letter to if grace will let know on what day at what hour will be kind enough to call on mr finn will be at home to receive park lane thursday th may chapter xiv new member for silverbridge lord silverbridge be informed that must be right that must go down to silverbridge few day before election to make known to elector a day for election drew near be understood that there must be other candidate conservative side be popular side among tradesman of silverbridge silverbridge have be proud to be honoured by service of heir of house of omnium even while heir have be liberal have regarded a so much matter of course that borough must be at disposal that question a to politics have ever arisen while retained seat have duke chosen to continue to send liberal one after when went into house of lord there must have be question a to fitness of man men so sent silverbridge have be supposed to be liberal a matter of course because pallisers be liberal when matter be remitted to when duke declared that must not interfere more for be thus that borough have obtained freedom then borough began to feel conservative predilection if grace really doe mean to do just what please be thing never thought of asking from grace then find having turned matter over among ourselves that be upon whole conservative in spirit borough have elected certain mr fletcher in doing so borough have still shade of fear that must offend duke house of palliser gatherum castle duke of omnium special duke be so great in eye of borough that first only strong feeling in borough be one of duty borough did not altogether enjoy being enfranchised when duke have spoken once twice thrice then with hesitating heart borough returned mr fletcher now mr fletcher be wanted elsewhere having be persuaded to stand for county be comfort to borough that must resettle beneath warmth of wing of pallisers so matter stood when lord silverbridge be told that presence in borough for few hour must be taken a compliment hitherto one knew at silverbridge during boyhood have not be much at gatherum castle have done best to eschew place since have ceased to be boy pallisers took pride in gatherum castle disliked oh yes will go down said to mr morton who be up in town need go to great barrack suppose great barrack be castle will put up at inn mr morton begged heir to come to own house silverbridge declared that must prefer inn so matter be settled be to meet sundry politician mr sprugeon mr sprout mr du boung who must like to be thanked for what have done who be to go with must naturally have asked tregear from tregear have for last week two be not perhaps estranged separated have be much taken up with racing have gone down to chester with major tifto under major auspicious influence have won little money now be very anxiously preparing for newmarket second spring meeting have therefore passed much of time with major tifto when visit to silverbridge be pressed on thoughtlessly asked tifto to go with tifto be delighted lord silverbridge be to be met at silverbridge by various well known politician from neighbourhood major tifto be greatly elated by prospect of such introduction into political world sooner have offer be made by lord silverbridge than saw own indiscretion tifto be very well for chester newmarket very well perhaps for beargarden not very well for electioneering expedition idea came to young nobleman that if must be fate to represent silverbridge in parliament for next twenty year must be well that silverbridge must entertain respecting exalted estimation that silverbridge must be taught to regard a fit son of father worthy specimen of british political nobility struck by serious reflection of nature did open mind to tregear be very fond of tifto said know whether be just sort of fellow to take down to election must think not said tregear very decidedly be very good fellow know said silverbridge know honester man than tifto anywhere dare say rather dare say know nothing about major honesty doubt whether do ride very well what have to do with nothing on earth therefore advise not to take to silverbridge need preach may call what like tifto must not hold tongue there be nothing must say there must not be to prejudice will go if wish said tregear what will governor say that must be look out in political point of view will not disgrace will hold tongue look like gentleman neither of be in tifto power so be settled that on day one after conversation lord silverbridge tregear must go together to silverbridge major when on same night noble friend altered plan be explained to did not bear disappointment with equanimity be that little strange said becoming very red in face what do call strange said lord well 'd made arrangement when man have be asked to do thing like doe like to be put off truth be tifto when came to think of saw that going down to fellow about parliament sort of thing ought to have political atmosphere not racing betting hunting atmosphere there be man in london who care more about politics than do not very many perhaps who understand better to tell truth lord think be throwing over will make up to said silverbridge meaning to be kind will go down to newmarket with stick to like wax doubt will do said tifto who like fool failed to see where advantage lay can be useful at newmarket so will stick to look here major tifto said silverbridge if be dissatisfied can easily separate ourselves be not dissatisfied said little man almost cry then talk a though be a to silverbridge will not want there when asked be only thinking what must be pleasant to of since have remembered that business must be business even did not reconcile angry little man who a turned away declared within own little bosom that must take out of silverbridge for lord silverbridge tregear went down to borough together on journey something be said about lady mary something also about lady mabel from first know said lady mary brother never thought must answer why not answer because knew governor must not have money rank sort of thing be not particularly charming to still thing must go together be very well for to be pal of course will be expected that mary must marry swell swell if will have mean to call swell yes do said silverbridge with considerable resolution ought not to make disagreeable because understand about a well a anybody chance have made eldest son of duke heir to enormous fortune chance have made sister daughter of duke heiress also intimacy with ought to be proof at rate to that on account set up above other fellow when come to talk of marriage of course be serious thing have told more than once that have objection on own score have be only saying what duke will think be telling that be impossible told so before will be kept apart so so will forget something of kind of course have to trust to for if forgets well good need forget lord bless talk a though thing be not done day will hear morning that be going to marry fellow who have lot of money good position what difference will make then whether have forgotten not might almost have be supposed that young man have be acquainted with mother history after there be pause there arose conversation about other thing cigar be smoked then tregear returned once more to subject there be one thing wish to say about what be want to understand that nothing else will turn away from intention marriage on part a of speak nothing that father can do will turn ca marry without leave perhaps not that will never give suppose look forward to waiting till death if see that happiness really depends on will give leave depends on if judge father rightly be just a soft hearted a other people man who hold out be not man of firmest opinion man of hardest heart somebody will talk mary over if so thing be over depends on then went on to tell friend that have spoken of engagement to lady mabel have mentioned to soul to father to why to because be friend together a child never have sister have be more like sister to than one else do object to knowing not particularly seems to now that everybody know everything there be no longer secret be special friend of yours said silverbridge of yours said tregear well yes in sort of way be jolliest girl know take round for beauty intellect good sense fun at same time know one equal to be pity did fall in love with knew other too early for then have not shilling must think dishonest if did not tell must not afford to love girl who have money man must live woman too at station be met by mr sprugeon mr sprout who with many apology for meanness of such entertainment took up to george

liberal be of particularly glad to see lordship among said mr du boung have told lordship how perfectly satisfied be to see borough in lordship hand said mr sprugeon be sure must not be in better said mr du boung for be quite willing to postpone peculiar shade of politics to advantage of having father son a representative mr du boung said with much intention of imparting grace dignity to occasion thought that be doing great thing for house of omnium that house of omnium ought to know be very kind of said lord silverbridge who have not read a carefully a must have done letter have be sent to did not therefore quite understand position mr du boung have intended to stand said mr sprout retired in lordship favour said mr sprugeon in doing considered that studied interest of borough said mr du boung thought gave up because there be hardly footing for liberal said lordship very imprudently borough be always liberal till last election said mr du boung drawing up borough wish on occasion to be magnanimous said mr sprout probably having on mind confusion between magnanimity unanimity a lordship be coming among borough be anxious to sink politics altogether for moment said mr sprugeon there have doubt be compact between sprugeon sprout party du boung party in accordance with have be arranged that mr du boung must be entitled to certain amount of glorification in presence of lord silverbridge be in compliance with wish on part of borough lord said mr du boung a to own feeling be quite a strong a of other gentleman in borough conceived to be duty to give way lordship be quite aware how much owes to mr du boung said tregear whereupon lord silverbridge bowed now what be to do said lord silverbridge then there be little whispering between mr sprout mr sprugeon perhaps mr du boung said lordship have better call first on dr tempest perhaps said injured brewer a be to be party affair after have better retire from scene thought be to be given up said tregear oh certainly

of be to hear said landlord though there be in borough who must have wished lord that have stuck to old palliser politics said mr du boung have stuck to palliser politics just at present think that

like servant hardly excuse have even be made have be simply told that be not wanted be apt sometimes to tell that knew on side bread be buttered perhaps hardly knew how best to keep butter going there be little pride about be antagonistic to best interest of trade a perhaps be well that must inwardly suffer when injured must not be well that must declare to such men a nidderdale dolly longstaff popplecourt that did mean to put up with sort of thing certainly must not have spoken in strain before tregear of men living hated feared most knew that other man loved silverbridge a did tregear have

being only four to one glory of being part owner of probable winner of derby be so much to that must not bring to be altogether angry with tifto there be doubt that horse present condition be due entirely to tifto care tifto spent in few day just before race greatest part of time in close vicinity of horse only running up to london now then a fish come up to surface for breath of air be impossible that lord silverbridge must separate from major at rate till after epsom meeting have paid money for match without word of reproach to partner still with feeling thing be not quite a ought

then have be set afloat there have be rather frequent correspondence with mr morton who have once twice submitted total of money paid on behalf of correspondent lord silverbridge who imagined to be anything extravagant have wondered how figure must mount up so rapidly money needed be always forthcoming raising of objection never seemed to be carried back beyond mr morton promise to father about money lender have be scrupulously kept a long a ready money can be made to be forthcoming without charge for interest young man must be very foolish who will prefer to borrow at twenty five per cent

disciplinarian have raised voice a result young man up at trinity must get leave to be away on derby pretext lord gerald raged against restriction very loudly at first proclaimed intention of ignoring college authority altogether of course must be expelled order be to thinking so absurd idea that must not see brother horse run be so extravagant that argued that father must not be angry with for

have possessed power of putting veto upon there have be transaction lately between son with reference to cutting off certain entail under money be to be paid to lord percival money have not yet be forthcoming therefore earl be constrained to assent be very distasteful to earl came home therefore in bad humour said great many disagreeable thing to daughter know papa if must do anything must said

welfare see why deuce get married will have to do sooner later be not pleasant speech for daughter to hear from father a to that said must come not a chance will have if want to sign anything will sign for have be asked to sign paper in other word to surrender right for other matter must be left to myself then have be very disagreeable indeed dined out together of course with luxury that wealth can give there be well appointed carriage to take backwards forward to next square such a earl must have be splendidly dressed a became earl daughter be brilliant with star have be accorded to by sovereign grateful minister in return for staunch parliamentary support one looking at must have imagined that father must have told daughter that must marry out of way because a unmarried girl be burden during dinner be very gay to be gay be habit may almost say work of life so chanced that sat between sir timothy beeswax who in day be very great man indeed very dolly longstaff whom silverbridge in irony have proposed to a fitting suitor for hand be lord silverbridge cousin of yours asked sir timothy very distant one have come over to know be such triumph be so sorry to hear however a reader know be fib sorry said sir timothy surely lord grex daughter must be conservative oh yes be conservative because be born one think people in politics must remain a be born unless be very wise indeed when men come to be statesman kind of thing of course can change backwards forward hope be not intended for lady mabel certainly not know enough about to be personal that however be again not quite true have greatest possible respect for duke think pity that must be made unhappy by son like duke well yes in way be most respectable man have be good public servant lot be ruined

look a clever a mr tregear ought to win always told just now that be friend of mine think that doe look clever there must be question that tregear when disliked company must show dislike by countenance be not improbable that have done so in presence of mr adolphus longstaff now tell truth lady mabel doe not look conceited sometimes generally look a if knew what be talking about be more than other people do of course be great deal more clever than be know that think even can be so clever a look so stupid ' be what ought to say now sometimes mr longstaff deny pleasure of saying what think when be over be very angry with for anxiety have expressed about tregear mr longstaff be thought exactly man to report have said in public room at club have be annoyed by what have heard a to friend knew that of men must keep free from such folly others have a be right to make fool of have seemed so natural that young men of own class must dissipate fortune reputation by kind of extravagance father have done so have never even ventured to hope that brother must not follow father example tregear if gave way to such folly a must soon fall headlong into pit from there must be escape if did fall knew well enough to be aware that must not stifle even conceal misery must occasion a long a stood well before world must be well able to assume indifference be to be precipitated into bottomless misfortune then must only throw after must see marry smile perhaps even like wife while be doing so must also marry resolve that husband whom took must be made to think that have loving wife be frank to die then must fall upon body a though have be known by world to be lover something of feeling came upon now when heard that have be betting have be unfortunate have be unable so to subdue a to seem to be perfectly careless about have begun by saying that have not believed have believed be so natural that tregear must have done a others did with whom lived then misfortune must be to so terrible so irremediable reader however may a well know at once that there be not word of truth in assertion after dinner went home alone there be other festivity to be attended have pleased to attend poor miss cassewary be dressed ready to go with a chaperone miss cassewary be quite satisfied to be allowed to go to bed in lieu of mr montacute jones great ball have gone to bedroom when lady mabel went to be glad be alone said because want to speak to be anything wrong everything be wrong papa say must give up house say that almost always when come back from race very often when

money at race man who sat next at dinner one of stupid hing fool one meet everywhere told so be one of beargarden set of course know about did say how much how be to pay anything of thing men do be

now have got something else to tell what be do frighten so when look like that may well be frightened for if come round will very soon be able to dispense with altogether royal highness lord silverbridge what do mean mabel be next door to royal highness at rate much more topping man than most of well then serene highness heir of duke of omnium have done inexpressible honour of asking to marry may well say to tell truth exactly did then why do say did think did quite ask gave to understand that must do so if gave encouragement did mean yes poor boy meant with word with look must have be down there kneeling asked whether liked well enough what do think did what did do spared out of sheer downright christian charity said to myself 'love neighbour be selfish unto a must must do unto ' be think of welfare though have in net let go will go to heaven for doing know said miss cassewary who be so much perturbed by news have heard a to be unable to come to opinion on point just raised may rather go to other place from how much embarrassment must have relieved father what friend must have made for percival how much might have be able to do for frank then what wife must have made think must will never get half so good will be sure to get one before long be sort of tenderness be quite inefficacious will become prey a must have made prey where be there who will treat so well can not bear to hear speak of in way be true know sort of girl must marry in first place must be two year younger four year fresher must be able not only to like love to worship how well can see must have fair hair bright green gray eye with sweetest complexion prettiest little dimple two inch shorter than delight of life must be to hang with two hand on arm must have feeling that silverbridge be apollo upon earth to be rather foolish very very sweet tempered young man anything rather than god if thought that must get fresh young girl with dimple then ought to abstain if be in earnest said miss cassewary throwing aside badinage thinking of main point if be in earnest will come again be quite in earnest then will come again think will said lady mabel told be too old for tried to laugh out of doe not like being laughed at have be saved will know if must come again will not spare again not twice felt to be hard to do so once because so nearly love there be so many of who be odious to a to whom idea of marrying seems to be mixed somehow with idea of suicide oh mabel be a sweet a rose if be sister servant dog must be devoted to can fancy that comfort success name must be everything to be what wife ought to feel must never feel to be superior be what wife ought in truth to feel think of two young men difference between well look like at often give way dare say after will live to be duchess of omnium then kissed friend went away to own room chapter xxi sir timothy beeswax there have lately be great conservative reaction in country brought about in part by industry good management of gentleman who be strong on side due also in part to blunder quarrel of opponent that opponent must have blundered quarrelled being men active in earnest be to have be expected such blunderings quarrellings have be matter of course since politics have be politics since religion have be religion when men combine to hing how must there be disagreement when men combine to do much how must there not be disagreement thirty men can sit still a like other a pea put thirty men up to run race will soon assume different form in doing nothing can hardly do amiss let doer of nothing have something of action forced upon too will blunder quarrel wonder be that there must ever be in reforming party enough of consentaneous action to carry reform reforming liberal party in british politics have thus stumbled stumbled till fell now there have be great conservative reaction many of most liberal constituency in country have be untrue to old political conviction a result lord drummond be prime minister in house of lord with sir timothy beeswax acting a first man in house of common can not be denied that sir timothy have good point a politician be industrious patient clear sighted intelligent courageous determined long before have have seat in house when be simply making way up to probability of seat by making reputation a advocate have resolved that must be more than attorney general more than judge more a thought than chief justice at rate something different plan have gained must be acknowledged that have be moved by grand manly ambition there be drawback to utility beauty of sir timothy character a statesman have idea a to necessity non necessity of measure whatever in reference to well being of country may indeed be said that such idea be to absurd fact that must be held by friend supporter be inconvenience be not in accord with who declare that parliament be collection of windbag puff blow crack to annoyance of honest men to parliament be debating place by having majority in by other mean might become great man of day by other than parliamentary mean must such one a come to be chief man use of parliament on own behalf on behalf of others have be for so many year present to mind that there seemed to be nothing absurd in institution supported for such purpose parliament be club so eligible in nature that englishman wished to belong to who succeeded be acknowledged to be cream of land who dominated in be cream of cream two who be elected to be chief of two party have more of cream in composition than others who must be chief of strongest party who therefore in accordance with prevailing arrangement of country must have power of making duke bestowing garter appointing bishop who by attaining first seat must achieve right of snubbing before whether friend foe according to feeling of sir timothy must have gained elysium of creaminess not to be found in other position on earth surface man be more warmly attached to parliamentary government than sir timothy beeswax think that ever cared much for legislation parliamentary management be forte there have be various rock on men have shattered bark in attempt to sail successfully into harbour of parliamentary management there be great senator who declares to that personally will have friend foe there be country before welfare within bosom be fire of patriotism within mind example of past time know that can be just teach to be eloquent strives to be wise will not bend at last in great solitude though closely surrounded by whose love have neglected to acquire break heart then there be who seeing misfortune of great one tell that patriotism judgment industry eloquence will not suffice for unless can be loved to do great thing man must have great following to achieve that must be popular so smile learns necessary wile be for country friend for friend first too must be eloquent well instructed in way of parliament must be wise diligent in that doe that say must first study party be well with for time have closed door of elysium too rigidly without gradually become stronger than friend within so fall may not door be occasionally opened to outsider so that exterior force be diminished know how great be pressure of water how peril of overwhelming weight of may be removed by opening way for small current there come therefore statesman who acknowledges to that will be pregnable that a statesman must have enemy be matter of course against moderate enemy will hold own when there come one immoderately forcible violently inimical then to man will open bosom will tempt into camp with offer of high command foe may be worth purchase too have answered well there be nemesis loyalty of officer so procured must be open to suspicion man who have said bitter thing against will never sit at foot in contented submission will friend of old standing long endure to be superseded by such convert danger sir timothy have seen studied for of have hoped to be able to provide antidote love can not do fear may do more fear acknowledges superior love desire equal love be to be created by benefit done mean gratitude know to be weak hope refers to benefit to come be of feeling strongest sir timothy have parliamentary doctrine concealed in depth of own bosom more important even than statesman who fall be who doe much thus injures many statesman who stand longest be who doe nothing injures one soon knew that work have taken in hand required art of great conjuror must be possessed of trick so marvellous that not even who sat nearest to might know how be performed for executive legislative business of country cared little one must be left in hand of men who liked work of other there must be little if possible none parliament must be managed party of patriotism did not know meaning few perhaps do beyond feeling that must like to lick russian to get better of american in matter of fishery frontier invented pseudo patriotic conjuring phraseology one understood many admired be ambitious that must be said of that be far away cleverest of party knew to be clever must only be far away cleverest by saying doing that one must understand if must become master of great hocus pocus system must be made to be graceful to ear eye of many might for awhile seem to have within semi divine attribute must have divine power of mastering loaf fish then must who followed believe in more firmly than other follower who have believed in leader when see young woman read closed book placed on dorsal vertebra if do believe that so read think that be endowed with wonderful faculty must also be made to believe that same young woman have direct communication with abraham by mean of invisible wire must be apt to do great many thing a young woman might tell conjuring when not known to be conjuring be very effective much doubt of sir timothy power have come from praiseworthy industry though cared nothing for making of law though knew nothing of finance though have abandoned legal study still worked hard because have worked harder in special direction than others around therefore be enabled to lead management of party be very great work in when to be added management of house of common man have enough upon hand even though neglect altogether ordinary pursuit of statesman around sir timothy be fond of party be for most part men who have not condescended to put shoulder to wheel a have done have there be very great light among have there be pitt peel sir timothy must have probably become attorney general have made way to bench there have be no pitt peel have seen opening have studied way of member parliamentary practice have become familiar to have shown to be ready at hour to fight battle of party have joined man knew so well a did sir timothy how to elevate simple legislative attempt into good faction fight have so mastered trick of conjuring that one must get to bottom of have assumed look of preternatural gravity made many young member think that sir timothy be born to be king of men there be doubt among older supporter who felt thraldom grievously there be lord in upper house son of lord in lower with pedigree going back far enough for pride who found irksome to recognise sir timothy a master doubt have worked very hard have worked for doubt knew how to do work did not there be other man among to whom lead must be conveniently transferred yet be uncomfortable perhaps little ashamed have arisen partly from cause that there have be something of counter reaction at last general election when house met minister have indeed majority much lessened majority old liberal constituency have returned to expression of real feeling reassertion of progress of tide recovery from partial ebb check violence of flow be common enough in politics at present moment there be many who said that have be accelerated by feeling in country sir timothy be hardly that country required a leader of country party chapter xxii duke in study be natural that at time when success greater than have be expected have attended effort of liberal when dozen unexpected vote have be acquired leading politician of party must have found compelled to look about see how good thing might be utilised in february certainly have not expected to be called to power in course of existing session perhaps did not expect yet there be still conservative majority though small majority strength of minority consisted not in fact that majority against be small that be decreasing how quickly doe snowball grow into hugeness a be rolled on when change come in weather how quickly doe melt before be gone become thing ugly weak formless where be individual who doe not assert to that must be more loyal to falling than to rising friend such be perhaps nature of one of when large number of men act together falling friend be apt to be deserted there be general feeling among politician lord drummond ministry sir timothy be failing liberal though must not yet count vote by might hope to be supported in power nevertheless felt that ought to be looking to arm there have be coalition who be well read in political literature of country will remember about that have perhaps succeeded in doing that for have be intended queen government have be carried on for two three year duke of omnium have be head of ministry during year have suffered so much a to have become utterly ashamed of coalition so much a to have said often to that under circumstance must again join ministry at time there be idea of coalition be state of thing can not come about frequently can only be reproduced by men who have never hitherto felt mean insipidity of such condition who have served on liberal side in coalition must again put shoulder to wheel of course be in man mouth that duke must be induced to forget misery once more to take upon duty of active servant of state who be most anxious on subject such men a lord cantrip mr monk old friend phineas finn few others be almost afraid to approach at moment when coalition be broken up have be very bitter in spirit apparently almost arrogant holding aloof from late colleague since trouble have come to have aggravated soreness of heart wife have died have suffered much through child what lord silverbridge have done at oxford be matter of general conversation also what have not done that heir of family must have become renegade in politics be supposed greatly to have affected father now lord gerald have be expelled from cambridge silverbridge be on turf in conjunction with major tifto something too have oozed out into general ear about lady mary something must have be kept secret a grave have therefore come to pas that be difficult even to address duke there be one man one who must do with ease to that man be at last put into motion at instance of leader of party old duke of st bungay wrote following letter to duke of omnium letter purported to be excuse for writer own defalcation chief object of writer be to induce younger duke once more to submit to harness longroyston rd june dear duke of omnium how quickly thing come round have thought that must never again have be called upon even to think of formation of liberal ministry now though be yesterday that be telling ourselves that be thoroughly manumitted from labour by altered opinion of country sundry of old friend be again putting head together did not do so must neglect manifest duty nothing be more essential to political well being of country than that leader on side in politics must be prepared for duty for be bound at last to put in old plea with determination that will be respected solve senescentem be now if calculate rightly exactly fifty year since first entered public life in obedience to advice of lord grey have then already sat five year in house of common assisted humbly in emancipation of roman catholic have learned by legislative trouble of just century that whom then invited to sit with in parliament have be in thing worst enemy what then have benefited only who love must not sinner also even tory have done a much a such memory be of avail now write to say that after so much of active political life will at last retire friend when see inspecting pigsty picking peach be apt to remind that can still stand on leg with more of compliment than of kindness will argue therefore ought still to undertake active duty in parliament can select own hour for pig peach must through dotage of age make mistake a to breeding of one flavour of other harm done will not go far in politics have done work what others in arena do will interest more than other thing of world think hope to dying day will not trouble worker with querulousness of old age so much for now let a go say parting word to with whom in politics have be for many year more in accord than with other leading man a nothing age infirmity must to own mind have justified in retiring so do think that who can plead age infirmity will find at last to want self justification if permit to be driven from task by pride by indifference must express feeling better be to say by pride diffidence look to old friendship to authority given to by age to thorough goodness of heart for pardon in thus accusing that little men must have ventured to ill use have hurt pride that little men must have be able to do so have created diffidence put to piece of work that man may do have le false pride a to way in may do than man have known let way be open to a little diffidence a in political mill of ours in england man can not always find way open to do thing doe not often happen that english statesman can go in make great score off own bat not le be bound to play game to go to wicket when find that time have come there be think two thing for to consider in matter two only first be capacity other be duty man may have found by experience that be unfitted for public life have known men in regard to whom have thoroughly wished that such experience have be reached be matter in man who doubt be bound to take evidence of around whole party be most anxious for co operation if be so make assurance from most conclusive evidence be bound to accept common consent of political friend on matter perhaps think that at certain period of life failed agree with that did not fail be matter on must be bound by opinion rather than by own a to matter of duty will have le difficulty in carrying with though renewed task may be personally disagreeable to even though taste must lead to other life think be not case still if country want must serve country be work a to one a have option of most of who choose public life may be said that be not there there must be others a serviceable when man such a have shown to be necessary a long a health age permit can not recede without breach of manifest duty work to be done be so important number to be benefited be so great that can not be justified in even remembering that have self a have said before trust that own age goodness will induce to pardon great interference whether pardoned not will always be most affectionate friend st bungay duke duke on reading letter be by mean pleased by content must ill bear to be reminded of pride of diffidence yet accusation others made against be a nothing to with charged must do till at last be forced to defend against by asking whether must be other than a god have made be last poorest makeshift of defence to man can be brought in own court be fault that be so thin skinned that thing hurt when coarse man said to that ought not to have be said be fault that at word penknife have stabbed other men have borne buffet without shrinking have shown thereby to be more useful much more efficacious must no more imitate than must procure for skin of rhinoceros tusk of elephant shrinking be what men called pride be pride of old friend wrote have ever be haughty unless in own defence asked remembering certain passage of humility in life certain passage of haughtiness also duke told also that be diffident of course be diffident be not one same thing very pride of be accused be more than shrinking come from want of trust in oneself be shy man friend enemy knew that be thus that still discoursed with shy self conscious timid shrinking thin skinned man of course be diffident then why urge on to task for be by nature unfitted yet there be much in old friend letter moved there be certain word kept on repeating to can not be justified in even remembering that have self be hard thing to say of man yet true thing of such man a correspondent have described correspondent have spoken of man who must know to be capable of serving state if man be capable be sure within own bosom of own capacity must be duty what if be not so satisfied what if felt that labour of must be vain self abnegation useless friend have told that on matter be bound to take opinion of others perhaps so if so have not that opinion be given to very plainly when be told that be proud diffident that be called upon to serve country by good service if such be within power did acknowledge freely not that must allow to be stuck up a ninepin only to be knocked down there be politician for whom such occupation seems to be proper who like too little office little power little rank little pay little niche in ephemeral history of year will reward many men adequately for being knocked down yet loved power even when thinking of allowed mind from time to time to run away into dreamland of prosperous political labour thought what must be to be beneficent prime minister with loyal majority with well conditioned unanimous cabinet with grateful people appreciative sovereign how well might man spend night day even to death in midst of labour such a hour after receiving duke letter suddenly jumped up sat down at desk felt to be necessary that must at once write to old friend more necessary that must do so at once because have resolved that must do so before have made up mind on chief subject of letter did not suit to say either that must that must not do a friend advised reply be made in very few word a to myself said after expressing regret that duke must find necessary to retire from public life a to myself pray understand that may do will never cease to be grateful for affectionate high spirited counsel then mind recurred to more immediate for moment heavier trouble have a yet given answer to letter from mr finn reader will perhaps remember might indeed be passed over without answer to be impossible have accused in very strongest language of injustice have made understand that if be unjust to then must be most ungrateful looking at matter with own light have thought that have be right have resolved to submit question to person a judge in matter have chosen lady cantrip lady cantrip have given judgment against have pressed lady cantrip for decided opinion have told that in same position must have done just a mr finn have done have constituted lady cantrip judge have resolved that judgment must be final declared to that did not understand if man house be on fire do think of certain rule of etiquette before bid send for engine if wild beast be loose do go through ceremony before caution wanderer abroad there must not have be moment nevertheless be now necessary that must conform to opinion of lady cantrip in doing so must apologise for bitter scorn with have allowed to treat wife most loyal loving friend few word to duke have not be difficult letter seemed to be herculean task be made infinitely more difficult by fact that lady cantrip have not seemed to think that marriage be impossible young people when have set mind upon do so generally prevail at last have be word discomforted greatly have thought marriage to be possible have not almost expressed opinion that ought to be allowed to marry if so must not be duty to take girl away from lady cantrip a to idea that young people because have declared to be in love be to have just what wanted with that did not agree at lady cantrip have told that young people generally did prevail at last knew story of one young person whose position in youth have be very much same a of daughter now have not prevailed in case have not opposition have be made to wish be most fortunate that young person have become wife glencora duchess have be allowed to have own way when be child what must have be fate ah what then have to think of might not have be alive now perhaps happier than have ever be with have remained always unmarried devoted simply to politics must not trouble of world have be lighter on what have to do with in matter be not happiness of that individual must be considered there be propriety in thing only by adherence to propriety on part of individual can general welfare be maintained king in country heir possible heir to throne be debarred from what might possibly be happy marriage by regard to good of subject to duke thinking maintenance of aristocracy of country be second only in importance to maintenance of crown how must aristocracy be maintained if wealth be allowed to fall into hand of adventurer such be opinion with regard to own order of one who be a truly liberal in idea a man in england who have argued out idea to consequence a by spread of education increase of general well being proletaire be brought nearer to duke so by such action must duke be brought nearer to proletaire such drawing nearer of class be object to man political action tended yet be dreadful thing to that own daughter must desire to marry man so much beneath own rank fortune a frank tregear must not allow to believe that young people must ever prevail nevertheless a idea of thing have not alarmed lady cantrip a have be necessary that must make apology to mr finn moment of procrastination be prick to conscience now therefore dragged out from secrecy of close drawer mr finn letter read through to once again yes be true that have condemned that have punished though have done nothing to said nothing written very little still have punished most severely have written a though matter be almost one of life death to must understand that too uncle conduct to woman wife have created intimacy have existed through effort have become almost a one of family now to be dismissed like servant who have misbehaved then argument in own defence be so good if only that lady cantrip have laid down a law be to be held a law be aware now that have have knowledge of matter till daughter have told her of engagement at matching then be evident also that have sent tregear to immediately on return to london at end of letter accused of what have be pleased to call usual tenacity in believing ill of have be obstinate too obstinate in respect did not love better for having told of at last did put apology into word dear mr finn believe have better acknowledge to at once have be wrong in judgment a to conduct in certain matter tell that owe to to make acknowledgment make subject be a may imagine so painful will spare if possible further allusion to believe did wrong therefore write to ask pardon must perhaps apologise also for delay in reply have have much to think of in matter have many others also on mind believe to be yours faithfully omnium be very short a being short be infinitely le troublesome at moment than fuller epistle be angry with knowing that be too short feeling that be ungracious must have expressed hope that might soon see again only have such wish there have be time at have liked knew that did not like now yet be bound to be friend if must only do great thing for thus satisfy feeling of indebtedness towards favour have be from to chapter xxiii frank tregear want friend six seven week have passed since tregear have made communication to duke during time have heard not word about girl loved knew indeed that be at horn probably have reason to suppose that be being guarded there a be out of reach did not surprise did regard a hardship be to be expected that must be kept out of sight be state of thing to a thought there must not be more than moderate amount of submission six week be not very long period be perhaps long enough for evincing respect owed to young lady father something must be done day how must expect to be true to unless took mean of showing to be true to in day did not live very much with brother not only disliked distrusted major tifto have so expressed a to give rise to angry word silverbridge have said that knew how to take care of tregear have replied that have doubt on matter then member of parliament have declared that at rate did not intend to be taken care of by frank tregear in such state of thing be not possible that there must be close confidence a to lady mary doe often come to pas that brother be confidant of sister lover brother hardly like sister to have lover though be often well satisfied that sister must find husband tregear want of rank wealth added something to feeling in mind of brother so that silverbridge though felt to be deterred by friendship from open opposition still be almost inimical wo do know have said to brother gerald shaking head tregear however be determined to be active in matter to make effort to speak to somebody how to make effort to whom must speak thinking of remembered that mr finn have sent for have told to go with love story to duke have be almost severe with after interview be over have felt that have acted well wisely therefore determined that must go to mr finn have a yet received answer from duke though nearly fortnight have elapsed since have written letter during time have become very angry felt that be not

for intrusion of course assured that be welcome after liberty took with mr tregear be only too well pleased that must come to see be afraid said that be little rough little warm be to be expected gentleman never like to be interfered with on matter position be be difficult mr finn be bound to acknowledge very ready way in did what asked to do now mr finn what be to come next ah something must be done know of course that duke did not receive with great favour did not suppose must did of course must object to marriage man in day can not dictate to daughter what husband must marry perhaps can dictate to what husband will not marry hardly that may put impediment in way duke will do so if be happy enough to have won affection of daughter so a to make essential to happiness that must become wife will give way what be to say mr tregear just what think why must be made to say what think on so delicate matter of what use must be thought remember how far be removed from be friend not at one le so a said must not hinder colour from coming into face be friend lady glencora with death of friend there be end of that be staying with at request told so will never stay with again mr tregear be of matter mean to say word against not word if wish to interest one a being duke friend then can assure be last person in london to whom must come know one to whom duke be likely to entertain feeling

lady mary be staying with suppose that if be here must let see in house without father leave suppose not certainly not therefore conceive that lady cantrip will not do so either wish be here must be of use must be dragon in guarding wish must let feel that be like sister to in matter be not sister yet aunt yet grandmother what mean be that can not be on side can not mr tregear think how long have

more for welfare of daughter be not sure of tenderness of own heart in that be doing be governed by anything sense of duty be personal pride love of personal aggrandisement thought that must assure that be open to such charge must not die for for if must so serve surely woman have accused most wrongfully when have intimated that must see girl suffer without caring for in indignation determined for awhile that must remove from custody of lady cantrip then where must place be aware that own house must be like grave to girl just fit to come out into world in coming autumn must go somewhere

selected doubt have be known to be heir apparent to dukedom to ducal revenue in case old lady midlothian have begun matter with occurred to that in royal marriage such beginning be quite common who must be happy man then began to count up requisite attribute must be of high rank eldest son possessor of heir to good estate did despise when found that put thing first a matter of course nevertheless did put first be ejecting other man because possessed none of attribute hurried on to add that man must be of good character such a young girl might learn to love yet be aware that added thing for conscience sake tregear character be good certainly girl loved be not clear to who knew anything of such matter mr francis tregear must not have dared even to think of marrying daughter of duke of omnium who must be happy man there be so many who evidently be unfit young lord percival be heir to ruined estate beggared peerage lord glasslough be odious to men there be three four others

supposed must dine at home never be at beargarden be sir asked silverbridge suddenly never said duke come dine with be not member of club care at about anybody can take in anybody doe not make promiscuous well know that doe seems to go on very well daresay there be cad there sometimes know where one doe meet cad there be plenty in house of common there be something in silverbridge make think that have not realised difference between private public life in former choose own associate be responsible for choice in latter be concerned with others for good of state though even for state sake must not willingly be closely allied with whom think dishonest outward manner fashion of life need create barrier must not turn up nose at house of common because constituency might send illiterate shoemaker might probably find illiterate shoemaker unprofitable companion for private hour think there will be shoemaker at beargarden even if there be must go dine with will be glad to see place where suppose pas many hour find very good shop to dine at place at house be so stuffy nasty besides one like to get away for little time certainly never be advocate for living in house one must always change atmosphere then got into cab went to club silverbridge be little afraid of what be doing invitation have come from on spur of moment hardly ventured to think that father must accept now did not quite know how duke must go through ceremony other fellow must come stare at man whom have be taught to regard a most un beargardenish of men be especially anxious to make thing pleasant for father what will order said son a took duke into dressing room to wash hand duke suggested that anything sufficient for son must certainly be sufficient for nothing especial occurred during dinner duke appeared to enjoy very much yes think be very good soup said think ever give soup at home then son expressed opinion that unless father looked about rather more sharply very soon must provide dinner at remarking that experience have taught that le people demanded more be sat upon duke did like dinner rather liked feeling that be dining with son report that duke of omnium be with lord silverbridge soon went round room who be justified by previous acquaintance came up to greet to who did so be very gracious be specially so to lord popplecourt who happened to pas close by table think be fool whispered silverbridge a soon a popplecourt have passed what make think so thought as at eton have done pretty well however oh yes in way somebody have told that be careful man about property believe be said silverbridge then see why must think fool to silverbridge made reply partly perhaps because have nothing to say hindered also by coming in of tregear be accident possibility of have not crossed unfortunately too duke back be turned so that tregear a walked up room must not see who be sitting at friend table tregear coming up stood close to duke elbow before recognised man spoke word two to silverbridge how do do mr tregear said duke turning round oh lord did not know that be hardly must be quite stranger here silverbridge came up from house together have be hospitable enough to give dinner will tell odd thing for london man mr tregear have not dined at london club for fifteen year before hope like sir said silverbridge very much indeed good evening mr tregear suppose have to go to dinner now then went into one of room upstairs to have coffee son declining to go into smoking room assuring father that did not in least care about cigar after dinner must be smothered duke did a be bidden went upstairs there be in truth strong reason for avoiding publicity of smoking room when bringing father to club have thought nothing about tregear have thought about tifto a entered have seen tifto at table dining alone have bobbed head at then have taken duke to further end of room have trusted that fear must keep major in place fear have kept major in place when major learned who stranger be have become silent reserved before father son have finished dinner tifto have gone to cigar so that danger be over by george there be silverbridge have got governor to dinner said tifto standing in middle of room looking round a though be announcing confusion of heaven earth why must lord silverbridge have father to dine with asked mr lupton believe know silverbridge a well a man by george be very last thing of kind must have expected there have be end of quarrel there have be quarrel at said tregear who have then just entered room nothing on earth must make silverbridge quarrel with father think must break duke heart to quarrel with son tifto endeavoured to argue matter out tregear having made assertion on behalf of friend must not allow to be enticed into further speech nevertheless there be good deal said by others during major drank two glass of whisky water in dining room have be struck with awe by duke presence have certainly no idea of presenting personally to great man bacchus lent aid when discussion be over whisky have be swallowed occurred to that must go upstairs ask to be introduced in meantime duke son be seated in close conversation on one of upstairs sofa be rule at beargarden that men might smoke over house except in dining room there be one small chamber called library in practice be not often followed room be generally deserted at moment father son be only occupant club said duke a sipped coffee be comfortable economical residence man get what want well served get cheap have drawback always see same fellow said silverbridge man who life much at club be apt to fall into selfish mode of life be taught to think that own comfort must always be first object man can never be happy unless first object be outside personal self indulgence begets sense of meanness stick to man even when have got beyond hope of rescue be for reason among others that marriage be so desirable man must marry suppose unless man have on shoulder burden of wife child must think feel that have shirked out of school be not doing share of work of commonwealth pitt be not married sir great many other good men have remained unmarried do mean to be pitt intend to be prime minister must not recommend to entertain ambition pitt perhaps hardly have time for marriage may be more lucky suppose will marry day must be glad to see marry early said duke speaking in low voice almost solemnly in quietest sweetest tone of voice be peculiarly situated though a yet be only heir to property honour of family still be married almost everything must be at disposal there be so much must only be too ready to give up to ca bear to hear talking of giving up anything said silverbridge energetically then father looked round room furtively seeing that door be shut that be assuredly alone put out hand gently stroked young man hair be almost caress a though must have said to be daughter must kiss there be much must fain give up said if be married man house in carlton terrace must be fitter for than for have disqualified for taking part in society must be filled by head of family who have inherited so much from mother must if married pleasantly do right well paused for moment then asked straightforward question very quickly have never thought of one yet suppose silverbridge have thought very much of somebody be quite aware that have almost made offer to lady mabel certainly have not given encouragement very fact that have not done so allured more did believe that be thoroughly in love with lady mabel have told that be too young be older than lady mab by week be beautiful that be certain be acknowledged by that be clever a for blood of believed father thought much there be perhaps none better in england have heard said of a now well remembered in father presence that have behaved remarkably well in trying circumstance have fortune everybody knew that then did not want fortune must not be good opportunity for breaking matter to father have never thought of one said duke again very sweetly very softly have lord silverbridge a made announcement blushed up to eye then there came over father something almost of fear if be to be told how must be if must not approve yes have said silverbridge recovering if wish will tell who be nay boy a to that consult own feeling be sure of oh yes have spoken to well yes in part have not accepted if mean that rather contrary now duke must have be very unwilling to say that son must certainly be accepted by girl in england to whom might choose to offer hand when idea of doubt be suggested to did seem odd that son must ask in vain what other young man be there who must offer so much who be at same time so likely to be loved for own sake smiled however be silent suppose may a well out with continued silverbridge know lady mabel grex lady mabel grex yes know be there objection be not senior sir be younger than be father be not man esteem have always be so good then duke be again silent have not heard that sir think have be not that great deal very great deal to be good must of quality be best be very beautiful think so sir of course have money be not needed be not needed have objection to make if be sure of own mind be quite sure of sir then will raise objection lady mabel grex father fear be not worthy man hear that be gambler be so poor that make worse silverbridge man who gamble because have money that can afford to lose be to thinking fool who gamble because have none be well let hope best of may give love have not accepted must do so may almost rejected be not sure that be in earnest mean to try again just at moment door be opened major tifto walked into room chapter xxvii major tifto duke beg pardon silverbridge said major entering room be looking for longstaff be here said silverbridge who did not wish to be interrupted by racing friend father believe said tifto be red in face be in other respect perhaps improved in appearance by liquor in more sober moment be not always able to assume appearance of equality with companion be ambition of soul to achieve second glass of whisky water must always enable to cock tail bark before company with courage of lady pug must do great honour to introduce to grace silverbridge be not prone to turn back upon friend because be low in world have begun to understand that have made mistake by connecting with major at club always defended partner though not unfrequently found obliged to snub major always countenanced little master of hound be true to own idea of standing to fellow nevertheless did not wish to introduce friend to father duke saw at glance felt that introduction must be made perhaps said getting up from chair be major tifto yes lord duke be major tifto duke bowed graciously father be engaged about private matter said silverbridge beg ten thousand pardon exclaimed major did not intend to intrude think have done said duke pray sit down major tifto major sat down though now bethink have to beg pardon that stranger must ask to sit down in own club mention lord duke be so unused to club forgot where be quite so lord duke hope think that silverbridge be looking well yes yes think so silverbridge bit lip turned face away to door did make very good thing of derby nag other day perhaps grace have heard did hear that horse in be interested have failed to win race yes did prime minister call grace out of compliment to certain ministry wish be going on to day instead of seedy lot have got in think lord duke that one may ask will tell know what running be well can assure grace be that since have seen 'orses have never seen 'orse fitter than when got canter that morning be nearly even betting not that silverbridge be fool enough to put on anything at rate never saw 'orse so bad ridden mean to say anything lord duke against man if fellow have be squared else be drunk else be off head that 'orse must have won lord duke know anything about racing major tifto suppose not grace a silverbridge be together in matter thought 'd just let grace know that ought to have have very good thing thought that perhaps grace might like to know tifto be making as of yourself said silverbridge making as of myself exclaimed major yes considerably think be little hard upon friend said duke with attempt at laugh be not to be supposed that must know how utterly indifferent be to everything connected with turf thought lord duke might care about learning how silverbridge be going on poor little man said almost with whine partner roughness have knocked out of nearly courage bacchus have given so do anything interest interest perhaps of pursuit racing be one to be least able to lend attentive ear that horse have head that did have tail till be ill used be extent of stable knowledge very good indeed lord duke very good indeed have have have horse have head have tail head tail upon word be best thing have heard for long time will do honour of wishing grace good night by bye silverbridge then left room having be made supremely happy by what considered to have be duke joke nevertheless must remember snubbing must be even with silverbridge day did lord silverbridge think that be going to look after lordship 'orses do always on square then be snubbed for doing be very sorry that must have come in to trouble said son have not troubled much know whether have troubled if be coming down to house again will walk with silverbridge of course have to go down to house again started together that man did not trouble silverbridge question be whether such acquaintance must not be troublesome to be not very proud of sir think one ought to be proud of one friend be friend in way at in what way then understands racing be partner of pleasure then man in whose society love to enjoy recreation of race course be sir because understands thought that gentleman on turf must have trainer for purpose not companion mean to imply that can save money by leaguing with major tifto sir indeed if associate with not for pleasure then surely must be for profit that must do former must be to so surprising that must regard a impossible that must do latter be think reproach said with tone of anger in voice so gently that silverbridge at first hardly understood gradually be meant came in upon felt to be ashamed of be bad said at last whether be bad will not say be sure that can gain nothing by companionship will get rid of said silverbridge after considerable pause can not do so at once will do will be better think tregear have be telling same thing be objectionable to mr tregear asked duke oh yes tregear can not bear treated great deal better than tregear ever doe deny that be entitled to be treated well so also be groom let say more about so be to

well together at there will be end to sir god bless boy said duke lord silverbridge sat in house to speak more accurately in smoking room of house for about hour thinking over have passed between father certainly have not intended to say anything about lady mab on spur of moment have come out now at rate be decided for that must in set term ask to be wife scene have just occurred have made thoroughly sick of major tifto must get rid of major there must be way of doing at once so easy so little open to observation a marriage if be once engaged to mabel dismissal of tifto must be quite

lady cantrip there be nothing that tried to conceal got up said threw arm round be not world to have be planned asked lady cantrip nothing have be planned be cousin very intimate go there constantly now want to tell papa about lady cantrip began to think that have be evil day for when have agreed to take charge of very determined young lady consented at once to write to duke a girl be in hand must take care not to lay open to reproach a objectionable lover have contrived meeting have met without contriving be necessary that duke must be informed must rather wrote letter said lady mary pray tell that along have meant to know about till lady cantrip seated at writing table did not know how great difficulty must be can not in circumstance be easy to write to father a to daughter love for objectionable lover duke character added much to severity of task then that embrace knew that duke must be struck with horror a read of such tale found almost struck with horror a attempted to write when came to point found must not write fear there be good deal of warmth shown on side said feeling that be calumniating man a to whose warmth have heard nothing be quite clear added that be not passing fancy on part be impossible that duke must be made to understand exactly what have occurred that silverbridge have taken mary did understand that have together gone to lord grex house understood also that meeting have taken place in presence of silverbridge of lady mabel doubt be accident lady cantrip wrote how must be accident have mary up in town on friday said to son on following sunday morning yes sir that friend of yours came in yes sir do not know what wish be certainly do must not help coming suppose that anybody have planned not be simply accident accident a must occur over over again unless mary be to be locked up who talk of locking anybody up what right have to speak in way only meant that of course will stumble across other in london think will go abroad said duke be silent for awhile then repeated word think will go abroad not for long hope sir yes to live there why must stay here what good can do here everything see everything hear be pain to young man of course must not go back in mind to last interview have have with father when duke have be so gracious apparently so well pleased be there anything else wrong except about mary silverbridge asked be told that gerald owes about fifteen hundred pound at cambridge so much a knew have few horse there be not money absence of principle that young man must have feeling that ought to live within certain prescribed mean do know what have have from mr morton not exactly sir be different with man let be who may must live within certain mean a for sister think will break heart silverbridge found to be quite impossible to say anything in answer to be going to church asked duke be not thinking of doing so particularly do not ever go yes sometimes will go with now if like sir have thought of going mind be too much harassed see why must not go silverbridge though have be willing to sacrifice morning to father for be fear in way that have looked at did not see reason for performing duty father omitted there be various matter also harassed on previous evening after dinner have allowed to back prime minister for leger to very serious amount in fact have plunged now stood to lose twenty thousand pound on doings of last night have made bet under influence of major tifto be remembrance of after promise made to father that annoyed most be imbued with feeling that behoved a man to pull together a must have said to live in accordance with certain rule must make rule easily enough have never yet succeeded in keeping one of have determined to sever from tifto in doing have intended to sever from affair of turf generally resolution be not yet week old be on evening that have resolved that tifto must no longer be companion now have to confess to that because have drunk three four glass of champagne have be induced by tifto to make wretched bet have told father that intended to ask mabel grex to be wife have so committed that offer must now be made did not specially regret that though wished that have be more reticent what fool man be to blurt out everything said to wife must be good thing for where must possibly find better wife than mabel grex in beauty be doubt inferior to miss boncassen there be something about miss boncassen made impossible to forget miss boncassen be american on many account out of question did not occur to that must fall in love with miss boncassen still seemed hard to that intention of marriage must stand in way of having good time with miss boncassen for few week doubt there be objection to marriage clipped fellow wing then if be married might be sure that tifto must be laid aside be such great thing to have got father assured consent to marriage meant complete independence in money matter then mind ran away to review of father affair be genuine trouble to that father must be so unhappy of grief weighed upon duke mind that in reference to sister be heaviest money gerald owed at cambridge must be nothing if other sorrow must be conquered have tifto own extravagance caused duke incurable wound if tregear must be got out of way father thought might be reconciled to other thing felt very tender hearted about father have remorse in regard to sister a made up mind that must speak very seriously to tregear have wandered into st james park have lighted by time dozen cigarette one after a sat on one of bench be handsome youth six foot high with light hair with round blue eye with aristocratic look have belonged so peculiarly to late duke be le conspicuous in present head of family be young man whom must hardly pas in crowd without observing of whom must say after due observation that have not a yet put off childish way now sat with leg stretched out with cane in hand looking down upon water be trying to think worked hard at thinking bench be hard upon whole be not satisfied with position have just made up mind that must look up tregear when tregear appeared on path before tregear exclaimed silverbridge silverbridge exclaimed tregear what on earth make walk about here on sunday morning what on earth make sit there must walk here often do doe not seem to odd must find be marvellous do often come never be here in life before strolled in because have thing to think of question to be asked in parliament notice of motion amendment in committee that kind of thing go on old fellow perhaps major tifto have made important revelation d major tifto with heart said tregear sit down here said silverbridge a happened at moment when came up be thinking of be kind be determined to go to about sister must be given up must be given up can never lead to good mean that there never can be marriage then paused tregear be determined to hear out be making father so miserable that must pity if must see dare say must when see people unhappy always pity what must ask to think of be if be to commission to tell sister that everything between must be given up must not be so unhappy that must have to pity must get over so will father have right to have own opinion on matter so have so have right in matter be very clear very potential be quite ready to admit that can not marry for many year to come unless will provide money be quite at liberty to tell say so have right to ask father for penny will never do so power be in hand a far a know own purpose will not make immediate attempt even to see did meet a saw other day by merest chance after do think that sister wish to give up a for supposing girl be to have what wish be nonsense for young men suppose equally so life ought to be life of self denial doubt perhaps might be duty to retire from affair if by doing so must sacrifice only one person of whom be bound to think in matter be girl love be just what must say about hope so in way support other if be other man circumstanced just like be other girl placed like mary must be first to say that man be behaving badly like to use hard language to in such case must be first to say of man that be looking after girl money silverbridge a said looked forward steadfastly on to water regretting much that cause for quarrel must have arisen thinking that tregear must find obliged to quarrel tregear after few moment silence having thought out determined that must not quarrel think probably might said laying hand on silverbridge arm think perhaps might express such opinion well then have to examine find out whether be guilty of meanness might perhaps be too ready to impute to have done so be quite sure that be not drawn to sister by desire for money did not seek her because be rich man daughter because be rich man daughter will give up will be mistress of occasion nothing word from will induce to leave word from if come from own lip will do so then took friend hand in having grasped walked away without saying word chapter xxxi miss boncassen river party thrice within next three week did lord silverbridge go forth to ask mabel to be wife thrice in vain on one occasion must talk on other thing on second miss cassewary must not leave on third conversation turned in very disagreeable way on miss boncassen a to whom lord silverbridge must not think that lady

laugh least apprehensive ear must have perceived that laughter be affected miss cassewary did not laugh at sat bolt upright looked very serious upon honour said younger lady be most beautifully simple minded human being ever knew in life then must laugh at how can one help of course do with purpose what purpose think be making fool of if somebody doe not interfere will go so far that will not be

poured out upon if be to marry mabel grex a thought of however told that must not sell for money magnificence must afford to be independent gratify own taste just at moment be of opinion that isabel

popplecourt have found lady cantrip very agreeable be to be hoped that reader be disgusted lord popplecourt must certainly not have given second thought to lady cantrip unless have be specially flattered why must such man have be flattered by woman who be in respect superior reader will understand have be settled by wisdom of elder that must be good thing that lord popplecourt must marry lady mary palliser mutual assent lead to marriage must doubt be spontaneous who doe not feel that young love must speak from first doubtful unconscious spark spark breath of air may quench cherish till becomes flame nothing can satisfy union of two lover one must be told to love bidden to marry man that woman theory of be plain to till have son daughter whom feel imperatively obliged to control theory be unassailable duty be so imperative duke have taught to believe that a wife must have be thrown away on world have be allowed to marry burgo fitzgerald so must daughter be thrown away be allowed to marry mr tregear therefore theory of spontaneous love must in case be set aside therefore spark must that have be no more must be quenched therefore there must be union of two lover simply prudent perhaps splendid marriage lord popplecourt be man in possession of large estate be unencumbered rank in peerage be not high barony be of old date if thing went well with something higher in rank might be open to have good look of sort recommend to pastor master to elder better have regular feature looked a though be steady be not impatient rollicking silverbridge be also good looking good look be such a must give pang to heart of anxious mother of daughter be handsomest man of three then looked a though have better did not care for elder lord popplecourt though very young man have once stammered through dozen word in house of lord have be known to dine with benevolent fund lord silverbridge have declared to be fool one thought to be bright in eye of duke of lady cantrip have good quality work be very disagreeable be more hard upon lady cantrip because did not believe in if must be done must be expedient felt very strongly that must not be done doubt that lady glencora have be turned from evil destiny lady glencora have be younger than daughter be now possessed of le character be lady cantrip blind to difference between poor man with bad character such a burgo have be poor man with good character such a be tregear nevertheless undertook to aid work condescended to pretend to be so interested in portrait of common ancestor a to persuade young man to have photographed in order that bringing down of photograph might lead to something took photograph lady cantrip said very much to about grandmother who be old lady in question must said just remember feature of dear old woman be not habitually hypocrite hated for what be doing yet object be simply good to bring together two young people who might advantageously marry other mere talking about old woman must be of service longed to bring out offer plainly say there be lady mary palliser think 'd make good wife for must not a yet bring to be so indelicately plain have seen duke since asked spoke to only yesterday in house like duke if may be allowed to say so must be for advantage that must like be if mean to take part in politics suppose will said popplecourt there be much else to do go to race shook head be glad of said lady cantrip nothing be so bad a turf fear lord silverbridge be devoting to turf think can be good for man to have much to do with major tifto suppose silverbridge know what be about here be opportunity might have be used must have be so easy for to glide from imperfection of brother to perfection of sister must not bring to do quite at once approached matter however a nearly a must without making grand proposition shook head sadly in reference to silverbridge then spoke of duke father be so anxious about dare say know man who be more painfully anxious about child feel responsibility so much since wife death there be lady mary be right must say right oh yes when girl be possessed of so many thing rank beauty intelligence large fortune will lady mary have much large portion of mother money must say when thing be joined together father of course feel most anxious a to disposal suppose be clever very clever said lady cantrip think girl may be too clever know said lord popplecourt perhaps may know more who be too foolish be so much obliged to for photograph mention really did mean that must send man down on occasion two young people did not see other lady mary did not come down lady cantrip lacked courage to send for a be might not be possible that young man must be induced to make agreeable to young lady without further explanation love making between young people can not well take place unless be brought together there be difficulty in bringing together at richmond duke have indeed spoken of meeting lord popplecourt at dinner there be to have followed proposition lady cantrip must make to must not yet make proposition therefore hardly knew how to arrange dinner be obliged at last to let wished for lover go away without arranging anything when duke must have settled autumn plan then attempt must be made to induce lord popplecourt to travel in same direction that evening lady cantrip said few word to mary respecting proposed suitor there be nothing have horror of a gambling said be dreadful be very glad to think that nidderdale doe not do anything of sort be perhaps on card nidderdale must do thing of knew nothing hope silverbridge doe not bet think doe there be lord popplecourt quite young man with everything at own disposal very large estate think of evil might do if be given way doe gamble not at must be such comfort to mother look to a though never must do anything said lady mary then subject be dropped be week after towards end of july that duke wrote line to lady cantrip apologising for what have done explaining that have asked lord popplecourt to dine at horn on certain sunday have said be assured by lord cantrip that arrangement must be quite convenient be clear from letter that be much in earnest of course there be reason why dinner must not be eaten only speciality of invitation to lord popplecourt must not be so glaring that must be struck by strangeness of there must be little party made up lord nidderdale wife be therefore bidden to come down silverbridge who at first consented rather unwillingly lady mabel grex a to whom duke made special request that might be asked last invitation be sent express from lady mary included miss ca so party be made up careful reader will perceive that there be to be ten of be odd papa wanting to have lady mabel mary said to lady cantrip doe not know dear hardly ever spoke to will tell expect silverbridge be going to marry why must know why must be very beautiful very clever if so papa must know about doe seem so odd that papa of people must turn match maker even that must think of so much be thrown upon now said lady cantrip poor papa then remembered spoke with little start of course be not thinking of arranging marriage be very different from preventing one from marrying whatever may think to be duty will be sure to do said elder lady very solemnly lady mabel be surprised by invitation be not slow to accept papa will be here will be so glad to meet lady mary have said why must duke of omnium wish to meet silverbridge will be here too mary have gone on to say be just family party papa know be not going anywhere be by lady mabel thought be much stirred bosom somewhat moved silverbridge also be moved by of course must not remember that have pledged to father to ask lady mabel to be wife have faltered since have be thought unkind to at rate indifferent have surely said enough to to make know what meant yet have taken no trouble to meet way then isabel boncassen have intervened now be asked to dinner in most unusual manner of guest invited lord popplecourt be perhaps least disturbed be quite alive to honour of being noticed by duke of omnium alive also to flattering courtesy shown to by lady cantrip justice must not be done unless be acknowledged that have a yet flattered with hope in regard to lady mary palliser when prepared for journey down to richmond thought much more of duke than of duke daughter oh yes can drive down if like kind of thing silverbridge said to on saturday evening bring back if will come when be coming hate waiting for fellow suppose leave at half past ten wo fix time if ca make suit there will be governor carriage will duke go down in carriage suppose so be quicker le trouble than railway then lord popplecourt reflected that must certainly come back with duke if must so manage there floated before eye vision of under secretaryship of might owe origin to proposed drive up from richmond at six o'clock on sunday evening silverbridge called for lord popplecourt upon word said did ever expect to see in cab why not especially because be not one of lot 'd sooner have tifto dare say must tifto be not at pleasant companion though understands horse be going in for heavy politics suppose not particularly heavy if not why on earth doe governor take up wo mind smoking dare say after there be conversation between chapter xxxv think be pretty to see duke reception of lady mabel knew mother many year ago said when be young mother mother be first cousin dear friend held hand a spoke looked at a though meant to love lady mabel saw that be so must be possible that duke have heard anything that must wish to receive have told have told miss cassewary that though have spared silverbridge yet knew that must make good wife if duke thought so also then surely need not doubt knew be cousin said have be so proud of connection lord silverbridge doe come see sometimes soon after silverbridge popplecourt came in if story of old woman in portrait may be taken a evidence of family connexion between lady cantrip lord popplecourt everybody there be more le connected with everybody else nidderdale have be first cousin of lady glencora have married daughter of lady cantrip be manifestly family party thanks to old woman in picture be point of conscience among perhaps not ten thousand say one thousand of bluest blood that everybody must know who everybody be duke though have not given mind much to pursuit have nevertheless learned lesson be knowledge possession of blue blood produce there be country with bluer blood than own in to be without such knowledge be crime when old lady in portrait have be discussed popplecourt be close to lady mary two have idea why such vicinity have be planned duke knew of course lady cantrip lady cantrip have whispered to daughter that marriage must be suitable daughter have hinted to husband lord cantrip of course be not in dark lady mabel have expressed hint on matter to miss ca who have not repudiated even silverbridge have suggested to that something of kind might be in wind thinking that if so none of knew much about sister mary popplecourt be divinely innocent idea of marriage have a yet gone farther than conviction girl generally be thing must be pressed on against must arm with shield marriage must have to come doubt not le be duty to live a though be pit towards must be tempted by female allurement that net must be spread over here be much too humble minded to imagine very hot said to lady mary found warm in church to day dare say came down here with brother in hansom cab what very odd thing to have hansom cab must like one must indeed particularly if must drive silverbridge doe at night when think people wo see drive cab in street what doe do with man put inside be out

expediency of certain event be what call logic be anything unexpected be odd lord silverbridge wo be laughed at have be at oxford ought to know what logic be that at rate be ill natured replied turning very red in face think meant oh lord silverbridge say that think meant can not think must willingly wound indeed indeed be not thinking have in truth be accident must not speak aloud because

perfect since have first met have heard loveliness talked of on side seemed to be admitted everywhere that so beautiful creature have never before be seen in london there be even certain dignity attached to be praised by lip miss boncassen a american girl have be judged to be beautiful only by own eye might perhaps have seemed to to be beneath serious notice in such case might have felt unable to justify so extraordinary choice there be acclamation of assent a to girl then came dancing one dance after pressure of hand entreaty that must not just on occasion dance with other man attendance on when took glass of wine whispered encouragement of mr montacute jones half resisting yet half yielding conduct of girl will not dance at again said when asked to stand up for think of

passed between silverbridge duke how different must have be feeling then must not be so much better for that must marry one of own class than american girl of whom nobody knew anything then to be daughter of duke of omnium to be future duchess to escape from care father vice folly have brought upon to have come to end of trouble must not be sweet have made mind up to nothing when asked to walk up to waterfall there be present to only glimmer of idea that ought to caution not to play with american girl feeling knew to be aware that when time for own action came feminine feeling must get better of purpose must not craftily bring to necessity of bestowing upon have that be within compass of power opportunity have not be lacking to on such occasion have always spared must opportunity come again again must spare might perhaps do good not to herself be now out of question to by showing how wrong be in trifling with girl feeling so started for walk of course must have avoided have be possible when men in such matter have two string to bow much inconvenience be felt when two become entangled silverbridge doubt have come over to killancodlem for sake of making love to mabel grex instead of doing so have made love to isabel boncassen during watch of night a have dressed in morning while mr jones have be whispering to little bulletin a to state of young lady health have not repented of change mabel have be thought so little gracious to that must have given up notion earlier for indiscreet declaration to father on other hand making love to isabel boncassen seemed to to posse divine afflatus of joy made of imaginable occupation sweetest most charming have admitted of embrace indeed have attempted none unless touch of hand might be so called from have immediately withdrawn conduct have be such that have felt to be incumbent on at very moment to justify touch by declaration of love then have told that must not promise to love in return yet have be so sweet so heavenly sweet during morning have almost forgotten mabel when mr jones told that isabel must keep room longed to ask for leave to go make inquiry at door must not play lawn tennis with well did not now care much for after what have said to must at rate give answer have be so gracious to that hope ran very high never occurred to to fancy that might be gracious to because be heir to dukedom of

because be conscious though unconsciously conscious of something of sympathy of love have to go to waterfall with mabel lady mabel be always dressed perfectly having great gift of own in direction there be freshness about made morning costume more charming than of evening never did look so well a when arrayed for walk on occasion have certainly done best poor blind idiot saw nothing of white

honour mabel be unfair be not friend think so dear friend hope so then may not tell what think if mean to marry that american young lady must not raise false hope false hope have hope have never thought that isabel must have false hope certainly do not know that everyone be looking at last night certainly not that old woman be going about talking of a doing pretending to be afraid of father whereas nothing must please better than to humble family so high a yours humble exclaimed lord silverbridge do think father must like must think that man must be doing well for by marrying miss boncassen do said energetically then must be very much in love with say nothing about if be so much in love with that mean to face displeasure of friend say what mean must talk more freely to than to one else wo talk about even to a regard miss boncassen think that man might marry without discredit wo have said that can be inferior to to anybody there be steady manliness in took lady mabel by surprise be convinced that intended to offer hand to girl now be actuated chiefly by feeling that doing so must be outrage to english propriety if word might have effect must be duty to speak that word think be wrong there lord silverbridge be sure be right what have felt about sister mr tregear be altogether different altogether frank wife will be simply wife mine must outlive father will be duchess of omnium father have heard speak with bitter regret of affair of lady mary because vexes must marriage with american lady vex le why must vex at be vulgar ill to look at stupid think of mother be not going to marry mother for matter of be going to marry be taking for granted in most unfair way how can help after what saw yesterday will not talk more about have better go down will get

pitying voice be must not sleep now begin to hope that sooner later will unstiffen during moment at word that uttered be thinking of declaration of love have made to seemed to a though matter have not dwelt on mind when drew chair away from table thought that not moment be to be lost before further explanation of feeling for other must be made be not matter have be so far discussed of vital importance for of glorious a be above other woman offer have made must have weight with did not think that proposed to give more than deserved still that be so willing to give be not little be possible that have not understood meaning if so must not willingly lose moment before made plain to seemed content to hang about with other woman when sauntered about ground seated on garden chair with lady mabel discussed with great eloquence general beauty of scottish scenery hour went on in way must be that knew that have offered to make wife during time went returned more than once still be there on same garden seat talking to who came in way then on sudden got up put hand on arm come take turn with said lord silverbridge do remember anything of last night remember thought for while

potent of spell what do mean by wanting two must have voice in a well a what be voice voice be told last night loved morning ask to be wife be very clear voice said almost in whisper in tone so serious that startled ought to be clear said doggedly do think know do think that if liked well last night like better now do like be just thing be going to say nothing about isabel just one thing

best sweetest of god feminine creature be whether be entitled to not can not yet say now will tell something of father father came to new york a labourer from holland worked upon quay in city then built house became rich be almost miser with good sense however to educate only son what father be see to be sterling gold be not like people dear mother be not at like lady be not lady in sense

custom with mr finn almost autumn to go off to vienna where possessed considerable property there to inspect circumstance of estate sometimes husband must accompany did so in year of be now speaking one morning in september be together at hotel at ischl whither have come from vienna when a went through hall into courtyard came in very doorway upon duke of omnium daughter duke lady mary have just arrived having passed through mountain from salt mine district be about to take up residence in hotel for few day have travelled very slowly for lady mary have be ill duke have expressed determination to see doctor at ischl there be greater mistake than in supposing that only young blush blush of middle life be luckily not seen through tan have come from sun gas work wile of world duke phineas blushed though blush be hidden that peculiar glance of eye always accompanies blush be visible enough from one to other elder lady kept countenance admirably younger one have occasion for blushing at once ran forward kissed friend duke stood with hat off waiting to give hand to lady then took that of late colleague how odd that must meet here said turning to mr finn odd enough to that grace must be here said because have heard nothing of intended coming be so nice to find said lady mary be moment come say that be moment going at moment be only going a far a halstadt be coming back to dinner of course will dine with will not papa duke said that hoped must to declare that be engaged at hotel unless there be real engagement be almost impossibility there be escape before be allowed to get into carriage have promised must dine with duke daughter know that be especially bore mr finn said to husband in carriage may be quite sure that of trouble there may be in have much more than share share must be whole said husband one else have done anything wrong when duke apology have reached so that there be longer ground for absolute hostility then have told whole story to husband at first be very indignant what right have duke to expect that ordinary friend must act duenna over daughter in accordance with caprice be said much more of kind humour towards quarrelling phineas finn might have felt for day two be quieted by wife prudence man said can do more than apologise after there be room for reproach at dinner conversation turned at first on british politics in mr finn be quite able to take part phineas be decidedly of opinion that sir timothy beeswax lord drummond must not live session on subject good deal be said later in evening duke found sitting with mr finn in broad verandah over hotel garden while lady mary be playing to phineas within how do think be looking asked father of course see that have be ill tell that be far from well at salzburg yes indeed for three four day frightened much suffered terribly from headache nervous headache so said there feel quite angry with because did not bring doctor with trouble ceremony of such accompaniment be doubt disagreeable suppose seemed when started to be unnecessary quite unnecessary doe complain again now did to day little next day lady mary must not leave bed duke in sorrow be obliged to apply to mr finn after what have passed on previous day mr finn of course called be shown at once up to young friend room there found girl in great pain lying with two thin hand up to head hardly able to utter more than word shortly after mr finn be alone with duke then there took place conversation between lady thought to be very remarkable have better send for doctor from england asked in answer to mr finn expressed opinion that measure be hardly necessary that gentleman from town who have be called in seemed to know what be about that illness lamentable a be did not seem to be in way dangerous one can not tell what come from said duke dubiously young people fancy be often subject to such malady must come from something wrong may be said of sickness therefore one try to find out cause say that be unhappy last word spoke slowly in low voice to mr finn must make reply did not doubt that girl be unhappy knew well why source of lady mary misery be one to must not very well allude know misery about young man be trouble requires time to cure said not meaning to imply time must cure by enabling girl to forget lover because in truth have not known what else to say if time will cure time say cure sorrow what must do to help time there be sacrifice must not make sacrifice of mean must devote to leave everything else on one side purpose being back in england in october must remain here if thought better for comfort can not tell duke can be woman might know better than do be so hard that man must be left with charge of from very nature can not understand duty then paused must find word must suit at moment be almost incredible to that after what have passed must speak to at a to condition of daughter can not know said very seriously encourage hope that must be allowed to marry man know mr finn felt that when told about at matching felt that must disapprove of disapprove of how must be otherwise of course felt that there be rank in life in first comer that suit maiden eye may be accepted a fitting lover will not say that who be born to such life may be happier be be sure free from trouble to be incident whom fate have called to different sphere duty be duty pang may cost duty must be performed certainly certainly certainly certainly said re echoing word then duke one have to be so sure what duty requires in many matter be easy enough only difficulty come from temptation there be case in be so hard to know be one of think so then maiden must in class of life be allowed to take man just suit eye a said mind be intent on glencora on burgo fitzgerald have not said so man may be bad vicious spendthrift eaten up by bad habit then frowned thinking that also have mind intent on glencora on burgo fitzgerald being most unwilling to have difference between burgo frank tregear pointed out to have said continued that even be none of fault apparent in character of suitor lady must in case be advised to accept young man because have made agreeable to there may be discrepancy there be said still with low voice with infinite energy insurmountable discrepancy only said that be case in might be difficult for to see duty plainly why must be must not have break heart then be silent for awhile turning over in mind proposition now seemed to have be made to if question came to must be allowed to break heart die must save from fate by sanctioning marriage with tregear if choice must be put to plainly by supernal power what then must choose if duty required to prevent marriage duty must not be altered by fact that girl must avenge upon by dying if marriage be in wrong that wrong must not be made right by fear of catastrophe be not often case duty required that someone must die yet a thought of thought that someone whom mind have suggested be one female creature now left belonging to put hand up to brow trembled with agony if knew if in truth believed that such must be result of firmness on part then must be infirm then must yield sooner than that must welcome tregear to house why must think that must die woman have now asked whether must be willing to break girl heart be frightful question must see that have come naturally in sequence of conversation have forced upon did girl break heart in such emergency be not romance men have died worm have eaten not for love remembered carried on argument in mind though pause be for minute there might be suffering doubt higher duty keener pang must become to be deterred from doing right because for time might find that have made world bitter to herself be there not feminine wile trick by woman learn to have way in opposition to judgment of lord master did not think that mary be wilfully guilty of scheme suffering knew be true suffering not le did become to be on guard against attack of nature said at last must not have break heart if understand what such word mean be generally think used fantastically must not wish to see overwhelmed by sorrow wish what question to ask father must be more plain in language duke though such marriage be distasteful to might perhaps be preferable to seeing sorrowing always why must have to sorrow always be told that man be born to sorrow a surely a spark fly upwards then can say nothing further think be cruel if be to say what really think will offend not unless mean offence will never do to duke when talk a do now hardly know think must see suffering not be moved by be to be continued long must give way though know that there be infinity of grief in life still struggle to save love from grieving if be steadfast enough to cling to affection for man then at last will have to yield looked at frowning did not say word then will perhaps be comfort for to know that man be trustworthy honest there be terrible rebuke in still a have called down upon must not resent even in heart thank said rising from chair perhaps will see again afternoon of course assented a interview have taken place in room took leave mr finn have said to be to same effect a have come from lady cantrip only be said with higher spirit woman saw matter in same light there must be fight between girl if must hold out for certain time must be conqueror might take away try what absence must do might have recourse to specific have answered so well in reference to own wife if continued to sorrow during absence if must have nothing to do with other lover then must at last give way have declared that be willing to sacrifice meaning thereby that if lengthened visit to city of china prolonged sojourn in western state of america must wean from love must go to china to western state at present self banishment have be carried farther than vienna during travel hitherto tregear name have not once be mentioned duke have come away from home resolved not to mention be minded to keep in reserve seeming catastrophe must justify declaration of purpose from first to last have be sad latterly have be ill when asked a to complaint must simply say that be not happy to go on with through chinese city must hardly be good for of must not wake to enthusiasm in regard to scenery costume picture even discomfort wherever be taken be barren to a plan stood at present be to return to england so a to enable to be at custins by middle of october have taught to hope that good must be done by prolonged travelling must readily have thrown over custins lord popplecourt must not bring to trust much to popplecourt scheme same contrivance have answered on former occasion when spoke to about plan expressed quite ready to go back to england when suggested chinese city face became very long be immediately attacked by paroxysm of headache think must take to place on seashore in england said mr finn custins be close to sea replied be lord cantrip place in dorsetshire be partly settled that be to go there suppose like lady cantrip why must not have not said word to to contrary only fear must feel that be being sent there a to convent ought to do then how can venture to answer that what must like best think must be to return to matching with to settle down in quiet way for winter duke shook head must be worse than travelling must still have headache still tell that be unhappy of course know what plan be pray believe must not obtrude advice if did not ask know said know how good be how reasonable know how much have to forgive oh if have not said so a must have done have not be from want of feeling do believe did what thought best when mary told that story at matching why must grace go back to that only may acknowledge indebtedness to say to somewhat fuller than must do in letter be sorry for pain gave be over now will be forgotten then spoke of immediate plan must at once go back to england by slow stage by very slow stage staying day two at salzburg at ratisbon at nuremberg at frankfort so on in way must reach england about th of october mary must then be ready to go to custins by time appointed in day two lady mary be better be terrible while last said speaking to mr finn of headache when have gone then be quite well only added after pause only can never be happy again while papa think a doe now then there be party made up before separated for excursion to hintersee obersee on occasion lady mary seemed to enjoy a liked companionship of mr finn against lady cantrip never said word lady cantrip be always duenna to whereas mr finn be friend while duke phineas be discussing politics together thoroughly enjoying weakness of lord drummond iniquity of sir timothy did with augmented vehemence from pony back two woman in lower voice talked over own affair dare say will be happy at custins said mr finn will not there will be people there whom know want to know have heard anything about mr finn mr finn turned round looked at for moment almost angrily then heart relented do mean mr tregear yes mr tregear think heard that be shooting with lord silverbridge be glad of said mary will be pleasant for of be very glad must be together while know that feel that be not altogether separated will never give up mr finn never never be use taking to china in mr finn quite agreed with chapter xlii again at killancodlem silverbridge remained at crummie toddie under dominion of reginald dobbes till second week in september popplecourt nidderdale gerald palliser be there also very obedient upon whole efficient tregear be intractable occasional untrustworthy be cause of much trouble to mr dobbes must entertain most heterodox injurious idea that a have come to crummie toddie for amusement be not bound to do anything did not amuse must not understand that in sport a in other matter there be ambition driving man on to excel always be ahead of others in spite of mr dobbes have cause for much triumph be going to be greatest thing ever done by six gun in scotland a for gerald whom have regarded a boy who have offended by saying that crummie toddie be ugly be ready to go round world for have indoctrinated gerald with idea of sportsman even to contempt for champagne conviction that tobacco must be moderated three lord too have proved efficient thing be going to be success just when day be of vital importance when be essential that there must be strong party for drive silverbridge found absolutely necessary that must go over to killancodlem have gone said nidderdale who be asked silverbridge almost angrily everybody know who be said popplecourt will be good thing when have got hold of boy so a to keep in proper place if can not withstand that sort of attraction ought not to go in for shooting at said dobbes must wonder at going continued nidderdale if did all know that american be no longer there have gone to bath think say suppose be mr jones said popplecourt dear boy said silverbridge may be quite sure that when say that be going to killancodlem mean to go to killancodlem that chaff about young lady think very disgusting will stop will be sorry if dobbes roll of killed must be lessened by single hand seeing that ambition set way considering amount of slaughter have perpetrated really think that need not be over anxious after nothing further be said tregear who knew that mabel grex be still at killancodlem have not spoken in truth mabel have sent for lord silverbridge have be letter dear lord silverbridge mr montacute jones be cut to heart because have not be over to see again say that be lamentable to think that man a reginald dobbes must have so much power over only twelve mile say know that be here told that knew miss boncassen be gone though miss boncassen have left be very pleasant party surely must be tired of such place a crummie toddie if only for sake of getting good dinner once in way do come over again will be here yet for ten day a will not let go back to grex

at once made up mind to go to killancodlem must not make up mind why be that have asked be sure of two thing sure in first place that have intended to let know that did not care about then sure that be aware of intention in regard to miss boncassen everybody at killancodlem have seen to disgust still that be so have be manifest have consoled feeling that must matter nothing must be accepted have made attempt to talk out of purpose must be that thought possible second attempt might be successful if so did not know have in truth thought not only that that something further than might be possible of course prize loomed larger before eye a prospect of obtaining became le must not doubt that have intended to offer hand when have spoken to of love in london then have stopped have spared a have told friend certainly have then be swayed by feeling that must be ungenerous in to seize greedily first opportunity have given have again made effort surely must not have sent ring have not intended to regard a lover when received ring heart have beat very high then have sent that little note saying that must keep till must give to wife when wrote that have intended ring must be own other thing pressed upon mind why have be asked to dinner at richmond why be invited to custins little hint have reached her of duke goodwill towards if on side marriage be approved why must destroy own hope then have seen with miss boncassen in pique have forced ring back upon during long game on lawn feeling have be very bitter of course girl be lovelier of two world be raving of beauty there be doubt a to charm of wit manner then have touch of blase used up way of life of lady mabel be conscious be natural that must be so be mabel grex girl to stand in way to force upon if loved certainly not though there might be triple ducal coronet to be have be there not other consideration must be well that heir of house of omnium must marry american girl a to whose humble birth whisper be already afloat a friend must not be right that must tell what world must say a friend therefore have given counsel when be gone whole thing weighed heavily upon mind why must lose prize if might still be own to be duchess of omnium have read of many of other sex of one two of own who by settled resolution have achieved greatness in opposition to obstacle be thing beyond reach to hunt catch marry to own injury must be impossible to be sure of herself there how infinitely better must be for must not have family with world of england in how short time must not repent marriage with miss boncassen whereas be wife must so stir for joy for good for honour that there must be possibility of repentance certainly have loved why else have followed spoken such word to of course have loved then there have come blaze of beauty have carried off not heart imagination because have yielded to such fascination be to desert also to desert from day to day thought of then wrote that letter hardly knew what must do what might say must trust to opportunity to do say something if have room for said to mr jones must scold lady mab have told that told to invite of course did do think must not sleep in stable give up own bed if there be other be so good of to come so good of mr jones to ask so very kind to come when attraction have gone then blushed stammered be just able to say that only object in life be

by lameness of such horse at time that hardly knew what saw what did not see at rate then in confusion found cause of lameness horse be led into stable a lame a tree here tifto found nail inserted into very cleft of frog of near fore foot so inserted that must not extract till farrier came that farrier have extracted nail from part of foot indicated be certainly fact then there be nail only who be most peculiarly privileged be allowed to see nail be buzzed about racing quarter that head of nail old rusty straight well pointed nail bore on mark of recent hammer in answer to be alleged that blacksmith in extracting nail with pincer have of course operated on head have removed certain particle of rust might easily have given appearance of having be struck in answer to farrier who be sharp fellow quite beyond suspicion in matter declared that have very particularly looked at nail before extracted have looked at with feeling on mind that something base might too probably have be done that be ready to swear that clear mark on head of nail be there before touched then not in stable lying under little dung heap away from stable door there be found small piece of broken iron bar about

lend at to who suspected mischief be miserable enough in great trouble must not separate from tifto believe word of that said to mr lupton ought to be investigated at rate said lupton mr pook may do a like will have nothing to do with then tifto came to swaggering tifto have to go through considerable amount of acting for be not very well adapted captain must have done better must have endeavoured to put altogether into same boat with partner must have imagined suspicion enmity on partner part till suspicion enmity have be shown tifto who have not expected that matter must be allowed to pas over without inquiry began by assuming that silverbridge must think evil of tifto who at moment must have given that have in world not to have done deed who now hated instigator of deed felt something almost akin to love for silverbridge found to be forced by circumstance to defend by swaggering understand be going on lord said do replied silverbridge horse be subject to accident be suppose a great sufferer a be deuced sight le able to bear who have said anything to contrary a for bearing must take a come of may a well know now a later have done with racing for ever what do tell that for can do

like to know what money pook have got on way laid disgusted silverbridge so much that turned away must have more to say to tifto before one o'clock at hour be stated nominally that race must commence general opinion have formed general opinion have nearly hit truth general opinion declared that nail have be driven in wilfully that have be done by tifto that tifto have be instigated by captain green captain green perhaps over acted part little intimacy with major be well known yet in turmoil kept apart a though have interest in matter have got little money on what little have lose said in answer to inquiry everyone knew that must not have great interest in race a to half owner of favourite be peculiarly intimate friend of own have come down to stable be seen about place with tifto might have be better a be though be very quiet name be soon mixed up in matter there be one man who asserted a fact known to that green villiers one gilbert villiers be in partnership together be very well known that gilbert villiers must win two thousand five hundred pound from lord silverbridge then minute investigation be made into betting of certain individual of course there must be great plunder where must plunder go who must get money poor silverbridge must lose be said that one at least of large bet made on tuesday evening must be traced to same villiers though not actually made by more must be learned when settling day must come there be quite enough already to show that there be many men determined to get to bottom of if possible there came upon silverbridge in trouble keen sense of position feeling of dignity ought to support clung during great part of morning to mr lupton mr lupton be much senior have never be intimate now there be comfort in society be afraid be hit heavily said mr lupton something over seventy thousand pound looking at what will be property be of course nothing if if what if go to jew for then will become great deal will certainly not do that then may regard a trifle said lupton ca be not trifle must tell father will find money there be doubt about will feel at present must rather change place with poorest gentleman know than have to tell have done with race lupton if so will have be happy day for man in position can hardly make money by may lose so much if man really like amusement a do risk more than what have in pocket may be very well at rate have done with nevertheless went to see race run everybody seemed to be touched with pity for carried well saying a little a must of own horse taking affecting to take great interest in race after race managed to see to whom have lost heavy stake having to own to a did so that not one of be gentleman to whom must like to give hand to explained that father be abroad that probably liability must not be settled till after father return however must consult father agent must then appear on settling day be full of blandest courtesy there be not one of who have doubt a to getting money unless whole thing might be disputed on score of tifto villany even then payment must not be disputed unless be proved that who demanded money have be one of actual conspirator after having seen

from mr moreton saying that must be in carlton terrace by noon on following day chapter xlv there will not be word about early in duke be at matching with daughter phineas finn wife be with on day after parted at ischl first news respecting prime minister have reached namely that son horse have lost race must not have annoyed at that paper read contained vague charge of swindling against somebody hinted that lord silverbridge have be victim even must not have troubled might in sort have comforted be not made evident to that son have be closely associated with swindler in transaction if be mere question of money might be settled without difficulty even though sum lost might have grown out of what might have expected into few thousand still must bear without word if only must separate boy from bad companion then came mr moreton letter telling whole at meeting took place between silverbridge father agent at carlton terrace be settled that mr moreton must write letter silverbridge tried found that must not do did not know how to humiliate sufficiently yet must not keep from making attempt to prove that according to recognised chance bet have be good bet mr moreton be better able to accomplish task knew duke mind very large discretion have be left in mr moreton hand in regard to money might be needed on behalf of dangerous heir so large that have be able to tell lord silverbridge that if money be in truth lost according to jockey club rule must all be forthcoming on settling day certainly without assistance from messrs comfort criball duke have be nervously afraid of such men of business a comfort criball from earliest day of son semi manhood have be on guard against let sacrifice be made so that son might be kept clear from comfort criballs to mr moreton have be very explicit own pecuniary resource be so great that must bear ravaging without serious detriment be for son character standing in world for future respectability dignity that fear be so keen not for own money by one so excitable so fond of pleasure a lord silverbridge ravaging must probably be made let be met by ready money such have be duke instruction to own trusted man of business acting on instruction mr moreton be able to tell heir that money must be forthcoming mr moreton after detailing extent nature of loss step have decided upon taking went on to explain circumstance a best must have made inquiry felt doubt that gigantic swindle have be perpetrated by major tifto others swindle have be successful mr moreton have consulted certain gentleman of high character versed in affair of turf mentioned mr lupton among others have be assured that though swindle be undoubted money have better be paid be thought to be impossible to connect men who have made bet with perpetrator of fraud if lord silverbridge be to abstain from paying bet because own partner have ruined animal belonged to jointly feeling must be against rather than in favour in fact jockey club must not sustain in such refusal therefore money must be paid mr moreton with expression of doubt trusted that might be thought to have exercised wise discretion then went on to express own opinion in regard to lasting effect matter must have upon young man think said that lordship be heartily sickened of racing that will never return to duke be of course very wretched when tidings first reached though be rich man of men least careful of rich still felt that seventy thousand pound be large sum of money to throw away among nest of swindler then be excessively grievous to that son must have be mixed up with such men wishing to screen son even from own anger be careful to remember that promise made that tifto must be dismissed be not to take effect till after race have be run there have be no deceit in then silverbridge have promised that must not plunge there be however promise from very nature may be broken without falsehood plunging be doubtful word path down to like doubtful path be slippery easy if assurance with mr moreton ended letter must only be made true must bring to forgive even offence boy must be made to settle in life duke resolved that only revenge must be to press on marriage with mabel grex at coblenz on way home duke daughter be caught up by mr mr finn matter of young man loss be discussed phineas have heard about be loud in denunciation against tifto captain green gilbert villiers others whose name have reached money thought must never have be paid duke however declared that money must not cause moment regret if only whole thing must be got rid of at cost have reached finn ear that tifto be already at loggerhead with associate there be hope that whole thing might be brought to light by mean for that duke cared nothing if only silverbridge tifto must for future be kept apart a far a be concerned good must have be done rather than harm while be in way together on rhine be decided that very soon after return to england phineas mr finn must go down to matching when duke arrived in london son be not there gerald have gone back to oxford silverbridge have merely left address then sister wrote very short letter papa will be so glad if will

minute before have washed dust from face hand be with father be glad to see silverbridge said duke putting out hand hope see well sir fairly well thank travelling think agrees with miss not comfort certain knowledge of how thing be going on come to think through skin when be at home feeling of absence pervades otherwise like what have be doing shooting little said silverbridge in mooncalf tone shooting great deal if what see in newspaper be true about mr reginald dobbes party presume be religion to offer up hecatomb to autumnal god who must surely take keener delight in blood slaughter than bloodthirsty god of old must talk to gerald about sir have gerald be so great at sacrifice how will suit with plato what doe mr simcox say of course be to have holiday just at time gerald be reading

of age in england scotland a for backing silverbridge think that have better have done with be said hardly in tone of reproach with something even of banter in a question be asked duke be smiling in moment sense of joyousness young man have felt in singing brother praise be expelled face fell stood before father almost like culprit might a well have out about racing continued duke something have to be said about have lost enormous sum of money duke tone in saying became terribly severe such at least be sound in son ear did not mean to be severe when did speak of displeased voice naturally assumed that tone of indignation with in day of yore have be wont to denounce public extravagance of opponent in house of common father paused son must not speak at moment worse than continued duke have lost in a bad company a must have found have picked england through mr lupton sir henry playfair lord stirling be in room when bet be made be gentleman name concerned with major tifto sir who can tell with whom may be in room though room of kind be think best avoided then duke paused again silverbridge be now sobbing so that must hardly speak be sorry that must be so grieved continued father such delight can not think lead to much real joy be for sir said son rubbing eye with hand supported head grief in matter might soon be cured how will cure will do anything to cure let major tifto horse go be gone said silverbridge energetically jumping from chair a spoke will never own horse again part of horse will have nothing more to do with race will believe will believe anything that tell wo say will not go to race because must not have hamper will bind by further promise have done with racing indeed indeed have sir then father came up to son put arm round young man shoulder embraced of course made unhappy knew must if be cured of evil money be nothing what be for for brother sister be large sum that will not grieve thing be so dangerous that if with much of loss can escape will think that have made not bad market who owns horse now horse will be sold for anything may fetch so that may get clear of dirt major know nothing of have not seen since day have claim on not shilling be other way let go then be quit of however may be send messenger so that may understand that have abandoned racing altogether mr moreton might perhaps see that father must forgive so readily yet suffer so deeply affected son feeling so strongly that for time must hardly repress sob now there will not be word more said about said duke suddenly silverbridge in confusion must make answer there will not be word said about said duke again now what do mean to do with immediately will stay here sir a long a do finn warburton have still few covert to shoot be good reason for staying anywhere

bread depended one ca expect game to be kept up if nobody go to shoot ca one did know must have thought that le be shot more there must be to shoot be ignorant in such matter silverbridge then broke forth into long explanation a to covert gamekeeper poacher breeding expectation of neighbourhood at large in middle of be interrupted by duke be afraid dear boy be too old to learn a be so manifestly duty go perform like man who will go with will ask mr finn to be one will be very hard upon in way of politics can answer better than can sir mr lupton said must come for day two will stand to after father stopped a be about to leave room one more word silverbridge do remember what be saying when walked down to house with from club that night silverbridge remembered very well what have said have undertaken to ask mabel grex to be wife have received father ready approval to proposition at moment be unwilling to refer to matter have thought about very much since said duke may say have be thinking of day if there be anything to tell must let know must not yes sir then there be nothing to be told hope have not changed mind silverbridge paused moment trusting that might be able to escape making of answer duke evidently intended to have answer appeared to sir that did not seem to suit said hardly driven young man must not now say that mabel have shown disposition to reject offer because a have be sitting by brookside at killancodlem even with self diffidence have be forced to see what be wish confusion too evident despair when heard of offer to american girl have plainly told tale must not now plead to father that mabel grex must refuse offer self defence when first found that have lost in love for american have be based on idea have done best to make mabel understand if have not actually offered to have done next thing to have run after till be ashamed of such running have given encouragement therefore have be justified doubt must have be mistaken that now perceived still felt to be justified be impossible that must explain to father one thing certainly must not say just at present after folly in regard to heavy debt must not at once risk father renewed anger by proposing to american daughter in law must stand over at rate till girl have accepted positively be afraid wo come off sir said at last then be to presume that have changed mind told when be speaking of be not confident have not ca explain sir fear wo come off then duke who have be sitting got up from chair with back to fire made final little speech decided just now silverbridge that nothing more must be said about unpleasant racing business nothing more will be said by must not be surprised if be anxious to see settled in life young man must be more bound by duty to marry early than be in first place have to repair injury done by inaptitude for society have explained to that be duty to have barsetshire covert properly shot have acceded to view surely must be equally duty to see

remembered what own feeling have be when mr finn have suggested propriety of telling story have be told to how must be possible to ask lady mabel to come to matching to meet miss boncassen in presence

considered to be unparalleled arrogance of young man in regard to rank young gentleman thought to be a good a anybody else in regard to money did acknowledge inferiority be misfortune must not be helped not only be letter arrogant fact that must dare to write letter on subject be proof of most unpardonable arrogance duke walked about room thinking of till be almost in passion then read letter again be gradually pervaded by feeling of manliness arrogance remained with arrogance there be certain boldness induced respect whether be son in law a must like not be duty to accept if by refusing to do so will render daughter miserable be mr tregear argument might be prepared to argue in answer that be duty to reject son in law even though by rejecting might make daughter miserable be not shaken with condemnation of young man there be mingled something of respect continued to digest letter before hour of dinner when almanac be brought to fixed on certain day boncassens knew must be free from engagement in ten day time a to lady mabel seemed to think almost certain that must come believe be always going about from one house to at time of year said mary think will come to if be

acknowledged to that tregear have shown certain manliness in appeal not on account be such man to have that demanded seemed to duke that there be alternative between note a given above total surrender post did not go out during night note lay hidden in duke private drawer till morning there be still that locus poenitentiae must be accorded to letter written in anger during day thought over constantly not in spirit of yielding not descending single step from altitude of conviction made feel that might be duty absolutely to sacrifice daughter asking whether might not be well that must explain whole matter at length to young man thought must put matter strongly be not by own doing that belonged to aristocracy if exclusiveness be banished from must cease to exist being what be having be born to such privilege such limitation be not bound in duty to maintain certain exclusiveness must appeal to young man to say whether marriage ought to be free between class of community if not between who be to maintain limit to whom authority in such matter be given so much in regard to rank then must ask young man whether thought fitting that young man whose duty according to known principle must be to earn bread must avoid that manifest duty by taking wife who must maintain a roamed about park alone felt that must write letter a must make impression even upon lover when have come back to study other reflection came to aid though might write most appropriate letter in world must there not certainly be reply a to conviction have ever known instance of man who have be convinced by adversary of course there must be reply reply to such correspondence there must be visible end word when once written remain may remain in testimony for ever so at last when moment came sent off three line with uncourteous compliment demand that there must be further correspondence at dinner endeavoured to make up for harshness by increased tenderness to daughter who be altogether ignorant of correspondence have written letter dear said have written hope people will come if will make comfortable papa be for sake wish to be here think that lady mabel miss boncassen be just such girl a must like do like only only what miss boncassen be american be that objection according to idea be desirable to become acquainted with person of various nation have heard doubt many story of awkward manner displayed by american lady if look for may probably find american woman who be not polished think will calumniate own country if say same of english woman must be object to select for own acquaintance best can find of country seems to that miss boncassen be young lady with whom other young lady might be glad to form acquaintance be little sermon mary be quite contented to endure in silence be in truth fond of young american beauty have felt pleasure in intimacy girl have proposed to thought inexpedient that miss boncassen lady mabel silverbridge must be at matching together therefore made reply to father sermon hardly seemed to go to point at issue be so beautiful said very beautiful said duke what have to do with girl need not be jealous of girl beauty mary laughed shook head what be then perhaps silverbridge might admire have doubt must doe for be aware that have met why must not admire know said lady mary sheepishly fancy that there be danger in direction think silverbridge understands what be expected from have not silverbridge plainly shown that understood what be expected from when selected lady mabel nothing must have be more proper duke have be altogether satisfied that in such matter there must have be change in so short time did not occur to poor mary be now completely silenced have be told that silverbridge understood what be expected from of course must not fail to carry home to herself accusation that failed to understand what be expected from have written letter have not a yet sent to mr finn to two young lady have be easy enough must mr mr finn come to matching on th of november papa say that promised to return think time will perhaps suit then to lady mabel do come if can papa particularly say that hope miss cassewary will come also to miss boncassen have written long letter that too have be written very easily write to instead of mamma because know must tell then will not be angry be only papa messenger be to say how much hope that will come on th mr boncassen be to bring whole british museum if wish then there be little postscript showed that there be already considerable intimacy between two young lady wo have mr l lord p not word be said about lord silverbridge there be not even initial to indicate name letter to brother be more difficult in epistle to others have so framed word a if possible to bring to matching in writing to brother be anxious so to write a to deter from coming be bound to obey father command have desired that silverbridge must be asked to come be asked to come craftily endeavoured so to word invitation that must be induced to remain away be papa doing said be glad that must like to have people here have asked finn with whom papa seems to have made up everything mr warburton will be here of course think mr moreton be coming seems to think that certain amount of shooting ought to be done then have invited lady mabel grex miss cassewary of papa choosing boncassens now will know whether set will suit have particularly begged that will come apparently because of lady mabel at know what that mean perhaps do a like lady mabel hope will come surely silverbridge must not run into jaw of lion when heard that be specially expected by father to come to matching in order that might make agreeable to one young lady must hardly venture to come seeing that must be bound to make love to young lady to mary great horror invitation be accepted mr mr finn be quite at duke disposal that have expected boncassens must come be signified in note from isabel covered four side of paper be full of fun under signature have be written few word not in fun word lady mary perfectly understood wonder wonder wonder did duke when inviting know anything of son inclination must be made to know now during visit what must say when did know that boncassens must come be matter of course mary have thought that lady mabel must refuse have told lady mabel that boncassens have be asked to thinking have not be improbable that young lady must be unwilling to meet rival at matching invitation be accepted be brother ready acquiescence troubled mary chiefly wrote a though there be doubt about matter of course there be deal of shooting to be done said consider bound to look after there ought not to be le than four gun particularly if warburton be to be one of like warburton very much think shoot badly to ingratiate with governor wonder whether governor must get leave for gerald for week have be sticking to work like brick if not must mind bringing someone ask governor let know will be there on th wonder whether will let hear what go on among about politics be sure there be not one of hate sir timothy worse than do lady mab be brick be glad have asked think will come a like shutting up at grex miss boncassen be brick if can manage about gerald will say that be third must have be very well have not known that secret must be that miss boncassen have be mistaken be forced to write again to say that father did not think right that gerald must be brought away from study for sake of shooting that necessary fourth gun must be there in person of one barrington erle then added lady mabel grex be coming so be miss boncassen to received reply though silverbridge have written to sister in usual careless style have considered matter much three month be over have idea of hesitation on part have asked to be wife be determined to go on with suit have ever be enabled to make same request to mabel grex have answered when did half make in serious manner must have be true to have not told father sister friend a isabel have suggested must not do so till must have received more certain answer from in respect to love be prepared to be quite a obstinate a sister be matter for own consideration must choose for three month be over be now business to present to lady again that lady mabel must also be at matching must certainly be misfortune thought probable that knowing that isabel boncassen must be there together must refuse invitation surely ought to do so that be opinion when wrote to sister when heard afterwards that intended to be there must only suppose that be prepared to accept circumstance a stood chapter lii miss boncassen tell truth on th of month guest came rattling in at matching one after boncassens be first lady mabel with miss cassewary followed

though be lively nevertheless kept eye upon lover lady mabel lady mary have said that thought brother be in love with lady mabel must be possible in own land have heard absurd story story seemed to to be absurd of treachery of lord countess of baseness of aristocrat of iniquity of high life in london father have told that go where might must find people in main to be very like other have seemed to that nothing must be more ingenuous than young man have be in declaration of love simplest republican must have spoken more plainly now at moment must not doubt that lover be very intimate with other

retired for night refused courtesy with usual smile showed more emotion than though two have now met for first time in life have quite made up mind a to what must do when opportunity must come in way must simply remind that three month be passed be shy of talking to in presence of lady mabel father be quite determined that thing must be done at once certainly wished that lady mabel have not be there in what have said to at dinner table have made understand that must be trouble to remembered look when told must marry be a though have declared to that be who ought to be husband referred back to proffer of love have once made to of course be disagreeable of course made thing difficult for not le be thing quite assured that must press suit to miss boncassen when be talking to mr boncassen

billiards said to isabel a three girl with other lady be together in drawing room got up very slowly from seat very slowly crept away to door then looked round a though expecting others to follow none

special reason why must must not have gone with thing must have be easy enough when two people go to play billiards third may surely accompany now lady mabel found that must not stir mr finn mr boncassen miss cassewary be in room none of moved silverbridge led way quickly across hall isabel boncassen followed very slowly when entered room found standing with cue in hand at once shut door walking up to dropped butt of cue on floor spoke one word well said what doe 'well ' mean three month be over certainly be 'over have be model of patience perhaps patience be more remarkable than constancy be not lady mabel grex in ascendant just now what do mean by why do ask that told to wait for three month have waited here be how very very downright be be not that proper thing thought be downright beat hollow yes three month be over now what have got to say put down cue stretched out arm a though be going to take hold to heart not that said laughing if will speak will hear know what

must answer question lord silverbridge be surely one have right to ask then stood waiting for reply keeping at little distance from a though be afraid that must fly upon indeed there seemed to be cause for such fear from frequent gesture of hand why do not answer have there be reason for such expectation yes there have there have thought of not knowing before have seen will know if will only say that love must like to know first do know almost have told that know what said to at killancodlem be not that enough approves what have to do with lady mabel be friend not guardian have right to

straightforward when found that be in earnest at killancodlem why did ever doubt when felt that be in earnest then have to be in earnest too thought so much about that lay awake nearly that night will tell thought tell something must like to hear will tell truth possible ' said to myself 'that man a can want to be wife englishman of highest rank greatest wealth one girl in world must love psha exclaimed be what said to myself then paused looking into face saw that there be glimmer of tear in eye one girl must love when asked for love because be so sweet so good so pleasant know that be chaffing then went on asking question be possible that who by friend will be regarded a nobody who be american with merely human workaday blood in vein that one a must become wife then told that be not possible be not in accordance with fitness of thing duke in england must rise up against especially that duke whose good will must be imperative why must rise up against know will will go on with story of myself when have settled that in mind just cried to sleep have be dream have come across one who in own self seemed to combine have ever thought of a being lovable in man isabel in outward circumstance soared a much above thought a heaven be above earth have whispered to soft loving heavenly word will not touch will listen to in sleep must be happy again not see barrier when woke made up mind 'if come to again ' said 'if must be that must come to again will tell that will be heaven on earth if if if ill will of friend must not make that hell to of ' did not tell quite that told nothing be to come again in three month said more than bade ask father now have come again can not understand girl fear doubt how must thought perhaps must not come when saw whispering to highly born well bred beauty remembered what be thought that must not come then must love love darling said a retreated from round corner of billiard table stood guarding from with little hand ask if love be entitled to know truth from sole of foot to crown of head love a think man must wish to be loved by girl love have come across life have swallowed up made own will not marry to be rejected by people will there be kiss between till know that will not be so may speak to father for what good have not spoken to father mother because have known that must depend upon father lord silverbridge if will tell that will be daughter will become wife oh with such perfect joy with such perfect truth if can never be so then let be torn apart with struggle still at once in case will get back to own country a best may will pray to god that may be forgotten then made way round to door leaving fixed to spot in have be standing a went made little prayer to delay fate be in to so be left alone in billiard room chapter liii then be a proud a queen during next day two shooting went on without much interruption from love making love making be not prosperous round poor lady mary have nothing to comfort must have be allowed to see letter lover have written to father comfort must have be if not ample still very great mary told again again that be quite sure of tregear be hard upon that must not be made certain that certainty be well grounded have known that tregear have written though have not seen word of letter must have comforted have heard nothing of letter in june last have seen by chance for few minute in lady mabel drawing room since have not heard from of be now more than five month since how must love serve how must her very life serve if thing be to go on like how be to bear thinking of resolved almost resolved that must go boldly to father desire that might be given up to lover brother though more triumphant for how must fail to triumph after such word a isabel have spoken to still felt difficulty very seriously have imbued with strong sense of own firmness have declared that must go away leave altogether if duke must be unwilling to receive knew that duke must be unwilling duke who certainly be not handy in duty of match making seemed to have fallen upon at death of wife showed by hundred little sign anxiety that son heir must arrange affair with lady mabel sign be manifest to mary be disagreeably manifest to silverbridge be unfortunately manifest to lady mabel be manifest to mr finn who be clever enough to perceive that inclination of young heir be turned in direction gradually became manifest to isabel boncassen host a host be courteous to guest have be of own selection did best to make pleasant to selected two for peculiar notice two be miss boncassen lady mabel while must walk talk argue after own peculiar fashion with american beauty explaining to matter political social till persuaded to promise to read pamphlet upon decimal coinage be always making awkward effort to throw silverbridge lady mabel together two girl saw knew well how matter be knew that be rival knew ground on on other stood be satisfied with advantage nearly satisfied isabel must not take prize without duke consent mabel must not have without that other consent if want to marry english duke once said to isabel in anger be unable to restrain there be duke never saw man more absolutely in love want to marry english duke said isabel pity girl who have idea of marriage except come from wish to give back love for love through father never suspected real state of son mind be too simple to think possible that purpose silverbridge have declared to a walked together from beargarden have already be thrown to wind did not like to ask why thing be not settled young men thought be sometimes shy young lady not always ready to give immediate encouragement when saw together concluded that matter be going in right direction be however opinion have to during three four day followed scene in billiard room isabel kept out of lover way have explained to that wished to do left to do day by day watched circumstance of life around knew that have not be done be sure that must not have be done while duke be explaining to beauty of quint expatiating on horror of twelve penny twelve inch twelve ounce variegated in matter by sixteen fourteen must not know that be ambitious of becoming daughter in law while be opening out to mystery of house of lord explaining how came to pas while be member of one house of parliament son must be sitting a member of how be that nobleman must be commoner how peer of one part of empire must sit a representative of borough in part be apt scholar have there be question of other young man marrying must probably have thought that other young man must have done better silverbridge be discontented with greatest misfortune be that lady mabel must be there while be present to father eye did not know how to declare altered wish now then must say to little word indicating feeling of absurdity of passion declare know whether be father that miss boncassen most affect said to to other similar speech must make answer have extracted secret from at killancodlem might use against if pleased in present frame of mind be not disposed to joke with upon subject on second sunday boncassens be to return to london on following tuesday found alone with isabel father american have be brought out at own request to see stable have be accompanied round premise by silverbridge by mr warburton by isabel by lady mary a got out into park party be divided silverbridge found with mr boncassen then occurred to that proper thing for young man in love be to go not to own father to lady father why must not do a others always did isabel doubt have suggested different course that isabel have suggested be at present moment impossible to now at instant without moment forethought determined to tell story to isabel father a other lover might tell to other father be very glad to find alone mr boncassen said mr boncassen bowed showed prepared to listen though so many at matching have seen whole play mr boncassen have seen nothing of know whether be aware of what have got to say can not quite say that be lord whatever be be sure will be delighted to hear want to marry daughter said silverbridge isabel have told that be downright in such matter have hardly a yet learned how to express with paraphrase in world delight mr boncassen stood stock still in excitement of moment pulled off hat proper thing be to ask permission to go on with want to marry daughter yes be what have got to say be aware of intention quite aware believe may say that if other thing go straight will consent father duke know nothing about a yet really take quite by surprise be afraid have not given enough thought to matter have be thinking about for last three month said lord silverbridge marriage be very serious thing of course be men generally like to marry equal know about think that count for much people always know who be equal be quite true if be speaking to to father theoretically must perhaps be unwilling to admit superiority on side because of rank wealth must make argument in favour of equality with best briton that ever lived a must become true born republican be just what mean when question becomes one of practising question for life for happiness for own conduct then knowing what must be feeling of aristocracy in such country a be prepared to admit that father must be a well justified in objecting to marriage between child of child of mine a must be in objecting to one between child son of mechanic in native city must be gentleman said silverbridge be word of quite know meaning do said silverbridge confidently must not define if man be well educated can keep good house over head perhaps may call gentleman there be many such with whom father must not wish to be so closely connected a propose may have sanction mr boncassen again took off hat walked along thoughtfully hope object to personally dear young lord father have gone out of way to be civil to be to return courtesy by bringing great trouble upon seems to be very fond of miss boncassen will continue to be fond of when have heard what doe isabel say say same a of course why of course except that be evident to a be to that must not with propriety say anything else think must must like know must like to be wife well yes if be serene think must consent dare say must consent if be serene why must not try too hard lord silverbridge say love do indeed then think of position in be placing be struggling to win heart silverbridge a heard assured that there be need for further struggling in direction perhaps have won yet may feel that can not become wife may well say to herself that be offered to be so great that doe not know how to refuse may yet have to say at same time that can not accept without disgrace must not put one that love into position a for disgrace be nonsense beg pardon mr boncassen must be disgrace that must be known here in england to be wife that none of of rank of what must then be own rank must welcome into new world must be out of question if own father refused to welcome must not others follow suit know father seem to know well enough to fear that must object yes be true what more do want to know if be once wife must not reject her of human being be in truth kindest most affectionate therefore must try after fashion lord can not see way through difficulty can say what please to a to own wish must not tell that have sanction from that evening story be told to mr boncassen matter be discussed among family isabel in talking to made scruple of declaring own feeling though in speaking to lord silverbridge have spoken very much a father have done afterwards yet in family conclave took lover part be very well father said told same thing if be man enough to be firm will not throw over not for duke in europe will not stay here to be pointed at will go back home if follows then will choose to forget about rank if love well enough to show that be in earnest will not disappoint for sake of pleasing father to mr mr boncassen be able to make efficient answer mr boncassen dear good woman must see reason why two young people who loved other must not be married at once duke duchess be nothing to if must be happy in england then let come live in new york did understand that anybody must be too good for daughter be there not idea mr boncassen

jones garden party before day in rain at maidenhead before brightness of killancodlem before glory of miss boncassen have be revealed to there be time for kind of thing now said weakly thought that when be here together must dress now sir will tell about when get back from cornwall will come back direct to matching will explain everything so escaped be clear to lady mabel that there be opportunity now for scheme might be possible must be postponed till after cornish business have be completed perhaps might be better so have thought that must appeal to that must tell of father wish of love for of authority have once given for loving of absolute impossibility of marriage with american thought that must do if not efficiently at rate effectively must not be done on very day on american have gone came out in course of evening that be going to assist frank tregear in canvas matter be not spoken of openly a tregear name must hardly be mentioned everybody knew gave occasion to mabel for few word apart with silverbridge be so glad be going to said in little whisper of course go when wish know that can do good greatest good in world name will go so far will be everything to to be in parliament when be to meet again said will turn up somewhere replied a gave hand to wish good bye on following morning duke proposed to lady mabel that must stay at matching for yet fortnight even for month if might be possible lady mabel whose father be still abroad be not sorry to accept invitation chapter lv polpenno polwenning seat of mr tregear frank father be close to borough of polpenno so close that gate of ground opened into town a silverbridge have told father many of tregear family have sat for borough then there have come change stranger have made welcome by money when vacancy now occurred deputation waited upon squire tregear asked to stand deputation must guarantee that expense must not exceed certain limited sum mr tregear for have such ambition eldest son be abroad be not at such man a one must choose to make into member of parliament after much consideration in family frank be invited to present to constituency frank aspiration in regard to lady mary palliser be known at polwenning be thought that must have better chance of success if must write letter mp after name frank acceded a be starting wrote to ask assistance of friend lord silverbridge at time there be only nine day more before election mr carbottle liberal candidate be already living in great style at camborne arm mr mr tregear elder sister of frank who quite acknowledged to be old maid be very glad to welcome frank friend on first morning of course discussed candidate prospect best chance of success said frank arises from fact that mr carbottle be fatter than people here seem to approve if purse be fat said old mr tregear will carry off personal defect lord silverbridge asked whether candidate be not too fat to make speech miss tregear declared that have made three speech daily for last week that mr williams rector who have heard declared to be godless dissenter mr tregear thought that must be much better that place must be disfranchised altogether than such horrid man must be brought into neighbourhood godless dissenter said holding up hand in dismay frank thought that have better abstain from allusion to opponent religion then mr tregear made little speech used said to endeavour to get someone to represent in parliament who must agree with on vital subject such a church of england necessity of religion now seems to be considered ill mannered to make allusion to such subject from may be seen that old tregear be very conservative indeed when old people be gone to bed two young men discussed matter hope will get in said silverbridge if can do anything for of course will be always good to have real member along with one said tregear begin to think be very shaky conservative be sorry for sir timothy be such beast said silverbridge be that notion of political opinion be to be that in accordance with own liking disliking for particular man one be supposed to have opinion of one own father must be down on man because be dissenter of course father be old fashioned doe seem so hard to said silverbridge to find difference between two set who be true conservative be much more like to father who be liberal than to own who be on same side a may be so still may be good conservative seems to in house to mean nothing more than choosing one set of companion choosing there be awful cad who sit along with mr monk fellow that make sick to hear whom must be civil to think there be anybody hate so much a old beeswax have contemptuous way with nose make long to pull mean to go over in order that may be justified in doing so think soar little higher said tregear oh of course be clever fellow said silverbridge not without touch of sarcasm man may soar higher than without being very clever if party call liberal be to have own way who be there that doe believe that church must go at once then distinction between borough house of lord immediately afterwards after that crown be not governor idea governor must help liberal party with plenipotentiary power must go on right away to logical conclusion of argument be only conservative feeling of country save such men a father from being carried headlong to ruin by own machinery have read carlyle french revolution yes have read be so there there be lot of honest men who thought must do deal of good by making everybody equal good many be made equal by having head cut off be why mean to be member for polpenno to send mr carbottle back to london carbottle probably doe want to cut anybody head off dare say be a conservative a anybody want to be member of parliament a have thought much about anything be quite willing to lend hand to communism radicalism socialism chopping people head off anything else be very well said silverbridge where must have be if there have be liberal robespierre pal cut off lot of head louis xiv louis xv locked up more in prison so have last word in argument whole of next morning be spent in canvassing whole of afternoon in evening there be great meeting at polwenning assembly room at present moment be in hand of conservative party here frank tregear made oration in declared political conviction whole speech be said at time to be very good portion of be apparently esteemed most have direct reference to mr carbottle who be mr carbottle why have come to polpenno who have sent for why mr carbottle rather than anybody else did not people of polpenno think that might be a well to send mr carbottle back to place from whence have come question seemed to silverbridge to be a easy a be attractive almost made desirous of making speech then mr williams rector followed gentleman who have many staunch friend many bitter enemy in town addressed chiefly to bane of whole country a conceived godless dissenter be felt by tregear to be injuring cause by word spoke be necessary that mr williams must liberate own mind therefore persevered with godless dissenter at great length not explaining however how man who thought enough about religion to be dissenter must be godless how godless man must care enough about religion to be dissenter mr williams be heard with impatience then there be clamour for young lord be son of ex prime minister therefore of course must speak be member of parliament therefore must speak have boldly severed from faulty political tenet of family therefore on such occasion a be peculiarly entitled to speak when man go electioneering must speak at dinner table to refuse be possible in assembly convened for semi private purpose gentleman may declare that be not prepared for occasion in such emergency a man member of parliament can not plead that be not prepared son of former prime minister who have already taken so strong part in politics a to have severed from father not prepared to address voter of borough whom have come to canvas plea be so absurd that be thrust on to foot before knew what be about be in truth first public speech at silverbridge have attempted to repeat few word in failure have be covered by sprugeons sprout now be on leg in great room in unknown town with aristocracy of place before eye at first swam little there be moment in thought must run away on morning a be dressing there have come to mind idea of possibility of such moment a few word have occurred to friend frank tregear began rushing at once at subject be very good fellow hope will elect then paused not remembering what be to come next sentiment have uttered appeared to auditor to be so good in so well delivered that filled up long pause with continued clapping exclamation yes continued young member of parliament encouraged by kindness of crowd have known frank tregear ever so long think must find better member of parliament anywhere there be many lady present thought that duke son be just person who ought to come electioneering among voice be much pleasanter to ear than of old mr williams woman waved handkerchief men stamped foot here be orator come among know about just a well a do continued orator be sure feel that ought to be member for polpenno there must be doubt about that a far a opinion of audience went there ca be better fellow than frank tregear ask to give three cheer for new member ten time three cheer be given carbottleites outside door who have come to report what be going on at tregear meeting be quite of opinion that eldest son of former prime minister be tower of strength know anything about mr carbottle continued silverbridge who be almost growing to like sound of own voice perhaps be good fellow too no very bad fellow indeed be heard from different part of room know anything about be at school with carbottle be taken a stroke of keenest wit be received with infinite cheering silverbridge be in pride of youth carbottle be sixty at least nothing must have be funnier seems to be stout old party think be man for polpenno think will return frank tregear be at school with tell that ca find better fellow anywhere than frank tregear then sat down be afraid felt that have made speech of evening be so much obliged to lord silverbridge miss tregear said a be walking home together be just sort of thing that people like so reassuring know what mr williams say about dissenter be of course true be reassuring hope did make fool of to night silverbridge said when be alone with tregear probably with little pride in heart ought to say that did seeing that praised so violently whatever be be well taken know whether will elect have come down a candidate be quite sure must have elected silverbridge be hardly satisfied with wished to have be told that have spoken well did not however resent friend coldness perhaps after did make fool of myself said to a went to bed on next day after breakfast be found to be raining heavily canvassing be of course business of hour canvassing be business can not be done indoors be soon decided that rain must go for nothing must agreement have be come to with carbottleites might have be decided that party must abstain a be impossible tregear party must not afford to lose day a mr carbottle by reason of fatness natural slowness must perhaps be specially averse to walking about in slush mud might be that must gain something so after breakfast started with umbrella tregear silverbridge mr newcomb curate mr pinebott conservative attorney with four five follower who be armed with book pencil who ticked off on list of voter name of friendly doubtful inimical parliamentary canvassing be not pleasant occupation perhaps nothing more disagreeable more squalid more revolting to sens more opposed to personal dignity can be conceived same word have to be repeated over over again in cottage hovel lodging of poor men woman who only understand that time have come round in be to be flattered instead of being flatterer think be right in supposing that husband principle be conservative mr bubbs know nothing about 'd better call again see bubbs hissel certainly will do so must at like to leave borough without seeing mr bubbs hope will have influence mr bubbs know nothing about folk at home allays vote buff think bubbs ought to go buff too only mind bubbs never come home to dinner must come arter six hope be to have some'at for trouble wo have word to vote unless have some'at such be conversation in candidate take part while cortege at door be criticising very imperfect mode of securing mr bubbs good wish then go on to next house same thing with variation be endured again guide philosopher friend who accompanies who be chief of cortege have calculated on behalf that ought to make twenty such visitation hour to call on two hundred constituent in course of day a be always falling behind in number be always being driven on by philosopher till come to hate poor creature to whom be forced to address with most cordial hatred be nuisance to man must subject in weather when rain there be superadded squalor ill humour to party make almost impossible for not to quarrel before day be over to talk politics to mr bubbs under circumstance be bad to do so with conviction that moisture be penetrating from greatcoat through shirt to bone while so employed be breathing steam from seven other wet men at door be abominable to have to go through be enough to take away pride man might otherwise take from becoming member of parliament to go through then not to become member be base indeed to go through to feel that be probably paying at rate of hundred pound day for privilege be most disheartening silverbridge a backed up tregear in uncomfortable work congratulated on comfort of having mr sprugeon mr sprout who must manage borough for without contest worked on day morning till one when took luncheon reeking with wet at king head so that little money might be legitimately spent in cause then at two sallied out again vainly endeavouring to make twenty call within hour about four when be beginning to be dusk be very tired silverbridge have ventured to suggest that a be wet through a there be to be meeting in assembly room night a nobody in part of town seemed to be at home might perhaps be allowed to adjourn for present be thinking how nice must be to have glass of hot brandy water then lounge till dinner time philosopher received proposition with stern disdain be lordship aware that mr carbottle have be out day from eight in morning be still at work that carbottleites have already sent for lantern be determined to go on till eight o'clock among artisan who must then have returned from work when man have put hand to plough philosopher thought that man must complete furrow philosopher view have just carried day discussion having be held under seven eight wet umbrella at corner of dirty little lane leading into high street when suddenly on other side of way mr carbottle cortege made appearance philosopher at once informed that on such occasion be customary that rival candidate must be introduced will take ten minute said philosopher then will take ten minute too upon tregear a being younger of two crossed over road introduction be made there be something comfortable in to tregear party a imagination must conceive anything more wretched than appearance of mr carbottle be very stout man of sixty seemed to be almost carried along by companion have pulled coat collar up hat down till very little of face be visible in attempting to look at tregear silverbridge have to lift up chin till rain ran off hat on to nose have umbrella in one hand stick in other be wet through to very skin what be own feeling can not be told philosopher guide friend must allow rest very hard work mr tregear said shaking head very hard indeed mr carbottle then two party went on own way without word chapter lvi news be sent to matching there be nine day of work during lord silverbridge became very popular made many speech tregear did not win half so many heart recommend so thoroughly to political predilection of borough nevertheless be returned must probably be unjust to attribute success chiefly to young lord eloquence certainly be not due to strong religious feeling of rector be to be feared that even thoughtful political conviction of candidate did not altogether produce result be that chief man among candidate guide friend that leading philosopher who must not allow anybody to go home from rain who kept eye so sharply open to pecuniary doings of carbottleites that mr carbottle guide friend have hardly dared to spend shilling be who have in truth be efficacious in attempt have made to spend money have be looked into circumvented a mr carbottle have be brought down to polpenno on purpose that might spend money a have nothing money to recommend a have not spent free independent elector of borough have not seen way to vote for therefore conservative be very elate with triumph there be great conservative reaction electioneering guide philosopher friend in humble retirement of own home be tailor in town whose assistance at such period have long be in requisition knew very well how seat have be secured ten shilling head must have sent three hundred true liberal to ballot box mode of distributing money have be arranged conservative tailor have be too acute not sovereign must be passed tailor got twenty five pound for work be smuggled in among bill for printing mr williams however be sure that have so opened out iniquity of dissenter a to have convinced borough yes salem zion ebenezer in large parish must be closed be great thing for country said mr williams will make capital member said silverbridge clapping friend on back hope will never forget said mr williams that owes seat to protestant church of england principle have sunk so deeply into mind of thoughtful portion of inhabitant of borough whom must elect tregear said mother feeling that rector took too much of praise to think have done more for than one else whispered miss tregear to young lord what said be so reassuring father before went to bed expressed to son with trepidation hope that must lead to great permanent increase of expenditure that evening before went to bed lord silverbridge wrote to father account of what have taken place at polpenno polwenning th december dear father among have managed to return tregear be afraid will not be quite pleased because will be vote lost to party really think that be just fellow to be in parliament if be on side be sure be kind of man 'd like to bring into office be always thinking about sort of thing say that if there be conservative such liberal a mr monk must be destroyed by jacobin there be something in whether man be conservative not suppose there ought to be conservative duke a read made memorandum in own mind that must explain to son that carriage must have drag to wheel that ambitious soul must choose to be coachman rather than drag be beastly work duke made memorandum to instruct son that gentleman above age of schoolboy must allow to use such word in such sense have to go about in rain up to knee in mud for eight nine day always saying same thing of course that said be bosh memorandum rather two one a to slang a to expediency of teaching something to poor voter on such occasion only comfort be that carbottle people be quite a badly off a memorandum a to grammar absence of christian charity did not at moment affect duke made ever so many speech till at last seemed to be quite easy here there be very grave memorandum speech easy to young speaker be generally very difficult to old listener of course be bosh required separate memorandum have promised to go up to town with tregear for day two after will stick to purpose of going to matching again will be there about nd will then stay over christmas after be going into brake country for hunting be such shame to have lot of horse never to ride most affectionate son silverbridge last sentence gave rise in duke mind to necessity of very elaborate memorandum on subject of amusement generally by same post letter went from polpenno to matching also gave rise to mental memoranda be a follows dear mabel be member of british house of common have sometimes regarded a being

of recollection of past feeling half concealed reference to former passion might have be allowed to a woman a woman whose fortune must depend on marriage must indulge in such allusion surely need not have be so hard still there be memorandum at present moment must do that desired a far a be in power be anxious that must marry lady mary palliser though so anxious also that something of love must

will give something to do certainly ought said duke think that be idle man to duke made answer did not wish to be made to talk about tregear may tell why say asked softly pressing hand on duke arm ever so gently to duke assented still coldly because want to know what ought to do must mind reading that letter of course will remember that frank have be brought up almost a brother sister duke took letter in hand did read very slowly what say about young men without mean going into parliament be true enough be not encouraging a duke went on reading mabel did not think necessary to argue matter have to read last paragraph twice before understood did read twice then folding letter very slowly gave back to companion what ought to do asked lady mabel a dear be friend think that carrying of message to mary must be breaking confidence think that must not speak to mary about mr tregear then changed subject lady mabel of course understood after must not say word to mary about election at

not to be borne farmer be very much stronger against than gentleman have now become settled belief among sporting men in england that major have with own hand driven nail into horse foot be to be endured that runnymede farmer must ride to hound under master who have be guilty of such iniquity a that staines egham gazette have always supported runnymede hunt declared in very plain term that who

better than might have be expected be very disagreeable position said very disagreeable indeed a for nail in horse foot know more about than babe unborn have got two thing to say will say what be most consequence first hound belong to here paused loud contradiction came from many part of room mr jawstock however proposed that major must be heard to end say belong to repeated major if anybody try

silverbridge everybody know that suppose dropped well on to eighty thousand pound propose to leave to let say ought to know more about than one be partner in horse lordship be very sweet upon just at present nobody need fear that will do good turn say leave to in matter major have certainly be well advised rumour have become prevalent among sporting circle that silverbridge have refused to condemn major be known that have paid bet without delay that have to extent declined to take advice from leader of jockey club major friend be informed that young lord have refused to vote against at club be not more than probable that if matter be referred to must refuse to give verdict against late partner major sat down put on cap folded arm akimbo with horn sticking out from left hand for time there be general silence broken however by murmur in different part of room then mr jawstock whispered something into ear of chairman mr topps rising from seat suggested to tifto that must retire think so said mr jawstock proposition have made can be discussed only in absence then major held consultation with one of friend after did retire when be gone real hubbub of meeting commenced there be there who understood nature of lord silverbridge feeling in matter must be last man in england to declare guilty said mr jawstock lord say sha ride across land said farmer in background think gentleman ever made fairer proposition since anything be anything said friend of major gentleman who kept livery stable in long acre wo have here said farmer whereupon mr topps shook head sadly think gentleman ought to be condemned without 'earing said one of tifto admirer where be to get one to hunt country like know a body be prepared to say will manage said young gentleman from neighbourhood of bagshot who thought that must hunt country quite a well a major tifto must go from here be long short of said mr jawstock put to vote mr jawstock said livery stable keeper mr topps who have have great experience in public meeting hereupon expressed opinion that might a well go to vote no doubt be right if matter be one must sooner later be decided in manner mr jawstock looked round room trying to calculate what might be effect of show of hand majority be with be well aware that of majority few must be drawn away by apparent justice of tifto proposition be use of voting let vote a might be out of question that tifto must remain master of hunt chairman have acceded on such occasion be difficult to go against chairman then there came show of hand first for who desired to refer matter to lord silverbridge afterwards for tifto direct enemy for who be anxious to banish out of hand without reference to one at last matter be settled to great annoyance of mr jawstock farmer meeting voted that lord silverbridge must be invited to give opinion a to innocence guilt of late partner major friend carried discussion out to a sat on horseback a though have altogether gained battle be secure in position a master of runnymede hunt for next dozen year at same time there came message from mr mahogany topps be now half past two mr topps expressed hope that major tifto must not draw country on present occasion major thinking that might be a well to conciliate enemy rode solemnly slowly home to tallyho lodge in middle of hound chapter lviii major be deposed when silverbridge undertook to return with tregear to london instead of going off direct to matching be to be feared that be simply actuated by desire to postpone further visit to father house have thought that lady mabel must surely be gone before task at polpenno be completed a soon a must again find in father presence must at once declare intention of marrying isabel boncassen must not see way to doing while lady mabel must be in house think will find mabel still at matching said tregear on way up will wait for fancy know why must wait for said silverbridge almost angrily thought that be fast friend suppose be after fashion might wait for perhaps think must if must go there be much thicker with than ever be went to see at grex when nobody else be there be miss cassewary nobody next door to said silverbridge half jealous of favour shown to tregear thought said tregear that there must be closer intimacy between know why must think so have never such idea yourself have now so there may be end of think fellow ought to be cross questioned on subject then be very sorry for mabel said tregear be uttered solemnly so that silverbridge found debarred from making flippant answer must not altogether defend have be quite justified thought in changing mind did not like to own that have changed so quickly think have better not talk more about said after pausing for few moment after nothing more be said between on subject up in town silverbridge spent two three day pleasantly enough while thunderbolt be being prepared for rather in truth two thunderbolt during day be much with tregear though must not speak freely of own matrimonial project still be brought round to give sort of assent to engagement between tregear sister new position friend have won for did in degree operate on judgment be not perhaps that imagined that tregear a member of parliament must be worthier that fancied that such must be duke feeling duke have declared that tregear be nobody must hardly be said of man who have seat in

that doe not undertake to reinstate major tifto even must opinion be in favour have honour to be lord lordship most obedient servant jeremiah jawstock juniper lodge staines mr jawstock when have written letter be proud of own language still felt that application be very lame one why ask man for opinion tell at same time that opinion might probably not be taken yet other alternative have be

that passage in explained that master of hound must be depositary of influence intimacy be good yet application be lame very lame lord silverbridge a read thought that be very unfair be most disagreeable thunderbolt then opened second letter of well knew handwriting be from major tifto letter be very legible writing be cramped showing that operation have be performed with difficulty silverbridge have hoped that might never receive epistle from late partner letter a follows have be drawn out for tifto in rough by livery stable keeper in long acre dear lord silverbridge venture

application a impertinence a to tifto vacillated much between pity contempt absolute condemnation everybody have assured that man have certainly be guilty fact that have made bet against joint horse bet a to have said nothing till after race be over have be admitted by yet be possible that man might not be such rascal a to be unfit to manage runnymede hound having got rid of tifto must have be glad that poor wretch must have be left with hunting honour did not think that must write to late partner letter must preserve honour to at tregear advice referred matter to mr lupton mr lupton be of opinion that letter must be answered that answer to must be very short there be prejudice about world just at present said mr lupton in favour of answering letter see why be to be subjected to

gone so far a to make preparation for what have hoped must be early marriage preparation exclaimed silverbridge thinking of church bell bride cake wedding present a to property be so anxious that must enjoy settled independence can belong to english gentleman never plough sow know more of sheep bull than of extinct animal of earlier age must not have so with must fain see surrounded by thing ought

placed in world below law be great thing because men be poor weak bad be great because where exists in strength tyrant can be above between there must be mention of law a guide of conduct speak to of honour of duty of nobility tell what require of silverbridge listened in silence with something of true admiration in heart felt strong necessity of declaring own conviction on one special point here at once in new crisis of conversation accident in regard to colour of dean lodge have stood in way of logical study so that be unable to put argument into proper shape there belonged to certain natural astuteness told that must put in rejoinder at particular point think be bound in honour in duty to marry miss boncassen said if understand what mean by nobility just a much because have promised not only for have promised therefore be bound have well have said that love therefore of course be bound be not only that what do mean suppose man ought to marry woman love if can get not so

boncassen be weak a water said unhappy father be not weak in did not say exactly same about lady mabel there be pause so that be driven to reply found a thought indifferent then changed mind indifferent what doe think about now doe know of how doe stand between two at present moment know that be engaged to miss boncassen doe approve of why must ask sir have not asked then why did tell must not have spoken mind when told there must have be much between when be talked of unfortunate young man be obliged to take time before must answer appeal have to own that father have justice on side at same time must reveal nothing of mabel secret told because be friend did not ask approval did disapprove thought that son must not marry american girl without family of course must feel that now have told what said hope will ask further question about can not make lady mabel wife though for matter of ought not to presume that must take if wished have intended to ask to day to consent to marriage with miss boncassen can not give consent then be very unhappy how can believe a to unhappiness when must have said same about lady mabel grex few week ago nearly eight month said silverbridge what be difference be not time disposition of man can not give consent young lady see in right light will make escape easy want to escape have indicated cause will separate will not be separated from said silverbridge who be beginning to feel that be subjugated to tyranny if chose to marry isabel one must have right to hinder can only hope that will think better of that when next speak to on other subject will answer with le arrogance rebuke be terrible to son whose mind at present moment be filled with two idea that of constancy to isabel boncassen then of respect affection for father indeed sir said be not arrogant if have answered improperly beg pardon mind be made up about thought have better know how be see that can say anything else to now think of going to harrington afternoon then duke with further very visible annoyance asked where harrington be be explained that harrington be lord chiltern seat lord chiltern being master of brake hound that be son purpose to remain six week among brake hound that must stay only day two with lord chiltern then appeared that silverbridge intended to put up at hunting inn in neighbourhood duke did not at like plan that son must choose to

be shooting in scotland then racing ah ala yes racing betting at doncaster then shooting at matching have be made to appear to be chief reason why have be living in own house now son be going away to live at inn in order that more time might be devoted to hunting why ca hunt here at home if must hunt be woodland said silverbridge thought wanted wood lord chiltern be always troubling about trumpington wood breeze about hunting enabled son to escape without further allusion to miss boncassen did escape proceeded to turn over in mind have be said tale have be told great burden be thus taken off shoulder must tell isabel so much thus free from suspicion of having be afraid to declare purpose must know what have done must be made to understand that have be firm have thought be very firm gave credit on head father doubt have be firm too that have expected father have said much that about honour duty have be very good be certain that when young man have promised young woman ought to keep word thought that there be certain change going on in management of world father did not quite understand father never do quite understand change be manifest to son year ago might have be improper that american girl must be elevated to rank of english duchess now be altered duke spent rest of day alone be not happy in solitude that silverbridge have told be sad to have taught to think

matter peril from outsider peril from new fangled prejudice peril from more modern sport peril from over cultivation peril from extended population peril from increasing railroad peril from literary ignorance peril from intruding cad peril from indifferent magnate duke of omnium for instance that peril of peril peril of decrease of fund increase of expenditure jaunty gentleman who put on dainty breech pair of boot on single horse ride out on pleasant morning to neighbouring meet thinking sportsman have faint idea of trouble few staunch workman endure in order that may not be made to think

swallow whole a hard riding men say came down in further ditch silverbridge came down on head horse pursued course across heavily ploughed field be very disagreeable be not in least hurt became duty to run after horse very few furrow of work suffice to make man think that hunting altogether be beastly sort of thing mr spooner horse who have shown to be little le quick of foot than own have known about bank double ditch have apparently of own accord turned down to right seeing hearing hound knowing that ploughed ground be to be avoided rider soon changed course went straight after riderless horse when silverbridge have reduced to utter speechlessness by exertion brought back steed be be be so sorry struggled to say then a held horse for struggled up into saddle keep down furrow said mr

baldfaced stag be here that horse be standing now intended by limiting to one horse day to mount friend for couple of week be settled at last that tregear must ride friend horse one day hire next so on wonder what will think of mr spooner said why must think anything of because doubt whether ever saw such woman before doe nothing hunt then certainly sha want to see again talk a never heard lady

enjoyable be really so exact judge of pace a pretended to be be afraid sha have anything like to day continued wind in west never do like westerly wind little to north said husband looking round compass dear said lady never know where wind come from now think of taking off comforter wo have tregear be riding friend favourite hunter thoroughbred bay horse very much more than up to rider weight supposed to be peculiarly good at timber water well defined kind of fence however high however broad found at covert near kennel killed fox after burst of few minute found again having lost fox declared that there be not yard of scent always know what west wind mean said mr spooner then lunched smoked trotted about with apparent acknowledgement that there be much to be done be not right that must expect much after so good thing a have have yesterday at half past two mr spooner have be sent home by providence mr spooner be calculating that must be able to ride horse again on tuesday when on sudden hound be on fox turned out afterwards that dick rabbit have absolutely ridden up among stubble that hound have nearly killed before have gone yard astute animal making best use of leg till must get advantage of first ditch ran crept jumped absolutely through pack then there be shouting yelling riding men who be idly smoking threw away cigar who be loitering at distance lost chance real sportsman always on alert always thinking of business in hand always mindful that there may be at moment fox just before hound have glorious opportunity of getting well away among one be more intent when moment came better away than mr spooner silverbridge have be talking to have full advantage of care tregear be riding behind with lord chiltern who have be pressing to come with friend to harrington a soon a shouting be heard chiltern be off like rocket be not only that be anxious to get well away that sense of duty compelled to see how thing be being done old fowler certainly be little slow dick rabbit with true bloody minded instinct of whip be little apt to bustle fox back into covert then when run commences with fast rush rider be apt to over ride hound then hound will over run fox of have to be seen to by master who know business tregear followed being mounted on fast horse be soon a forward a judicious rider must desire now runks press on spoil said mr spooner to hard riding objectionable son of old runks vet from rufford young runks did press on till master spoke word word will not be repeated be efficacious at moment there have be check a there be generally after short spurt when fox hound horseman get off together not always in order in have be placed here there be too much bustle pack becomes disconcerted enabled fowler to get up by dint of growling at men conciliating hound soon picked up scent if 'd stand still for two minute be to muttered aloud to 'd 'ave some'at to ride arter might go then there be of 'd soon be nowhere in spite of fowler denunciation there be of course rush runks have slunk away by making little distance be now again ahead of hound unfortunately there be half dozen with lord chiltern be very wrath when be like said mr spooner to tregear be always well to give wide berth a hound be now running fast be necessary that even in taking precaution due regard must be have to fox line be back for harrington bush said mr spooner a said so rode at bank with rail at top of perhaps foot half high with deep drop into field beyond be not very nice place be apparently only available spot in fence seemed to know well for a got close to brought horse almost to stand so took horse cleared rail seemed just to touch bank on other side while threw back almost on to crupper so came down with perfect ease knowing that must not be easy to horse paused moment to see what must happen tregear be next to be intending to fly fence when saw mr spooner pull horse pause also have to pull horse did so a to enable to take leap without danger encumbrance from hardly so a to bring horse to bank in same way may be doubted whether animal be riding must have known enough be quiet enough to have performed acrobatic manoeuvre have carried mr spooner so pleasantly over peril have idea of for thought occurred to that must turn ride fast at jump before must turn saw that silverbridge be pressing on be thus only resource to do a mr spooner have done be too close to rail still tried horse attempted to jump caught foot against bar of course went over head foremost probably must have be nothing have not silverbridge with rushing beast be

make understand have absolutely control over what control have nay can not define that be father acknowledges authority regard a friend a such treat with sweetest affection nothing can be more gratifying than manner to personally ought to be so have thoroughly won heart still know that if there be difference between must not obey why must because hold deputed authority oh duke go for very little anywhere one can depute authority come too much from personal accident too little from reason law to be handed over to others besides fear that on one matter concerning be not agreed will be sorry if be so feel that be bound to tell opinion oh yes think that in end lady mary will allow to be separated from tregear think that in end will become man wife seemed to duke to be not quite so bad a might have be speculation a to result be very different from expressed opinion a to propriety be to tell truth a to own mind might perhaps have said same thing one be not to relax in one endeavour to prevent be wrong because one fear that wrong may be ultimately perpetrated let be a may said can not alter duty mine duke if may presume to think have duty in matter that must encounter burden of duty bind to for ever if be that will certainly be married one day who have said that who have admitted that if be so if seems to that must be so then how can be anxious to prolong suffering

others be well for often that be so plastic whether must be better for that must be so will not say must be better said duke doggedly such be not nature be a determined a ever may be determined too if at last will be of use if be fate to be married to man die of broken heart what justifies in saying that how can torture by threat if think so duke be justified of late have be with daily almost hourly say that will kill now in youth be not often fancy that woman die after fashion broken heart may bring sufferer to grave after lapse of many year how will be with if must live like ghost beside

gratitude to of can not express sense in word how far may agree with where may disagree will not attempt to point out to now oh that have troubled to think to feel in matter true friendship have compelled to say to will be written down in tablet of memory duke child have at rate be fortunate in securing friendship of such friend then turned back to fireplace be constrained to leave room without word have determined to make best plea in power for mary while be making plea have be almost surprised by own vehemence greater have be vehemence stronger thought must have be duke anger a have watched working of face have felt for moment that vial of wrath be about to be poured out upon even when left room almost believed have not taken moment for consideration at fireplace parting word must have be different a be there must be question now of departure power be left to of separating from lady mary though duke have not a yet acknowledged to be conquered there be doubt to now that must be conquered either here in london must be girl nearest friend up to day when must be given over to mr tregear be one of three attack be made upon duke before went up to parliamentary duty

writing from lord chiltern house where be confined to bed think will understand when say that even in helpless condition feel constrained to do something of course ask for nothing from on own behalf on behalf may not add prayer to hers have honour to be grace very faithful servant francis tregear coming alone must perhaps have have effect duke have desired young man not to address again young man have disobeyed mere courtesy must now have constrained to send reply to further letter coming a did while heart be still throbbing with effect of mr finn word be allowed to have certain force argument used be true argument girl be devoted to man who sought hand mr finn have told that sooner later must yield unless be prepared to see child wither fade at side have once thought that must be prepared even for that have endeavoured to strengthen own will by arguing with that when saw duty plainly before must cleave to let result be what might that picture of face withered wan after twenty year of sorrowing have have effect upon heart even made excuse within own breast in young man favour be in parliament now what may not be done for young man in parliament altogether young man appeared to in

of life a year be coming on felt how necessary be that must have someone who must love since wife have left have be debarred from caress by necessity of showing antagonism to dearest wish have be duty to be stern in word to daughter have be governed by conviction that never ought to allow duty of separating from lover to be absent from mind be not prepared to acknowledge that duty have ceased yet there have crept over feeling a be half conquered why must not seek recompense in daughter love papa said hate hate darling because be disobedient oh papa can not help must not have come must not have

know day chapter lxvii be such beast lord silverbridge remained hunting in brake country till few day before meeting of parliament have be left to must have have week in country might probably have overstayed opening day have not be left to in last week in january important despatch reached hand from le important person than sir timothy beeswax suggesting to that must undertake duty of seconding address in house of common when proposition first reached made hair stand on end have never yet risen to foot in house have spoken at election meeting in cornwall have found easy enough after first second time have thought good fun knew that standing up in house of common must be different from then there must be dress must so hate to fig out look like guy said to tregear to whom of course confided offer be made to tregear be very anxious that must accept man must never refuse anything of kind come in way tregear said be only because be governor son silverbridge pleaded partly so perhaps if be altogether so what of take good god provide of course thing ambition covets be easier to duke son than to others not on account must duke son refuse man when see rung vacant on ladder must always put foot there will tell said silverbridge if thought be fair sailing 'd do must feel certain must come cropper still 'd try a say fellow must try be meant a blow at governor old beeswax think that if can get up to swear that crew be real first chop hand will hit governor hard be a much a saying to governor chap belongs to not to ' be thing wo go in for then tregear counselled to write to father for advice at same time to ask sir timothy to allow day two for consideration counsel took letter reached father two day before left matching in answer to there came first telegram begging silverbridge to be in london on monday then letter in duke expressed a being anxious to see son before giving final answer to question thus be that silverbridge have be taken away from hunting isabel boncassen however be now in london from be possible that might find consolation have written to soon after reaching harrington telling that have have out with governor there be good deal can only tell when see said then assured with many lover protestation that be always must be till death altogether own most loving s to have received answer by return of post must be delighted to see up in town a must father mother have now got comfortable house in brook street then signed sincere friend isabel silverbridge thought that be cold remembered certain scrap in feminine handwriting in more passion be expressed perhaps be way with american young lady when be in love yes said duke be glad that have come up at once a sir timothy must have answer without further delay what will say duke though have already considered matter very seriously nevertheless took few minute to consider again offer said must be acknowledged a very flattering circumstance be not usual can not often be case that minister must ask son of keenest political opponent to render service however will put aside not quite sir for present will put on one side not looking at party may be called upon to support having for moment no regard to line in politics there be opening to real duty of parliamentary life must sooner see accorded to than if be to break down talking to father must not quite venture to ask what might happen if be to come cropper none brave deserve fair said duke slapping hand upon table why if fail 'we fail screw courage to sticking place will not fail ' what high point must ever be reached if caution such a be allowed to prevail what young men have done before can not do have doubt of capacity none have sir said silverbridge considerably gratified also surprised none in least perhaps of diligence must learn by heart sir if mean that mean rather mean much more than that have first to realise in mind thing to be said then word in must say before come to learning by heart of suppose must tell what to say doubt with inexperience must be unfit that must be left entirely to must wish to know perhaps must say to feel that sentiment to be expressed by be just must have to praise sir timothy not that necessarily must have to advocate course in parliament sir timothy friend have taken propose to take hate like poison there need be personal feeling in matter remember that when moved address in house mr mildmay be prime minister man for whom regard esteem be unbounded who have be in political matter preceptor of youth whom a patriotic statesman almost worshipped whom now remember a man whose departure from arena of politics left country very destitute one have sprung up since like to hardly second to in speaking on so large subject a policy of party thought beneath to eulogise man same policy reversed may keep silent respecting sir timothy need of course say what think about suppose do agree with sir timothy a to general policy on other condition can undertake duty of course have voted with so have observed not so regularly perhaps a mr roby must have desired mr roby be conservative whip suppose people at silverbridge expect to support hardly know how may be used to be contented with poor service doubt feel have changed for better must say that sir be bound to suppose that think so because when matter be left in own hand at once elected conservative need not fear that will offend by seconding address will probably feel proud to see young member brought forward on occasion a will be proud to see son must if be on other side sir yes silverbridge yes must be very proud if be on other side there be useful old adage bid not cry for spilt milk have right to opinion though perhaps may think that in adopting what must call new opinion be little precipitate can not act together in politics not le on account do wish to see take active useful part on side to have attached a said rose from seat spoke with emphasis a though be addressing imaginary speaker house of legislator around will be proud to hear second address if do a gracefully a fitly a be sure may if will give trouble will hear do with infinite satisfaction even though will feel at same time anxious to answer argument to disprove assertion must be listening doubt to opponent must be proud to feel be listening to son advice to be to do a sir timothy have asked be such beast sir said silverbridge pray speak in way on matter so serious think quite understand sir perhaps not can enlighten believe have done only to annoy duke who have again seated be leaning back in chair raised up placed hand on table before looked son hard in face idea silverbridge have just expressed have certainly occurred to remembered well circumstance of time when sir timothy beeswax have be member of same government remembered how animosity have grown how treacherous have thought man from moment in have read minister letter to young member have felt that offer have too probably come from desire to make political separation between son complete have thought that in counselling son be bound to ignore such feeling certainly have not occurred to that silverbridge must be astute enough to perceive same thing what make fancy said duke striving to conceal by manner not altogether successful in concealing gratification certainly felt well sir be not sure that can explain of course be putting in different boat from have already chosen boat perhaps think may get out again dislike skipper so much that be not sure that will not oh silverbridge be fault so much be included in be unstatesmanlike unpatriotic almost dishonest do mean to say that must be that in politics according to personal liking for individual when trust leader ca believe very firmly in follower said silverbridge doggedly wo say sir what may do though dare say that what think be not of much account do think good deal about be glad of a think not at improbable may go back again if mind will refuse of course after that duke have further argument to use in favour of sir timothy proposition chapter lxviii brook street silverbridge have now week on hand felt might devote to lady of love be comfort to that need have nothing to do with address to have to go day after day to treasury in order that might learn lesson must have be disagreeable to did not quite know how lesson must have be communicated fancied must have come from old roby whom did not love much better than sir timothy then speech must have be composed afterwards submitted to someone probably to old roby again by whom doubt must be cut slashed made quite different speech than have intended if have not praised sir timothy roby other tutor might have be assigned to must have put praise in then how many hour must have taken to learn horrid thing by heart proudly felt that have not be prompted by idleness to decline task not le be glad to have shuffled burden from off shoulder early next morning be in brook street having sent note to say must call having even named hour yet when knocked at door be told with utmost indifference by london footman miss boncassen be not at home also that mr boncassen be not at home also that mr boncassen be not at home when asked at what hour miss boncassen be expected home man answered just a though have be anybody else that knew nothing about turned away in disgust have driven to beargarden in misery have recourse to game pie pint of champagne for lunch halloa old fellow what be hear about said nidderdale coming in sitting opposite to know what have heard be going to second address what made pick out from lot of be just what be not going to do saw in paper dare say yet be true must wonder if ask at moment waiter handed large official letter to lord nidderdale saying that messenger who have brought be waiting for answer in hall letter bore important signature of t beeswax on corner of envelope so disturbed lord nidderdale that called at once for glass of soda brandy when opened be found to be very nearly counterpart of silverbridge have received down in country there be however added little prayer that lord nidderdale must at once come down

standing faithful cab felt that at present moment must be impossible to sit still dismissed equipage walked rapidly along brook street into park lane from thence to park hardly knowing whither went in enthusiasm of moment walked back to marble arch thence round by drive to guard house bridge over serpentine by knightsbridge barrack to hyde park corner though must give up everything go live in own country with must marry politics hunting address to queen horse gun father wealth own rank what be to isabel boncassen in meeting have met one human being in world who must really be anything to either in friendship in love when have told what must do for to make home happy have seemed to that other delight must fade away from for ever how odious be tifto racehorse how unmeaning noise of club how terrible tedium of parliamentary bench must not tell love a have told hers acknowledged to that word must not be a word intellect a hers heart must be a true have spoken to of name rank outside world around must make understand at last that be nothing to in comparison with when have got round to hyde park corner felt that be almost compelled to go back again to brook street in other place must there be anything to interest nowhere else must there be light warmth joy what must think of to go back hot soiled with mud in order that might say one more adieu that possibly might ravish one more kiss must hardly be manly must postpone for morrow on morrow of course must be there work be before that prayer have to be made to father rather wonderful effort of eloquence must be made by father might be convinced that girl be so infinitely superior to anything of feminine creation have ever hitherto be seen heard of idea a to birth country rank name ought in instance to count for nothing did believe that have found pearl that question of setting need be taken into consideration if duke must not see fault must be in duke eye perhaps in own word certainly not in pearl then compared to poor lady mabel in doing so did arrive at something near truth in inward delineation of two character lady mabel with grace with beauty with talent be creature of effort a might be called manufactured article strove to be graceful to be lovely to be agreeable clever isabel be infinitely more without struggle when be most fond of mabel most anxious to make wife there have always be present to feeling that be old though knew age to day knew to be younger than yet be old something have gone of native bloom something have be scratched chipped from first fair surface have be repaired by varnish veneering though have loved have never be altogether satisfied with isabel be a young a hebe knew nothing of actual year did know to have seemed younger to have seemed older to have seemed in way different from what be must have be to be le perfect chapter lxix pert poppet on sunday morning while lord silverbridge be alone in certain apartment in house in carlton terrace be called own sitting room name be brought of gentleman who be anxious to see have seen father have used eloquence of be master not quite with effect have desired father have be very kind too have be eloquent have a be often case with orator be apparently more moved by own word than by of adversary if have not absolutely declared a irrevocably hostile to miss boncassen have not said word might be supposed to give token of assent silverbridge therefore be moody contemplative desirous of solitude nothing that duke have said have shaken be still sure of pearl quite determined that must wear various thought be running through brain what if be to abdicate title become republican be inclined to think that must not abdicate be quite sure that one must prevent from going to america calling mr palliser that father must forgive accept daughter in law brought to be in first place to marry without sanction felt quite sure what be there that father must not forgive then isabel must not assent to be turning in head ever anon trying to relieve mind by clarissa be reading in conformity with father advice when gentleman card be put into hand whatever doe want here said to then ordered that gentleman might be shown up gentleman in question be old friend dolly longstaff dolly longstaff silverbridge have be intimate a young men be be not friend a far a silverbridge knew have dolly ever set foot in house before well dolly said what be matter now suppose be surprised to see did think that be ever up so early be at time almost noon oh come now be nonsense can get up a early a anybody else have changed for last four month be at breakfast morning very soon after ten what miracle be there anything can do for well yes there be of course be surprised to see never be here before therefore be odd be odd felt that when tell have come about will think more odd know can trust with secret that depends dolly what mean be know be good natured there be ever so many fellow be one most intimate friend must say anything on earth must be ill natured hope be not friend oh yes be think of glasslough popplecourt hindes if knew anything about that did want to have known about young lady anything of kind think 'd tell everybody man ca tell anything doe know be true have thought of then there be particular reason for telling be about young lady wo tell will wo ca see why on earth must come to be ever so many year older than be have thought of too be just person must tell want to help last word be said in whisper dolly a said have drawn nearer to friend silverbridge remained in suspense saying nothing by way of encouragement dolly either in love with own mystery doubtful of own purpose sat still looking eagerly at companion what mischief be asked silverbridge impatiently have quite made up own mind be good thing at rate be not what must have called marrying sort of man must have said suppose most men do marry sooner later be just what said to myself have to be done know there be three different property coming to at least one have come already be lucky fellow have made up mind when say thing mean to do what can do be just what be coming to if man doe marry think ought to be attached to to a broad proposition silverbridge be ready to accede regarding dolly a middle aged sort of fellow one of men who marry because be convenient to have house kept for simply nodded head be awfully attached to dolly went on to say be right of course there be fellow who marry girl for money have known men who have married grandmother not really that kind of thing when woman be old doe not much matter who be one be not old rich well know about be not after money pray understand that be because be downright fond of be american what said silverbridge startled know be reason have come to be miss boncassen dark frown came across young man face that must be said to be disgusting that owl like must dare to talk of loving miss boncassen be offensive to be because know that have come to think that be after dolly a said lifted quickly up in seat nodded head mysteriously a looked into companion face be a much a though must say see be surprised so be then went on doe pert poppet be almost too much for silverbridge still contained wo look at because have got into head that perhaps day may be duchess of omnium that of course be out of question upon word seems to to be so very very distasteful that think have better say nothing more about be distasteful said dolly truth be be so downright what may call enamoured talk such stuff a here said silverbridge jumping up wo have be there be nothing must do to get of course be good match for have got three separate property when governor go off will have clear fifteen thousand year oh bother of course be nothing to be very tidy income for commoner how be to do better know how must do much worse said silverbridge in transport of rage then pulled moustache in vexation angry with that must have allowed to say even word on so preposterous supposition isabel boncassen dolly longstaff be titania bottom over again be absolutely necessary that must get rid of intruder began to be afraid that must not do without using language must be uncivil upon word said think have better not talk about more young lady be one for whom have very great respect mean to marry said dolly thinking thus to vindicate might a well think of marrying one of star one of star royal princess well perhaps be opinion ca say that agree with see why must take can give position may call al out of peerage can bring into society can make english lady of ca make anything of except to insult too by talking of quite understand said unfortunate lover getting up from seat very likely wo have perhaps have told so never mentioned name to in life suppose remembers existence say that there can be insult in one a asking one a to be wife to say that doe remember existence be absurd why must be troubled with because think be making fool of because be honest be why said dolly with much energy there be something in partly reconciled silverbridge to despised rival there be touch of truth about man though be so utterly mistaken in idea want to give over in order may try again think ought to keep girl from promotion merely for fun of flirtation perhaps be fond of wo marry be fond of will after minute pause silverbridge resolved that must be magnanimous miss boncassen be going to be wife said wife yes wife now think will see that nothing further can be said about matter duchess of omnium will be lady silverbridge oh of course will be that first then have got nothing further to say be not going to enter to run against only must have believed if anybody else have told such be good fortune oh ah yes of course be one way of looking at well silverbridge will tell what will do will hook not yes will dare say wo believe have got feeling about here a said laid hand upon heart that if stayed must go in for hard drinking will take great asiatic tour know fellow want to go have got money dare say will be off before end of next month know fellow must buy dozen hunter do silverbridge shook head good bye said dolly in melancholy tone be sure be very much obliged to for telling if 'd known 'd meant must have meddled of course duchess of omnium look here dolly have told what must not have told one wanted to screen young lady name be so kind of repeat be kind of thing that lady be particular about choose own time for letting everybody know then dolly promised to be a mute a fish took departure silverbridge have felt towards end of interview that have be arrogant to unfortunate man particularly in saying that young lady must not remember existence of such suitor have also recognised certain honesty in man purpose have not be le honest because be so absurd actuated by consciousness of have swallowed anger have told whole truth nevertheless thing have be said be horrible to buffoon of man have called isabel pert poppet how be to get over remembrance of such offence then wretch have declared that be enamoured there be sacrilege in term when applied by such man to isabel boncassen have thought of day to come when everything must be settled when might sit close to call pretty name when might in sweet familiarity tell that be little yankee fierce republican chaff about star stripe then a pictured scene to in imagination must lean upon must give back chaff must call aristocrat must laugh at title a thought of must be proud with feeling that such privilege must be own now wretched man have called pert poppet there be sanctity about divinity made almost profanity to have talked about at to one a dolly longstaff be holy of holy at vulgar eye must not even be allowed to gaze have be most unfortunate interview be clear that a have announced engagement to one a dolly longstaff matter now must admit of delay must explain to father that a tidings of engagement have got abroad honour to young lady must compel to come forward openly a suitor at once if argument might serve then perhaps intrusion must not have be altogether misfortune chapter lxx love may be great misfortune silverbridge when reached brook street that day be surprised to find that large party be going to lunch there isabel have asked to come have thought dearest girl in world for doing so now gratitude for favour be considerably abated did not care just now for honour of eating lunch in presence of mr gotobed american minister whom found there already in drawing room with mr gotobed with ezekiel sevenkings great american poet from far west who sat silent stared at in unpleasant way when sir timothy beeswax be announced with lady beeswax daughter gratification certainly be not increased last comer who did not arrive indeed till be seated at table almost made start from chair take departure suddenly that last comer be other than mr adolphus longstaff a happened be seated next to dolly with lady beeswax on other side of whereas holy of holy be on other side of dolly arrangement made seemed to to have be monstrous have endeavoured to get next to isabel have so manoeuvred that there must be vacant chair between have not much regarded because vacant chair may be pushed on one side before have made calculation dolly longstaff be sitting there almost thought that dolly winked at in triumph very dolly who hour ago have promised to take off upon asiatic travel sir timothy minister kept up conversation very much between sir timothy flattering everything be american minister finding fault with very many thing be english now then mr boncassen must put in word to soften severe honesty of countryman to correct euphemistic falsehood of sir timothy poet seemed always to be biding time dolly ventured to whisper word to neighbour be to say that frost have broken up silverbridge heard looked dagger at everyone then lady beeswax expressed to hope that be going to do great thing in parliament session mean to go near place said not at conveying purpose to have really come driven by stress of moment to say something must express general hatred of everybody mr lupton be there on other side of isabel be soon engaged with in pleasant familiar conversation then silverbridge remembered that have always thought lupton to be most conceited prig nobody gave so many air be so careful a to dyeing of whisker be astonishing that isabel must allow to be amused by such antiquated coxcomb when have finished eating moved about changed place mr boncassen being rather anxious to stop flood of american eloquence came from friend mr gotobed british viand have become subject to criticism mr gotobed have declared to mr lupton that did believe that london must produce dish of squash tomato be quite sure must have sweet corn then there have be moving of seat in minister be shuffled off to lady beeswax poet found by side of isabel do not regret mountain prairie said poet great water green savannah think more perhaps of fifth avenue said miss boncassen silverbridge who at moment be being interrogated by sir timothy heard word of be so sorry lord silverbridge said sir timothy that must not accede to little request did not quite see way said silverbridge with eye upon isabel so understood hope that thing will make clearer to shortly there be nothing desire so much a support of young men such a very cream may say of whole country be to young conservative thoughtfulness truly british spirit of springing aristocracy look for reaction be sure will at last carry safely over rock shoal of communistic propensity must wonder if did said silverbridge did think that be going to remain down there talking politics to old humbug like sir timothy when sun moon star have gone up into drawing room for at moment isabel be making way to door sir timothy have buttonholed of course be late now to say anything further about address have arranged that not quite a must have wished for have set heart upon initiating into rapturous pleasure of parliamentary debate hope that good time be coming pray remember lord silverbridge there be member sitting on side of house need hardly say on other whom must go farther to oblige than father son be sure be very kind said silverbridge absolutely using little force a disengaged then at once followed lady upstairs passing poet on stair have hardly spoken to whispered to isabel knew that to whisper to now with eye of many upon with ear of many open be absurdity must not refrain there be so many to be entertained a people say think ought to have to entertain answered laughing one heard silverbridge yet did not seem to whisper left however at once be soon engaged in conversation with sir timothy convivial lunch hold to be altogether bad worst of many evil be that vacillating mind doe not know when to take owner off silverbridge be on occasion quite determined not to take off at a be only lunch people must go then must be left with isabel vacillation of others be distressing to mr lupton went poor dolly got away apparently without word beeswax gotobeds must not go poet sat staring immovably in meanwhile silverbridge endeavoured to make time pas lightly by talking to mr boncassen have be so determined to accept isabel with adjunct that have come almost to like mr boncassen must certainly have taken part violently have one spoken ill of in presence then suddenly found that room be nearly empty beeswax gotobeds be gone at last poet with final glare of admiration at isabel have taken departure when silverbridge looked round isabel also be gone then too mr boncassen have left room suddenly at same instant mr boncassen entered by door two men be alone together dear lord silverbridge said father want to have few word with of course there be nothing for to submit remember what said to down at matching oh yes remember that did great honour of expressing wish to make child wife be asking for very great favour also for there be greater favour must do to man than to give daughter nevertheless be doing great honour did a do everything with honest grace went far to win heart be not at surprised sir that must have won hers young man a heard must only blush look foolish if know girl money title must go for anything think much more of love mr boncassen than do of anything else in world love lord may be great misfortune a said tone of voice be altered there be melancholy solemnity not only in word in countenance take that young people when love rarely think of more than present moment if did so bloom must be gone from romance others have to do for if isabel have come to saying that loved poor man there must not have be much to disquiet poor man may earn bread for wife if failed must have found bread have loved somewhat below own degree must have opposed so long a husband have be educated man there might have be future punishment to fear think must have done said silverbridge at rate have not done so how be to look upon have done will do best for mr boncassen believe must even love ca make englishwoman can make duchess not that sir ca give parentage fit for duchess not fit at least in opinion of with whom will pas life with whom perhaps without whom will be destined to pas life if becomes wife unfortunately doe not suffice that must think fit though loved other a well a man woman that ever be brought into other arm by beneficence of god can not make happy unless can assure respect of around world will respect conduct yes think world world must learn to do think must help must not suffice may respect man who clean boot must be wretched man if be thrown on for society must not give society will duchess countess give theirs certainly will ask for a thinking to be of more value than of others be to become wife must be so abnormally placed a to require for comfort must have become lady of high rank not because love rank because love yes yes yes said silverbridge hardly knowing why became impetuous having removed into position being a must be countess duchess what not how must be happy if be excluded from community of countess duchess be not like said silverbridge will not say that be know having anglican tendency have be wont to contradict countryman when have told of narrow exclusiveness of noble having found noble commoner alike in courtesy be cold word in hospitable friendship must now not only contradict must laugh to scorn such charge so far spoke somewhat loudly then dropped voice a concluded be anything le than happiness of child be in question what be to say sir only know be not going to lose be fine fellow be going to say that wished be american so that isabel need not lose boy have told that know how might be of whom know who must best tell truth on subject who be there whose age will have given experience whose rank will have made familiar with matter who from friendship to must be least likely to decide against wish who from own native honesty must be most sure to tell truth mean father said silverbridge do mean father happily have taken dislike to girl have seen enough of to feel sure that be devoted to own child indeed be just liberal man one must say not carried away by prejudice well girl have just put head together have come to conclusion if duke of omnium will tell that must be safe a wife safe from contempt of around will have will rejoice to give to not because be lord silverbridge not because of rank wealth because be that individual human being whom now hold by hand when american have come to end silverbridge be too much moved to make immediate answer have idea in own mind that appeal be not altogether fair father be just man just affectionate liberal then will so often happen that father want son to marry very girl on whom son have set heart must only say that must speak to father again on subject let tell that be contented said mr boncassen will tell that be contented now friend good bye silverbridge begged that might be allowed to see isabel before be turned out isabel have left house in company with mother chapter lxxi what be to say sir when silverbridge left mr boncassen house be resolved to go to father without hour delay represent to duke exactly how case stood must be urgent piteous submissive eloquent in other matter must promise to make arrangement father might desire must make father understand that happiness depended on marriage when once married must settle down even at gatherum castle if duke must wish must not think of race horse must desert beargarden must learn blue book by heart only do a much shooting hunting a must become young nobleman in position must say a eagerly a pleasantly a might be said must add to assurance of unchangeable intention be purpose to marry isabel boncassen if must do with father good will so best at rate must marry world at time be altogether busy with political rumour be supposed that sir timothy beeswax must do something very clever be supposed also that must sever from of present companion on point everybody be agreed on point only everybody be right lord drummond who be titular prime minister sir timothy have during considerable part of last session through whole vacation so belarded other with praise in public expression that be quite manifest that have quarrelled when body of statesman make public asseveration by one various voice that there be discord among not dissentient voice on subject people be apt to suppose that can not hang together much longer be man who have peace at home declares abroad that wife be angel who life on comfortable term with partner of trouble can afford to acknowledge ordinary rub of life old mr mildmay who be prime minister for so many year whom party worshipped used to say that have never found gentleman who have quite agreed with round sir timothy have always be in exact accord with colleague till have left never have there be such concord a of late men club newspaper now protested that a natural consequence there must soon be break up not on account must perhaps be necessary that sir timothy must resign not necessary that resignation must be permanent conservative majority have dwindled still there be majority certainly be case lord drummond must not get on without sir timothy might not be possible that sir timothy must get on without lord drummond if so must begin action in direction by resigning must have to place resignation doubt with infinite regret in hand of lord drummond if such step be to be taken now just a parliament be about to assemble what must become of queen speech of address of noble peer noble other commoner who be to propose second in two house of parliament there be who said that trick played at last moment must be very shabby then again there be who foresaw that shabbiness must be made to rest anywhere rather than on shoulder of sir timothy if must turn out that have striven manfully to make thing run smoothly that premier incompetence chancellor obstinacy that secretary peculiarity of temper have done might not sir timothy then be able to emerge from confused flood swim along pleasantly with head higher than ever above water in great matter parliamentary management go for so much if man be really clever handy at trade if can work hard know what be about if can give take be not thin skinned sore bored if can ask pardon for peccadillo seem to be sorry with good grace if above thing be able to surround with prestige of success then so much will be forgiven great gift of eloquence be hardly wanted deep seated patriotism be capable of strong indignation party have to be managed who can manage best will probably be best leader subordinate task of legislation of executive government may well fall into inferior hand of le astute practitioner be admitted on side that there be man like sir timothy for managing house coercing party there be therefore general feeling that must be pity sir timothy must be squeezed out knew little secret of business must arrange let cause be what might to get full house for friend empty bench for opponent must foresee thousand little thing to even walpole must have be blind pitt must not have condescended to regard with familiarity made very comfortable leader of house of common there be various idea prevalent a to politics of coming session prevailing idea be in favour of sir timothy duke be at seat of old political ally duke of st bungay have be absent from sunday th till morning of friday th on day parliament be to meet on morning at about noon letter came to son saying that father have returned must be glad to see silverbridge be going to house on day be not without own political anxiety if lord drummond remained in thought that must for present stand by party have adopted if however sir timothy must become prime minister there must be loophole for escape there be three four besides who detested sir timothy in such case might perhaps have company in desertion be on mind through be aware that there be matter of much deeper moment required energy when father message be brought to told at once now be time for eloquence well silverbridge said duke how be matter going on with there seemed to be something in father manner more than ordinarily jocund good humoured with sir mean to ask party secret if sir timothy understand other of course will be discreet ca be discreet sir because know anything about when heard said duke smiling of being in close conference with sir timothy sir yes mr boncassen told that be so deeply taken up with other at house that nobody must get word with of have seen mr boncassen asked son whose attention be immediately diverted from father political badinage yes have seen happened to meet where be dining last sunday walked home with be so intent upon what be saying that fear allowed to take out of way what be talking about said silverbridge preparation eloquence method now seemed to have departed from be talking about said duke have told that wanted to see what did say sir suppose can guess what said wished to know what thought of offer have made to daughter great subject have come up so easily so readily that be almost aghast when found in middle of yet must speak of matter at once hope raised objection sir said objection came mainly from be bound to say that word fell from be spoken with wisdom still asked to consent by mean told opinion then asked question be sure did not say that ought not to be married did say that thought ought not to be married if if what sir if there be probability that daughter must not be well received a wife then asked what must be reception of silverbridge looked up into father face with beseeching imploring eye a though everything now depended on next few word that might utter will think unwise marriage continued duke silverbridge when heard at once knew that have gained cause father have spoken of marriage a thing be to happen joyous light dawned in eye look of pain went from brow duke be not slow to perceive will think unwise marriage continued repeating word be bound to tell be miss boncassen to become wife must also become daughter oh sir told why marriage must be distasteful to whether may be wrong right think to be for good of country for good of order for good of individual family that must support other by marriage be not a though be narrow class already too closely bound together by family alliance room for choice might be wide enough for without going across atlantic to look for who be to be mother of child to mr boncassen replied that be to look solely to daughter happiness meant to understand that cared nothing for feeling why must to be deep wisdom be to empty prejudice asked then how others must receive be sure that everybody must like said silverbridge like like very much be so glad still be sorrow to when however put question to about world around a to among whom lot must be cast must not say that thought must be rejected oh idea of rejecting isabel have brightness grace own continued duke will ensure acceptance in society yes yes be just that sir will be nine day wonder foolish young nobleman who chose to marry american think will be just other way up sir among men place will think be secure to be what told mr boncassen be right with then now if call right will understand of course that be acting in opposition to advice wish what be to say sir exclaimed silverbridge almost in despair when love girl better than life when tell that can be mine if choose to take when have asked to be wife have got to say that like when father have given way rest of must be possible must say now will give up opinion be to go for nothing in anything duke a said knew that be expressing aloud feeling must have be restrained within own bosom be natural that there must have be such plaint same suffering must be encountered in regard to tregear daughter in way have be thwarted in direction be driven to yield yet now have to undergo rebuke from own son because one of inward plaint must force from lip of course girl be to be taken in among pallisers treated with idolatrous love a perfect a though blood of howard be running in vein what further inch of ground be there for fight if fight be over why must rob boy of one sparkle from off joy of triumph silverbridge be now standing before abashed by plaint inwardly sustained doubt by conviction of great success subdued by father wailing however perhaps have better let that pas said duke with long sigh then silverbridge took father hand looked up in face most sincerely hope that may make good loving wife said duke that may do duty by in not easy sphere of life to will be called be quite sure will said silverbridge whose idea a to isabel duty be confined at present to feeling that must now have to give kiss without stint what have seen of personally recommends to said duke girl be fool that be quite true sir who think that world be to be nothing dancing going to party many have be doing for so many year said silverbridge that ca understand that there must be end of wife ought to feel great responsibility of position hope will sooner begin better said silverbridge stoutly now said duke looking at watch might a well have lunch go down to house will walk with if please will be about time for of then son be forced to go down witness somewhat faded ceremony of seeing parliament opened by three lord sitting in commission before throne whereas for such stress a father have laid upon must have disregarded

through treachery then last word have be almost worst of who can tell what may come to pas showing too plainly that must not even now give up hope before month be up wrote to a follows dear lord silverbridge why do not come see be friend so plentiful with one so staunch a may be thrown over of course know why come put aside come can not hurt have learned to feel that certain thing world regard a too awful to be talked of except in way of scandal may be discussed then laid aside just like other subject what though wear wig wooden leg may still be fairly comfortable among companion unless crucify by trying to hide misfortune be not presence of skeleton crush not even will hurt much if let go about house a list be everlasting effort horror make to peep out of cupboard that robs of ease at rate come see of course know that be to be married to miss boncassen who doe not know trumpeter have be at work for last week very sincere friend mabel wished that have not written of

misfortune must be forgotten better knew what meant about trumpeter have intended to signify isabel in pride have boasted of matrimonial prospect of course there have be trumpet be there not always trumpet when marriage be contemplated magnificent enough to be called alliance a for that have blown trumpet have told everybody that be going to be married to miss boncassen isabel have blown trumpet in own straightforward way have told truth to whom concerned of course must go see lady mabel trusted that for own sake nothing must be said about trumpet so have come at last mabel said when entered room miss cassewary be not here a wanted to see alone got to go out morning why did not come before said in letter that knew why in saying so be accusing of cowardice be not be not cowardice why then did not come thought must hardly wish to see so soon after what passed be honest at rate felt must be too much ashamed of what said to be able to look in face not exactly other man must have felt same other man must be honest enough to tell so think that ever in life have constrained to civility of lie hope not to be civil false be often better than to be harsh true may be soothed by courtesy yet not deceived by lie what told in letter hope have destroyed will destroy do be not intended for partner of future joy a told then can talk freely why not know of how conscience may be can not tell be clear from soil with think must be smirched think nothing of sort yes silverbridge do have said to yourself girl have determined to get have not scrupled a to how must do such idea have ever crossed mind have never told of encouragement gave such condemnation a have spoken of must have be just if effort have be sanctioned by word look deed from did give warrant for thinking that be lover that theory by have justified to seemed to fall away from under questioning must not now remember word to in old day before miss boncassen have crossed path did know that have once intended to make understand that loved have not understood understanding have not accepted word therefore have thought free now seemed that have not be entitled so to regard there sat looking at waiting for answer who have be so sure that have committed no sin against have not word to say to want answer to lord silverbridge have told must have skeleton in cupboard down at matching before at killancodlem appealed to asking to take a wife hardly that altogether will have nothing denied have done will be ashamed of anything did do so even after infatuation thought then that one so volatile might perhaps fly back again will not do said frowning at need trouble with assurance friend let understand other now be not now supposing that can fly back again have found perch must settle on like good domestic barn door fowl again scowled if be too hard upon must certainly turn upon will not fly back again now be be not justified when came to killancodlem in thinking that lover have come there how can tell be own justification be thinking of see can not be justified did mean to suppose that be speaking to word in earnest when there sitting in very spot spoke to of love did speak of love did speak of love now silverbridge for if there be english gentleman on earth think that be one a gentleman tell did not even tell father must be wife know did did tell men such a who can not even lie with eyelid who will not condescend to cover up secret by moment of feigned inanimation have many voice did tell broke confidence told did not mean to tell now also have told did told so then changed mind know changed mind men often do pinker pink whiter white finger will press just ounce closer cheek will consent to let come just little nearer be because isabel have not easily consented to such approach trifle such a will do such trifle have done with must be beneath to make comparison where might seem to be gainer grant beauty be very lovely have succeeded have succeeded be justified be condemned be not so tell like man be justified be condemned when told that must be wife then told father same story be to think meant nothing have deceived did not mean have deceived what can not deny yet have not manliness to own to poor woman who can only save from humiliation by extorting truth from oh mabel be so sorry must be so believe be with sorrow will last till be again sitting close to silverbridge do wish to be longer fault after have not be great deceived did not mean to deceive never never fancy have never known how much bore about with modesty have be so perfect that have not thought of a more than other men have forgotten that have have in hand disposal to one woman of throne in paradise suppose thought of did why must tell falsehood now have determined that must know everything must better confess to own sin when have shown that too have not be innocent not think of men think of high title great wealth power place if men why must not woman men try to get be not even applauded for energy woman have one way to try tried think be for how will answer without confession even be not hardened enough to make in truth silverbridge have never loved drew up slowly before answered gradually assumed look very different from easy boyish smile be customary to be glad of that said why be glad now can have regret need have none be necessary to that must have little triumph must show that knew how far have wronged now wish that must know everything have never loved there be end of then have liked so well so much better than others dozen men have asked to marry though might be nothing till made that request then became thing of horror to be not thing of horror must have become wife think must have learned to love be best a be ought to say so too have doubt must have liked to be duchess of omnium perhaps might have fitted place better than one who can a yet know little of duty privilege may perhaps think that other arrangement must have be better even for can take care of myself in must have married without loving must have done so determined to serve with devotion woman who doe love hardly think necessary must have so done duty that must never have guessed that heart have be in keeping of man man yes of course if there have be no other man why not be so hard do think that can love one be not one girl must naturally love be not preoccupied that woman must

asked what be idea about life in general said that thought parliament be good sort of thing be lucky enough to have seat must take lodging somewhere in westminster till 'till what ' asked 'till

with wife in united state suppose will be allowed to run about world together so soon a said tregear be too well satisfied with day work to complain did say what meant to give oh dear even that meant

temperament that must not change then have to give way gerald suppose will bring kitchen maid for wife oh sir must not say that to must not have said to beg pardon silverbridge then paused moment turning over certain thought within own bosom perhaps after be well that pride of be conscious must be rebuked may be that rebuke have come in such form must be thankful know can love isabel that to will be everything young man have nothing must revolt think have be wrong now have said will let pas from will dine with to day silverbridge then went up to see sister so have settled little business

mother promised bride mr boncassen bore with more ease than one in company having at command gift of manliness enabled to regard marriage exactly a must have done other america be not so far distant what must be able to see girl occasionally liked young man believed in comfort of wealth therefore be satisfied when marriage be spoken of written of a alliance then must say hard word two about duke lord in general on occasion a be happy at ease so much must not be said for wife with whom duke attempted to place on term of family equality in doing failed to hide attempt even from broke down under have simply walked into room with a must have done on other occasion then remarked that frost be keen thaw disagreeable must have be better for when told that hoped must often make herself at home in house looked a said a though be asking to take place among goddess of olympus be troubled a to answer oh lord duke said when think of isabel living here being called by name almost upset isabel have father courage be more sensitive though must have borne honour well be oppressed by feeling that weight be too much for mother must not keep ear from listening to mother word eye from watching mother motion be prepared to carry mother everywhere a other girl have to be taken with belonging so must if be taken at have said plainly enough there must be division between mother still knowing that mother be not quite at ease be hardly at ease silverbridge came in at last moment of course occupied chair next to isabel a house be sitting be natural that must come up in flurry left phineas said pounding away in old style at sir timothy by bye isabel must come down day hear sir timothy badgered must be back again about ten well gerald how be at lazarus made effort to be free easy even soon found that be effort gerald have come up from oxford for occasion that might make acquaintance with boncassens have taken isabel in to dinner have be turned out of place when brother came in have be little confused by first impression made upon by mr boncassen have involuntarily watched father silver be going to have odd sort of mother in law said afterwards to mary who remarked in reply that must not signify a mother in law must be in new york tregear part be very difficult to play must not feel that though have succeeded still be a yet looked upon askance silverbridge have told that by degree duke must be won round that be not to be expected that must swallow at once regret truth of must not be accepted immediate inconvenience however be not le felt everyone there knew position of everyone tregear felt difficult to act up to must not play well pleased lover openly a did silverbridge mary herself be disposed to be very silent heart breaking tedium of dull life have be removed determination have be rewarded that have wanted have be granted to be happy be not prepared to show off happiness before others be aware that be thought to have done evil by introducing lover into august family be duke who made greatest effort with least success have told again again that be bound by sense of duty to swallow regret have taken to task on matter have done so even out loud to son have declared that must let pas from who doe not know how hard be for man in such matter to keep word to who have not said to at very moment of own delinquency now be now at very instant of time must crush quench kill evil spirit within be now must abate greed smother ill humour abandon hatred be now here must drive out fiend a have sworn to myself must do yet have failed that must be done must be done at last by man be very certain when silverbridge assured sister that must come right very soon have understood father character must not be completed quite at once have be required to take isabel only to heart must have be comparatively easy there be men who seem at first sight very susceptible to feminine attraction who nevertheless be dominated by grace of flounce who succumb to petticoat unconsciously who be half in love with woman merely for womanhood so be with duke have given way in regard to isabel with le than effort frank tregear be likely to cost be not at house sir said silverbridge when felt that there be pause not to day then there be pause again think that will beat cambridge year to moral said gerald who be sitting at round table opposite to father mr boncassen who be next to asked in irony probably rather than in ignorance whether victory be to be achieved by mathematical classical proficiency gerald turned looked at do mean to say that have never heard of university boat race papa have disgraced for ever said isabel have dear yes have heard of thought lord gerald protestation be too great for mere aquatic triumph now be poking fun at said gerald well may said duke sententiously have laid very open to having fun poked at in matter think sir said tregear that be learning to do same sort of thing at american university oh indeed said duke in solemn dry funereal tone then little life gerald remark about boat race have produced be quenched at once duke be not angry with tregear for little word of defence be not able to bring into harmony with one guest be almost savage to without meaning be continually asking why destiny have be so hard upon a to force to receive there at table a son in law man who be distasteful to be endeavouring to answer question taking to task telling that destiny have done injury that pride have be wounded be false pride be making brave fight during fight be hardly fit to be genial father father in law of young people who be going to be married to one before dinner be over made great effort tregear said even be effort for have never hitherto mentioned man name without formal mister tregear a be first time have sat at table let be old fashioned ask to drink glass of wine with glass of wine be drunk ceremony afforded infinite satisfaction at least to one person there mary must not keep from expression of joy by pressing finger for moment against lover arm though not usually given to such manifestation blushed up to eye feeling produced on company be solemn rather than jovial everyone there understood mr boncassen must read duke mind down to last line even mr boncassen be aware that act of reconciliation have be intended when governor drank that glass of wine seemed a though marriage ceremony have be performed gerald said to brother that evening when duke glass be replaced on table be conscious of solemnity of what have done be half ashamed of when lady have gone upstairs conversation became political lively duke must talk freely about state of thing to mr boncassen be able gradually to include tregear in badinage with attacked conservatism of son so half hour passed well upstairs two girl immediately came together leaving mr boncassen to chew cud of grandeur around in sleepy comfort of arm chair so everything be settled for of said isabel of course knew be to be settled for told so at custins did not know then only told that have asked hardly believed certainly believed knew about lady mabel grex only suspected something now know be mistake have never be more than suspicion why when be at custins did not tell about have nothing to tell can understand be not joyful that must all be settled only poor lady mabel have got lady mabel to trouble conscience from be evident that silverbridge have not told chapter lxxv major story by end of march isabel be in paris whither have forbidden lover to follow silverbridge be therefore reduced to shift of bachelor life in friend seemed to think that ought now to take special delight perhaps did not take much delight in be doubt impatient to commence steady married life for have prepared nevertheless just at present lived good deal at beargarden where be to live boncassens be in paris sister be at matching with houseful of other pallisers father be again deep in politics of course be much in house of common that also be stupid indeed everything must be stupid till isabel came back perhaps dinner be more comfortable at club than at house then a everybody knew be good thing to change scene therefore dined at club though must keep hansom go down to house again in course of evening spent many long hour at beargarden there will very soon be end of a far a be concerned said mr lupton to one evening a be sitting in smoking room after dinner sooner better a far a place be concerned place be a good a other for matter of like beargarden since got rid of two three not very charming character mean poor friend tifto said silverbridge be not thinking of tifto there be one two here who be quite a bad a tifto wonder what have become of poor devil know in least heard of row about hound letter to wrote to answered a know whither vanished what be doing how be living have not least idea gone to join other fellow abroad must say among got lot of money a duke ought to remember be not with said silverbridge a though be in degree mourning over fate of unfortunate friend suppose captain green be leader in now be done gone own to certain regard for major be true to till thought snubbed must not let go down to silverbridge with always thought that drove poor major to malpractice at moment dolly longstaff sauntered into room came up to may be remembered that dolly have declared purpose of emigrating a soon a

visit to matching to enter in may be presumed on full fruition of advantage a accepted suitor have be arranged with good deal of precision a though there have still be hope left that lady mary might change mind of course there be such hope when duke asked young man to dine with when invited to drink that memorable glass of wine when young man be allowed in presence of boncassens to sit next lady mary be of course settled father probably found relief in yielding by slow degree must rather that there must be correspondence till then have said to tregear to daughter have promised there must be correspondence at easter must meet after easter mary be to come up to london to be present at brother wedding to also tregear have be formally invited be hoped that then something might be settled a to own marriage tregear with surgeon permission took seat in parliament be introduced by two leading member on conservative side immediately afterwards found seated next to friend silverbridge on top bench behind minister house be very full a there be feverish report abroad that sir timothy beeswax intended to make statement one quite knew what statement be to be politician in house out of thought that knew that statement must be bid for higher power on part of sir timothy if there have be dissension in cabinet secret of have be well kept to tregear who be not a yet familiar with house there be special appearance of activity silverbridge must see that there be more than wonted animation that treasury bench must be full at time be thing of custom whole broadside of question must be fired off one after like rattle of musketry down rank when a nearly a possible report of gun be made to follow close upon of gun before with exception that in such case little sound be intended to be a like a possible to preceding whereas with rattle of question answer question answer becomes little more authoritative le courteous than last treasury bench be ready for usual responsive firing a questioner be of course in place opposition front bench be also crowded behind be nearly equally full there be many peer in gallery general feeling of sensation prevailed silverbridge have be long enough in house to appreciate to tregear house be simply house be odd enough must have row very first day come said silverbridge think there will be row beeswax have something special to say be not here yet see have left about six inch for there between roper sir orlando will have privilege of looking just down on top of head when doe come sha stay much longer after where be going mean to day must not have be here now in very place mean want to stick to just at first will move down below gangway not improbably creep over to other side before long mean think will begin to feel have made mistake in coming to side at think have after be not very important what be not important think very important perhaps may be to perhaps may be able to keep up more think of le excuse seem to have for deserting old way of family what be there in fellow down there to make fellow feel that ought to bind to neck heel principle yes principle believe have vague idea a to supporting property land kind of thing know that anybody want to attack anything somebody soon must want to attack if there be defender suppose there be outside power people public opinion choose to call country will have to go very much a outside power chooses here in parliament everybody will be a conservative a outside will let think matter on side sit doe matter that must have to act with who go against grain with never heard worse political argument in life dare say not however here be sir timothy when look in way buckram deportment solemnity know be going to pitch into somebody at moment leader of house came in from behind speaker chair took place between mr roper sir orlando drought silverbridge have be right in saying that sir timothy air be solemn when man have to declare solemn purpose on solemn occasion in solemn place be needful that must be solemn though solemnity befits man best will be that importance of moment may produce without thought given by to own outward person still who be there can refrain from attempt who can boast who have be versed in way duty of high place that have kept free from study of grace of feature of attitude of gait even of dress for most of bishop for most of judge of statesman orator general for many even of doctor parson even attorney tax gatherer certainly butler coachman mr turveydrop great professor of deportment have done much there must always be art to underlie protect art art can hide art really clever archbishop really potent chief justice man who a politician will succeed in becoming king of men must know how to carry buckram without showing be in sir timothy perhaps failed little there be men who look a though be born to wear blue ribbon have come probably from study seems to be natural sir timothy did not impose on who looked at a do men must see little of paint must hear crumple of starch padding must trace something of uneasiness in must be composed grandeur of brow turveydrop spectator must say to after may be question whether man be open to reproach for not doing well greatest among if must find one great enough must not do at for think must hold that true personal dignity must be achieved must if be quite true have be achieved without personal effort though be evinced in part by carriage of body carriage must be fruit of operation of mind even when be assisted by external garniture such a special clothes wig ornament such garniture must have be prescribed by sovereign by custom must not have be selected by wearer in regard to speech man may study that may make suasive if go beyond will trench on histrionic effort will know to be wrong because will be ashamed to acknowledge be good to be beautiful must come of god not of hairdresser personal dignity be great possession man must struggle for more than must for beauty many however do struggle for with such success though achieve quite real thing still get something on can bolster up be mighty others older men than silverbridge saw a much a did young friend be more complaisant more reasonable too heard crackle of buckram be aware that last touch of awe have come upon brow just a owner be emerging from shadow of speaker chair to be thing of course real caesar be not to be found day can always have pitt to control debate that kind of thing that last touch have effect of course be paint how must poor girl look before gaslight if there be paint house of common like little deportment on occasion if special man look bigger than can console by reflecting that also look bigger than fellow sir timothy probably knew what be about did on whole more good than harm by little trick a soon a sir timothy have taken seat mr rattler got up from opposition bench to ask question on matter of finance brewer be anxious about publican licence must chancellor of exchequer say word on matter notice have of course be given questioner have stated quarter of hour previously that must postpone query till chancellor of exchequer be in house sir timothy rose from seat in blandest manner began by apologising for late appearance be sorry that have be prevented by public business from being in place to answer honourable gentleman question in proper turn even now feared that must decline to give answer must be supposed to be satisfactory must probably be duty to make statement to house on following day statement be not quite prepared to make at present moment in existing state of thing be unwilling to make reply to question by might seem to bind government to opinion then sat down rising again not long afterwards when house have gone through certain formal duty moved that must be adjourned till next day then member trooped out with others tregear lord silverbridge so be end of first day of parliament said silverbridge what doe mean let go to carlton hear what fellow be saying on evening young men dined at mr boncassen house though tregear have be cautioned not to write to lady mary though be not to see before easter still be so completely understood that be about to become husband that be entertained in capacity by who be concerned in family so will go out said mr boncassen seems to be general idea said expectant son in law when two men want to be first will give way ca very well get on in same boat together then expatiated angrily on treachery of sir timothy tregear in more moderate way joined in same opinion upon word young men doubt whether be right said mr boncassen whether can be possible that man must have risen to position with so little patriotism a attribute to friend will not pretend to say must think that in england be impossible of be sure that facility exists here for minister minister to go out of office without disturbance of crown be great blessing say other party will come in be most probable said silverbridge with other party never come in never have chance of coming in except once in four year when president be elected that one event bind for four year do change minister said tregear secretary may quarrel with president may have gout be convicted of peculation yet think yourselves more nearly free than be be not so sure of that have have pretty difficult task that of carrying on government in new country be nevertheless more populous than almost old country influxions be so rapid that ten year nature of people be changed be easy though think on whole have done

that ought not to have be sure sometimes in solitude used to think that have be wrong began to doubt whether under circumstance must have be justified in asking father daughter to be wife because of rank not so much rank a money ought to be considered poor man who marries rich woman will always be suspected because people be so mean poor spirited because think that money be more than anything else must be nothing at in such matter know how can be anything have be saying that to all along a though one be to stop to think whether one be rich poor tregear when be said must not remember at time not very much prior to at mary have not stopped to think for while have mabel suppose be worse for than for added hope not be frank therefore ought to have made up to now be very bad to be alone

about meeting up at lord grex be so shocked do remember that do remember be not shocked question be not to be answered by word be continued be awful thing to do be determined to show be in earnest do remember how miss cassewary looked miss cassewary knew about daresay did so suppose did mabel grex have thought that perhaps might make mabel confidante then looked up into face what like mabel do not do like very very much perhaps have liked too well for eh frank too well for what that must have heard have to say about with sympathy if so be so sorry need not fear that have ever for moment be untrue either to be sure have not to poor mabel then took to custins be worst of can not quite tell what happened there of course asked a have said must not quite tell about lord popplecourt next

hot over felt that must not restrain blush such must be feeling of man when find compelled to own to girl father that intends to live upon money not upon own like to be troublesome continued duke to ask question might seem to be impertinent oh of course feel position can only say that be not because daughter might probably have money that first sought love will be so received now perhaps will be best that must arrange with man of business mr moreton will be instructed mr moreton life near place in barsetshire be now in london if will call on will tell must suggest hope will find that affair

boncassen guilty in day in such splendid thing be done on so very splendid scale young lady can not herself lay out friend gift so a to be properly seen by friend well skilled well paid hand be needed even for hence come public information on affair must surely be private in grandmother time happy bride happy mother compounded cake at rate trusted housekeeper know that terrible tower of silver now stand niddle noddling with appendage of flag spear on modern wedding breakfast table will come to pas with of soon that must deny pleasure of having young friend because marriage present be so costly poor mr boncassen have not perhaps happy time with august guest on morning when retired to give isabel last kiss in privacy did feel proud to think that daughter must day be english duchess chapter

omnium must be produced to world amidst blare of trumpet glare of torch so have be duke mary be determined that other wedding must be different be to take place at matching none must be present who be staying in house who lived around such a tenant dependant four clergyman united force to tie isabel to husband one of whom be bishop one canon two others royal chaplain there be only to be vicar of
