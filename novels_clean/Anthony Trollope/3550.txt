can not compete with mountain scenery of other tourist loved region in europe at port de venasquez brche de roland in western pyrenees rather to speak more truly at spot in close vicinity of famous mountain entrance from france into spain one can make comparison with switzerland northern italy tyrol ireland will not be injurious to scene then under view among eastern mountain can rarely be done

in shape of djeuners dinner bath bed never failed to give in accordance with dictate of strict conscience be trait in character of hotel keeper can not be praised too highly have met due reward in custom of public nevertheless there be who thought that there be occasionally ground for complaint in conduct even of madame bauche in first place be deficient in pleasant smiling softness must belong to keeper of house of public entertainment in general mode of life be stern silent with guest autocratic authoritative sometimes contradictory in house altogether irrational unconciliatory when change even for day be proposed to when shadow of complaint reached ear indeed of complaint a made against establishment be altogether intolerant to such have one answer who complained might leave place at moment notice if so pleased there be always others ready to take place power of making answer came to from lowness of price be power be very dear to bath be taken at different hour according to

year of age be very stout short in neck wore own gray hair at dinner be always tidy enough during whole day previous to hour might be seen with escaping from under cap in extreme disorder eyebrow be large bushy alone must not have given to face that look of indomitable sternness possessed eyebrow be serious in effect not so serious a pair of green spectacle always wore under be thought by who have analysed subject that great secret of madame bauches power lay in green spectacle custom be to move about through whole establishment day from breakfast till period came for to dress for dinner must visit chamber bath walk once twice round salle manger very repeatedly round kitchen must go into hole corner peer into everything through green spectacle in walk be not always thought pleasant to meet custom be to move very slowly with hand generally clasped behind back rarely spoke to guest unless be spoken to on such occasion must not often diverge into general conversation if one have aught to say connected with business of establishment must listen then must make answersoften not pleasant in hearing thus walked path through world stern hard solemn old woman not without gust of passionate explosion honest withal not without inward benevolence true tenderness of heart child have have many seven eight one two have died others have be married have son settled far away from home at time of be now speaking one be left in way subject to maternal authority adolphe bauche be only one of child of whom much be remembered by present denizen hanger on of hotel be youngest of number having be born only very shortly before return of madame bauche to vernet have be altogether reared there be thought by world of part rightly thought that be mother darlingmore so than have be of brother sistersthe very apple of eye gem of life at time be about twenty five year of age for last two year have be absent from vernetfor reason will shortly be made to appear have be sent to paris to see something of world learn to talk french instead of patois of valley having left paris have come down south into languedoc remained there picking up agricultural lore be thought might prove useful in valley farm of vernet be now expected home again very speedily much to mother delight that be kind gracious to favourite child doe not perhaps give much proof of benevolence have also be kind gracious to orphan child of neighbour nay to orphan child of rival innkeeper at vernet there have be more than one water establishment proprietor of second have died few year after madame bauche have settled at place house have not thrived only child little girl be left altogether without provision little girl marie clavert la mre bauche have taken into own house immediately after father death although have most cordially hated that father marie be then infant madame bauche have accepted charge without much thought perhaps a to what might be child ultimate destiny since then have thoroughly done duty of mother by little girl who have become pet of whole establishment favourite plaything of adolphe bauche at last of course early sweetheart then therefore there have come trouble at vernet of course world of valley have seen what be taking place what be likely to take place long before madame bauche knew anything about at last broke upon sens that son adolphe bauche heir to virtue rich first young man in neighbouring valley be absolutely contemplating idea of marrying that poor little orphan marie clavert that one must ever fall in love with marie clavert have never occurred to madame bauche have always regarded child a child a object of charity a little thing to be looked on a poor marie by world looking through green spectacle have never seen that marie clavert be beautiful creature full of ripening charm such a young men love to look on marie be of infinite daily use to madame bauche in hundred little thing about house old lady thoroughly recognised appreciated ability for very reason have never taught to regard marie otherwise than a useful drudge be very fond of protgeso much so that must listen to in affair about house when must listen to one elsebut mary prettiness grace sweetness a girl have be thrown away upon maman bauche a marie used to call unluckily have not be thrown away upon adolphe have appreciated a be natural that must do have be so utterly indifferent to mother consequently have fallen in love consequently also have told love consequently also marie have returned love adolphe have be hitherto contradicted in few thing thought that difficulty must be prevented by informing mother that wished to marry marie clavert marie with woman instinct have known better have trembled almost crouched with fear when confessed love have absolutely hid from sight when adolphe went forth prepared to ask mother consent to marriage indignation passionate wrath of madame bauche be past gone two year before date of story need not therefore much enlarge upon subject be at first abusive bitter be bad for marie afterwards bitter silent be worse be of course determined that poor marie must be sent away to asylum for orphan penniless paupersin short anywhere out of way what mattered outlook into world happiness indeed very existence outlook happiness of adolphe bauchewas not that to be considered a everything at vernet terrible sharp aspect of affair did not last very long in first place la mre bauche have under green spectacle heart that in truth be tender affectionate after first two day of anger admitted that something must be done for marie clavert after fourth day acknowledged that world of hotel world must not go a well without marie clavert a must with in next place madame bauche have friend whose advice in grave matter must sometimes take friend have told that must be much better to send away adolphe since be so necessary that there must be sending away of one that must be much benefited by passing month of life away from native valley that absence of year two must teach to forget marie even if did not teach marie to forget must say word two about friend at vernet be usually called m le capitaine though in fact have never reached that rank have be in army having be wounded in leg while still sou lieutenant have be pensioned have thus be interdicted from treading further thorny path lead to glory for last fifteen year have resided under roof of madame bauche at first a casual visitor going coming now for many year a constant there a be be so constantly called le capitaine that real name be seldom heard may however a well be known to that be theodore campan be tall well looking man always dressed in black garment of coarse description certainly scrupulously clean well brushed of perhaps fifty year of age conspicuous for rigid uprightness of backand for black wooden leg wooden leg be perhaps most remarkable trait in character be always jet black being painted polished japanned a occasion might require by hand of capitaine be longer than ordinary wooden leg a indeed capitaine be longer than ordinary men nevertheless never seemed in way to impede rigid punctilious propriety of movement be never in way a wooden leg usually be in way of wearer then to render more illustrious have round middle round calf of leg may so say band of bright brass shone like burnished gold have be capitaines custom now for year past to retire evening at about seven oclock into sanctum sanctorum of madame bauches habitation dark little private sitting room in made out bill calculated profit there regale in presenceand indeed at expense for item never appeared in billwith coffee cognac have said that there be never eating drinking at establishment after regular dinner hour in so saying spoke of world at large nothing further be allowed in way of trade in way of friendship so much be now day always allowed to capitaine be at moment madame bauche discussed private affair asked for received advice for even madame bauche be mortal must green spectacle without other aid carry through trouble of life be now five year since world of vernet discovered that la mre bauche be going to marry capitaine for eighteen month world of vernet have be full of matter amount of patience be at last exhausted a further step in direction be ever taken beyond daily cup of coffee that subject died awayvery much unheeded by la mre bauche though thought of matrimony for thought much of matrimony for other people over most of cup of evening coffee cognac matrimonial project be discussed in latter day have be seen that capitaine pleaded in mary favour when fury of madame bauches indignation broke forth that ultimately marie be kept at home adolphe sent away by advice adolphe can not always stay away madame bauche have pleaded in difficulty truth of capitaine have admitted said might be married to one else before two year be over so matter have commenced to whom must be married to question capitaine have answered in perfect innocence of heart la mre bauche must be much better able to make such choice than did not know how marie might stand with regard to money if madame must give little dot affair capitaine thought must be more easily arranged thing took month to say during period marie went on with work in melancholy listlessness one comfort have adolphe before went have promised to holding in hand a did so little cross have given that earthly consideration must sever themthat sooner later must certainly be husband marie felt that limb must not work tongue speak be not for one drop of water in cup then deeply meditating la mre bauche hit upon plan communicated to capitaine over second cup of coffee into poured full teaspoonful more than usual allowance of cognac why must not capitaine be man to marry clavert be very startling proposal idea of matrimony for never having a yet entered into capitaines head at period of life la mre bauche did contrive to make not altogether unacceptable a to matter of dowry be prepared to be more than generous did love marie well must find in heart to give anythingany thing except son own adolphe what proposed be adolphe must never keep bath if capitaine must take marie for wife marie madame bauche declared must be mistress after death subject of course to certain settlement a to adolphes pecuniary interest plan be discussed thousand time at last so far brought to bear that marie be made acquainted with ithaving be called in to sit in presence with la mre bauche future proposed poor girl manifested disgust to stiff ungainly lover whom assigned to herwho through whole frame be in appearance almost a wooden a own leg on whole indeed marie liked capitaine felt that be friend in country such marriage be not uncommon capitaine be perhaps little beyond age at man might usually be thought justified in demanding service of young girl a nurse wife then marie of herself have so little to giveexcept youth beauty goodness yet must not absolutely consent for be not absolutely pledged to own adolphe therefore when great pecuniary advantage be one by one displayed before when la mre bauche a last argument informed that a wife of capitaine must be regarded a second mistress in establishment not a servant must only burst out into tear say that did not know will be very kind to said capitaine a kind a man can be marie took hard withered hand kissed then looked up into face with beseeching eye be not without avail upon heart will not press now said capitaine there be time enough let heart be touched ever so much one thing be certain must not be permitted that must marry adolphe to view of matter have given in unrestricted adhesion must by mean withdraw without losing altogether position in establishment of madame bauche indeed did conscience tell that marriage must be permitted must be too much if pretty girl be allowed to marry first young man might fall in love with must world come to soon appeared that there be not time enoughthat time be growing very scant in three month adolphe must be back if everything be not arranged by time matter might still go astray then madame bauche asked final question think do that can ever marry adolphe a asked accustomed terror of green spectacle magnified tenfold marie must only answer by burst of tear affair be at last settled among marie said that must consent to marry capitaine when must hear from adolphes own mouth that adolphe loved no longer declared with many tear that vow pledge prevented from promising more than be not fault at rate not now that loved lover be not faultnot now at leastthat be bound by pledge when heard from own mouth that have discarded then must marry capitaineor indeed sacrifice in other way that la mre bauche might desire what must anything signify then madame bauches spectacle remained unmoved not heart marie told capitaine must be equal to herself in establishment when once be entitled to be called madame campan must be to quite a daughter must have cup of coffee evening dine at big table wear silk gown at church servant must call madame great career must be open to if must only give up foolish girlish childish love for adolphe great promise be repeated to marie by capitaine nevertheless there be one thing in world in mary eye be of value that one thing be heart of adolphe bauche without must be nothing with thatwith assured must wait patiently till doomsday letter be written to adolphe during eventful doings letter came from saying that greatly valued mary love that a have be clearly proved to that marriage must be neither for advantage for be willing to give up consented to marriage with capitaine expressed gratitude to mother for pecuniary advantage have held out to oh adolphe adolphe ala ala be not such way of most men heartsand of heart of woman letter be read to marie have more effect upon than must have have dry legal document in day in place men woman did not depend much upon letter when be written be there expressed in much of heart of feeling marie must understand a be well aware glance of adolphes eye tone of adolphes voice must perceive at once from what lover really meant what wished what in innermost corner of heart really desired that must do from stiff constrained written document must understand nothing be agreed therefore that adolphe must return that must accept fate from mouth capitaine who knew more of human nature than poor marie felt tolerably sure of bride adolphe who have seen something of world must not care very much for girl of own valley money pleasure little position in world must soon wean from love then marie must accept destinyas other girl in same position have done since french world began now be evening before adolphes expected arrival la mre bauche be discussing matter with capitaine over usual cup of coffee madame bauche have of late become rather nervous on matter thinking that have be somewhat rash in acceding so much to marie seemed to that be absolutely now left to two young lover to say whether must have other not now nothing on earth must be further from madame bauches intention than decree resolve be to heap down blessing on person concernedprovided always that must have own way provided did not have own way to heap downanything blessing have code of morality in matter must do good if possible to everybody around must not on score be induced to consent that adolphe must marry marie clavert must be in wind must rid house of marie of capitaine even of adolphe have become therefore somewhat querulous opinionated in discussion with friend dont know said on evening in question dont know may be right if adolphe turn against be to do then mre bauche said capitaine sipping coffee puffing out smoke of cigar adolphe will not turn against have be somewhat remarked by many that capitaine be more at home in house somewhat freer in manner of talking with madame bauche since matrimonial alliance have be on tapis than have ever be before la mre observed did not quite like how must prevent now when capitaine be once married must make know place in spite of promise to marie if say like girl continued madame bauche friend may be sure that will say nothing of kind have not be away two year without seeing girl a pretty a marie then have letter be nothing capitaine must eat letter a quick a must eat omelet aux fine herbes now capitaine be especially quick over omelet aux fine herbes mre bauche also have purse will know that can not eat except with good will ah exclaimed madame bauche poor lad have not sou in world unless give to did not seem that reflection be in displeasing to adolphe will now be man of world continued capitaine will know that doe not do to throw away everything for pair of red lip be folly of boy adolphe will be no longer boy believe mre bauche thing will be right enough then will have marie sick ill half dying on hand said madame bauche be not flattering to capitaine so felt perhaps so perhaps not said at rate will get over be malady rarely kill young womenespecially when alliance awaits bah said madame bauche in saying that word avenged for too great liberty capitaine have lately taken shrugged shoulder took pinch of snuff uninvited helped to teaspoonful of cognac then conference ended on next morning before breakfast adolphe bauche arrived on that morning poor marie hardly knew how to bear month two back even up to last day two have felt sort of confidence that adolphe must be true to nearer came that fatal day le strong be confidence of poor girl knew that two long headed aged counsellor be plotting against happiness felt that must hardly dare hope for success with such terrible foe opposed to on evening before day madame bauche have met in passage kissed a wished good night marie knew little about sacrifice felt that be sacrificial kiss in day sort of diligence with mail for olette passed through prades early in morning conveyance be sent from vernet to bring adolphe to bath never be prince princess expected with more anxiety madame bauche be up dressed long before hour be heard to say five several time that be sure must not come capitaine be out on high road moving about with wooden leg a perpendicular a lamp post almost a black marie also be up nobody have seen be up have be out about place before of be stirring now that world be on move lay like hare in form then old char banc clattered up to door adolphe jumped out of into mother arm be fatter fairer than have last seen have larger beard be more fashionably clothed certainly looked more like man marie also saw out of little window thought that looked like god be probable said to herself that one so godlike must still care for mother be delighted with son who rattled away quite at ease shook hand very cordially with capitaineof whose intended alliance with own sweetheart have be informed then a entered house with hand under mother arm asked one question about where be marie said marie oh upstairs will see after breakfast said la mre bauche so entered house went in to breakfast among guest everybody have heard something of story be on alert to see young man whose love want of love be considered to be of so much importance will see that will be right said capitaine carrying head very high think so think so said la mre bauche who now that capitaine be right no longer desired to contradict know that will be right said capitaine told that adolphe must return man be man look at doe not care for marie clavert capitaine with much eloquence in motion pitched over neighbouring wall small stone held in hand then went to breakfast with many sign of outward joy not without inward joy for madame bauche thought saw that son be cured of love in mean time marie sat up stair still afraid to show have come said young girl servant in house running up to door of mary room yes said marie must see that have come oh how beautiful be said girl putting hand together looking up to ceiling marie in heart of heart wished that be not so beautiful a then chance of having might be greater company be talking to a though be prfet said girl never mind who be talking to said marie go away leave meyou be wanted for work why before be not talking to why not if be really true to ala began to fall upon mind that must be false what then what must do then sat still gloomily thinking of other spouse have be promised to a speedily after breakfast a be possible adolphe be invited to conference in mother private room have much debated in own mind whether capitaine must be invited to conference for many reason must have wished to exclude did not like to teach son that be unable to manage own affair must have be well pleased to make capitaine understand that assistance be not absolutely necessary to then have inward fear that green spectacle must not now be a efficacious on adolphe a have once be in old day before have seen world become man might be necessary that son being man must be opposed by man so capitaine be invited to conference what took place there need not be described at length three be closeted for two hour at end of time came forth together countenance of madame bauche be serene comfortable hope of ultimate success ran higher than ever face of capitaine be masked a be always face of great diplomatist walked placid upright raising wooden leg with ease skill be absolutely marvellous poor adolphes brow be clouded yes poor adolphe for be poor in spirit have pledged to give up marie to accept liberal allowance mother tendered remained for now to communicate tidings to marie must not tell have said to mother with very little of manliness in face on mother now so prided herself la mre bauche explained to that be part of general agreement that marie be to hear decision from own mouth need not regard said capitaine with most indifferent air in world girl expects only have childish idea that be bound till release dont think will be troublesome adolphe at moment did feel that must have liked to kick capitaine out of mother house where must meeting take place in hall of bath house suggested madame bauche because a observed must walk round round nobody ever went there at time of day to adolphe objected must be so cold dismal melancholy capitaine thought that mre bauches little parlour be place la mre did not like might be overheard a well knew guessed that meeting must not conclude without sob must certainly be bitter might perhaps be loud send up to grotto will follow said adolphe on therefore agreed now grotto be natural excavation in high rock stood precipitously upright over establishment of bath steep zigzag path with almost never ending step have be made along face of rock from little flower garden attached to house lay immediately under mountain close along front of hotel ran little brawling river leaving barely room for road between door over there be wooden bridge leading to garden two three hundred yard from bridge began step by ascent be made to grotto when season be full weather perfectly warm place be much frequented there be green table in four five deal chair green garden seat also be there however have be removed into innermost back corner of excavation a hinder leg be somewhat at fault wall about two foot high ran along face of guarding occupant from precipice in fact be grotto little chasm in rock such a often see up above head in rocky valley by mean of steep step have be turned into source of exercise amusement for visitor at hotel standing at wall one must look down into garden down also upon shining slate roof of madame bauches house to left might be seen sombre silent snow capped top of stern old canigou king of mountain among eastern pyrenees so madame bauche undertook to send marie up to grotto adolphe undertook to follow thither be now spring though wind have fallen snow be no longer lying on lower peak still air be fresh cold there be danger that of few guest at establishment must visit place make put on cloak mre bauche said capitaine who did not wish that bride must have cold in head on wedding day la mre bauche pished pshawed a though be not minded to pay attention to recommendation on such subject from capitaine nevertheless when marie be seen slowly to creep across little bridge about fifteen minute after time have handkerchief on head be closely wrapped in dark brown cloak poor marie little heeded cold fresh air be glad to avail herself of mean by might hide face when madame bauche sought out in own little room with smiling face kind kiss bade go to grotto knew fancied that knew that be over will tell truthhow be said la mre will do can know to make happy marie must remember what monsieur le cur told other day in vale of tear can not have everything a will have day when poor wicked soul have be purged of wickedness now go dear take cloak yes maman adolphe will come to try behave well like sensible girl yes mamanand so went bearing on brow sacrificial kissand bearing in heart unutterable load of woe adolphe have gone out of house before standing in stable yard well within gate so that must not see watched slowly crossing bridge mounting first flight of step have often seen tripping up stair have almost a often followed with quicker foot when must hear must run then must catch breathless at top steal kiss from when power of refusing have be robbed from by effort at escape there be such running now such following thought of such kiss a for must fain have skulked off shirked interview have dared did not dare so waited there out of heart for ten minute speaking word now then to bath man who be standing by just to show that be at ease bath man knew that be not at ease such must be lie a rarely achieve deceptionare rarely believed then at end of ten minute with step a slow a mary have be also ascended to grotto marie have watched from top so that must not be seen however have not once lifted up head to look for with eye turned to ground have plodded way up to cave when entered be standing in middle with eye downcast hand clasped before have retired way from wall so that eye might possibly see of false lover there stood when entered striving to stand motionless trembling like leaf in limb be only when reached top step that made up mind how must behave perhaps after capitaine be right perhaps must not mind marie said with voice attempted to be cheerful be odd place to meet in after such long absence held out hand to only hand offered salute did not even kiss cheek a brother must have done of rule of outside world must be remembered that poor marie knew little have be brother to before have become lover marie took hand saying yes have be very long now have come back went on to say seems that be in confusion together never knew such piece of work however be for best suppose

distasteful to enough probably to make become decently good husband to must fate enable to marry not enough to enable to support punishment must be sure effect of mother displeasure besides have promised mother that must give up mariehad entirely given in adhesion to plan of marriage with capitaine have owned that path of life a marked out for by mother be one behoved a man to follow be view
