five six thousand pound in pocket martin kelly dined with brother at jude spent evening equally unreasonably at least may be supposed so from fact that at one oclock in morning be to be seen standing on one of table at burton bindons oyster house with pewter pot full of porter in hand insisting one in room must drink health of anty lynch whom on occasion swore to be prettiest youngest girl in connaught be lucky be so intoxicated that one must understand that hearer be so drunk that must understand nothing a otherwise publicity of admiration might have have effect of preventing accomplishment of design managed however to meet patron next morning at lawyer though eye be very red cheek pale after being there for half hour left office with assurance whenever lady might please to call there must find deed prepared for signature must adjust property in manner required that afternoon lord ballindine left dublin with friend to make instant arrangement for exportation of brien

dublin with a little delay a possible chapter iv dunmore inn anty lynch be not prettiest youngest girl in connaught must martin have affirmed to be so unless have be very much inebriated indeed however young might have be once be never pretty in ireland there be not more single hearted simple minded young woman use word simple a foolish for though uneducated be not foolish be unaffected honest humble true entertaining very lowly idea of own value unelated by newly acquired wealth have be so little thought of life by others that have never learned to think much of have have few acquaintance friend have spent life hitherto so quietly silently that apparent apathy be attributable rather to want of subject of excitement than to sluggishness of disposition mother have died early since then only case in anty have be called on to exercise own judgment be in refusing to comply with father wish that must become nun on subject though often pressed have remained positive always pleading that felt call to sacred duty must be required innocently assuring father that if allowed to remain at home must cause trouble little expense so have remained at home have inured to bear without grumbling thinking that have cause for grumbling petulance of father more cruel harshness ill humour of brother in family scheme of aggrandisement have be set aside barry have be intended by father a scion on whom family honour be to fall education have be expensive allowance liberal whim permitted while anty be never better dressed than decent english servant have be taught nothing save

whom sim in wealth have attached with whom alone intended that barry must associate be of masculine gender gave bachelor dinner party to hard drinking young men for whom anty be well contented to cook when theyas often from effect of potation be perforce obliged to dostayed night at dunmore house anty never showed in breakfast parlour boiled egg made tea took own breakfast in kitchen be not wonderful therefore that one proposed for anty though who knew lynches knew that sim have daughter be very generally given out that be not so wise a neighbour father brother took pain to deny rumour inhabitant of village knew better lynches be very generally disliked shameful way miss anty be trated be often discussed in little shop many of townspeople be ready to aver simple anty lynch be best of breed out out matter stood thus at dunmore when quarrel before alluded to occurred when sim made will dividing propertyand died before destroying a doubtless must have done when passion be over great be surprise of one concerned of many who be not at concerned when be ascertained that anty lynch be heiress that be now possessed of four hundred pound year in own right passion of brother must be impossible to describe soon however found that be too literally true that direct mean be at hand by must deprive sister of patrimony lawyer when informed anty of fortune present station made understand that have equal right with brother in everything in house though at first tacitly acquiesced in management be not at all simple enough to be ignorant of right of possession weak enough to relinquish barry soon made up mind that a have must have property must now do be to take care that must revert to a heir measure of most importance in effecting must be to take care that did not marry in first passion after father death have be rough cruel to soon changed conduct endeavoured to flatter into docility at one moment to frighten into obedience in next soon received blow be also severe one moylan old man who proposed match to martin called on showed that anty have appointed agent have executed necessary legal document for purpose upon subject argued for long time with sisterpointing out to that old man must surely rob heroffering to act a agent himselfrecommending others a more honest fittingand lastly telling that be obstinate fool who must soon be robbed of penny have that must die in workhouse at last anty though dreaded brother be firm wonderful a may appear even loved begged not to quarrel with herpromised to do everything to oblige answered wrath with gentleness be of avail barry knew that agent be plotterthat must plot against influencethough little guessed then what must be first step moylan must take how likely must be if really acted on to lead to sister comfort happiness after barry passed two month of great misery vexation must not make up mind what to do what final step to take about property sister at first thought of frightening moylan sister by pretending that must prove anty to be of weak mind not fit to manage own affair that must indict old man for conspiracy felt that moylan be not man to be frightened by such bugbear then made up mind to turn have into money to leave sister to dog one who might choose to rob go live abroad then thought if sister must die what pity must be must lose how must blame if be to die soon after having married low adventurer reflected how probable such thing must behow likely that man must soon get rid of then mind began to dwell on death to wish for found constantly thinking of ruminating on determining that be only event must set right own debt must swallow up present property how must bring to live on pitiful remainder when stupid idiot a called to have three time more than must possibly want morning after morning walked about small ground round house with hat over eye hand tossing about money in pocket thinking of thiscursing father longingalmost praying for sister death then must have horse flog poor beast along road without going anywhere having object in view always turning same thing over over in mind after dinner must sit by hour over fire drinking longing for sister money calculating probability of ever possessing began to imagine circumstance might lead to death thought of way in person situated a be might often did die reflected without knowing that be doing so on probability of robber breaking into house if be left alone in of murdering thought of silly woman setting own clothes on fireof falling out of windowdrowning themselvesof perishing in hundred possible improbable way be after have be drinking while that idea became most vivid before eye seemed like golden dream accomplishment of must hardly wish for at last a fume of spirit gave courage other more horrible image must rise to imagination drop of sweat must stand on brow a must invent scheme by be so inclined must accelerate without detection event for so ardently longed with such thought must turn into bed though in morning must try to dispel idea in have indulged overnight still left impression on mindthey added bitterness to hatredand made look on a man injured by father sister think that owed to to redress injury by extraordinary mean be whilst barry lynch be giving way to such thought a vainly endeavouring to make up mind a to what must do martin made offer to anty to tell truth be martin sister meg who have made first overture a anty have not rejected with great disdain have rather shown disposition to talk about a thing just possible martin have repeated in person have reiterated till anty have at last taught to look upon a likely desirable circumstance martin have behaved openly honourably with regard to money part of business telling contemplated bride that be of course fortune have first induced to think of adding that must also value love for herself if must allow described to sort of settlement must propose ended by

that be trying to stifle that be escaping to tell world of brutality cruelty happened over over again for when dozed for minute same thing re occurred a vividly a before made even waking consciousness preferable to vision of disturbed slumber so at last roused endeavoured to think what must do whilst be sitting up in bed reflecting that must undress before must dress himselffor have tumbled into bed with most of clothes onterrys red head appeared at door showing anxiety on part of owner to see if masther be awake to take step to bring about such state if luckily still slept whats time terry said lynch frightened by own state into rather more courtesy than usually displayed to dependent on well then blieve past one yer honer d l be ive such headache be screwed last night eh terry blieve

tea do bring up here be feeler if anything be matter with anty terry must be sure to tell now only said yi yer honer retreated barry now comforted with reflection that there be great harm done that though certainly there have be row between anty must probably blow over then also began to reflect perhaps what have said done must frighten out of match with kelly in meantime terry went into kitchen with news that masther be awake axing for tay biddy have considered entitled to remain morning at inn having in manner earned right to be idle for day by activity during night other girl have endeavoured to enjoy same luxury for have be found once twice during morning ensconced in kitchen under sally wing mr kelly have hunted back to go wait on master giving to understand that must not receive whole household yere afther telling where miss antys gone terry inquired injured fair one divil tell for thinshure may find out widout telling faix hell be mad thin when find shes taken up

in pocket there be tea to be have bell be now rung a barry have gradually re assured rung violently terry when arrived distracted at bed room door be angrily asked by thirsty master why tea didnt appear truth be now obliged to come out at rate part of so terry answered that miss anty be out have key with miss anty be so rarely out barry instantly trembled again have gone to magistrate to swear against have run away from have gone off with martin where d l gone terry said in extremity faix yer thin im not rightly knowing hear tell shes down at widow kelly who told fool well thin yer honer

hatred for returned again anxious wish that might be somehow removed from path a obnoxious stumbling block few minute ago be afraid have murdered now almost wished that have done so finished dressing then sat down in parlour have be scene of last night brutality to concoct fresh scheme for persecution of sister in meantime terry rushed down to inn demanding key giving mr kelly fearful history of master anger very wisely refrained from retailing having procured key gave to messenger merely informing thanks to god kind protection miss anty be tolerably well over last night work might tell master so message terry thought wisest to suppress so took breakfast up in silence master asked more question be very sick pale must eat nothing drank quantity of tea couple of glass of brandy water then felt better again began to think what measure must take what scheme must concoct for stopping horrid marriage making sister obedient to wish confound said almost aloud a thought with bitter vexation of spirit of unincumbered moiety of property confound grinding teeth meaning by to include with anty father one who might have assisted father in making odious will a well a own attorney in tuam who wouldnt find out legal expedient by must set aside then a thought of shameful persecution of be victim kicked fender with impotent violence a noise of falling fire iron added to passion reiterated kick till unoffending piece of furniture be smashed then with manly indignation turned away to window breaking furniture though be what widow predicted of wouldnt in way mend matter assist in getting out of difficulty what be to do couldnt live on year couldnt remain in dunmore to be known by one a martin kelly brother in law couldnt endure thought of dividing property with low born huxtering blackguard a called over over again couldnt stay there to be beaten by in course of legal proceeding to give up amicable possession of what ought to have beenwhat must have be hiswhat looked upon a own came back sat down again over fire contemplating debris of fender turning miserable circumstance over in mind after remaining there till five oclock having fortified with sundry glass of wine formed resolution must make one struggle more must first go down to widow claim sister a poor simple young woman inveigled away from natural guardian if be unsuccessful a felt pretty sure must be must take proceeding to prove lunatic if failed might still delay finally put off marriage be sure must get attorney to put in way of doing to undertake work for late father attorney have be fool in not breaking will at rate trying must go to daly young daly knew be sharp fellow wanted practice must just suit then if at last found that nothing must be done by mean if sister property must go from must compromise matter with bridegroom must meet way raising what money must on share of estate give leg bail to creditor go to place abroad where tidings of dunmore must never reach what did matter what people said must never hear must make over whole property to kelly on getting good life income out of martin be prudent fellow must jump at plan a thought of even began to wish that be done pictured to easy pleasure card table billiard room cafs of calais boulogne pleasure have never known have be so glowingly described to got almost cheerful again a felt that in way there might be bright day yet in store for must however still make last effort for whole stake must be time enough to give in make best of pi aller when be forced to do so if beaten must make use of martin kelly must first try if couldnt prove to be swindling adventurer sister to be idiot much satisfied at having come to salutary resolution took up hat set out for widow in order to put into operation first part of scheme rather wished over a knew that mr kelly be coward have strong tongue in head however must be done sooner better first of looked at in glass to see that appearance be sufficiently

clare streethe started for home by ballinasloe canal boat reached that famous dept of fleecy tribe without adventure will not attempt to describe tedium of horrid voyage for have be often described before to martin who be in way fastidious be not so unendurable a must always be to who have be accustomed to more rapid movement yet will attempt to put on record miserable resource of who doomed to twenty hour sojourn in one of floating prison vainly endeavour to occupy amuse mind will advise who from ill contrived arrangement unforeseen misfortune may find on board ballinasloe canal boat to entertain such vain dream vi inerti of patient endurance be only weapon of use in attempting to overcome lengthened ennui of most tedious transit reading be out of question have tried seen others try in vain sense of motion almost imperceptible still perceptible noise above smell around diversified crowd of be part at one moment heat crowd creates at next draught window just opened behind ear let in on fume of punch snore of man under table noisy anger of neighbour who reviles attendant sylph must be witticism of third who make continual amorous overture to same overtasked damsel notwithstanding publicity of situation loud complaint of old lady near door who can not obtain gratuitous kindness of glass of water baby soothing lullaby of young one who be suckling infant under elbow thing alike prevent one from reading sleeping thinking one can do be to wait till long night gradually wear away reflect time hour run through longest day hardly know why journey in one of boat must be much more intolerable than travelling outside inside coach for in on coach one have le room for motion le opportunity of employment believe misery of canal boat chiefly consists in pre conceived erroneous idea of capability one prepares for occupationan attempt be made to achieve actual comfortand end in disappointment limb become weary with endeavouring to fix in position of repose mind be fatigued more by search after than want of occupation martin however made complaint felt misery made great play at eternal half boiled leg of mutton floating in bloody sea of grease gravy always come on table three hour after departure from porto bello others equally gifted with dura ilium messorum swallowed huge collops of raw animal vast heap of yellow turnip till pity with stranger must at first be inclined to contemplate consumer of such unsavoury food be transferred to victim who have to provide meal at two shilling head love drinkand martin have on previous day be much troubled with bothhad affected appetite ate out money with true persevering prudence of connaught man who firmly determines not to be done be equally diligent at breakfast at last reached ballinasloe

hotel yard found car already prepared for journey on giving order for similar vehicle for own use be informed by disinterested ostler that horse then being harnessed be to take mr daly attorney to

speaking acquaintance with mr daly whom rightly imagined must not despise economy actuated have carpet bag put into well of car placing on proceeded to attorney door soon made necessary explanation to mr daly who made objection to proposal also throwing somewhat diminutive carpet bag into same well placed alongside of friend proceeded on journey with most amicable feeling towards other little guessed one other a commenced talking on now absorbing subject of great trial that be going to dunmore for express objectthough not with expressed purpose of opposing otherthat daly be to be employed to suggest legal mean for robbing martin of wife anty of property martin be going home with fixed determination of effecting wedding to prevent companion be in consideration of liberal payment to use ingenuity energy when have discussed oconnel companion chance of liberation for four five mile when martin have warmly expressed assurance that jury must convict saviour of country daly have given

quickly down street what barry lynch must want with young daly who be beginning to be known a clever though not over scrupulous practitioner felt presentiment that must have reference to anty made rather uncomfortable must barry have heard of engagement have anty repented of bargain during short absence have that old reptile moylan played false spoilt game must be said martin to odd ill be even with schamer yet only shes so asy frightenedav shed laist pluck in life little id care for moylan barry little soliloquy brought to inn door of tribe of lounger who be always hanging about door whom

lower region to pay filial respect to mother considerable time passed before martin returned to meal three young woman have provided for during be in close consultation with widow in first place began upbraiding for folly in wishing to marry old maid for money then taxed with villany for trying to cheat anty out of property when defended from that charge by telling what have done about settlement asked how much have to pay rogue of lawyer for gander job then proceeded to point out difficulty lay in way of marriage between martin anty showed how mad be for of to think about from that got into narrative of barrys conduct antys suffering of lost anything in telling having by time gossiped into good humour proceeded to show how through mean assistance marriage might take place if be still bent upon eschewed running away must hear of clandestine proceeding must be married in face of day a kelly ought with friend round have huggery muggery work up in corner not indeed why must theyfor fear of barry lynchwho cared for dhrunken blackguard like thatnot indeed who ever heard of kelly being afraid of lynchtheyd ax to come see sister married av didnt like might do other thing so widow got quite eloquent on glory of wedding enormity of son future brother in law who have assured martin come down abused horribly in own shop before town because allowed anty to stay in house then proceeded to consequence of marriage expressed hope that when martin got that ready money must do something for poor sisthersfor heaven knew war like to be bad enough off for shed be able to do for

there war nothing like industhry who knowd whether born villain barry mightnt yet get sich hoult of money thered be getting out of fist then depicted in most pathetic language what must be misery of herself kelly if martin flushed with prosperity be to give up farm at toneroe afterwards find that have be robbed of expected property that have support for young bride on subject martin considerably comforted by assuring that have thought of abandoning toneroe although did not go so far a to acquiesce in very small cottage moreover expressed thorough confidence that must neither be led lead anty into imprudence of marriage until have well satisfied that property be safe widow be well pleased to find from martin prudent resolve that be own son that neednt blush for then parted to shop to

much difficulty in persuading three companion to take glass of punch out of tumbler le in getting to take second before went to bed anty be again intimate a be sitting next her for couple of hour on

enemy camp attorney drove up to door of dunmore house on car be shown into drawing room where met barry lynch two young men be acquainted though not intimate with other bowed then shook hand barry told attorney that be welcome to dunmore house attorney made bow rubbed hand before fire said be very cold evening barry said be nation cold for time of year considering that be now in middle of

there truth be that a time of man visit have drawn nearer barry have become more more embarrassed now that attorney have absolutely come employer felt unable to explain business before dinner fellow be so confoundedly sharpi will never be up to till get tumbler of punch on board said to comforting with reflection besides im never well able for anything till get little warmed well get along like house on fire when weve got hot water between true meaning of be that hadnt courage to make known villanous scheme respecting sister till be half drunk in order earlier to bring about necessary now daily consummation sneaked downstairs took solitary glass of brandy to fortify for entertaining attorney dinner be dull enough for of course a long a man be in room there be talking on business in present frame of mind barry be not likely to be agreeable companion attorney ate dinner a if be part of fee received in payment of work be to do with determination to make most of at last dish disappeared with terry rooney who however like faithful servant felt too strong interest in master affair to be very far absent when matter of importance be likely to be discussed now mr daly said lynch can be snug here without interruption for hour two youll find that whiskey old good think if prefer wine port on table came from bartons in sackville street thank ye if take anything itll be glass of punch a weve business to talk of may be id better keep head clear head never so clear then a when ive done second tumbler im never so sure of what im about a when im little warmed say because

much business in county having little believe ive be in company with odd time be queer man wasnt mr daly be then dare say didnt know much about ill take sugar from mr lynch believe might a well mix

dot be in glory in element on curragh be never quite happy anywhere else however be not case with companion for couple of day excitement attending brien boru be sufficient to fill lord ballindines mind after that must not help recurring to other thing be much in want of money have be civilly told by agent managing clerk before left town that there be difficulty in way of immediately getting sum required annoyed for must not carry on game without money then again be unhappy to be so near fanny wyndham from day to day without seeing be truly earnestly attached to miserable at threat have be made by guardian that match must be broken off be true that have made up mind not to go to grey abbey a long a remained at handicap lodge having made resolution thought be wise in keeping still continually felt that must be aware that be in neighbourhood must not be hurt at apparent indifference then knew that guardian must make use of present employmenthis sojourn at den of sporting character a friend blake habitationand continued absence from grey abbey though known to be in vicinity a additional argument for inducing ward to declare engagement at end trouble annoyed though

plentiful with tradesman be becoming obdurate persevering host blake be not soothing comfortable friend under circumstance gave good deal of practical advice must not sympathise with blake be sharp hard sensible man who reduced everything to pound shilling penny lord ballindine be man of feeling for time at least man of pleasure though be thought friend did not pull well together in fact bored other terribly one morning lord ballindine be riding out from training ground when met if not old at rate intimate acquaintance named tierney mr a be commonly called mat tierney be bachelor about sixty year of age who usually inhabited lodge near curragh who kept horse two on turf more for sake of standing gave in society liked best than from intense love of sport be fat jolly fellow always laughing usually in good humour be very fond of what considered world world at least that part of knew returned compliment well lord said after few minute of got up enthusiasm respecting brien boru congratulate sincerely what about said lord ballindine why find youve got first rate horse hear youve got rid of first rate lady youre very lucky doubt in think fortune have stood to most in latter lord ballindine be petrified did not know what to reply be aware that engagement with miss wyndham be so public that tierney must allude to other lady must not conceive how one must have heard that intended marriage be broken offat rate how must have heard spoken of so publicly a to induce to mention in sort of way to first impulse be to be very indignant felt that one must dream of quarrelling with mat tierney so said a soon a be able to collect thought sufficiently be not aware of second piece of luck mr tierney pray who be lady why miss wyndham said mat little astonished at lord ballindines tone im sure mr tierney said frank must say nothing particularly in connection with lady name intended to be impertinent injurious be not that be quite certain of must own that what have just said must appear to be dear lord said other surprised grieved beg ten thousand pardon if have unintentionally said anything feel to be either surely if be not wrong in asking match between miss wyndham be broken off may ask mr tierney who told so certainlylord kilcullen a be miss wyndhams cousin lord cashels son must not think report authentic overset frank still more thoroughly lord kilcullen must never have spread report publicly unless have be authorised to do so by lord cashel frank lord kilcullen have never be intimate former be aware that other have always be averse to proposed marriage still must never have openly declared that marriage be broken off have not have authority for saying so a seem somewhat surprised continued mat seeing that lord ballindine remained silent apparently at loss for what ought to say perhaps ought to tell that lord kilcullen mentioned last night very publiclyat dinner party a absolute fact indeed from manner thought wished to be generally made known presumed therefore that have be mutually agreed between that event be not to come offthat match be not to be run with peculiar view know on subject of matrimony thought fair point for congratulation if lord kilcullen have misled heartily beg to apologise at same time by giving authority to show must not intend anything impertinent if suit be quite at liberty to tell lord kilcullen have told if wish to contradict report must own have spread will do so frank felt that must not be angry with mat tierney therefore thanked for open explanation merely muttering something about private affair not being worthy of public interest rode off towards handicap lodge appeared very plain to that grey abbey family must have discarded fanny wyndham lord lady cashel whole set must have made up mind to drop altogether otherwise one of family must not have openly declared match at end yet be at loss to conceive how must have done sohow even lord cashel must have reconciled to to do so without common place courtesy of writing to on subject then when thought of own fanny a have so often called be still more bewildered with whom have sat for so many sweet hour talking of impossibility of ever forgetting deserting even slighting other who have be so entirely devoted to himso much more than engaged to himcould have lent name to heartless mode of breaking faith if have merely proposed for through guardian thought frank to himselfif have got lord cashel to make engagement a many men do must not be surprised after have passed between usafter vow then lord ballindine

fairly aground from not knowing whether under present circumstance ought to speak of affianced to guardian a fanny miss wyndham when have quite done be dead silent have paused sufficiently long to assure earl that be going to say nothing further just at present great man commenced answer be painful subject lordmost peculiarly painful at present time surely after have passedbut especially after

solemn air about lord cashel during whole of interview deepened into quite funereal gloom a asked last question be so uniformly solemn that have not struck lord ballindine besides appearance of solemnity agreed so well with lord cashels cast of feature tone of voice that visage more lengthened speech somewhat slower than usual served only to show off a so much more clearly identified by own characteristic thus man who always wear green coat doe not become remarkable by new green coat be only so much more than ever man in green coat lord ballindine therefore answered question without appearance of surprise lord cashel expected must feel if have really not yet heard of occurrence about to be related to earl therefore made up mind a indeed have nearly done before frank knew well what be going to be told though suited purpose to conceal knowledge must not however give young brother nobleman lie be therefore constrained to tell tale a if to one to whom be unknown be determined however though must not speak out plainly to let frank see that be not deceived by hypocrisy that lord cashel be well aware not only that event about to be told have be known at handicap lodge that viscount present visit to grey abbey have arisen out of knowledge lord ballindine up to moment be perfectly ignorant of event be only doing justice to to say have heard of must at least have induced to postpone visit for time lord cashel paused for few moment looking at frank in most diplomatic manner then proceeded to unfold budget be much surprised that must not have heard of distressing news reached grey abbey yesterday must have be well known in different circle in dublin yesterday morning considering great intercourse between dublin curragh wonder can have be left so long in ignorance of circumstance so likely to be widely discussed at one time might have so strongly affected own interest lord cashel again paused looked hard at frank flattered that be reading thought looked a if have detected spot on others collar wanted to see whether be ink soot lord ballindine be however confounded when earl spoke of circumstance so likely to be widely discussed mat tierneys conversation recurred to lord kilcullens public declaration that fanny wyndhams match be offit be certainly odd for lord cashel to call occurrence in miss wyndhams family then have round about way of saying everything say continued earl after short pause can not be surprised that event of so much importance of so painful nature doubtless already so publicly known must not before have reached ear of one to whom presume miss wyndhams name be not always wholly indifferent a have not heard lord will communicate to again paused a though expecting assurance of lord ballindines ignorance why lord said frank did hear rumour surprised very much must not suppose to be true to tell truth be very much in consequence of what heard came to grey abbey to day be now lord cashels turn to be confounded first to deny that have heard anything about itand then immediately to own that have heard have be induced to renew visit to grey abbey in consequence just what in wisdom have suspected be case how must lord ballindine have face to own must however tell reader event of frank be ignorant appears lord cashel be determined not to communicate to fanny wyndhams father have held governorship golden appointment in golden day of india consequently have died rich left eighty thousand pound to son who be younger than fanny twenty to daughter son have lately be put into guard be not long spared to enjoy sword uniform died death have put sister in possession of money lord cashel thought that though frank might slight twenty thousand pound must be too glad to be allowed to remain accepted admirer of hundred thousand thought must have heard lord resumed senior a soon a have collected shred of dignity frank open avowal have somewhat scattered felt certain must have heard will be sure perceive that be time for youexcuse if use word may appear harshit be time for one not intimately connected with miss wyndham by tie of family to intrude upon sorrow frank be completely bothered thought that if be so sorrowful if grieved so deeply at match being broken off be just reason why must see after be rather flattering to to hear of sorrow dear fanny be so grieved that be forced to part from lord cashel said be ready to do please ill take step youll advise really can not see why im to be told that engagement between miss wyndham be off without hearing reason from herself ill make sacrifice please requires im sure be attached to can not have overcome affection so soon have already said that requiremiss wyndham requiresno sacrifice from time for sacrifice be past think affection be of such nature a will long prey on spirit affection for be can assure pray excuse mebut think be hardly time to talk of to show affection have be proved to be of lasting fear must say sincere nature must now have be most valued will leave to say whether be case so mean to say lord cashel can not see miss wyndham assuredly lord ballindine must own hardly appreciate delicacy in asking to do so at present moment there be something very hard in match be to be broken off without notice to when requested at rate to hear decision from mouth of only person competent to make be told that be indelicate for to wish to do so put back up well lord said with spirit miss wyndham be at present ward in house be obliged to postpone exercise of right to at least be entitled of hearing decision from own mouth can not think that expects must be satisfied with such answer a have now received will write to evening will expect at rate courtesy of answer from advice to ward will be not to write to at rate for present presume lord can not doubt word that miss wyndham chooses to be released from engagement must say own conduct render highly inexpedient for to keep dont doubt word of course lord cashel such being case think miss might at least tell so must have thought lord ballindine that must have felt that sudden news of dearly loved brother death be more than sufficient to excuse miss wyndham from undergoing interview even under ordinary circumstance must be of very doubtful expediency brother death good gracious be harry wyndham dead frank be so truly surprisedso effectually startled by news now for first time heard have companion possessed real knowledge of human nature must at once have seen that astonishment be not affected have none therefore went on blundering in own pompous manner yes lord be dead understood to say that have already heard unless ear deceived explained that demise be immediate cause of present visit can not however go so far a to say that think have exercised sound discretion in matter in expressing such opinion however be far from wishing to utter anything may be irritating offensive to feeling upon word then never heard word about till moment poor harry be fanny much cut up miss wyndham be much afflicted wouldnt for world annoy press on at moment pray tell lord cashel how deeply feel sorrow pray tell with kindestbest compliment termination be very coldbut so be lord cashels face lordship have also risen from chair frank saw be intended that interview must end must now have be glad to stay wanted to ask hundred questionshow poor lad have died whether have be long illwhether have be expected saw that must go so rose putting out hand lord cashel just touched said good bye lord trust after few month be gone by may see reason to alter opinion have expressed respecting ward must not hear from before then will again do honour of calling at grey abbey will write to miss wyndham before do so lord cashel have honour of wishing lord ballindine very good morning of bowing to door so interview ended chapter xii fanny wyndham when lord cashel have seen frank over mat lay outside study door that there be six foot servitor to open other door through might have to pas returned to seat drawing chair close to fire began to speculate on fanny discarded lover be very well satisfied with with own judgment firmness in late conversation be very evident that frank have heard of harry wyndhams death of fanny great accession of wealth that have immediately determined that heiress be no longer to be neglected that ought to strike while iron be hot hence visit to grey abbey pretended ignorance of young man death when found must not see miss wyndham be ruse old bird like lord cashel be not to be caught with chaff then how indelicate of to come press suit immediately after news of so distressing nature have reached miss wyndham how very impolitic thought lord cashel to show such hurry to take possession of fortunehow completely have destroyed own game then other thought passed through mind ward have now one hundred thousand pound clear be certainly great deal of ready money lord cashel have younger son heir lord kilcullen be expensive man owed did not exactly know be always afraid to ask how much must marry soon must be sure to go to devil have be living with actress opera dancer quite long enough for own respectability if ever intended to be such pattern to country a father be now time for to settle down lord cashel bethought that if must persuade son to marry fanny wyndham pay debt with fortunesurely couldnt owe more than hundred thousand poundshe must be able to give very handsome allowance to live on to do lord cashel justice must say that have fully determined that be duty to break off match between frank ward before heard of accident have so enriched fanny feeling slighted neglectedknowing how near to lover be that nevertheless never came to see herhearing name constantly mentioned in connection merely with horse jockeyshad be induced to express acquiescence in guardian view to throw poor frank overboard in earl have be actuated by mercenary view a far a own immediate family be concerned have truly justly thought that lord ballindine with limited fortune dissipated habit be bad match for ward have consequently done best to break engagement there must therefore thought be nothing unfair in taking advantage of prudence have exercised on behalf did not know when be persuading to renounce lord ballindine at moment young rich only brother be lying at point of death have not done for own sake lord kilcullens there must therefore be nothing unjust ungenerous in turning to own account two loss that of lover brother have fallen on miss wyndham at same time if a guardian must have be wrong to allow lord ballindine to squander twenty thousand must be so much more wrong to let make duck drake of five time a much in manner quieted conscience a to premeditated absorption of ward fortune be true that lord kilcullen be heartless rou whereas lord ballindine be only thoughtless rake then lord kilcullen must be earl peer of parliament lord ballindine be only irish viscount be true that in spite of present anger fanny dearly loved lord ballindine be dearly loved by that lord kilcullen be not man to love be loved then kelly court be to grey abbey rent not twentieth part of above lord kilcullens vice be filtered through cleansing medium of father partiality lord ballindines fault be magnified by cautious scruple of fanny guardian old man settled therefore in own mind that fanny must be dear daughter only difficulty expected to encounter be with hopeful son did not occur to that fanny might object that must be other than pleased with arrangement determined however to wait little before tidings of future destiny must be conveyed to although time be to be lost in talking over matter with lord kilcullen in meantime must be necessary for to tell fanny of lord ballindines visit wily peer be glad to think that must not be further disgusted at hurry former lover have shown to renew protestation of affection a soon a tidings of wealth have reached however must say nothing on head must merely tell that lord ballindine have called have asked to see have be informed of determination to see more sat for considerable time musing over fire strengthening resolution then stalked strutted into drawing room where lady be sitting to make communication to miss wyndham miss wyndham cousin lady selina grey only unmarried daughter left on earl hand be together lady selina be not in premire jeunesse in manner face disposition be something like father be not therefore very charming fault be softened down in what be pretence in be to certain degree real in have most exaggerated conception of own station dignity of what be due to expected from because rank enabled to walk out of room before other woman fancied better than entitled to be thought better be plain red haired in way attractive have refused offer of respectable country gentleman because be only country gentleman then flattered that owned continuance of maiden condition to high station made fit match only for most exalted magnate of land be true industrious charitable worked hard to bring acquirement to pitch considered necessary to render fit for position truly loved family tried hard to love neighbour in might have succeeded for immeasurable height from looked down on listened complacently to serious caution against pride religion taught considered that be obeying warning when spoke condescendingly to around thought that condescension be humility that self exaltation be not pride proper feeling of own family dignity fanny wyndham be very different creature too be proud pride be of if not of le innocent cast be proud of own position be a fanny wyndham not a lord cashels niece anybodys daughter have be brought out in fashionable world liked be liked by felt that owed character three year have given to herself not to around stood a high a lady selina though on very different ground undue familiarity must have be quite a impossible with one a with other lady selina chilled intruder to distance fanny wyndhams light burned with so warm flame butterfly be afraid to trust wing within reach be neither so well read so thoughtful on what did read a friend must turn what learned to more account for benefit of others one in fact must please other must not fanny wyndham be above usual height did not look tall for figure be well formed round bust full have dark brown hair be never curled worn in plain braid fastened at back of head together with long rich fold be collected there under simple comb forehead be high beautifully formed when spoke showed animation of character eye be full round of hazel colour bright soft when be pleased full of pride displeasure when temper be ruffled dignity offended nose be slightly retrouss not so much so a to give to that pertness of be usually index line of cheek chin be very lovely be encouraged to comb back luxuriant hair gave greatest charm to face mouth be large too large for beauty therefore be not regular beauty be talking to willing to please must hardly wish to be le can not describe shade of complexion be rich glowing though be not brunette believe that in painting portrait artist must have mixed more brown than other colour at time of be now speaking be sitting rather lying on sofa with face turned towards cousin eye fixed on vacancy a might have be expected be thinking of brother sudden death other subject crowded with into mind figure shared with thought have be induced to give guardian unqualified permission to reject in name further intercourse with frank though have doubtless be induced to do so by distressing consciousness that have be slighted by have cheated into belief that prudence have induced to do so felt that be not fitted to be poor man wife that lord ballindine be a ill suited for matrimonial poverty have therefore induced to give up may be be afraid that if delayed doing so might be given up now however case be altered though sincerely grieved for brother must not recollect difference death made in own position be now great heiress be to marry lord ballindine if did not make rich man must at rate free from embarrassment besides must give up nownow that be rich must first hear of brother death wealth then must immediately be told that have resolved to reject must bear that must be subjected to construction must fairly be put upon conduct if acted in manner then again felt that loved did love more dearly than be aware began to repent of easy submission to guardian advice to think how must best unsay what have already said have lost brother must afford also to lose lover have have none must really love two tear again came to eye lady selina saw for twentieth time that morning turn face to back of sofa heard sob lady selina be sitting at one of window over carpet work frame have talked great deal of sound sense to fanny that morning about brother now prepared to talk more preparatory to threw back long red curl from face wiped red nose for be february fanny must occupy indeed must dear use attempting embroidery for mind must still wander to be more must read indeed must do go on with gibbon ill fetch for only tell where be must not read selina must not think about what read more than about work must try fannythe very attempt must be work to mind besides must be doing duty must all tear bring back to can all sorrow again restore to friend have great consolation fanny in reflecting that remembrance of brother be mixed with alloy have not lived to be contaminated by heartless vice of portion of world into must probably have be thrown have not become dissipatedextravagantand sensual must be great consolation to might be thought that lady selina be making sarcastic allusion to own brother to fanny lover meant nothing of kind remark be intended to be sensible true consolatory at rate did harm for fanny be thinking of something else before have half finished speech have again be silent for short time when door opened in came earl usual pomposity of demeanour be somewhat softened by lachrymose air in respect to ward grief put on a turned handle of door walked somewhat more gently than usual into room well fanny how be now said a crept up to shouldnt brood over sad thought poor brother have gone to better world will always think of a one who have felt sorrow be guilty of few fault died before have wasted fortune health a might have donethis will always be consolation be singular how nearly alike be platitude of daughter father young man have not injured name character in world have left money behind therefore death be le grievous fanny did not answer sat upright on sofa a came up to herand then sat down beside perhaps im wrong fanny to speak to on other subject so soon after sad event of heard last night on whole think better to do so be good for to rouse to exert to think of other thing besides will be comfort to to know have already done what be sure strongly wished to have executed at once be not necessary for guardian to say anything further to induce ward to listen knew that be going to speak about lord ballindine be attention will not trouble fanny by speaking to now hope said fanny with heart palpitating if anything ought to hear will be trouble to why dear do think ought to know without loss of time that lord ballindine have be with morning fanny blushed up to hairnot with shame with emotion a to what be coming next have have long conversation with continued earl in book room think have convinced that be for mutual happinesshe paused for couldnt condescend to tell lie in glib speechifying manner be nearly falling into onemutual happiness be such appropriate prudential phrase that must not resist temptation corrected himselfat least think have convinced that be impossible that must longer look upon miss wyndham a future wife lord cashel paused for mark of approbation fanny saw that be expected to speak therefore asked whether lord ballindine be still in house listened tremulously for answer for felt that if lover be to be rejected have right after what have passed between to expect that must in person express resolution to yet if have to see now must reject must tell that vow have be made between be to be a nothing must only fall on shoulder weep in arm lord cashel have managed better than fanny at present moment must expect youcould reasonably expect to subject to anything so painful a interview must now have be lord ballindine have left housei hope for last timeat least for many month word fell cold upon fanny ear did leave anyany message for nothing of moment nothing can avail to communicate to expressed grief for brother death desired must tell how grieved be that must be so afflicted poor harry sobbed fanny for be relief to cry again though tear be more for lover than brother poor harry be very fond of other im sure must have be sorryim sure hed feel itand paused sobbed againhe have heard of harrys death then when said have in mind none of dirty suspicion have actuated lord cashel guessed at feeling by own answered accordingly at first understood to say have then seemed to wish to express that have not impression own be that must have heard of sad news must have reached fanny still did not understand earl idea of lover coming after money immediately on obtaining possession of never entered mind thought of wealth a far a might have affected did not dream of altering conduct towards did seem unhappy about continued be sure must make very unhappy must not have loved harry better if have be brother then blushed again through tear a remembered that have intended that must be brother lord cashel did not say anything more on head be fully convinced that lord ballindine only looked on young man death a windfall might turn to own advantage thought must be little too strong to say so outright just at present will be comfort for to know that matter be now settled continued earl that one can attach slightest blame to in matter lord ballindine have shown so very imprudent so very unfit in way for honour once intended that other line of conduct be open to than have wisely pursued treading on fallen be too much for fanny have right either to speak to think ill of said through tear if one be ill treated in matter be did not ask to see surely fanny must not at present moment have wished to see be great relief under circumstance not having to do so be contented must be glad that be satisfiedthat shouldnt think have treated harshly rudely did appear a if wished to see again why certainly did ask for last interviewwhich anticipating wish have refused be satisfied did appear to think that have be badly treated rejected lover answered earl with stately smile seldom express much satisfaction with term of rejection can not say that lord ballindine testified strong emotion rose from sofa a said then intending to clinch nail added a went to doorto tell truth fanny think lord ballindine be much more eager for alliance with fair self now than be few day back when must never find moment time to leave horse friend mr blake to see intended wife to pay lady cashel usual courtesy of morning visit then opened door again closing addedi think however fanny that what have now passed between will secure from further annoyance from lord cashel in last speech have greatly overshot mark object have be to make separation between ward lover permanent hitherto have successfully appealed to pride judgment fanny have felt lord cashel to be right when told that be neglected that frank be dissipated in debt knew must be unhappy a wife of poor nobleman felt that must break proud heart to be jilted have therefore though unwillingly still entirely agreed with guardian a to expediency of breaking off match have lord cashel be judicious might have confirmed in resolution last thunderbolt have be intended to crush lord ballindine have completely recoiled upon fanny now instantly understood allusion raising face be again resting on hand looked at with indignant glance through tear lord cashel however have left room without observing indignation expressed in fanny eye be indignant knew frank well enough to be sure that have come to grey abbey morning with such base motif a ascribed to might have heard of harrys death come there to express sorrow offer that consolation felt must accept from sooner than from living creatureor might have be ignorant of altogether that must come there to press suit because brother be deadimmediately after deathwas not only impossible person who must say be possible must be false untrue to uncle must not have believed have basely pretended to believe that might widen breach have made fanny be alone in drawing roomfor cousin have left a soon a father began to talk about lord ballindine sat there glowering through tear for long time have lord ballindine be able to know thought at moment must have felt little doubt a to ultimate success of suit chapter xiii father son lord cashel firmly believed when left room that have shown great tact in discovering frank mercenary scheme in laying open before fanny that have firmly finally made up mind to have nothing more to do with have not long be re seated in customary chair in book room before began to feel certain degree of horror at young lord baseness to think how worthily have executed duty a guardian in saving miss wyndham from so sordid suitor from thinking of duty a guardian mind not unnaturally recurred to be incumbent on a father here nothing disturbed serenity be true that from appreciation of lustre must reflect back upon from allowing son to become decidedly fashionable young man have encouraged in extravagance dissipation heartless worldliness have brought up to be supercilious expensive unprincipled useless then be gentlemanlike dignified sought after now father reflected with satisfaction that if must accomplish well conceived scheme must pay son debt with ward fortune at same time tie down to degree of propriety decorum by wife lord kilcullen when about to marry must be obliged to cashier opera dancer expensive crew though might not leave turf altogether when married must gradually be drawn out of turf society must doubtless become good steady family nobleman like father why helord cashel himselfwise prudent respectable a wasexample a knew to be to peer english irish scotchhad have horse indiscretion when be young then stroked calf of leg smiled grimly for memory of juvenile vice be pleasant to lord cashel thought a continued to reflect on matter lord ballindine be certainly sordid schemer that son be young man of whom have just reason to be proud who be worthy of wife in shape of hundred thousand pound then congratulated on being most anxious of guardian best of father with comfortable reflection worthy peer strutted off through ample door up lofty stair away through long corridor to dress for dinner might have heard boot creaking till got inside dressing room must have owned that did so with most dignified cadence be pleasant enough certainly planning thing there must be little trouble in executing in first place lord kilcullenthough very good son on whole a father frequently remarked to himselfwas little fond of having will of own may be might object to dispense with dancing girl though there be unfortunately little doubt that money be indispensably necessary to be just possible that might insist on having cash without cousin however proposal must be made a operation necessary to perfect marriage must cause delay money must certainly be wanted a soon a possible time be to be lost lord kilcullen be accordingly summoned to grey abbey a presumed attendance be required for purpose of talking over method of raising wind obeyed summonsi must rather have said of raising storm for gentle puff must serve to waft through present necessity down came to great delight of mother who thought by far finest young man of day though usually slighted snubbed ridiculed herand of sister who always hailed with dignified joy return of eldest scion of proud family to ancestral roof earl be also glad to find that previous engagement detained be that so far sacrificed own comfort a to leave tattersalls figuranti of opera house to come way to grey abbey in county of kildare though earl be glad to see son be still little consternated business interview must not be postponed a be not to be supposed that lord kilcullen must stay long at grey abbey during london season father have yet hardly sufficiently crammed for occasion besides pressure from without must have be very strong to have produced so immediate compliance with behest not uttered in very peremptory manner generally speaking to very obedient child on morning after arrival earl be little uneasy in chair during breakfast be rather sombre meal for fanny have by mean recovered spirit did appear to be in way to do so countess tried to chat little to son hardly answered lady selina though be often profound be never amusing lord cashel made sundry attempt at general conversation a often failed be at last however over father requested son to come with into book room when fire be poked chair be drawn together over rug there be further preliminary must be decently introduced earl be therefore forced to commence well kilcullen im glad youre come to grey abbey im afraid however shant induce to stay with long so a well perhaps to settle business at once must however greatly oblige mother im sure need not add if must make arrangement so a to stay with till after easter must then return together till after easter lord must be in hue cry before time if be so long absent from accustomed haunt besides must only put out own arrangement rather of lady cashel there must probably be room for in family coach family coach wont go lord kilcullen be sorry to say that state of affair at present render advisable that family must remain at grey abbey season will attend parliamentary duty alone be intended a hit first at prodigal son kilcullen be too crafty to allow to tell merely bowed head opened eye to betoken surprise at decision remained quiet indeed continued lord cashel did not even intend to have gone unexpected death of harry wyndham render necessary must put fanny affair in right train poor harrydid see much of during illness why noi cant say did im not very good hand at doctoring nursing saw once since got commission glittering with gold lace like new weather cock on town hall hadnt time to polish shine off death will make great difference a far a fanny be concernedeh indeed will fortune now be considerablea deuced pretty thing remembering that ready money that can touch moment shes of age shes entirely off with ballindine isnt oh entirely said earl with considerable self complacency that affair be entirely over ive stated so everywhere publicly dare say shell give money nevertheless shes not girl to give over man if shes really fond of dear kilcullen have authorised to give final answer have done so after that know must be quite impossible for toto youll seeshell marry lord ballindine have harry lived might have be different now shes got brother money shell think point of honour to marry poor lover besides staying year in country will be in favour shell see one hereand shell want something to think of understand have altogether thrown into blake handsthe keenest fellow in ireland with a much mercy a foxhound he positive fool be ballindine im afraid isim afraid be may be sure im too fond of fannythat be have too much regard for trust reposed in to allow to throw away upon thats very well what can do why not allow to see ive plan in head for ahbut thing be to put plan into head id be sorry to hear of fine girl like fanny wyndham breaking heart in half ruined barrack in connaught without money to pay schoolmaster to teach child to spell ive too many trouble of own to think of just at present to care much about hers son heir got up stood with back to fire put arm under coat lap upon soul lord never be so hard up in life lord cashel now prepared for action first shot be fired must go on with battle so hear kilcullen yet during last four year youve have nearly double allowance before paid farthing owed within last five year youve have nearly forty thousand pound supposing youd have younger brother lord kilcullensupposing that have have six eight son instead of only one what must have done how then must have paid debt fate having exempted lordship from so severe curse have never turned mind to reflect what might have done under infliction supposing have chosen to indulge in expensive habit must have absorbed income left unable to do more for than many other nobleman in position do for sonsdo ever reflect how impossible must then have be for to have helped out of difficulty feel a truly grateful for self denial in respect a do in of non begotten brother lord cashel saw that be laughed at looked angry did not want to quarrel with son so continued jervis writes word that be absolutely necessary that thirty thousand pound must be paid for at once that remaining in londonor in fact in country at be quite out of question indeed lord im afraid jervis be right thirty thousand pound be aware what income be why hardly know jervis take care that never see much of do mean that dont receive at doubt accurate payment mean to say that dont often have satisfaction of seeing much of at right side of banker book thirty thousand pound will sum set completely free in world be sorry to say will notnor nearly then lord kilcullen said earl with most severe still most courteous dignity may trouble to be good enough to tell at present moment do owe im afraid must not do so with accuracy be more than double sum have named do mean that have schedule of debtsno mean of acquainting with amount how can expect that can assist when think too much trouble to make thoroughly acquainted with state of own affair list must certainly be made out if have prospect of being able to settle amount if lordship can undertake to do so at once will undertake to hand correct list of sum due before leave grey abbey presume must not require to know exactly to whom item be owing effrontery be too much lord cashel be very near to losing temper upon honour kilcullen youre cool very cool come upon to pay heaven know how many thousandsmore money know than im able to raise condescendingly tell that will trouble so far a to let know how much money be to give youbut be not to know what be done with if be to pay debt again will do through jervis pray remember replied lord kilcullen not at disturbed from equanimity have not proposed that must pay debt without knowing where money went also have not yet asked to pay at who then do expect will pay can assure must be glad to be relieved from honour merely said that have not yet made proposition respecting of course expect assistance failing have resource jew must regret to put property into hand especially a hitherto have not raised money on post obit at rate im glad of said father willing to admit excuse for returning to good humour must be ruin hope that anything short of may bemay bemay be done something with expression be not dignified pained earl to make be expressive didnt wish at once to say that have proposal for paying off son debt now kilcullen tell fairly in round figure what do think oweas near a can guess without going to pen paper know well lord if will allow will make proposition to if will hand over to mr jervis fifty thousand pound for to pay such claim a have already be made upon a agent such other debt a may have sent in to if will give thirty thousand to pay such debt a choose to have paid by agent will undertake to have everything settled eighty thousand pound in four year why kilcullen what have done with itwhere have gone have five thousand year no house to keep up property to support tenant to satisfy rate to payfive thousand year for own personal expensesand in four year have got eighty thousand in debt property never can stand that know never can stand at rate why kilcullen what have done with mr crockford have portion of john scott have of great deal of be scattered rather widelyso widely that must be difficult now to trace lord have gone wont deny that greater portion of have be lost at play on turf trust may in future be more fortunate more cautious trust so trust so indeed eighty thousand pound do think can raise such sum a at week warning indeed have doubt a to being able to do so may be question whether be willing be noti be not able said libelled father a know well enough incumbrance on property take more than quarter of income there can nevertheless be doubt of being able to have money at once if chose to go into market for have doubt that mr jervis must get for at once at five per cent four thousand year gone for ever from propertyand what security be to have that same sacrifice will not be again incurred after lapse of four year can have security lord against being in debt can however have security that will not again pay debt in own resolution trust however have experience to prevent again falling into so disagreeable predicament think have heard lordship say that incurred unnecessary expense in london before marriage wish kilcullen that have never exceeded income more than did mine be use talking further on subject can not will noti can not in justice to to borrow money for if must must think right to do so then what devil use of talking about so long said dutiful son hastily jumping up from chair in have again sat down did bring down to grey abbey merely to tell that knew of difficulty that must hing to assist now dont put into passionpray dont said father little frightened by sudden ebullition if youll sit down listen to ill tell what propose did not send for here without intending to point out to method of extricating from present pecuniary embarrassment if have wish to give up course ofi must say reckless profusion commence upright distinguished career still hope to see take will think own plan be safer more expedient one than have proposed be quite time for now to abandon expensive folly of youth andlord cashel be getting into delightfully dignified tone felt prepared for good burst of common place eloquence son looked impatient a must not take such liberty with a must with lord ballindine came to point at once ended abruptly by saying get married for purpose of allowing wife to pay debt why not exactly that a of course must not marry woman woman with large fortune must follow a matter of consequence lordship proposes fortune not a first object of affection merely a corollary perhaps will be a well that must finish proposition before make remark on subject lord kilcullen sat down with well feigned look of listless indifference well kilcullen have latterly be thinking much about so have poor mother be very uneasy that must stillstill be unmarried jervis have written to very strongly see be quite necessary that something must be doneor will be ruined now if did raise sumand really must not do iti dont think must manage just at present even if did must only be encouraging to go on just in same way again now if be to marry whole course of life must be altered must become at same time more respectable more happy must depend good deal upon circumstance must think oh be sure must be just same sort of fellow be when at age be much happier after be married so know now see cousin have hundred thousand pound in fact something more than whatfanny poor ballindine so thats way with be when be contradicting rumour of marriage with fanny little thought be to be rival at rate will have to shoot first might at rate confine to sense lord kilcullen when be taking so much pain to talk sensibly to on subject presume can not interest indeed lord im attention do intend to talk sensibly when say that think be proposing to treat ballindine very ill world will think well of turning adrift on score of match being imprudent one wont speak so leniently of if expel a soon a ward becomes heiress to make way for own son know im not thinking of doing so ive long seen that lord ballindine must not make fitting husband for fannylong before harry died think that will indeed do think will be lucky to get im flattered into silence pray go on will be earla peerand man of property what must become if married lord ballindine oh be quite right go on wonder never occurred to before to set cap at now do be serious wonder how can joke on subject with debt im sure feel heavy enough if dont see lord ballindine be refusedi may say be refusedbefore heard about poor boy unfortunate death be very morning heard of three four hour before messenger came that fanny have expressed resolution to declare off commissioned to tell so therefore of course two thing cant have remotest reference to other see there be have be two fanny wyndhamsseparate person though ward of lordship lord ballindine be engaged to girl who have brother can have possible concern with fanny wyndham heiress who have brother how can be so unfeelingbut may pay debt in own way wont ever listen to what have to say must have thought that a father might have considered entitled to more respect from indeed lord im respect attention wont say one more word till youve finished wellyou must see there can be objection on score of lord ballindine oh none at then where must fanny wish for better match than must be great thing for match must be in thing soso respectable just what ought to be mother must be so delighted so must fortune must so nicely pay debt exactly of course must take care to have present incomefive thousand yearsettled on in shape of jointure im sure must be treating handsomely interest of fortune must not be more than what must live on why of course must continue present allowance think that have found so insufficient for must be enough for of must make enough kilcullenin order that there may be something left to enable to keep up title when be gone by time lord kilcullen appeared to be a serious nearly a solemn a father sat for considerable time musing till father said well kilcullen will take advice impracticable lord in first place money must be paid immediately considerable delay must occur before must even offer to miss wyndham in next place be to do so be sure must refuse why there must be delay of course suppose if passed word through jervis for so much of debt a be immediate that settlement might be made whereby might stand over for twelve month with interest of course a to refusing not at likely where must look for better offer dont know much of cousin dont think shes exactly girl to take man because he good match for perhaps not then know understand woman so well must have such opportunity must be sure to make agreeable to with very little effort on part yes poor thingshe must be delivered over ready bound into lion den then young man sat silent again for time turning matter over in mind at last said well lord be considerate dutiful son will agree to proposition must saddle with condition have doubt that sum suggested must be paid through agent must be arranged to be paid in year eighteen month by making responsible for must undertake to indemnify thirty thousand pound must have at once must return to london with power of raising there without delay also must repay out of fanny fortune must then undertake to use best endeavour to effect union with ward most positively will not agree to thisnor have hand in matter unless be put in immediate possession of sum have named unless will agree to double income a soon a be married to proposition earl at first refused to accede son be firm then lord cashel agreed to put in immediate possession of sum of money required must not hear of increasing income argued discussed quarrelled over matter for long time till at last anxious father in passion told son that might go own way that must take further trouble to help so unconscionable child lord kilcullen rejoined by threatening immediately to throw whole of property be entailed on into hand of jew long argued bargained till be surprised at obstinacy of other ended however by splitting difference be agreed that lord cashel be at once to hand over thirty thousand pound to take son bond for amount that other debt be to stand over till fanny money be forthcoming that income of newly married pair be to be seven thousand five hundred year at least thought lord kilcullen to a good humouredly shook hand with father at termination of interviewi have not done so badly for infernal dog will be silenced will get money must not have gone back without can go on with marriage not a may choose hereafter wont be bad speculation however to do lord cashel justice did not intend cheating son did suspect son of intention to cheat generation be deteriorating chapter xiv countess be delightful to see on what good term earl son met that evening at dinner latter even went so far a to be decently civil to mother be quite attentive to fanny however did not seem to appreciate compliment be now fortnight since have heard of brother death during whole of time have be silent unhappy fretful not word more have be said to about lord ballindine have a yet spoken about to one have be thinking about little else have ascertainedat least so thoughtthat must never be happy unless be reconciled to more brooded over subject more felt convinced that such be case must not think how have ever be induced to sanction by name such unwarrantable proceeding a unceremonious dismissal of man to whom troth have be plighted merely because have not called to see a for not writing be aware that lord cashel have recommended that till be of age must not correspond a thought matter over in own room long hour after hour became angry with for having be talked into feeling of anger for what right have to be angry because kept horse must not expect to put into lord cashels leading string indeed thought must have liked le if have done so now to reject just when circumstance put in power to enable to free from embarrassment live manner becoming station what must frank think of herfor must not suppose that rejection have be caused by unexpected inheritance in course of fortnight made up mind that lord cashel have said to lord ballindine must be unsaidbut who be to do must be most unpleasant task to perform one be aware guardian must be most unwilling to undertake fully resolved that must do herself if must find fitting ambassador to undertake task though must be step to must fain not be driven at one time absolutely thought of asking cousin kilcullen about itthis be just before leaving grey abbey seemed so much more civil kind than usual then knew so little of so little liked what did know scheme therefore be given up lady selina be so cold prudentwould talk to so much about propriety self respect self control that must not make confidante of one must talk to selina on subject more immediately interesting than roman emperor pattern for worsted work fanny felt that must not be equal to going boldly to lord cashel desiring to inform lord ballindine that have be mistaken in view have taken of ward wish be impossible such proceeding must probably bring on fit of apoplexy there be one else to whom must apply aunt lady cashel be very good natured old woman who slept greatest portion of time knitted through rest of existence did not take prominent part in of important doings of grey abbey though lord cashel constantly referred to for thought respectable to do so no one regarded much fanny felt however that must neither scold ridicule refuse to listen to lady cashel therefore at last went for assistance ladyship always passed morning after breakfast in room adjoining own bed room in daily held deep debate with griffith factotum respecting household affair knitting needle own little ailment cossetings griffith luckily be woman of much same taste a ladyship only somewhat of more active temperament be most stedfast friend be such comfort to lady cashel to have one to whom must twaddle morning after lord kilcullens departure fanny knocked at door be asked to come in countess a usual be in easy chair with knitting apparatus in lap griffith be seated at table pulling about thread keeping ladyship awake by small talk im afraid im disturbing aunt said fanny wanted to speak to for minute two good morning mr griffith oh wont disturb fanny be

bell when miss wyndham be going pray dont leave alone now ladynot moment griffith escaped to syrup fanny heart beat quick hard a sat down on sofa opposite to aunt be impossible for one to be afraid of lady cashel there be so very little about must inspire awe then what have to say be so very disagreeable to say if have have to tell tale out loud merely to empty easy chair must have be dreadful undertaking well fanny what can do for im sure look very nice in bombazine very nicely made up who be made for got down from dublin aunt from foleys oh remember so told griffith have niece make thing

sorry for what have be done fanny be again in tear dear fanny said countess so far excited a to commence rising from seatthe attempt however be abandoned when felt ill effect of labour to be exposing herselfbut dear fannywhat must have done now know really for best oh dear aunt must get somebody to see ive be thinking about ever since be here with uncle wouldnt let think that broke off merely becausebecause of poor harrys money fanny sobbed away dreadfully dont want to marry said nave countess now fanny did want to marry though hardly liked saying so even to lady cashel know promised must said what will think of mewhat must think of to throw off so cruelly so harshly after thats pastoh aunt must see again know something of human nature replied aunt if do tell will end in being engaged to again know off now come dear dont think so much about im sure lord cashel wouldnt do anything cruel harsh oh must see again come of then paused for considerable time during bewildered old lady be thinking what must do to relieve sensitive niece dear dear aunt dont want to deceive fanny springing up knelt at aunt foot looked up into face do love himi always loved can not can not quarrel with then burst out cry vehemently hiding face in countess lap lady cashel be quite overwhelmed fanny be usually so much more collected than that present prostration of feeling body be dreadful to see

well fanny dear ill go to lord cashel perhaps wouldnt mind coming here ring bell for dear im sure hell be very angry id just write line ask lord ballindine to come dine here let settle only dont think lord cashel must like griffith answered summons be despatched to book room to tell lordship that ladyship must be greatly obliged if must step upstairs to for minute two a soon a griffith be gone on errand fanny fled to own apartment leaving aunt in very bewildered pitiable state of mind there waited with palpitating heart weeping eye effect of interview be dreadfully nervous for felt certain that must be summoned before uncle hitherto alone in house have held in kind of awe indeed respect for uncle have not be of most exalted kind now felt be afraid of remained in room much longer than thought must have taken aunt to explain what have to say at last however heard footstep in corridor griffith knocked at door aunt must be obliged by stepping into room tried not to look disconcerted asked if lord cashel be still there be told that be felt that have to muster up courage to encounter when went into room lady cashel be still in easy chair chair seemed to lend none of easiness to owner be sitting upright with hand on two knee looked perplexed distressed unhappy lord cashel be standing with back to fire place fanny have never seen face look so black really seemed for time to have given over acting to have thrown aside dignity to be natural in earnest lady cashel began conversation oh fanny said must really overcome sensitiveness really must ive spoken to uncle quite impossible very unwise indeed cant be done at in fact lord ballindine isnt by mean sort of person supposed fanny knit brow little at felt somewhat le humble than did before knew must get indignant if uncle abused lover that if did courage must rise in proportion aunt continued uncle very kind about say can of course forgive feeling little out of sort just at present im sure so can im sure id do anything to make happy a for making up with lord ballindine again indeed can not be thought of fanny so uncle will tell then lord cashel opened oracular mouth for purpose of doing so really fanny be most unaccountable thing ever heard of youd better sit down while speak to fanny sat down on sofa think understood rightly when desired le than month ago to inform lord ballindine that circumstancesthat be own conductobliged to decline honour of alliance did not do so spontaneously of own accord certainly uncle agreed to take advice though did so most unwillingly have not authority for desiring himi wont say to discontinue visit for that have long donebut to give up pretension to hand did not authorise to do so believe did uncle have done a desired now fanny have done sonow have fully explained to what taught to believe be wish on subject will tell mefor really think aunt must have misunderstood youwhat be that wish to do why uncle pointed outand be very true then that fortune be not sufficient to enable lord ballindine to keep up rank be different now be very very sorry that be so be different now feel ought not to reject lord ballindine because be so much richer than be when hewhen proposed to then merely matter of feeling with not of affection if understand be afraid that must be thought to have treated lord ballindine badly not only that then paused for few moment added thought must have parted with when made believe that ought to do so find can not mean that love earl looked very black at niece intended to frighten out of resolution quietly answered yes uncle do want to tell so after having banished from house fanny eye again shot fire at word banished answered very quietly even with smile uncle want to ask here again might tell rest fanny dear said countess uncle couldnt do know told to go away before besides really dont think hed come he so taken up with horrid horse mr blake who be worse than of em really fanny kilcullen say that mr blake be quite notorious think aunt lord kilcullen might be satisfied with looking after if depended on never have kind word to say for lord ballindine know fanny continued aunt know everybody if say lord ballindine be that sort of person why must be so though im sure im very sorry to hear lord cashel saw that must not trust more to wife that last hit about kilcullen have be very unfortunate so determined to put end to fanny yearning after lover with strong hand said if mean fanny after what have passed must go to lord ballindine give to understand that be again welcome to grey abbey must at once tell that be absolutelyabsolutely impossible if have personal objection to young man on prudential score very fact of having already at request desired absence from house must be sufficient to render impossible owe too much to own dignity be too anxious for reputation to think of doing such thing when also remember that lord ballindine be reckless dissipated gambleri much fear with fixed principle must consider step towards renewing acquaintance between most wicked unpardonable proceeding when fanny heard lover designated a reckless gambler lost remaining feeling of fear at uncle anger standing up looked full in face through tear not so lord said when have finished be not what have said know too well to believe such thing of will not submit to hear abused oh fanny dear said frightened countess dont speak in way surely uncle mean to act for own happiness dont know lord ballindine have horrid horse if dont mind horse aunt one else need he gambler he not dissipatedim sure not so much so a lord kilcullen in fanny youre mistaken said earl dont wish to discus matter with must however fully understand lord ballindine can not be received under roof if regret must remember that rejection be own act think then acted most prudently trust will not be long before be of same opinion lord cashel moved to door a though have accomplished part in interview stop one moment uncle said fanny striving hard to be calm hardly succeeding did not ask aunt to speak to on subject till have turned over over in mind resolved must not make myself miserable for ever because have be foolish enough not to know mind best know whether can ask lord ballindine to grey abbey not be determined if can not see here will see somewhere else turned towards door then thinking of aunt turned back kissed immediately left room countess looked up at husband quite dumbfounded seemed rather distressed however muttered something about being hot headed simpleton soon thinking better about then betook to private retreat to hold sweet converse with own thoughtshaving first rung bell for griffith to pick up scattered thread of mistress knitting lord cashel certainly did not like look of thing there be determination in fanny eye a made parting speech upset rather threw considerable difficulty in way of lord kilcullens wooing to be sure time must do great deal then there wasnt so much time to spare have already taken step to borrow thirty thousand pound have indeed empowered son to receive have also pledged for other fifty then after perverse fool of girl must insist on being in love with scapegrace lord ballindine however might wear away must take very good care that must hear of misdoings must be very odd if after plan be to be destroyed arrangement disconcerted by own ward nieceespecially when designed so great match for must not however make quite comfortable though have great confidence in own diplomatic resource chapter xv handicap lodge lord ballindine left grey abbey rode homewards towards handicap lodge in melancholy speculative mood first thought be of harry wyndham frank a accepted suitor of sister have known well intimately have liked much poor young fellow have be much attached to be greatly shocked to hear of death be not yet month since have seen shining in new blown splendour of cavalry regimentals lord ballindine be unfeignedly grieved to think how short time lad have lived to enjoy thought then naturally turned to own position declaration lord cashel have made to respecting must be absolutely true that fanny have determined to give up altogetherafter willing vow assurance of unalterable affection must be so cold a to content with sending formal message by uncle that did not wish to see again frank argued with that be impossible be sure knew too well still lord cashel must hardly tell downright lie have distinctly stated that rejection came from miss wyndham then began to feel indignant spurred horse rode little faster made few resolution a to upholding own dignity must run after lord cashel niece must not even ask to change mind since have be able to bring to such determination a expressed to must insist on seeing must not refuse that to after what have passed between must then tell what thought of leave for ever must hing to vex a long a be grieving for brother poor harryshe loved so dearly perhaps after sudden rejection be in manner occasioned by sad event must be revoked a sorrow grew le with time then for first time idea shot across mind of wealth fanny must inherit by brother death certainly have considerable effect on for breathed slow awhile be little time before must entirely realise conception that fanny be now undoubted owner of large fortune be thought to at last that sordid earl considers that can now be sure of higher match for niece fanny have allowed to be persuaded out of engagement have allowed to be talked into belief that be duty to give up poor man like then felt very angry again heaven said to himselfis possible must be so servile so mean fanny wyndham who cared so little for prosy admonition of uncle few month since can have altered disposition so completely can possession of brother money have made so vile change in character must be same fanny who have so entirely belonged to who have certainly loved truly once perish money have sought from affection alone have truly fondly loved have determined to cling to in spite of advice of friend then found deserted betrayed by because circumstance have given probable power of making better match such be lord ballindines thought flattered with reflection that be most cruelly used affectionate disinterested lover did not at moment remember that be fanny twenty thousand pound have first attracted notice that have for considerable time wavered before made up mind to part with at so low price be not to be expected that must remember just at present rode on considerably out of humour with world except a got near to handicap lodge however genius of master spirit of classic spot came upon began to bethink that must be somewhat foolish of to give up game just at present reflected that hundred thousand pound must work wondrous change improvement at kelly courtand that if be before prepared to marry fanny wyndham in opposition to wish of guardian must now be doubly determined to do so even though grey abbey have resolved to contrary last idea in mind a got off horse at friend door be a to what dot blake must think say of tidings brought home with be dark when reached handicap lodge having first asked whether mr blake be in heard that be dressing for dinner went to perform same operation when came down full of budget quite ready a usual to apply to dot for advice be surprised annoyed to find two other gentleman in room together with blake what bore to have to make one of dinner party of four long protracted rubber of short must follow when mind be so full of other concern however be not to be avoided guest be fat good humoured ready witted mat tierney little connaught member of parliament named morris who wore wig played very good rubber of whist knew good deal about selling hunter

accession of fortune have not heard that have rejected lover that have be turned out of guardian house did mean to tell did not find pleasantly situated in having to hear congratulation listen to joke while felt that rumour have so emphatically denied to mat tierney only two day since have turned out to be true not one of party made slightest reference to poor brother from whom fanny new fortune have come except a lucky mean of conveying to there be regret even pretended for early death sympathy expressed with fanny sorrow there be moreover evident conviction in mind of three that frank of course looked on accident a piece of unalloyed good fortunea splendid windfall in way unattended with disagreeable concomitant grated against feeling made conscious that be not yet heartless enough to be quite fit for society in found party soon went into dining room frank at first got little ease for fanny wyndham seemed to be forgotten in willing devotion be paid to blake soup interest of fish also seemed to be absorbing though conversation became more general towards latter course still be on general subject a long a servant be in room much to annoyance mistress again came on tapis together with claret kilcullen dont hit off togethereh ballindine said mat never quarrelled answered frank never however be very intimate wonder at for youre fond of turf there large string of at

explained to how matter really stood at grey abbey told how impossible have found to insist on seeing miss wyndham so soon after brother death how disgustingly disagreeable stiff repulsive earl have be by degree got to talk of other thing among frank present pecuniary misery there can be doubt suppose said dot when frank have consoled by anathematising earl for ten minute a to fact of miss wyndhams inheriting brother fortune faith dont know never thought about fortune if youll believe never even remembered that brother death must in way affect in way of money until after left grey abbey oh can believe capable of anything in way of imprudence ah dot to think of pompous foolwho sits caw in dingy book room of with a much wise self confidence a antiquated ravento think of insinuating

said viscount chapter xvii martin kelly courtship will be remembered that tuam attorney daly dined with barry lynch at dunmore house on same evening that martin kelly reached home after dublin excursion on occasion good deal of interesting conversation took place after dinner barry however be hardly amenable to reason at social hour be not till following morning that became thoroughly convinced that must be perfectly impossible for to make sister out lunatic to satisfaction of chancellor then agreed to abandon idea in lieu of to indict at rate to threaten to indict widow kelly son for conspiracy attempt to inveigle sister anty into disgraceful marriage with object of swindling out of property ill see moylan mr lynch said daly if can talk over think might succeed in frightening whole set of so far a to prevent marriage moylan must know that if sister be to marry young kelly thered be end to agency must promise something mr lynch yes suppose must pay before get anything out of not beforebut must understand that will get something if make useful must let explain to that if marriage be prevented will make objection to continuing to act a miss lynchs agent might hint possibility of receiving rent on whole property hint what like daly dont tie down to infernal ruffian suppose can throw overboard afterwards cant why not altogether mr lynch if make definite promise will expect to keep to confound himbut tell daly what be he to doand what be be to do why mr lynch more than probable think that plan of martin kelly marrying sisther may have be talked over between ould woman moylan young man if so thats something like conspiracy if must worm out of think id manage to frighten what deuce have better do see there be bit of row between be anty got frightened when spoke to of rascal then left house couldnt make understand that shed be all right if shed come to house again while barry lynch have be sleeping off effect of punch daly have be inquiring into circumstance under anty have left house have pretty nearly learned truth knew therefore how much belief to give to client representation dont think said that sister will be likely to come back at present will probably find quieter easier at inn see have be used to quiet life if remains there can marry young ruffian moment take into head to do so there always rogue of priest ready to do job of sort exactly so mr lynch of course sister can marry whom plea when plea one else can prevent still then what devil use of paying to come here tell that thats affair didnt come without being sent for be going to tell that though cant prevent from marrying if plea may make afraid to do so have better write kind affectionate note regretting have taken place between promising to give molestation of kind if will return to own houseand keep copy of letter then will see moylan if can do anything with will be necessary that must also see must come over to tuam meet in office then will try force entrance into widow castle if possible see sister humbug ould woman into belief that have laid open to criminal indictment might even go so far a to have notice served on if snap finger at can hing further advice in case must be that must make best term in power with martin kelly let whole thing go id soonerwhy daly believe youre a bad a blake youre afraid of huxtering thief if go on in way mr lynch youll get professional gentleman to act with give best advice dont like neednt follow wont get solicitor in connaught to do better for than what im proposing confusion muttered barry struck hot turf in grate desperate blow with tongs have in hand sent spark bit of fire flying about hearth truth be see sister in full sens there divil doubt of that money own can marry whom plea that can do be to try make kelly think have got into scrape letterwhat on earth be to say to ill just put down what must say be if like can copy daly then wrote following letter dear anty before taking other step must not fail of being very disagreeable to to others wish to point out to how injudiciously be acting in leaving own house to try to induce to do will be most beneficial to most conducive to happiness respectability if will return to dunmore house most solemnly promise to leave unmolested much regret that violence on thursday must have annoyed can assure be attributable merely to anxiety on account nothing however will induce to repeat must be aware that little inn be not fit place for to be stopping at be obliged to tell have conclusive evidence of conspiracy having be formed by family with whom be staying to get possession of money that conspiracy be entered into very shortly after content of father will have be made public must have fact proved at assize disreputable party to punished unless will consent at rate for time to put under protection of brother in meantime pray believe dear anty in spite of appearance affectionate brother barr y lync h be then agreed that letter must be copied signed by barry delivered by terry on following morning be sunday daly then returned to tuam with warm admiration for client in meantime excitement at inn arising from antys arrival martin return be gradually subsiding two important event happening on same day sadly upset domestic economy of mr kelly establishment sally have indulged in tea almost to stupefaction katties elfin lock became more than ordinarily disordered on following morning however thing seemed to fall little more into place widow be a usual behind counter if girl did not give a much assistance a desired of a much a be usual with be perhaps excusable for must not well leave new guest alone on day after coming to martin went out early to toneroe doubtless necessary labour of incipient spring required at farmbut believe that if motif be analysed hardly felt up to tte tte with mistress before have enjoyed cool day consideration of extraordinary circumstance have brought into inn a mother guest moreover wished to have little undisturbed conversation with meg to learn from how anty might be inclined towards just at present so martin spent morning among lamb plough be walking home towards dusk tired enough when met barry lynch on horseback that hero having come out a usual for solitary ride to indulge in useless dream of happy time must have be sister only removed from tribulation in world though martin have never be on friendly term with more ambitious neighbour there have never up to time be quarrel between therefore just muttered good morning mr lynch a passed on road barry said nothing did not appear to see a passed idea struck a soon a have passed pulled in horse hallooed out kellyand a martin stopped added come here momenti want to speak to well mr barry what be said other returning lynch paused evidently did not know whether to speak let alone at last said never mindill get somebody else to say what be going to say youd better look sharp what youre about lad youll find in scrape that dont dream of be that called back for said martin thats mean to say to at present well then mr lynch must say youre very good im shure will look sharp enough to

answered barry know youll be glad to hear shes pretty well shes coming round from thratement got other night though by account wondher shes alive moment to tell of barry did not attempt further reply rode on sorry enough that have commenced conversation martin got home in time for snug tea with anty sister succeeded in prevailing on three to take glass of punch before anty went to bed began to find more at ease with able to call by christian name without disagreeable emotion certainly have most able coadjutor in meg made room on sofa for between mistress then contrived that room must be barely sufficient so that anty be rather closely hemmed up in one corner moreover made anty give opinion a to martin look after metropolitan excursion tried hard to make martin pay compliment to antys appearance in failed although gave numerous opportunity however passed evening very comfortablyquite sufficiently so to make anty feel that kindly humble friendship of inn be infinitely preferable to miserable grandeur of dunmore house be probable that lovemaking in world must not have operated so strongly in martin favour a feeling meg however be not satisfied for a soon a have seen jane anty into bed room returned to brother lectured a to lukewarm manifestation of affection martin said returning into little sitting room carefully shutting door after youre biggest bosthoon of gandher ever see to be losing opportunity with anty way blieve waiting be for to come forward to do think young woman dont expect something more from lover than jist for to sit by go on a one a though be one of own sisthers av once get out of before priest have made one of two of mind tell itll be up with wondher martin havent got more pluck in oh bother meg youre thinking of nothing kissing slobbheringantys

sunday morning at breakfast widow proposed to anty that must go to mass with daughter anty trembled so violently at idea of showing in public after escape from dunmore house that widow did not press to do so although afterwards expressed disapprobation of antys conduct to own girl dont see what have to be afeard of said in going to get mass from own clergyman in own chapel dont think suppose that barry lynchd dare come in there to pull out before blessed altar glory be to god ah mother know have be so frighted frighted indeed shell get over tantrum hope before sunday next know where ill wish again so anty be left at home rest of family went to mass when woman returned meg manoeuvred greatly in fine successfully that one must enter little parlour to interrupt wooing intended must take place there have difficulty with jane for told what plan be though le energetic sister did not quite agree in wisdom of design pronounced opinion that must be better to let thing settle down bit still did not presume to run counter to meg view meg have work to dispose of mother must not have answered at a meg have very well learned to caution mother not to interrupt martin in love making for widow have charity for such folly certainly expected daughter to get married wished to be well speedily settled watched anything like flirtation on part a closely a cat doe mouse if young man be in house shed listen to fall of footstep with utmost care when have reason to fear that there be anything like lengthened tte tte upstairs must steal on pair if possible unawares interrupt without least reserve billing cooing might be going on sending delinquent daughter to work giving glower at swain expected might be sufficient to deter from similar offence for little time girl consequently be taught to be on alertto steal about on tiptoe to elude mother watchful ear to have recourse to thousand little method of deceiving to baffle with own weapon mother if suspected that prohibited frolic be likely to be carried on at late hour must tell daughter that be going to bed must shut up for couple of hour in bed room then steal out eavesdropping peeping through key hole listening at door handle daughter knowing mother practice must not come forth till listening peeping have be completed till have ascertained by infallible mean that old woman be between sheet party knew trick of other yet taking in widow got on very well with child everybody said what good mother have be be accustomed to use deceit be therefore not disgusted by in others whether system of domestic manner have described be one likely to induce to sound restraint good moral be question will leave to be discussed by writer on educational point however meg managed did contrive that mother must not go near

wasting morning in way diligently commenced weighing out innumerable three halfporths of brown sugar martin went about own business daly left inn after interview with anty kelly in anything pleasant frame of mind in first place knew that have be signally unsuccessful that want of success have be mainly attributable to having failed to see anty alone in next place felt more than ever disgusted with client began to reflect for first time that might probably must irretrievably injure character by undertaking a martin truly called very low line of business that if matter be persevered in one in connaught must be sure to hear of antys persecution that own name must be so mixed up with lynchs in transaction a to leave mean of escaping ignominy be so justly due to employer beyond selfish motif of wishing to withdraw from business really pitied anty felt great repugnance at being mean of adding to trouble be aware of scandalous shame of subjecting again to ill treatment of such wretch a brother by threatening proceeding knew must never be taken a got on car to return to tuam determined that plan might settle on adopting must have nothing further to do with prosecuting persecuting anty kelly ill give best advice can about said daly to if dont like may do other thing wouldnt carry on with game for he worth believe be not much have intended to go direct to dunmore house from kelly to have seen barry must have have to stop for dinner if have done so though generally speaking not very squeamish in society did not wish to enjoy after dinner tte tte with himits better to get over to tuam thought try make see rason when he sober nothing too hot too bad for when he mad dhrunk afther dinner accordingly lynch be again summoned to tuam held second council in attorney little parlour daly commenced by telling that sister have seen have positively refused to leave inn that widow son have listened to threat of prosecution unmoved undismayed barry indulged in usual volubility of expletive expressed fixed intention of exterminating kelly declared with many asseveration conviction that sister be lunatic swore by everything under in above earth that must have shut up in lunatic asylum in ballinasloe in teeth of lord chancellor other lawyer in ireland cursed shade of father deeply copiously assured daly that be only prevented from recovering own property by weakness ignorance of legal adviser ended by asking attorney advice a to future conduct what d l then be to do with confounded ideot said if youll take advice youll hing what let marry have young blackguard brought up to dunmore under very nose im very much afraid mr lynch if wish to be quit of martin kelly be must lave dunmore may be shure wont oh a for ive nothing to tie to dunmore hate place never meant to live there if only saw sister properly taken care of that be put out of power to throw away must leave at once between mr lynch will be taken care of a for throwing away must judge of take word for best thing for to do be to come to term with martin kelly to sell out property in dunmore youll make much better term before marriage than must afther stand to rason barry be half standing half sitting on small parlour table there remained for few minute meditating on dalys most unpleasant proposal be hard pill for to swallow couldnt get down without convulsive grimace bit under lip till blood came through at last said why youve taken thing up daly a if be to be paid by kelly instead of by cant understand confound if can daly turned very red at insinuation be within ace of seizing lynch by collar expelling in summary way from premise feat be able to perform willing also for be sick of client thought of second time restrained mr lynch said after moment two thats second time youve made observation of kind to ill tell what if business be best in county instead of being a bad case a be ever put into lawyer hand wouldnt stand from if think can let out passion against a do against own people youll find mistake out very soon so youd betther mind what youre saying why what devil did say said lynch half abashed ill not repeat itand hadnt betther either now do choose to hear professional advice behave to a ought will do will go out of look out for attorney to tell truth id jist a lieve youd take business to one else barrys brow grew very black looked at daly a though must much like to insult again if dared did not dare have one else to look to for advice support have utterly estranged from father lawyer though suspected that daly be not true to felt that must not break with be obliged therefore to swallow wrath though choked to mutter something in shape of apology be mutter daly heard something about being only joke not expecting to be taken up so d sharp accepting sound a amende honorable again renewed function a attorney will authorise to see martin kelly to treat with youll find cheapest thing can do more than itll be what nobody can blame for how treat with himi owe nothingi dont see what ive got to treat with about be to offer property on condition hell consent to marry sister be that what mean thats not what mean itll come to much same thing in end in first place must withdraw opposition to miss lynchs marriage indeed must give direct sanction in next place must make amicable arrangement with martin about division of property whatcoolly give have impudence to askthrow up game altogether pitch whole stake into lapwhy daly well mr lynch finish speech said daly looking full in face barry have be on point of again accusing attorney of playing false to paused in time caught dalys eye did not dare to finish sentence have begun cant understand mean said cant understand what youre after go on may be youre right cant see for life of what be to get by plan a barry be now cowed frightened have dram bottle by to reassure became comparatively speaking calm subdued indeed before interview be over fell into pitiably lachrymose tone claimed sympathy for many hardship have to undergo through ill treatment of family ill try explain to mr lynch what youll get by a far a can understand father left about eight hundred year between twothats sisther then there house furniture nothing on earth can keep out of property prevent from marrying whom plases martin kelly who be honest fellow though sharp enough have set eye on before many week youll find hell make wife undher circumstance wouldnt be best tenant must find for dunmore youre not fond of place will be still le so when he brother in law lave altogether mr lynch give laise of whole concern if youll do now at once take word for youll get more out of dunmore than iver will by staying here fighting matther out about debt daly why suppose fact be debt be own eh wellsuppose be exactly so personal debt of own why when youve made final arrangement about property must make other arrangement with creditor thats quite separate affair dont expect martin kelly to pay debt suppose might get sum of money for good will mightnt dont think martin able to put large sum down ill tell what think might ask what think must give to get good will consent to match to prevent further difficulty think hed become tenant for whole of share at rent of five hundred year maybe hed give three hundred pound for furniture stock thing about place if so must give laise of three life there be good deal in proposition be pleasing to barrys mind five hundred year without trouble in collecting power of living abroad in unrestrained indulgence of hotel billiard room probable chance of being able to retain income bilk creditor prospect of shaking off from consequence of connection with kelly being for ever rid of dunmore encumbrance thing opened before eye vista of future idle uncontrolled enjoyment just suited to taste strongly tempted at once to close with dalys offer still must hardly bring to consent to be vanquished by own sister be wormwood to to think that after must be left to undisturbed enjoyment of father legacy have be brow beaten by widow insulted by young kelly cowed silenced by attorney whom have intended to patronise convert into creature of own must however have borne put up with if must only have got will of sister to give up to who have be slave lifeto own at last that have power over whom have always looked upon a so abject so mean thing to give in of own accord to robbery have be committed on by own father to do while felt convinced a still did that sufficiently unscrupulous attorney must save from such cruel disgrace loss be trial to must hardly bring to submit crushed tamed a be still sat on edge of parlour table there remained mute balancing pro con of dalys plan daly waited minute two for answer finding that said nothing left alone for time to make up mind telling that must return in about quarter of hour barry never moved from position be important question have to settle so felt for gave up to subject undivided attention since boyhood have looked forward to life of ease pleasure licence have longed for father death that might enjoy seemed now within reach for mean though reduced must still be sufficient for sensual gratification idle unprincipled brutal castaway wretch a barry be still felt degradation of inaction when have such stimulating motif to energy a unsatisfied rapacity hatred for sister ignorant a be of meaning of word right tried to persuade that must be wrong in to yield must only pluck up sufficient courage to speak mind to daly frighten into compliance with wish still felt that might be successfulthat might by legal tactic at rate obtain for management of sister property must not do felt that daly be master though still thought that might have triumphed have come sufficiently prepared that be with considerable quantum of spirit inside knew well enough to be aware that must hing without assistance ala must not obtain there have great reliance in efficacy of whiskey must trust much to large dose of port wine with brandy considered invincible sat biting lip trying to think trying to make up mind trying to gain sufficient self composure to finish interview with daly with appearance of resolution self confidence be in vain when attorney returned face still plainly showed that be utterly unresolved utterly unable to resolve on anything well mr lynch said daly will let spake to kelly about must rather sleep on matther barry gave long sighwouldnt give six hundred daly hed still have two hundred clear think what thatd be for fellow like must ask for then ill not propose to such thing upon soul hell be great fool to give five hundred because he occasion to meddle with in matther at at still think may give a for asking for moreat rate wont do can do what like be to sell furniture everythinghorses cattle everything about placefor three hundred pound not unless like aint mr lynch ill tell thisif can do so do do so itll be best bargain ever mademind one half of belongs to sisther barry muttered oath through ground teeth must have liked to scratch ash of father from resting place wreak vengeance on whenever degrading fact be named to want money daly said couldnt get afloat unless have more than couldnt pay bill know unless got higher figure down than come daly must do something for must do something know to earn fee tried to look facetious by giving wretched ghastly grin bill wont be long one mr lynch may be shure im trying to make a short a can a for earning may think can assure will never have got money harder ive now given best advice if mind not yet made up perhaps youll have goodness to let hear from when be daly walked from fire towards door placed hand upon handle of be hint barry couldnt misunderstand well ill write to said passed through door felt however that be useless to attempt to trust to own judgment turned back a daly passed into officedaly said step out one minute wont keep second attorney unwillingly lifted up counter came out to manage own way said do think best must see that ive be badly usedinfernally cruelly treated ought to do best can for here be giving away a may say own property to young shopkeeper upon soul ought to make pay something for upon soul ought for only fair ive tould mr lynch what ill propose to martin kelly if dont think term fair can propose others youre at liberty to employ other agent please barry sighed again yielded felt broken hearted unhappy longed to quit country so distasteful to relative neighbour so ungrateful longed in heart for sweet easy haunt of boulogne have never known of have heard many glowing description from congenial spirit whom knew have heard enough of way mean of many leading star in elysium to be aware that with five hundred year unembarrassed punctually paid might shine a prince indeed must go at once to happy foreign shore where memory of father must follow where presence of sister must degrade irritate where billiard table be rife brandy cheap where virtue be easy restraint unnecessary where duty must harass tenant upbraid dun persecute there carefully guarding against scheme of le fortunate follower of pleasure among whom must be thrown in social hour must convert shilling of income to purpose of self enjoyment live life of luxurious abandonment need not be altogether idle reflected within afterwards a be riding home felt that be possessed of sufficient energy talent to make perfectly master of pack of card to be proficient over billiard table even to get upper hand of box of dice with such pursuit left to might yet live to be talked of feared wealthy barrys utmost ambition must have carried no further a said before yielded to attorney commissioned fully to treat with martin kelly in manner proposed by martin be to give five hundred year for share of property three hundred pound for furniture c barry be to give sister written unconditional assent to marriage be to sign document might be necessary a to settlement be then to leave dunmore for ever daly made write authority for making such proposal by bound to term must be acceded to by other party must bear in mind added daly a client for second time turned from door dont guarantee martin kelly will accept term very likely may be sharp enough to know that can manage a well without a can with youll remember that mr lynch willi will daly look hereif bite freelyand think will if find must get a much a thousand out of even eight hundred will have one hundred clear for be barrys last piece of diplomacy for day daly vouchsafed answer returned into office barry mounted horse returned home not altogether ill pleased with prospect still regretting that must have gone about so serious piece of business so utterly unprepared regret rose stronger when after dinner courage returned to a sate solitary over fire must have have here said to not gone to confounded cold hole of after there place for cock to fight on like own dunghill there nothing able to carry fellow well through tough bit of jobation with lawyer like stiff tumbler of brandy punch itd have be worth couple of hundred to to have have out hereimpertinent puppy well devil halfpenny ill pay thought be consolatory began again to think of boulogne chapter xxi lord ballindine at home two day after last recorded interview between lord ballindine friend dot blake former found once more sitting down to dinner with mother sister honourable mr okelly honourable miss okelly at least such be titular dignity conferred on in county mayo though believe strictly speaking young lady have claim to appellation mr okelly be very small woman with particularly developed character perhaps of very general utility be fond of daughter more than fond of son partly because be so tall so handsome partly because be lord head of family owner of house be on whole good natured person though perhaps temper be little soured by husband having very unfairly died before have given right to call lady ballindine be naturally shy reserved seclusion of okellys court did not tend to make le so felt that position rank of son required to be dignified consequently when in society somewhat ridiculously aggravated natural timidity with assumed rigidity of demeanour be however good woman striving with small mean to do best for family prudent self denying very diligent in looking after house servant two daughter have be at instance of grandfather courtier christened augusta sophia after two princess of name be now called gu sophy be pretty good natured girlsone with dark brown other light brown hair played harp badly sung tolerably danced well be very fond of nice young men thought kelly court rather dull then have known nothing better since have grown up there be tolerably nice people not very far off whom occasionally saw there be dillons of ballyhaunis who have three thousand year spent six be really delightful familythree daughter four son unmarried up to anything son hunted shot danced did everything that ought to doat least in eye of young lady though of more coldly prudent acquaintance expressed opinion that must be a well if three younger must think of doing something for looked so manly handsome when breakfasted at kelly court on hunt morning with bright top red coat hunting cap that gu sophy great many others thought must be shame to interrupt in career then ballyhaunis be only eight mile from kelly court though be irish mile be true road be not patronised by grand jury distance be only eight mile there be always bed for when went to dinner at peter dillons then there be blake of castletown to be sure must give party for be unmarried be none worse for have plenty of horse went out everywhere blake of morristown also be very nice people only unfortunately old blake be always on keeping couldnt show out of door except on sunday for fear of bailiff brown of mount dillon brown of castle brown general bourke of creamstown family lived within fifteen sixteen mile of kelly court prevented okellys from feeling quite isolated from social world nearest neighbour however be armstrong of saw great deal reverend joseph armstrong be rector of

not good living mr armstrong have very large family be therefore poor man child be helpless uneducated improvident wife be nearly worn out with labour of bringing forth afterwards catering for great portion of own life be taken up in hard battle with tradesman tithe payer creditor debtor yet in spite of insufficiency of two hundred year to meet want mr armstrong be not unhappy man at moment of social enjoyment forgot care poverty be always first to laugh last to cease to do so never refused invitation to dinner if did not entertain many in own house be fortune not heart prevented from doing so must hardly be called good clergyman yet remissness be not so much own fault a of circumstance how must protestant rector be good parish clergyman with one old lady daughter for exercise of clerical energy talent constantly lauded zeal of st paul for proselytism a once observed even st paul have never have to deal with obstinacy of irish roman catholic often regretted want of work

with one dwelt within ten mile of priest parson lord commoner such be neighbourhood of kelly court among such lord ballindine have now made up mind to remain while till circumstance must decide what

further than good connexion thought jerry tailor when job be finished among other invitation sent be one to martin kellynot exactly worded like others for though lord ballindine be perhaps more anxious to see than anyone else martin have not yet got quite so high in ladder of life a to be asked to breakfast at kelly court fact that frank for moment thought of asking showed that be looking upwards in world estimation frank wrote note saying that hound must throw off at kelly court at eleven that if must ride over must be sure to see good hunt that lord ballindine have few word to say to

borrow money from note be sent to glebe requesting rector to come to breakfast to look at hound being thrown off modest style of invitation be considered a due to mr armstrong clerical position be

fortune to lose declared must be unpardonable sin on lord ballindines part seemed to be not at surprised that lord cashel must wish to secure so much money in own family did at participate in unmeasured reprobation with frank loaded worthy earl name one hundred thirty thousand pound must justify anything thought of nine poor child poor wife poor home poor two hundred year poor self

of family who from continual attendance knew how very near to death be must hardly allow to think that must recover there be two person however who from moment of amendment felt inward sure conviction of convalescence be martin barry to former feeling be of course one of unalloyed delight went over to kelly court spoke there of betrothed a though be already sitting up eating mutton chop be congratulated by young lady on approaching nuptials sauntered round kelly court shrubbery with frank talking over future prospect asking advice about propounding pro con on difficult question whether

inn get glass of sherry at dunmore house doctor have very generally done so for time barry endeavoured to throw veil of brotherly regard over true source of anxiety veil be much too thin to hide what hardly covered barry a got intimate with doctor withdrew altogether when barry must say well doctor how be to day then remark in answer to doctor statement that be very badwell suppose cant last much longer very tedious isnt poor thing be plain enough that brother be not longing for sister recovery then must go little further remark that if poor thing be to go must be better for went at once expressed opinion that be rather ill treated by being kept so very long in suspense doctor colligan ought to have be shocked at so be at first to certain extent be not man of very high tone of feeling have so often heard of heir to estate longing for death of proprietor of have so often seen relative callous indifferent at loss of who ought to have be dear to seemed so natural to that barry must want estate that gradually got accustomed to impatient inquiry listened to answered without disgust fell too into kind of intimacy with barry liked daily glass three four glass of sherry besides be good thing for to stand well in professional point of view with man who have best house in village who must soon have eight hundred year if barry showed impatience discontent a long a daily bulletin told that anty be still alive though dying may easily be imagined that did not hide displeasure when first heard that be alive better brow grew very black cheek flushed drop of sweat stood on forehead said speaking through closed teeth d doctor dont mean to tell shes recovering now dont say mr lynch whether be certain fever have left shes very weak very weak indeed never knew person to be alive

through teeth shell drive mad then thought how easily might have smothered a lay there clasping hand with one in room a thought crossed brain eye nearly started from head sweat ran down face clutched money in trouser pocket till coin left impression on flesh gnashed teeth till jaw ached with own violence then in sick room have be afraid of must not have touched then for wealth of bank of englandbut now devil sat within revelled with full dominion over soul there be then feeling left akin to humanity to give one chance of escape there be glimmer of pity shadow of remorse sparkle of love even though of degraded kind hesitation in will for crime might yet by god grace lead to eschewal there be black foul deadly ready for devil deadliest work murder crouched there ready to spring yet afraidcowardly too thirsty alter blood to heed own fear theftlow pilfering pettifogging theft avarice lust impotent scalding hatred controlled by black blood rushed quick to from heart filling with sensual desire below passion of brute denying one feeling one appetite for aught be good even human again next morning doctor be questioned with intense anxiety be goingwas droopinghad yesterday horrid doubt raised only false alarm be utterly beyond barrys power to make attempt at concealment even of most willow kind well doctor be dying yet be brutal question put be if anything rather stronger answered doctor shuddering involuntarily at open expression of barrys atrocious wish yet taking glass of wine devil be muttered barry throwing into arm chair sat there little time doctor also sat down said nothing continued sipping wine in name of mercy what must do said barry speaking more to than to other why youve enough mr lynch without hers can do well enough without enough must think have enough if be robbed of more than half of have half indeed shoutedi may say at once dont believe there man in ireland must bear will again there be silence still somehow colligan seemed to stay longer than usual now then barry must for moment look full in face almost instantly drop eye again be trying to mature future plan bringing into shape thought have occurred to in wild way at different time proposing to scheme with brain have be long loaded have never resolved onwhich have never made palpable definite one thing found sure certain on one point be able to become determined must not do alone must have assistant must buy one aid again looked at colligan again eye fell there be encouragement there there be discouragement why did stay there so long why did so slowly sip that third glass of wine be waiting to be asked be ready willing to be bought there must be something in thoughtshe must have reason for sitting there so long so silent without speaking word taking eye off fire barry have made up mind to ask aid wanted felt that be not prepared to do sothat must soon quiver shake that must not then carry through felt that wanted spirit to undertake own part in business much le to inspire with will to assist in at last rose abruptly from chair said will dine with to day colliganim so down in mouth so deucedly hipped will be charity well said colligan dont care if do must

sat thus long showed great want of character of good feeling in must never have become intimate even have put up with man expressing such wish a so often fell from barrys lip be entirely innocent of thought barry attributed to have never even occurred to that barry bad a be must wish to murder sister bad heedless sensual a doctor colligan might be barry be thousand fathom deeper in iniquity than

even know that have observed a often a found mind thus wandering must start off at quicker pace again endeavour to lay out line of conduct for evening at last however came to conclusion that must be better to trust to chapter of chance there be one thing rather two thing must certainly do must make doctor half drunk before opened on subject must take care to be in same state so walked in sat still before fire for two long remaining hour intervened before clock struck six be about noon when doctor left during six long solitary hour one feeling of remorse have entered breast have often doubted hesitated a to practicability of present plan not once have made faintest effort to overcome wish to have deed done there be not one moment in must not most willingly have have sister blood

painfully anxious on subject anxious not only that matter must be arranged that must be done at once be plain that lord kilcullen must not remain in london for must be arrested same thing must happen at grey abbey if be to remain there long without settling affair if be once to escape creditor by going abroad there must be such thing a getting back again lord cashel saw good reason why there must be delay harry wyndham be dead above month fanny be evidently grieving more for loss of lover than of brother naturally felt alone in worldand a lord cashel thought one young viscount must be just a good a advantage too be much in favour of son must one day be earl posse grey abbey so great accession of grandeur dignity rank must not be a earl considered very delightful to sensible girl like ward marriage of course neednt be much hurried four five month time must do for be only anxious that must be engagedthat lord kilcullen must be absolutely acceptedlord ballindine finally rejected earl

hidden beneath gloss of parental affection there be little of roman about earl must not condemn own son so fumed fretted twisted about in easy chair in dingy book room passed long hour in trying to

that there be anything of kill joy character in fanny composition that natural disposition of grey abbey belonging to be to be dull solemn slow respectable fanny alone have ever given life to place made house tolerable secession to rank of sombre crew be therefore more remarked if fanny moped grey abbey might figuratively be said to hang down head lady cashel be in sense of word continually wrapped up in wool worsted earl be always equally ponderous specific gravity of lady selina must not be calculated be beyond power of figure even in algebraic denomination to describe moral weight now fanny did mope grey abbey be triste indeed griffith in lady boudoir rolled unrolled huge white bundle of mysterious fleecy hosiery with more than usually slow unbroken perseverance lady bewailed fermentation among jam pot with voice did more than whine be almost funereal a lord went from breakfast room to book room from book room to dressing room from dressing room to dining room footstep creaked with sound more deadly than of death watch book room have caught darker gloom back of book seemed to have lost gilding mahogany furniture french polish there like god lord cashel sate alone throned amid cloud of awful dulness ruling world of nothingness around by silent solemnity of inertia lady selina be always useful with solid slow activity dignified intensity of heavy perseverance made perhaps more intolerable than father be like old coach remembervery sure very respectable so tedious so monotonous so heavy in motion that man with spark of mercury in composition must prefer danger from faster vehicle to horrid weary murderous slow security lady selina from day to day performed duty in most uncompromising manner knew what be due to position from exacted performed accordingly with stiff steady propriety made awful if not hateful creature one of daily duty one for performance of have unfortunately ample opportunity be consolation of fanny under trouble poor fanny how great aggravation be to other misery for considerable time lady selma have known nothing of true cause of fanny gloom for though two cousin be good friend a far a lady selina be capable of admitting so human frailty a friendship still fanny must not bring to make confidante of kind stupid unpretending old aunt be much better person to talk to even though did arch eyebrow shake head when lord ballindines name be mentioned assure niece that though have always liked must not be good for much because lord kilcullen have said so fanny must not well dissemble be tormented by lady selinas condolements recommendation of gibbon encomium on industry anathema against idleness be so often reminded that weeping must not bring back brother inactive reflection make fate le certain that at last made monitor understand that be about lord ballindines fate that be anxious that be coming back might be effected by weepingor other measure lady selina be shocked by such feminine girlish weakness such want of dignity character such forgetfulness a said to fanny of what be due to own position lady selina be unmarried not likely to marry why have maintained virgin state foregone blessing of love matrimony because a often said to herself occasionally said to fanny must not step down from lofty pedestal on have pleased fortune birth to place learned however by degree to forgive though couldnt approve fanny weakness remembered that be very different thing to be earl niece earl daughter that same conduct must not be expected from fanny wyndham lady selina grey two be sitting together in one of grey abbey drawing room about middle of april fanny have that morning again be talking to guardian on subject nearest to heart have nearly distracted by begging to take step to make frank understand that renewal of visit at grey abbey must not be ill received lord cashel at first tried to frighten out of project by silence frown look not finding successful commenced long oration in broke down rather have to cut up into sundry short speech in endeavoured to make appear that lord ballindines expulsion have originated with fanny herself banished not banished le fanny have to do with better ward however declared in rather tempestuous manner that if must not see at grey abbey must see elsewhere lordship be obliged to capitulate by promising that if frank be unmarried in twelve month time fanny must then still be of same mind must consent to match use influence to bring about by mean satisfied fanny be that earl must say have now to consider whether must accept term act for herself have have idea what step must with propriety take in opposition to earl must have withdrawn fortune from house hand without scruple of conscience what be to do couldnt write to lover ask to come back to herwhither must go couldnt well set up house for lady selina be bending over writing desk penning most decorous note with precision of calligraphy be painful to witness be writing order

ill didnt mean said fanny becoming almost irritated only meant paused did not finish sentence lady selina wiped pen in scarlet embroidered pen wiper closed lid of patent inkstand folded piece of blotting paper over note be writing pushed back ruddy ringlet from contemplative forehead gave slight sigh turned towards cousin with purpose of commencing vigorous lecture cross examination by hoped to exorcise spirit of lamentation from fanny breast restore to healthful activity in performance of world duty fanny felt what be coming must not fly so closed book eye prepared for endurance fanny said lady selina in voice be intended to be severe sorrowful be giving way to very foolish feeling in very foolish way be preparing great unhappiness for allowing mind to waste in uncontrolled sorrow in mannerin manner can not be ruinously injurious dear fanny why dont do somethingwhy dont occupy youve given up work youve given up music youve given up everything in shape of reading how long fanny will go on in sad manner lady selina paused a fanny did not immediately reply continued speech ive begged to go on with reading because nothing mental employment will restore mind to proper tone im sure ive brought second volume of gibbon twenty time dont believe youve read chapter month back how long will allow to go on in sad manner not long selina a say im sad enough be becoming in fanny to grieve in way for man whom rejected because be unworthy of selina ive told before such be not case believe to be perfectly worthy of of one much superior too did reject fanny bade papa tell to discontinue visitsdidnt fanny felt that cousin be taking unfair advantage in throwing thus in teeth own momentary folly in having be partly persuaded partly piqued into quarrelling with lover resented a such if did said somewhat angrily doe not make grief lighter to know brought on fanny must show that loss for grieve be past recovery sorrow for there be cure must cease to be grieved for at rate openly if lord ballindine be to die must not allow death to doom to perpetual sigh perpetual inactivity youd then know grief be hopeless youd recover lord ballindine be not dead said fanny ah thats just point continued ladyship must be dead to to must now be just same a though be in grave loved time since accepted found love misplacedunreturned at rate coldly returned though loved passed deliberate judgment on wisely rejected having done so name must not be on lip form figure must be forgotten thought of must sully mind love for must be permitted to rest in heart must be rooted out whatever exertion may cost selina believe have heart perhaps a much a fanny ive heard of people who be said to be heart flatter be not one of have mind to regulate heart conscience to prevent sacrificing duty for sake of heart if knew said fanny meaning of what love be youd know that can not be given up in moment a suppose rooted out a choose to call to tell truth selina dont choose to root out gave word to frank not twelve month since that with consent of one belonging to owned that loved solemnly assured must always do so can not ought not will not break word must think of nothing what call own dignity will not give up own happiness firmly believe too for anything so empty dont be angry with fanny said lady selina regard for dignity arises only from affection for must be sorry to see lessen in eye of around must remember that can not act a girl might whose position be le exalted miss ojoscelyn might cry for lost lover till got back again got one must be wiser must not be worse can not do rank station be in benefit require more rigid conduct much more control over feeling than be necessary in humbler position must always remember fanny that much be expected from to whom much be given im to be miserable life because im not parson daughter like miss ojoscelyn god forbid fanny if youd employ time engage mind cease to think of lord ballindine youd soon cease to be miserable yes though might never again feel happiness of loving might still be far from miserable cant cease to think of selinai wont even try then fanny truly pity selina pity said fanny roused to energy a different thought crowded to mind who think more of position a earl daughteran aristocrat than of nature a woman thank heaven im not queen to be driven to have other feeling than of sex do love lord ballindine if have power to cease to do so moment id sooner drown than exercise then why be weak enough to reject because be weak wretched foolish girl said in moment of passion uncle acted on at once without giving one minute for reflectionwithout allowing one short hour to look into own heart find how be deceiving in thinking ought to part from told lord cashel in morning must give up before have time to think of what have said have be here have be turned out of house oh selina be very very cruel in father to take at word so shortly fanny hid face in handkerchief burst into tear thats unfair fanny couldnt be cruel in to do for must have done for own daughter thought think that lord ballindine must not make happy why must think sohed business to think so sobbed fanny through tear who must have business to think for if not guardian why didnt think so then before encouraged to receive be because frank wouldnt do just what be bid be because wouldnt become stiff solemn grave likelike fanny be going to make comparison must not have be flattering to lady selina to father did not quite forget stopped short without expressing likeness have spoken against at first must have obeyed will not destroy now for prejudice fanny buried face among pillow of sofa sobbed aloud lady selina walked over to sofa stood at head of bending over cousin wished to say something to soothe comfort did not know how there be nothing soothing comforting in nature nothing soft in voice manner be repulsive almost unfeeling yet be not unfeeling loved fanny a warmly a be capable of loving must have made almost personal sacrifice to save cousin from grief must be possible have borne sorrow must not unbend must not sit down by fanny side taking hand say soft soothing thing must not make grief easier by expressing hope for future consolation for past must have felt that be compromising truth by giving hope dignity by uttering consolation for loss of considered better lost than retained lady selinas only recipe be endurance occupation at rate practised what preached be never idle never complained a saw fanny grief heard sob at first thought that in mercy must now give up subject of

truly prodigal son must have fatted calf prepared for arrival flurried rejoiced terrified excited lady exceedingly in first place be so truly delightful that son must turn good proper careful decorous just at right time of life so exactly thing ought to happen of course young nobleman be extravagant wicked lascivious habitual breaker of commandment idolators be nature in lady cashels thought on education of young men evil be ranked with measles hooping cough be well that must be gone through be done with early in life have kind of hazy idea that opera dancer gambling club be indispensable in fitting young aristocrat for future career doubt whether must not have agreed to expediency of inoculating son of hers with ailment in mild degreevaccinating a be with dissipation in order that might

strengthened argument by asserting that miss wyndham have of late be quite mumchance lady cashel be at first rather inclined to insist on niece being called to council griffith eloquence be too strong judgment too undoubted so fanny be left undisturbed lady selina alone summoned to join aged female senator of grey abbey selina said ladyship a soon a daughter be seated on sofa opposite to mother

spirit to enlighten be delighted to find mat tierney be to be there be rejoiced to be able to convey with a sort of protection from father eloquence for first two day of visit lord kilcullen mother began father intent on at once commenting on iniquity of late arrival when saw figure of very stout gentleman amply wrapped up in travelling habiliment follow son into inner hall tierney lord said son be good enough to come down with found that intended to be here to morrow told mother must be delighted to see to day instead earl shook mr tierneys hand told how very welcome be at time especially at

fear for friend interest not that there be real occasion for fanny wyndham be not girl to be talked out of into real passion by anyone now tell truth fanny said kilcullen a be sitting over fire together in library one dark afternoon before went to dress for dinner hadnt be taught to look on a kind of ogrea monster of iniquity who spoke nothing oath did nothing sin not exactly that wont say

day devising iniquity in dream come now tell truth shame devil if be devil know people have made out to be why really adolphus never calculated how day night be spent if be to tell truth fear of might have be passed to better advantage of fanny mightnt with truth say same of ourselves of course none of said fanny dont think im judging asked questionand suppose wanted answer did wanted true onefor though may never have given much trouble to form opinion about be anxious that must do so now dont want to trouble with what be done past dont want to make appear have not be thoughtless imprudentwicked iniquitous if be fond of strong term do want to trouble with confessing impropriety may regularly receive absolution do wish to believe have done nothing must exclude from future good opinion from friendship esteem be not of unforgiving temperament even have done anything for to forgive be not aware that have nothing for to forgive in light of offence to yourself much perhaps to prevent being willing to regard a personal friend be not only first cousin fanny be placed more closely together than cousin usually be have father mother now also have brother took hand in own a said so who must be brother to if be not who at rate must look on a friend if not on nobody must be better believe than selina be stiff coldunlike in everything must be so happy if must be friendthe friend of friend spoke of other evening if must fill place must be empty near heart can never be to if believe that anything in past life have be really disgraceful be for reason want to know what truly think of wont deny that be anxious must think well of mewell at rate for present future charitably a regard past fanny have be taken much by surprise by turn cousin have given to conversation be so much affected that before have finished be in tear have taken hand out of to put handkerchief to eye a did not immediately answer continued will probably be much here for time to comesuch at least be present plan hope that while be will become friend not such friend fanny a judith ojoscelynfriends only of circumstance who have taste habit feeling in commonfriends whose friendship consists in living in same parish meeting other once twice week friend in realityfriends in confidencefriends in mutual dependencefriends in lovefriends dear fanny a cousin situated a be must be to other fanny heart be very full for felt how much how desperately wanted friend a kilcullen described how delightful must be to have such friend to find in own cousin whole family hitherto be so cold to herso uncongenial earl absolutely disliked loved aunt be only because be auntshe couldnt like though loved lady selina to degree admired be like loving marble figure there be more true feeling in what kilcullen have now said to than in have fallen from whole family for four year have lived at grey abbey must not therefore close on offer of affection will be such friend then said after be too bad have too much of taint of wicked world to be friend of so pure creature a oh adolphus im sure never thought so said never judged indeed be not disposed to do so now im too much in want of kindness to reject yourseven be disposed to do so be not then fanny be to be friendstrue loving trusting friend oh yes said fanny be really truly grateful for affection kindness know how precious be will value accordingly again lord kilcullen took hand pressed in then kissed told be own dear cousin fanny then recommended to go dress did sat down for quarter of hour ruminating then also went off to dress during quarter of hour very different idea passed through mind than such a who knew best must have given credit for in first place thought that really began to feel affection for cousin fanny to speculate whether be absolutely within verge of possibility that must marry herretrieve circumstancestreat well live happily for rest of life a respectable nobleman for two three minute illusion remained till be banished by retrospection be certainly possible that must marry be full intention to do so a to retrieving circumstance treating wellthe first be absolutely impossiblethe other nearly so a to living happily at grey abbey a family man yawned a felt how impossible must be that must spend month in such way let alone life then fanny wyndham be so beautiful so lively so affectionate so exactly what cousin wife ought to be must not bear to think that protestation of friendship love have be hypocritical that must only look upon a gudgeon a bigger fish determined to swallow yet such must be view regarding departed to dress absolutely troubled in conscience be fanny thought about cousin be much surprised gratified at same time somewhat flustered overwhelmed by warmth novelty of affection however never for moment doubted truth towards have slightest suspicion of real object chief thought be whether must induce to be mediator for between lord cashel lord ballindine during next two day spoke to good deal about brotherof whom by bye have really known nothing contrived however to praise a young man of much spirit great promise then spoke of own large fortune asked what wish be about investment told how happy must be to express wish at once to lord cashel to see that be carried out once twice have gradually attempted to lead conversation to lord ballindine kilcullen be too crafty have prevented have not yet sufficient courage to tell at once what be so near heart fanny said lady selina one morning about week after general arrival of company at grey abbey when of have taken departure be very glad to see have recovered spirit know have made great effort appreciate admire indeed selina fear be admiring too soon own have be amused week past to certain degree pleased fear youll find will relapse there be radical reform thought be in same direction a be great trial in world be to behave well becomingly in spite of oppressive thought always take struggle to do struggle youve made hope may lead to feel that may be contented in comfort without having everything think necessary to happiness im sure looked forward to week a one of unmixed trouble torment be very wrong to do so have given great deal of unmixed satisfaction im very glad of selina what be im sure must not have come from poor mr ellison bishop wife seemed to to spend time in talking to virtue say be own reward dont know what other satisfaction can have have from in first place have given great pleasure to see that be able to exert in company that crowd of people did not annoy have chiefly be delighted by seeing that adolphus be such good friend must think fanny that be anxious about only brotherespecially when have have so much cause to be anxious about dont think must be delight to to find that be able to take pleasure in society must be doubly pleased doubly delighted if must please have not vivacity to amuse what nonsense selina dont say that true fanny have not grey abbey have become distasteful to because be sedate steady people perhaps must call dull heavy have grieved that must be so though can not alter nature be so much contrarythere be so much in character like own before became fond of world feel can become attached to fond of be delighted to see that think so what do think of now that have seen more of than ever did before indeed said fanny like very much be very clever isnt might have be anything if have given fair play seems to have taken greatly to oh yes be great friend then fanny pausedso great friend continued looking somewhat gravely in lady selinas face mean to ask greatest favour of must ask of anyone one be sure little dreamed must ever ask of what be fanny be secret indeed be selina secret will tell mean to tell feel about lord ballindine mean to ask to see for adolphus have offered to be brother to mean to take at word lady selina turned very pale looked very grave a replied be not giving brother work fanny brother must protect from importunity insult from injury wrong be sure adolphus must do brother must consent to offer hand to man who have neglected be refused who in probability must now reject with scorn if have opportunityor if not will take for money sake that fanny be not brother work be embassy be sure adolphus will not undertake if take advice will not ask a lady selina finished speaking walked to door a if determined to hear reply from cousin a be leaving room fancied that heard sobbing heart softened again turned towards said god know fanny wish to be severe ill natured to must do anything for comfort happiness can not bear to think that shouldlady selina be puzzled for word to express meaningthat must forget attempted to put arm round fanny waist be mistaken fanny be not sobbing be angry what selina now said about forgetting did not make le so said withdrawing from cousin embrace standing erect while bosom be swelling with indignation want affection from selina be accompanied by so much disapprobation dont wish to be severe only say that be likely to forget forget fanny threw back beautiful head clenched little fist by side other day said disgrace bore calmly then will not longer bear such imputation tell plainly selina will not forget will be forgotten will submit to whatever fate cold unfeeling people may doom merely because be woman alone will not give up lord ballindine if have to walk to door tell so be to do so must never think that have forgotten listen to fanny said selina wait moment continued fanny have listened enough be turn to speak now for one thing have to thank have dispelled idea must look for help to anyone in family will not ask brother to do anything for think so disgraceful will not subject to scorn with choose to think love

friend brother will still be happy different feeling be disturbing lord kilcullens breastdifferent from other of very different from usually found place there have sought fanny hand not only with most sordid also with most dishonest view not only intended to marry for fortune also to rob of money to defraud that might enable once more to enter world of pleasure with slight encumbrance of wretched wife in carrying out plan have disturbed by own weakness have absolutely allowed to fall in love with cousin when a have just done offered hand be quite a anxious that must accept for own sake a for of money have taught to believe that must accept many misgiving have haunted a to ruined state to must bring a wife feeling though strong enough to disturb be not strong enough to make pause tried to

cashels plan be certainly not lucky be not that sufficient care be not used in laying sufficient caution displayed in maturing passed time in care caution spared pain in seeing that whole machinery be right be indefatigable in deliberation diligent in manoeuvring constant in attention somehow be unlucky scheme be never successful in present instance be peculiarly unfortunate for everything went wrong with have got rid of obnoxious lover have coaxed over son have spent immensity of money have undergone world of trouble self restraintand then when really began to think that ward fortune must compensate for own family came to one after to assure that be completely mistakenthat be utterly impossible that thing a family marriage between two cousin must never take place indeed ought not to be thought of lady selina gave first check on morning on lord kilcullen made offer paid father solemn visit in book room told exactly what have before told mother assured that fanny must not be induced at rate at present to receive cousin a lover whispered to with unfeigned sorrow shame that fanny be still madly in love with lord ballindine begged to induce brother to postpone offer at rate for month hate lord ballindines very name said earl petulant with irritation none of approve of papa dont think of supposing that must now be fitting husband for fanny that must possibly ever be married of course not to be thought of if must advise adolphus not to be premature might in end be more successful kilcullen have made own bed must lie in wont interfere between said angry father if be only to recommend delay suggested daughter few month delay think how short time harry have be dead lord cashel knew that delay be death in case so pished hummed hawed quite lost dignity on piqued ended by declaring that must not interfere that might do a liked that young people must not be guided that must not make unhappy about so lady selina crestfallen disappointed went away then lady cashel

character shell marry now suppose repent at leisure ill give further trouble about earl thought upon subject however good deal before mr armstrong arrival have made up mind that must again swallow word ask ward lover back to house have at rate become assured that if did not do so one else must do for mr armstrong be happily possessed of considerable stock of self confidence during first day journey felt want of with regard to delicate mission with be entrusted when have deposited carpet bag at little hotel at kilcullen bridge found seated on hack car proceeding to grey abbey began to feel that have rather difficult part to play by time that house be in sight felt completely puzzled a to manner in must open negotiation have however desired man to drive to house must not well stop car in middle of demesne to mature plan when be at door must not stay there without applying for admission so got card case in hand rang bell after due interval to parson did not seem bit too long heavy looking powdered footman appeared announced that lord cashel be at home in minute mr armstrong found in book room be morning after lord kilcullens departure lord cashel be still anything comfortable ladyship have be bothering about poor boy a called son now that learned be in distress have be beseeching to increase allowance earl have not told wife extent of son pecuniary delinquency

brought in friend name rev george armstrong written on plain card parson have not put name of parish fearing that earl knowing from whence came might guess business decline seeing a be difficulty be made parson soon found tte tte with earl have taken liberty of calling on lord cashel said mr armstrong having accepted offer of chair on rather delicate mission earl bowed rubbed hand felt more comfortable than have done for last week liked delicate mission coming to for flattered that knew how to receive in delicate manner liked also displaying dignity to stranger for felt that stranger stood rather in awe of also felt though did not own to that manner be not so effective with people who have known time may say very delicate mission said parson one must not have undertaken have not known lordship character for candour honesty lord cashel again bowed rubbed hand be lord friend of lord ballindine a such have taken liberty of calling on lordship friend of lord ballindine said earl arching eyebrow assuming look of great surprise very old friend lord clergyman of parish for many year intimate friend of father have known lord ballindine since be child lord ballindine be lucky in having such friend few young men now be sorry to say care much for father friend be there anything mr armstrong in can assist lordship lord said parson need not tell that before took perhaps unwarrantable liberty of troubling be made acquainted with lord ballindines engagement with ward with manner in engagement be broken off object be mr armstrong object be to remove if possible unfortunate misunderstanding between lordship friend misunderstanding mr armstrongthere be misunderstanding between really think perfectly understood other lord ballindine be engaged to ward engagement however being contingent on adoption of certain line of conduct line of conduct lordship did not adopt perhaps used wise discretion however thought not thought mode of life pursued pardon moment mr armstrong will have said appears to to be necessary on occasion perhaps more than be necessary more probably than must have allowed to say have not lord ballindine sent a ambassador clergyman of parish friend of father lord cashel again bowed rubbed hand thought mr armstrong young friend appeared wedded to style of life quite incompatible with incomewith own income a single man income must have possessed have married ward thought that marriage must only lead to poverty distress felt be only doing duty to ward in expressing opinion to found that be of same opinion that feared union with lord ballindine must not ensure happiness to to herself habit be too evidently of extravagance hers have not be such a to render life of privation anything life of misery have thought one moment more mr armstrong will have done after mature consideration miss wyndham commissioned to express sentimentsand must say fully coincided with ownto lord ballindine to explain to that found obliged tototo retrace step have taken in matter did in manner a little painful to lord ballindine a be able be difficult mr armstrong to make disagreeable communication palatable be very difficult to persuade young man who be in love to give up object of idolatry trust lord ballindine will do justice to own on occasion alluded to said nothing unnecessarily harshnothing calculated to harass feeling appreciate esteem lord ballindines good quality much regretted that prudence forbad to sanction near alliance be anxious to do honour of making with lord cashel finished harangue felt once more on good term with by mean intended offering further vehement resistance to ward marriage be indeed rejoiced to have opportunity of giving way decently must not resist temptation of explaining conduct making speech lord said parson what tell be only repetition of what heard from young friend be glad to hear trust then may have pleasure of feeling that lord ballindine attribute to personal unkindness not in least lord cashel very far from though lord ballindine may not bemay not hitherto have be free from folly of age have have quite sense enough to appreciate lordship conduct
