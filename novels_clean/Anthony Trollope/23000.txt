when however sir joseph died codicil to will executed with due legal formality bequeathed orley farm to youngest son little lucius mason then commenced legal proceeding at last developed into great orley farm case eldest son contested validity of codicil indeed there be ground on appeared feasible that must do so codicil not only left orley farm away from to baby lucius also interfered in

of very codicil sum of two thousand pound be not be true left away from surviving joseph be to be produced out of certain personal property have be left by first will to widow then old jonathan usbech have died while sir joseph mason be still living circumstance of trial need not be detailed here be clearly proved that sir joseph have during whole life expressed intention of leaving orley farm to eldest son that be man void of mystery not given to secret in money matter one very little likely to change opinion on such subject be proved that old jonathan usbech at time in will be made be in very bad circumstance a regard money health business have once not be bad have eaten drunk at period be feeble penniless overwhelmed by gout debt have for many year be much employed by sir joseph in money matter be known that be so employed almost up to day of death question be whether have be employed to make codicil body of will be in handwriting of widow a be also codicil be stated by at trial

thing lady mason proved that on date of signature mr usbech have be with sir joseph for sundry hour then young clerk be examined have said witnessed in time four ten twenty under pressure confessed to a many a hundred twenty business signature on part of employer sir joseph thought have witnessed hundred twenty must take oath have not witnessed hundred twenty one did remember witnessing signature of master about time specified by date of codicil remembered maid servant also signing at same time mr usbech be then present did not remember mr usbech having pen in hand mr usbech knew must not

be confident that own name a there appearing have be written by on re cross examination felt sure that there be something wrong ended in judge informing that word be worth nothing be hard enough on poor young man seeing that have done best to tell that remembered then servant girl came into witness box be sure be own handwriting remembered being called in to write name seeing master write have be explained to at time admitted that have not understood explanation have also seen clerk write name be not sure that have seen mr usbech write mr usbech have have pen in hand be sure of that last witness be miriam usbech then very pretty simple girl of seventeen father have told once that hoped sir joseph must make provision for have be shortly before father death at father death have be sent for to orley farm have remained there till sir joseph died have always regarded sir joseph lady mason a best friend have known sir joseph life did not think unnatural that must provide for have heard father say more than once that lady mason must never rest till old gentleman have settled orley farm upon son not evidence taken have be given here enough probably for purpose will codicil be confirmed lady mason continued to live at farm evidence be supposed to have be excellently given to have be conclusive have seen signature written codicil must explain motive be woman of high character of great talent of repute in neighbourhood a judge remarked there must be possible reason for doubting word nothing also must be simpler prettier than evidence of miriam usbech a to whose fate destiny people at time expressed much sympathy that stupid young clerk be responsible for only weak part of matter if proved nothing on one side did prove anything on other be commencement of great orley farm case having be then decided in favour of infant be allowed to slumber for nearly twenty year codicil be confirmed lady mason remained undisturbed in possession of house acting a guardian for child till came of age indeed for time beyond epoch in course of page two will beg reader to allow to introduce lady to acquaintance miriam usbech of whom also will see something remained at farm under lady mason care till married young attorney who in process of time succeeded to such business a father left behind suffered trouble in life before settled down in neighbouring country town a mr dockwrath for have have lover stupid young clerk who have so villainously broken down in evidence to other lover whom have be unable to bring to accept lady mason have given favour assistance poor miriam be at time soft mild eyed girl easy to be led one must have said in matter lady mason must not lead be in vain to tell that character of young dockwrath did not stand high that young kenneby clerk must be promoted to manner of good thing soft mild eyed a miriam be love be still lord of in matter must not be persuaded eventually gave two thousand pound to samuel dockwrath young attorney with questionable character led to breach between patroness lady mason wishing to do best for young friend have favoured john kenneby be not woman at likely to quarrel on such ground a well miriam have said must judge for yourself of course in such matter a know regard for oh yes ma'be said miriam eagerly will always be glad to promote welfare a mr dockwrath if possible can only say must have have more satisfaction in attempting to do so for a mr kenneby in spite of seeming coldness of word lady mason have be constant to friend for many year have attended to with more le active kindness in sorrow arising from annual baby two set of twin progeny before commencement of tale reached serious number of sixteen living among other solid benefit conferred by lady mason have be letting to mr dockwrath of certain two field lying at extremity of farm property quite adjacent to town of hamworth in old mr usbech have resided have be let by year at rent not considered to be too high at period have certainly become much lower in proportion to value of land a town of hamworth have increased on field mr dockwrath expended money though probably not so much a averred when noticed to give up at period of young mason coming of age expressed terribly aggrieved surely mr dockwrath be very ungrateful lady mason have said to have answered with disrespectful word hence have arisen actual breach between poor miriam husband must say miriam mr dockwrath be unreasonable lady mason have said what must poor wife answer oh lady mason pray let bide time till come right never did come right affair of two field created great orley farm case will be business to unravel now word two a to orley farm in first place let be understood that estate consisted of two farm one called old farm be let to old farmer named greenwood have be let to to father for many year antecedent to day of mason mr greenwood held about three hundred acre of land paying with admirable punctuality over four hundred year in rent be regarded by orley people a institution on property then there be farm house land attached to be residence in sir joseph have lived keeping in own hand portion of property when first inhabited by house be not fitted for more than requirement of ordinary farmer have gradually added to ornamented till be commodious irregular picturesque straggling when died during occupation

servant room of fair dimension be two story high room be low roof steep covered with tile next portion have be added by sir joseph then mr mason when first thought of living at place also be tiled room be nearly a low there be three story building therefore be considerably higher for five twenty year farm house so arranged have sufficed for common want of sir joseph family when determined to give up establishment in city added on step to house at orley farm on occasion built good dining room with drawing room over bed room over portion of edifice be slated whole stood in one line fronting on to large lawn fell steeply away from house into orchard at bottom lawn be cut in terrace here there upon there stood apple tree of ancient growth for here have be garden of old farm house be large straggling tree such a delight eye of modern gardener produced fruit by bushel very sweet to palate though probably not so perfectly round large handsome a horticultural skill of present day requires face of house from one end to other be covered with vine passion flower for aspect be due south a whole of later addition be faced by verandah also a regarded ground floor ran along middle building place in summer be pretty enough a have said before be irregular straggling at same time roomy picturesque such be orley farm house there be about two hundred acre of land attached to together with large old fashioned farm yard standing not so far from house a most gentleman farmer might perhaps desire farm building however be well hidden for sir joseph though must at time go to expense of constructing anew have spent more money than proceeding must have cost doctoring existing evil ornamenting standing edifice in doing have extended wall of brewhouse covered with creeper so a to shut out from hall door approach to farm yard have put up quarter of mile of high ornamental paling for same purpose have planted extensive shrubbery along brow of hill at one side of house have built summer house sunk have have fence below orchard have contrived to give to place unmistakable appearance of english gentleman country house nevertheless sir joseph have never bestowed upon estate have ever deserved more grandiloquent name than have possessed of old orley farm house be somewhat more than mile distant from town of hamworth land run in direction of town not skirting high road

southern coast must greedily fill long chapter with well loved glory of cleeve hill may be that must press heather with foot more than once in course of present task if so will be well to leave something for coming visit ungrateful will let know whether owe gratitude have paid rent half year a came due what more must have ungrateful indeed be one of woman who think that ought to go down on knee to if only speak civilly to will let know whether be ungrateful word be spoken by angry mr samuel dockwrath to wife a stood up before parlour fire after breakfast woman to whom referred be lady mason mr samuel dockwrath be very angry a so spoke at rate seemed to be so there be men who take delight in abusing special friend whom wife best love mr dockwrath be one of have never given cordial consent to intercourse have hitherto existed between lady of orley farm household although have not declined substantial benefit have accompanied pride have rebelled against feeling of patronage though interest have submitted to advantage thence derived family of sixteen child be heavy burden for country attorney with small practice even though wife may have have fortune of two thousand pound thus mr dockwrath though have never loved lady mason have permitted wife to accept numberless kindness lady with comfortable mean child be always able to bestow on favoured neighbour who have few mean many child indeed have accepted great favour with reference to holding of two field have acknowledged a much when first took into hand sixteen seventeen year back be forgotten now having held for so long period bitterly felt loss resolved that must ill become a man attorney to allow so deep injury to pas unnoticed may be moreover mr dockwrath be now doing somewhat better in world than formerly that must afford to give up lady mason to demand also that wife must give up trumpery present from orley farm be very well while be struggling for bare bread now now that have turned corner now that by divine art mystery of law have managed to become master of beautiful result of british perseverance balance at banker must afford to indulge natural antipathy to lady who have endeavoured in early life to divert from little fortune have started in world miriam dockwrath a sat on morning listening to husband anger with sick little girl on knee four five others clustering round half covered with matutinal bread milk be mild eyed soft a ever hers be nature in softness must ever prevail softness that tenderness of heart always leaning sometimes almost crouching of mild eye be outward sign comeliness prettiness be gone female beauty of sterner grander sort may support burden of sixteen child living still survive have known to do so to survive with much of youthful glory that mild eyed soft round plumpy prettiness give way beneath weight a year alone tell on quickly child limited mean combined with year leave to hardly chance be sure be very sorry said poor woman worn with many care sorry yes will make sorry proud minx there be old saying that who live in glass house must throw stone samuel think mean to be doing harm know always did say bessy how can put finger into basin in way sam have taken spoon away mamma will let know whether be doing harm what signifies what be said sixteen year ago have anything to show in writing a far a know nothing of kind be said oh remember samuel do indeed let tell then that have better not try to remember anything about if ai quiet bob will make pretty quick d 'ye hear that fact be memory be not worth curse where be to get milk for child do think when field be gone be sure be very sorry samuel sorry yes somebody else will be sorry too look here miriam wo have going up to orley farm on pretence do hear that then having given that imperative command to wife slave lord master of establishment walked forth into office on whole miriam usbech might have done better have followed advice of patroness in early life married stupid clerk chapter ii lady mason son trust that be already perceived by persistent novel reader very much of interest of tale will be centred in person of lady mason such educated person however will probably be aware that be not intended to be heroine heroine so called must by certain fixed law be young marriageable such heroine in future number will be forthcoming with a much of heroic about a may be found convenient for present let be understood that person character of lady mason be a important to a can be of young lady let be ever so gracious ever so beautiful in giving detail of history know that need go back beyond grandfather grandmother who be thoroughly respectable people in hardware line speak of relative by father side own parent have risen in world have risen from retail to wholesale considered for long period of year to be good representative of commercial energy prosperity of great britain fall have come upon a fall doe come very often to excellent commercial representative mr johnson be in gazette must be long to tell how old sir joseph mason be concerned in affair how acted a principal assignee how ultimately took to bosom a portion of asset of estate young mary johnson made wife mistress of orley farm of family of johnson there be three others father mother brother father did not survive disgrace of bankruptcy mother in process of time settled with son in one of lancashire manufacturing town where john johnson raised head in business to moderate altitude sir joseph having afforded much valuable assistance there for present will leave think that sir joseph ever repented of perilous deed did in marrying that young wife home for many year have be desolate solitary child have gone from did not come to visit very frequently in poor home at farm have become grander people than have be gifted with aspiring mind in turn twist took looked to do something towards washing clean from dirt of counting house be specially case with sir joseph son to whom father have made over land money sufficient to enable to come before world a country gentleman with coat of arm on coach panel must be inconvenient for to run off to groby park at present moment will therefore say more just now a to joseph junior will explain that joseph senior be not made angry by neglect be grave quiet rational man not however devoid of folly a indeed what rational man be so devoid be burdened with ambition to establish family a result of success in life having put forth son into world with view be content that son must act upon persistently joseph mason esq of groby park in yorkshire be now county magistrate have made way towards footing in county society around with hope ambition such a be probably not expedient that must spend much of time at orley farm three daughter be circumstanced much in same way have married gentleman be bent on rising in world moreover steadfast resolution of purpose characterised father be known by by husband have received fortune with settled contingency to be forthcoming on father demise why then trouble old gentleman at orley farm under such circumstance old gentleman married young wife to great disgust of four child of course declared to other corresponding among by letter that old gentleman have positively disgraced be impossible that must make visit to orley farm while mistress of house be there daughter did make such visit joseph son whose monetary connection with father be a yet by mean fixed settled in nature did make one such visit then received father assurance so at least afterwards said swore that marriage must by mean interfere with expected inheritance of orley farm acre at time young son have be born probably be such young son expected farm house became much brighter abode for old man for few year be left to after have brought young wife home be quiet sensible clever unremitting in attention burthened with request for gay society took home a found making best of for making for much better than have ever hitherto known own child have always looked down upon regarding merely a coffer from whence money might be have though have never resented contempt have in certain measure be aware of there be such feeling shown by wife took benefit gave graciously thankfully gave back to in return certainly care time apparently love for herself in way of wealth money never asked for anything then baby have come young lucius mason there be of course great joy at orley farm old father felt that world have begun again for very delightfully be more than ever satisfied with wisdom in regard to marriage very genteel progeny of early youth be more than ever dissatisfied in letter among dealt forth harder still harder word upon poor sir joseph what terrible thing might not be expected to do now that dotage be coming on three married lady have selfish fear so at least declared united in imploring brother to look after interest at orley farm how dreadfully must young heir of groby be curtailed in dignity seignories if must be found at last day that orley farm be not to be written in rent roll then while be yet bethinking how might best bestir news arrived that sir joseph have suddenly died sir joseph be dead will when read contained codicil by that young brat be made heir to orley farm estate have said that lady mason during married life have never asked of husband anything for herself in law proceeding be consequent upon sir joseph death became abundantly evident that have asked for much for son that have be specific in request urging to make second heir to settle orley farm upon own boy lucius stated that have never done except in presence of third person have often done so in presence of mr usbech attorney a to mr usbech be not alive to testify have also done so more than once in presence of mr furnival barrister a to mr furnival being alive did testify very strongly a to contest nothing further need now be said resulted in favour of young lucius mason therefore also in favour of widow in favour moreover of miriam usbech thus ultimately in favour of mr samuel dockwrath who be now showing to be so signally ungrateful joseph mason however retired from battle nothing convinced father said have be old fool as idiot vulgar ignorant fool be not man to break word that signature to codicil might be might not if have be obtained by fraud what must be easier than to cheat old doting fool many men agreed with joseph mason thinking usbech attorney have perpetrated villainy on behalf of daughter joseph mason must believe say that believed belief in none sister joined that lady mason have be villain be minded to press case on to court of appeal up even to house of lord be advised that in doing so must spend more money than orley farm be worth that must almost to certainty spend in vain under advice cursed law of country withdrew to groby park lady mason have earned respect of around by way in bore in painful day of trial also in of success especially also by manner in gave evidence thus though have not be much noticed by neighbour during short period of married life be visited a widow by many of more respectable people round hamworth in showed feeling of triumph never abused husband relative spoke much of harsh manner in have be used indeed be not given to talk about own personal affair although a have said many of neighbour visited did not lay out for society accepted returned attention for most part seemed to be willing that matter must so rest people around by degree came to know way spoke to when met occasionally went through ceremony of morning call did not ask to tea party did not expect to see at picnic archery meeting among who took by hand in time of great trouble be sir peregrine orme of cleeve for such be name have belonged time out of mind to old mansion park sir peregrine be gentleman now over seventy year of age whose family consisted of widow of only son only son of widow who be of course heir to estate title sir peregrine be excellent old man a trust may hereafter be acknowledged regard for lady mason be perhaps in first instance fostered by extreme dislike to stepson joseph mason of groby mr joseph mason of groby be quite a rich man a sir peregrine owned estate be nearly a large a cleeve property sir peregrine must not allow that be gentleman that must by possible transformation become one have not probably ever said so in direct word to of mason family opinion on matter have in way worked way down to yorkshire therefore there be love to spare between two county magistrate there have be slight acquaintance between sir peregrine sir joseph lady of two family have never met till after death of latter then while trial be still pending mr orme have come forward at instigation of father in law by degree there have grown up intimacy between two widow when first offer of assistance be made accepted sir peregrine doubt did not at dream of such result a family pride especially pride took in widowed daughter in law must probably have be shocked by such surmise nevertheless have seen friendship grow increase without alarm have become attached to lady mason have gradually learned to excuse in want of gentle blood early breeding a rule regarded a necessary to gentleman from alone a thought must spring many of excellence go to form character of lady may therefore be asserted that lady mason widowed life be successful that be prudent well conducted one must doubt neighbour of course did say of that must not drink tea with mr arkwright of mount pleasant villa because be allowed privilege of entering sir peregrine drawing room such little scandal a be matter of course let one live according to possible impossible rule yet offence will be given in quarter who knew anything of lady mason private life be aware that did not encroach on sir peregrine hospitality be not at cleeve a much a circumstance must have justified at one time by mean so much a mr orme must have desired in person be tall comely when sir joseph have brought to house have be very fair tall slight fair very quiet not possessing that loveliness be generally most attractive to men because beauty of might boast depended on form rather than on brightness of eye softness of cheek lip face too even at age seldom betrayed emotion never showed sign of anger of joy forehead be high though somewhat narrow nevertheless gave evidence of considerable mental faculty be evidence false for who came to know lady mason well be always ready to acknowledge that be woman of ordinary power eye be large well formed somewhat cold nose be long regular mouth also be very regular teeth perfectly beautiful lip be straight thin must sometimes seem that be teeth yet be certain that never made effort to show great fault of face be in chin be too small sharp thus giving on occasion something of meanness to countenance be now forty seven year of age have son who have reached man estate yet perhaps have more of woman beauty at present time than when stood at altar with sir joseph mason quietness repose of manner suited year position age have given fulness to tall form habitual sadness of countenance be in fair accordance with condition character yet be not really sad at least so said who knew melancholy be in face rather than in character be full of energy if energy may be quiet a well a assured constant of course have be accused dozen time of matrimonial prospect what handsome widow be not so accused world of hamworth have be very certain at one time that be intent on marrying sir peregrine orme have not married think may say on behalf that have never thought of marrying indeed one can not see how such woman must make effort in line be impossible to conceive that lady so staid in manner must be guilty of flirting be there man within ten mile of hamworth who must have dared to make attempt woman for most part be prone to love making a nature have intended that must be there be woman from whom such folly seem to be a distant a skittle beer be distant from dignity of lord chancellor woman be lady mason at time time be about to exist for a period at narrative will begin lucius mason be over twenty two year old be living at farm have spent last three four year of life in germany where mother have visited year have now come home intending to be master of own destiny mother care for during boyhood up to time at became of age have be almost elaborate in thoughtfulness have consulted sir peregrine a to school sir peregrine looking to fact of lad own property also to fact known by of lady mason mean for purpose have recommended harrow mother have hesitated have gently discussed matter have at last persuaded baronet that step must be injudicious boy be sent to private school of high character sir peregrine be sure that have be so sent at own advice looking at peculiar position of mother said sir peregrine to young daughter in law at very peculiar position that of relative think will be better that must not appear to assume anything early in life nothing can be better conducted than mr crabfield establishment after much consideration have have hesitation in recommending to send son to thus lucius mason have be sent to mr crabfield think that idea originated with sir peregrine perhaps will be a well added baronet that perry must not be together at school though have objection to meeting in holiday mr crabfield vacation be always timed to suit harrow holiday perry here mentioned be grandson of sir peregrine young peregrine who in coming day be to be future lord of cleeve when lucius mason be modestly sent to mr crabfield establishment at great marlow young peregrine orme with prouder hope commenced career at public school mr crabfield did duty by lucius mason sent home at handsome well mannered lad tall comely to eye with soft brown whisker sprouting on cheek well grounded in greek latin euclid grounded also in french italian possessing many more acquirement than must have learned at harrow added to rather consequent on be conceit public school education must not have created when mother compared in holiday not openly with outspoken word silently in heart lucius mason be found by to be superior in manner knowledge acknowledged also that there be more of ingenuous boyhood about peregrine orme peregrine orme be year younger therefore comparative deficiency be not cause of intense sorrow at cleeve grandfather must probably have be better satisfied perhaps also so must mother have be le addicted to catching of rat better inclined towards miss edgeworth novel shakespeare play be earnestly recommended to by lady gentleman boy generally be fond of rat very frequently be not fond of reading therefore having be duly considered there be not much deep sorrow in day at cleeve a to boyhood of heir there be great pride at orley farm although pride be shown openly to one lady mason in visit at cleeve said little a to son present excellence a to future career in life did say much to sir peregrine to mr orme asking council of one expressing fear to other then sir peregrine having given consent sent lad to germany be allowed to come of age without special sign of manhood aught of glory of property although in case that coming of age did put into absolute possession of inheritance on day have be so minded must have turned mother out of farm house taken exclusive possession of estate did in fact remain in germany for year beyond period returned to orley farm only in time to be present at celebration of twenty first birthday of friend peregrine orme ceremony a may be surmised be by mean slurred over without due rejoicing heir at time be at christchurch at such period slight interruption to study be not to be lamented there have be sir peregrine ormes in part ever since day of james indeed in day long antecedent to there have be knight bearing that name of whom have be honourably beheaded for treason others imprisoned for heresy one made away with on account of supposed royal amour to great glorification of descendant looking to antecedent of family be only proper that coming of age of heir must be duly celebrated lucius mason have have antecedent great great grandfather of have knelt at foot of improper princess therefore lady mason though have be at cleeve have not mentioned fact that on very day son have become man when peregrine orme became man though still in manhood too much devoted to rat gloried greatly in quiet way whispered hope into baronet ear that young heir must not imitate ambition of ancestor by jove must not do now at said sir peregrine by mean displeased at allusion then question a to future life of lucius mason became one of great importance be necessary to consult not only sir peregrine orme young man mother have suggested to first law great mr furnival formerly of home circuit now practising only in london be very special friend must give son possible aid in direction what living man must give better aid than great mr furnival lucius mason must have none of law resolve pronounced very clearly while yet in germany whither mother visited bearing with long letter written by great mr furnival nevertheless young mason must have none of law have idea said that lawyer be liar whereupon mother rebuked for conceited ignorance want of charity did not gain point have however string to bow a objected to be lawyer might become civil engineer circumstance have made sir peregrine orme very intimate with great mr brown indeed mr brown be under great obligation to sir peregrine sir peregrine have promised to use influence lucius mason said that civil engineer be only tradesman of upper class tradesman with intellect said wished to use intellect did not choose to be tradesman mother rebuked again a well deserved that must then asked of what profession have thought philology said a profession perhaps literature will devote to philology race of man nothing considerable have be done with a combined pursuit with view returned home while peregrine orme at oxford be still addicted to hunting of rat with philology race of man consented to combine pursuit of agriculture when mother found that wished to take up abode in own house by mean opposed suggested that a such be intention must farm own land be very ready to do have not represented that step be in way impolitic must willingly have requested mr greenwood of old farm to look elsewhere have spread energy over whole domain a be contented with desiring that mr dockwrath must vacate small holding a be imperative a to that mother gave way without making cause of battle must willingly have left mr dockwrath in possession did say word two a to milk necessary for sixteen child lucius mason be ducal in idea intimated opinion that have right to do what liked with own have not mr dockwrath be told when field be surrendered to a favour that must only have in possession till heir must come of age mr dockwrath have be so told telling such a be easily forgotten by men with sixteen child thus mr mason became agriculturist with special scientific view a to chemistry philologist with object of making pursuit bear upon study with reference to race of man be convinced that by certain admixture of ammonia earth must produce cereal result hitherto unknown to farming world that by tracing out root of word must trace also wandering of man since expulsion of adam from garden a to latter question mother be not inclined to contradict seeing that must sit at foot of mr furnival of mr brown have objection to race of man must endure to be talked to about oceanic mongolidae iapetidae of indo germanic class have perhaps own idea that such matter though somewhat foggy be better than rat when came to other subject informed that properly plentiful feeding of world be only kept waiting for chemist certainly did have fear chemical agriculture be expensive though result may possibly be remunerative still while be thus kept waiting by backwardness of chemist there must be much risk in making serious expenditure with such view mother said when have now be at home about three month when fiat for expulsion of samuel dockwrath have already gone forth will go to liverpool to morrow to liverpool lucius yes that guano got from walker be adulterated have analyzed find that doe not contain above thirty two half hundredth of of ought to hold in proportion of seventy five per cent of whole doe not be impossible to obtain result while one be working with such fictitious material look at bit of grass at bottom of greenwood hill fifteen acre field why lucius always have heaviest crop of hay in parish off meadow be very well mother have never tried nobody about here ever have tried what land can really produce will throw three field beyond into one will get greenwood to let have bit of hill side giving compensation of course then dockwrath must want compensation dockwrath be impertinent rascal will take opportunity of telling so a be saying will throw seventy acre together then will try what will be relative effect of guano patent blood must have real guano so will go to liverpool think must wait little lucius be almost too late for change of kind year wait yes what have come of waiting wait at in doubling population thirty three year when come to feeding of be always for waiting be that waiting have reduced intellectual development of one half of human race to present terribly low state rather prevented rising in degree proportionate to increase of population more waiting for mother if can help lucius must not such new attempt a be made by men with large capital said mother capital be bugbear said son speaking on matter quite ex cathedra a doubt be entitled to do by extensive reading at german university capital be bugbear capital be really wanting be thought mind combination knowledge lucius yes know what be going to say mother boast that posse thing do say will endeavour to obtain have doubt will must not that come first be waiting again know a much a good manure will give good crop if sun be allowed full play upon land nothing crop be allowed to grow be what will attempt at first there can be great danger in so went to liverpool lady mason during absence began to regret that have not left in undisturbed inexpensive possession of mongolidae iapetidae rent from estate including that must have paid a tenant of smaller farm must have enabled to live with comfort if such have be taste might have become philosophical student lived respectably without adding anything to income by sweat of brow now matter be likely to become serious enough for gentleman farmer determined to wait no longer for chemist might be result immediate profitable return per acre must not be expected a one of rent from smaller farm must now be out of question must be well if payment made so punctually by old mr

impose trouble on lady when alternative of taking trouble on be given to moreover liked to have object for daily ride liked to be consulted on certain matter especially liked being so consulted by lady mason so sent word back that must be at farm at twelve on following day exactly at hour gray pony cob might have be seen slowly walking up avenue to farm house cleeve be not distant from orley farm more than two mile by nearest walking path although must not be driven much under five with sort of carriage one be obliged to come from cleeve house down to lodge on hamworth alston road then to drive through town of hamworth so back to farm in walking one must take path along river for nearly mile thence rise up hill to top of crutchley wood descend through wood to crutchley bottom passing along valley come out at foot of cleeve hill just opposite to orley farm gate distance for horseman be somewhat greater seeing that there be not a yet bridle way through crutchley wood under circumstance journey between two house be very frequently made on foot for walking from cleeve house to hamworth nearest way be by lady mason gate lady mason drawing room be very pretty though be by mean fashionably furnished indeed eschewed fashion in thing made pretence of coming out before world a great lady have never kept kind of carriage though mean combined with son income must certainly have justified in pony chaise since lucius have become master of house have presented with such vehicle also with pony harness complete a yet have never used being afraid a said to with smile of appearing ambitious before stern citizen of hamworth nonsense mother have replied with considerable amount of young dignity in face be entitled to comfort for can afford to pay without injury to one will take ill of if see using oh sir peregrine be so kind of said lady mason coming forward to meet friend be plainly dressed without full exuberance of costume yet everything about be neat pretty everything have be object of feminine care very plain dress may occasion a much study a most elaborate may be quite a worthy of study have caused lady mason be inclined to think be by mean indifferent to subject then to belonged great art of hiding artifice not at not at said sir peregrine taking hand pressing a always did what be use of neighbour if be not neighbourly be very well from sir peregrine in existing case be not man who by mean recognised necessity of being civil to who lived near to great to poor be neighbourly may be doubted whether must have thought much of lady mason if have be le good looking le clever ah know how good always be to will tell why be troubling now lucius went off two day since to liverpool grandson told that have left home be excellent young man be sure have reason to be thankful sir peregrine remembering affair in cowcross street certain other affair of somewhat similar nature thought that have for that must not have exchanged own bright eyed lad for lucius mason with virtue learning indeed be thankful continued widow nothing can be better than conduct mode of life hope have attraction at liverpool of disapprove there be nothing of kind attraction be perhaps have better explain whole matter lucius know have taken to farming have taken up land held have not yes little more be anxious to add even to that be very energetic about sir peregrine well life of gentleman farmer be not bad one though in special circumstance must certainly have recommended profession acting upon advice did urge to go to bar have will of own mind altogether made up a to line of life think will suit best what fear now be that will spend more money upon experiment than can afford experimental farming be expensive amusement said sir peregrine with very serious shake of head be afraid be now have gone to liverpool to buy guano said widow feeling little shame in coming to so inconsiderable conclusion after somewhat stately prologue to buy guano why must not get guano from walker a man symonds doe say be not good analyzed fiddlestick why did order in london if did like walker gone to liverpool for guano will tell what be lady mason if intends to farm land in way must have very considerable capital at back will be long time before see money again sir peregrine have be farming life have own idea on subject knew very well that gentleman let set to work a might with own land must do a well with a farmer who must make living out of farming besides paying rent who must do else have living knew also that such operation a young friend be now about to attempt be amusement fitted only for rich may be also that be little old fashioned therefore prejudiced against new combination between agriculture chemistry must put stop to kind of work very soon lady mason must indeed will bring to ruin with lady mason face became very grave serious what can say to sir peregrine in such matter a be afraid that must not mind if must not object to speaking to sir peregrine be graciously pleased to say that must not object be disagreeable task said that of giving advice to young man who be bound by tie either to take even to receive with respect will not find at disrespectful think can promise said frightened mother that matter be ended by promise on part of baronet to take case in hand to see lucius immediately on return from liverpool have better come dine at cleeve said sir peregrine will have out after dinner of made lady mason very grateful chapter v sir peregrine make second promise left lady mason very grateful at end of last chapter for promise made to by sir peregrine with reference to son there be still weight on lady mason mind say that pith of lady letter be in postscript may be that remained for lady mason to say be after matter a to be most anxious for assistance a be here said to baronet must let mention subject surely said again putting down hat riding stick sir peregrine be not given to close observation of around might have seen by heightened colour of lady face by slight nervous hesitation with began to speak that be much in earnest a to other matter have be clever in power of observation might have seen also that be anxious to hide feeling remember circumstance of terrible lawsuit said at last what a to sir joseph will yes remember well know that will never forget kindness that showed said know how must have lived through without dear mr orme what about now fear be going to have further trouble do mean that man at groby park be going to try case again be not possible after such lapse of time be lawyer think that can do know know what intends whether intends anything be sure of that will give trouble if can will tell whole story sir peregrine be not much perhaps after may not be worth attention know attorney in hamworth who married miriam usbech what samuel dockwrath oh yes know well enough to tell truth think very well of be not tenant of yours not at present then lady mason explained manner in two field have be taken out of lawyer hand by son order ah be wrong there said baronet when man have held land so long must not be taken away from except under pressing circumstance be if pay rent mr dockwrath did pay rent certainly now fear be determined to do can to injure what injury can mr dockwrath do know have gone down to yorkshire to mr mason place know be searching through paper of old mr usbech before went indeed may say know a fact that have gone to mr mason with hope that law proceeding may be brought on again know a fact think may say so dear lady mason may ask how know a fact wife be with yesterday said with feeling of shame a disclosed source from whence have obtained information did tell tale against own husband not a meaning to say anything against sir peregrine must not think so badly of a must think must willingly obtain information in manner must understand have always be friend when found that mr dockwrath have left home on matter in be so nearly concerned can not think natural that must let know to sir peregrine made direct answer must not quite say that thought be natural must give expressed approval of such intercourse between lady mason attorney wife thought must be better mr dockwrath must be allowed to do worst if have intention of doing evil lady mason must pas by without condescending to notice circumstance made allowance for weakness did not give utterance to disapproval in word know think have done wrong then said appealing to there be tone of sorrow in voice went to heart not wrong can not say that have done wrong may be question whether have done wisely ah if only condemn folly will not despair be probable may not have done wisely seeing have not to direct what will do now oh sir peregrine say that will not desert if trouble be coming on again will not desert lady mason may be sure of dearest friend must advise to take notice whatever of mr dockwrath proceeding regard a person entirely beneath notice if be must not move at in matter unless received legal summons made necessary for to do so have not honour of personal acquaintance with mr mason of groby park be in way that sir peregrine always designated friend stepson if understand motif by may probably be actuated in in other matter think likely that will expend money on so very unpromising case must do anything for vengeance doubt if must throw away money even for unless be very sure of prey in matter what can possibly do have decision of jury against at time be afraid to carry case up to court of appeal sir peregrine be impossible to know what document may have obtained since what document can do harm unless indeed there must turn out to be will subsequent to under son inherits property oh there be subsequent will of course there be not therefore need not frighten be just possible that attempt may be made now that son be of age regard even that a improbable must not advise then to say anything to mr furnival certainly not unless receive legal notice may make necessary for to consult lawyer hing if mr dockwrath come to again tell that be not disposed to take notice of information mr dockwrath be be sure very good sort of woman indeed have always heard so if be think must feel inclined to have much conversation with about private affair what tell tell also to husband then baronet having thus spoken word of wisdom sat silent in arm chair lady mason still looking into face remained silent also for few minute be so glad asked to come then said be delighted if have be of service to of service oh sir peregrine can not understand what be to live alone a do for of course can not trouble lucius with matter can man gifted a be comprehend how woman can tremble at very idea that law proceeding may possibly be repeated sir peregrine must not remember a looked at that during law proceeding when attack be made not only on income on honesty have never seemed to tremble have always be constant to herself even when thing appeared to be going against year passing over head since time have perhaps told upon courage will fear nothing now a have promised that will still be friend may be very sure of lady mason believe may fairly boast that easily abandon whom have once regarded with esteem affection among whom lady mason will be sure allow to say that be reckoned a by mean least then taking hand old gentleman bowed over kissed dearest dearest friend said lifting sir peregrine beautifully white hand to lip also kissed that will be remembered that gentleman be over seventy that pretty scene must therefore be enacted without impropriety on side sir peregrine then went a passed out of door lady mason smiled on very sweetly be quite true that be over seventy nevertheless smile of pretty woman still have charm for more especially if there be tear in eye while for sir peregrine orme have soft heart a soon a door be closed behind lady mason seated in accustomed chair trace of smile vanished from face be alone now must allow countenance to be true index of mind if such be case heart surely be very sad sat there perfectly still for nearly hour during whole of time there be same look of agony on brow once twice rubbed hand across forehead brushing back hair showing have there be one by to see that there be many gray lock there mixed with brown hair have there be one by must may be surmised have be more careful there be smile in face now be there tear in eye one other emblem be equally alien to present mood there be sorrow at heart deep thought in mind knew that enemy be conspiring against against against son what step might best take in order that might baffle illustration there be sorrow in heart deep thought in mind have got that woman on hip now be word mr dockwrath have uttered into wife ear after two day spent in searching through father paper poor woman have once thought of burning paper in old day before have become mr dockwrath friend lady mason have counselled to do so pointing out to that be troublesome must by possibility lead to profit have consulted lover have counselled to burn nothing must that have be guided by friend now said to herself with regard to old trunk perhaps occasionally with regard to other thing have got that woman on hip at last there have be gleam of satisfaction in samuel eye a uttered word have convinced wife that be not idle threat knew nothing of what box have contained now even if have not be kept safe from under samuel private key content be of interest have of course gone have business in north will be away for about week mr dockwrath have said to on following morning oh very well then will put up thing have answered in usual mild sad whining household voice voice at home be always sad whining for be overworked have too many care lord be tyrant to rather than husband yes must see mr mason immediately look here miriam positively insist that go to orley farm hold intercourse whatever with lady mason d 'ye hear mr dockwrath said that did hear promised obedience mr dockwrath probably guessed that moment back be turned must be told at farm probably also have real objection to doing so have in truth wished to keep proceeding secret from lady mason must not have divulged to wife then mr dockwrath did start for north bearing certain document with soon after departure mr dockwrath did pay visit to orley farm lady mason sat there perfectly still for about hour thinking what must do have asked sir peregrine have advantage of advice did not weigh much with what wanted from sir peregrine be countenance absolute assistance in day of trouble not advice have desired to renew interest in favour to receive from assurance that must not desert that have obtained be of course also necessary that must consult in turning over within own mind line of conduct did not consciously attach weight to sir peregrine opinion great question for to decide be must put case into hand of friend mr furnival now at once must wait till have received certain symptom of hostile proceeding if did see mr furnival what must tell only that mr dockwrath have found document among paper of old mr usbech

also nevertheless although be possessed of charm might look at for ten day together on eleventh must not know if met in street appearance of mr mason be not forte have be beauty if have be lot to be known in history be not a beauty that must have be famous parsimony be great virtue power of saving strong point have said that spent much money in dress people will perhaps think that two point of character be not compatible such people know nothing of true spirit of parsimony be from back belly of other people that saving be made with greatest constancy most satisfactory result parsimony of mistress of household be best displayed on matter eatable on matter eatable drinkable for there be fine scope for domestic saving in tea beer milk in such matter chiefly did mr mason operate going a far a dared towards starving even husband nevertheless must feed in middle of day having roast fowl with bread sauce in own room miser who starves dy without ounce of flesh on bone while skinny head lie on bag of gold be after respectable there have be grand passion in life that grandest work of man denial can not altogether despise one who have clothed with rag fed with bone scraping while ortolan be within easy reach there be woman wife mother of family who must give bone scraping to husband bone to servant while hide ortolan for must dress child in rag while cram chest drawer box with silk satin for own back woman one can thoroughly despise even hate woman be mr mason of groby park will not trouble reader at present with much description of young mason eldest son be in army younger at cambridge spending much more money than father allowed not that in respect be specially close fisted ascertained what be sufficient amply sufficient a be told by colonel of regiment tutor of college amount allowed assuring joseph john that if spent more must have to pay for out of money must enrich in future year how must son of such mother be other than spendthrift of course be extravagant of course spent more than must have done father resolved that must keep word with religiously daughter be much le fortunate having possible mean of extravagance allowed to father mother decided that must go out into county society therefore clothing be not absolutely of rag young lady who doe go into society whether be of county town will fully understand difference between liberal stingy wardrobe girl with slender provision of millinery may be fit to go out quite fit in father eye yet such going out may be matter of intense pain be very well for world to say that girl must be happy without reference to clothes show such girl will show one whom must be very sorry that boy of mine must choose a sweetheart three miss mason a always be called by groby park people have be christened diana creusa penelope mother having passion for classic literature indulged by use of lempriere dictionary be not especially pretty be especially plain be well grown healthy quite capable of enjoying in of amusement customary to young lady if only opportunity be afforded mr dockwrath have thought well to write to mr mason acquainting that gentleman with intended visit mr mason said to must recognise name know whence came under such circumstance must be sure to see although express purpose of proposed interview must not have be explained to such in result be exactly case mr mason did remember name of dockwrath though have never hitherto seen bearer of a letter be dated from hamworth felt sufficient interest in matter to await at home coming of visitor know name mr mason sir have known long said mr dockwrath seating in chair be offered to in magistrate study though never have pleasure of seeing before to knowledge name be dockwrath sir be solicitor live at hamworth married daughter of old mr usbech sir whom will remember mr mason listened attentively a detail be uttered before so clearly said nothing merely bowing head at separate statement knew about old usbech daughter nearly a well a mr dockwrath did be man who knew how to be silent upon occasion be too young sir continued dockwrath when have that trial about orley farm to have anything to do with matter nevertheless remember circumstance a though be yesterday suppose sir remember also yes mr dockwrath remember very well well sir impression have always be that then attorney stopped be quite intention to speak out plainly before mr mason be anxious that gentleman must speak out too at rate might be well that must be induced to express little interest in matter impression say have always be said mr mason repeating word of companion looking a ponderous grave a ever countenance however expressed nothing usual ponderous solemnity impression always be that there be something have not be a yet found out what sort of thing mr dockwrath well secret think that lawyer managed matter well mr mason think must have done better mr dockwrath say that mr mason be only lad at time must not have managed at did ferret about enough mr mason there be deal better evidence than be given by word of mouth clever counsel can turn witness pretty nearly way like ca do with little fact have time see to get round lawyer sir did get up little fact a must have done have got up since mr dockwrath say that mr mason see interest lie in maintaining codicil wife fortune came to under deed to be sure be gone spent long since lord chancellor with judge must enforce restitution nevertheless must wish that one must have claim against on account perhaps will not object to say what be that do wish wish to see right done mr mason be think that lady mason son have right to possession of place think that codicil be correct instrument in case of mason versus mason think that friend got to bottom of then mr dockwrath leaned back in chair with inward determination to say nothing more until mr mason must make sign that gentleman however still remained ponderous heavy therefore there be short period of silence have got to bottom of since mr dockwrath at last said say have said attorney might ask then what be propose to effect by visit with have honoured of course be aware that be very private matter although must feel under obligation to to man who might assist to arrive at true fact have hitherto be concealed be not disposed to discus affair with stranger on ground of mere suspicion must have come here mr mason at very great expense personal inconvenience to myself in profession if have not good reason for doing so think that ever got to bottom of matter ca say have done so now have even tried tell what mr mason if wish think must put in way of trying lawyer be messrs round crook of bedford row will not be better that must go to mr dockwrath mr mason think will be better must go to know round crook well mean to say word against if go farther into affair must do with principal be not going to cut own throat for sake of mending man little finger have family of sixteen child mr mason have to look about very sharp very sharp indeed then there be pause mr dockwrath began to perceive mr mason be not by nature open demonstrative communicative man if anything further be to be done must open out little fact be mr mason have come across document must have have at trial round crook ought to have have only be half sharp why sir mr usbech have be father man of business for year upon year yet did half go through paper turned over looked at never thought of seeing what little fact might be proved document be with now here mr mason be not so soft a never carry about original document unless when ordered to prove copy of one two item have made not regular copy mr mason just line two to refresh memory mr dockwrath took small letter case out of breast coat pocket by time mr mason curiosity have be roused began to think possible that visitor have discovered information might be of importance to be going to show document said be a may be said attorney know a yet whether care to see have come long way to do service seems to be rather shy of coming forward to meet a said before have very heavy family be not going to cut nose off own face to put money into other man pocket what do think journey down here will cost including loss of time interruption to business look here mr dockwrath if be really able to put into possession of fact regarding orley farm estate ought to know will see that be compensated for time trouble messrs round crook will have nothing to do with round crook so that be settled mr mason then mr dockwrath half minute mr mason will have nothing to do with round crook a know to be gentleman man of honour will put in possession of what have discovered leave to afterwards to do what think right about expense time service wo forget that be long way from hamworth to groby park if must succeed if be to look at document must do so without pledging to anything said mr mason still with much solemnity have great doubt a to new acquaintance much feared that be derogating from dignity a county magistrate owner of groby park in holding personal intercourse with nevertheless must not resist temptation most firmly believed that codicil have not expressed genuine last will fair disposition of property made by father might certainly be case that proof of that believed be to be found among paper of old lawyer hated lady mason with power of hatred if there did even yet exist for chance of upsetting claim ruining before world be not man to forego chance well sir will see said mr dockwrath rather hear for there be not much to see so saying extracted from pocket book very small bit of paper must prefer to read if be same to mr dockwrath will understand much better in way a like mr mason said attorney handing small bit of paper will understand sir that be real copy only few date particular just jotted down to assist own memory document supported by mr dockwrath have come down to yorkshire consisted of sheet of note paper writing upon covered hardly half of word mr mason read be a follows date of codicil th july witness to instrument john kenneby bridget bolster jonathan usbech nb jonathan usbech died before testator mason martock deed of separation dated th july executed at orley farm witness john kenneby bridget bolster deed be prepared in office of jonathan usbech probably executed in presence be be written on paper mr mason read word to three time before looked up said anything concerning be not man quick at receiving new idea into mind of understanding new point have once become intelligible to be made own remained so always well said when read above word for third time see sir said mr dockwrath see what said mr mason still looking at scrap of paper why date to begin with see that date be same th of july in same year well said mr dockwrath looking very keenly into magistrate face well said mr mason looking over paper at boot john kenneby bridget bolster be witness to instrument said attorney so see said magistrate remember that came out in evidence that of recollected having be called on for two signature on same day there be nothing of came out be even hinted at nothing even hinted at mr mason a justly observe be what mean by saying that round crook people did get up little fact believe sir there be men in profession out of london who know quite a much a round crook ought to have have fact seeing that very copy of document be turned over by hand mr dockwrath hit table heavily in warmth of indignation against professional brother earlier in interview mr mason must have be made very angry by such freedom be not angry now yes ought to have known said did not even yet see point merely saw that there be point worth seeing known of course ought to have known look here mr mason if have on mind that 'd thrown over client of mine by such carelessness a 'd 'd strike own name off roll must indeed never must look counsel in face again if 'd neglected to brief with such fact a suppose be carelessness eh mr mason oh yes be afraid so said mr mason still rather in dark must have have object in keeping back must say none in life let see mr dockwrath how doe bear upon date be same witness same deed of separation be genuine there be doubt about oh be sure of quite certain found entered in old office book be last of lot of such document executed between mason martock after old man gave up business see be always with knew about about partnership deed of course did be clever woman mr mason very clever be almost pity that must come to grief have carried on so well have mr mason face now became very black why said if what seem to allege be true must be do mean sir by pity mr dockwrath shrugged shoulder be very blue said uncommon blue must be swindler common swindler nay worse than oh yes deal worse than mr mason a for common according to way of thinking there be nothing at common about look upon a about best got up plant ever remember to have heard of do indeed mr mason attorney during last ten minute of conversation have quite altered tone understanding that have already achieved great part of object mr mason in intense anxiety did not observe have mr dockwrath in commencing conversation talked about plant blue mr mason must probably have rung bell for servant if be anything be forgery said mr dockwrath looking companion full in face always felt sure that father never intended to sign codicil a that never did sign mr mason witness said mr mason still not enlightened a to true extent of attorney suspicion signed other deed be two of did there be doubt about on very day certainly did witness signature made by old gentleman in own room on th of july original of document with date name will be forthcoming soon enough well said mr mason did not witness two signature think not eh be sure of girl bolster must have remembered must have said so be sharp enough who wrote name then at foot of will said mr mason ah be question who did write know very well mr mason be who did not having come to think may give very good guess who did then sat silent for three four minute mr dockwrath be quite at ease rubbing chin with hand playing with paper knife have taken from study table waiting till must please mr mason to renew conversation mr mason be not at ease though idea of affecting reserve before attorney have left be thinking how best might confound destroy woman who have robbed for so many year who have defied got better of put to terrible cost who have vexed spirit through whole life deprived of content have be to a thorn ever present in festering sore have always believed that have defrauded belief have be qualified by unbelief of others might have be have half thought that old man have signed codicil in dotage having be cheated bullied into by woman there have be day in life on must not have ruined have be in power to do so now now new grander idea be breaking in upon mind must be possible that might live to see not merely deprived of ill gained money standing in dock a felon to receive sentence for terrible misdeed if might be so must not receive great compensation for that have suffered must not be sweet to sense of justice that of must thus at last have own did not even yet understand mr dockwrath suspected did not fully perceive why woman be supposed to have chosen a date of forgery date of other genuine deed did understand did perceive at least so thought that new perhaps conclusive evidence of villainy be at last within reach what will do now mr dockwrath said at last well be to understand that do honour of asking advice

mr furnival may say must not have be there to meet of fact lady mason be perhaps aware be so grateful to for trouble said a raised veil while pressed hand between own can only ask to believe must not have troubled unless have be greatly troubled mr furnival a placed in arm chair by fireside declared sorrow that must be in grief then took other arm chair opposite to rather close to much closer to than ever now seated to mr f speak of trouble said be nothing if can do anything to relieve though be so tender did not omit to tell of folly in having informed son that be to be in london have seen

need really cause trouble again took hand that might encourage lady mason let keep hand for minute so a though did not notice yet a turned eye to might appear that tenderness have encouraged sitting there thus with hand in with hand in during first portion of tale told that wished to tell something more told now to than have done to sir peregrine learned from said speaking about mr dockwrath husband that have found out something about date lawyer did not find out before something about date said mr furnival looking with eye into fire know what about date only that said that lawyer in bedford row round crook yes said that be idiot not to have found out before then went off to groby park came back last night of course have not seen since by time mr furnival have dropped hand be sitting still meditating looking earnestly at fire while lady mason be looking earnestly at be trying to gather from face whether have seen sign of danger be trying to gather from word whether there might really be cause to apprehend danger how be to know what be really inside mind what be actual thought inward reasoning on subject what private knowledge might have be still kept back from in ordinary intercourse of world when one man seek advice from who be consulted demand in first place that will be put in possession of circumstance of case how else will be possible that must give advice in matter of law be different if having committed crime be to confess criminality to gentleman engaged to defend might not be called on to say then o friend confess also to judge so let justice be done ruat coelum rest of who must pay lawyer for counsel such a in case there be question of payment advice to be given be to widowed woman from experienced man of world nevertheless must only make calculation a to peculiar case in way in ordinarily calculated must be possible that anything have be kept back from be there fact unknown to known to must be terrible fatal damning to sweet friend if proved before world must not bring to ask yet be so material that must know twenty year ago at time of trial have at one time thought hardly matter to tell what thought have not be favourable to cause then mind have altered have learned a lawyer do learn to believe in own case when day of triumph have come have triumphed loudly commiserating dear friend for unjust suffering to have be subjected speaking in low modified tone a to grasping greedy cruelty of man of groby park nevertheless through have felt that round crook have not made most of case now sat thinking not so much whether have be in way guilty with reference to will a whether counsel must give ought in way to be based on possibility of having be thus guilty nothing might be so damning to cause a that must make sure of innocence if be not innocent yet must not ask question if innocent why be that be now so much moved after twenty year of quiet possession be pity said at last that lucius must have disturbed that fellow in possession of field be be said did not think possible that miriam husband must turn against must be wise do think to let have land again think that must be telling telling others also that be afraid of if have obtained information may be considered of value by joseph mason can sell at higher price than holding of field be worth must be well be asking question then checked must what be well be so harassed that hardly know what be saying must be wise do think if be to pay anything so a to keep quiet what buy off mean well yes if call so give sum of money in compensation for land on understanding know then paused that depends on what may have to sell said mr furnival hardly daring to look at ah yes said widow then there be pause think that must be at discreet said mr furnival after chance be that be moonshine think so yes can not think so what can man possibly have found among old attorney paper may be injurious to interest ah know understand so little of thing at time told told that law might possibly go against boy right must have be bad then must be ten time more dreadful now there be many question capable of doubt then be definitely settled at trial a to husband intellect on day for instance there must be no doubt a to so have be proved will not raise point again must have possibly have made later will be sure did not have done so must not have be found among mr usbech paper for a far a remember poor man never attended to business after day what day th of july day on be with sir joseph be singular thought barrister with how much precision remembered date circumstance that circumstance of trial must be fresh on memory be not wonderful how be that knew so accurately thing have occurred before trial when trial must have be expected a to said nothing be sure went to groby park oh yes have doubt of be quite sure know that can do anything wait have mentioned to sir peregrine immediately occurred to lady mason mind that must be by mean expedient even if be possible to keep mr furnival in ignorance of anything that really did therefore explained that have seen sir peregrine be so troubled at first moment hardly knew where to turn said be quite right to go to sir peregrine be so glad be not angry with a to did say anything anything particular promised that must not desert must there be new difficulty be well be always good to have countenance of such neighbour a be advice of such friend a be again put out hand to well yes be trade know to give advice smiled a took how must live through such trouble without lawyer be very much abused now day said mr furnival thinking of what be going on down at birmingham at very moment hardly know how world must get on without ah lawyer be not like perhaps worse great many much better a be saying think must take step at present man dockwrath be vulgar low minded revengeful fellow must endeavour to forget ah if must why not what can possibly have learned to injury then a seemed to lady mason that mr furnival expected reply to question forced to give one suppose that can not know anything tell might do said mr furnival who be still musing round be not bad fellow be acquainted with be junior partner in house at time of trial know that persuaded joseph mason not to appeal to lord will contrive if possible to see will be able to learn from at rate whether anything be being done then if hear that there be not will be comforted of course of course if there be think there will be nothing of sort said mr furnival leaving seat a spoke if there be will have aid slowly rose from chair a spoke mr furnival gave promise of a sir peregrine have done before then with handkerchief to eye thanked tear be not false a mr furnival well saw seeing that wept seeing that be beautiful feeling that in grief in beauty have come to for aid heart be softened towards put out arm a though must take to heart a daughter dearest friend said trust that harm will come to will trust said gently stopping motion of arm will trust altogether when have seen mr round will hear from at moment a be standing close together door opened mr crabwitz introduced lady who indeed have advanced so quickly towards

have immediately walked across passage towards husband room expressing knowledge that mr furnival be within mr crabwitz have will in world to stop progress found that lacked power to stay for moment advantage of matrimony be many great so many so great that men doubtless ought to marry even matrimony may have drawback among unconcealed undeserved jealousy on part of wife be perhaps a disagreeable a what be man to do when be accused before world before small fraction of world of making love to lady of acquaintance what be to say what way be to look love did never did must think of for world say with hand on heart there be mr jones appeal to be reduced to must innocent man be so reduced by wife of bosom be speaking of undeserved jealousy may therefore be thought that remark apply to mr furnival do apply to a much a to woman that general idea a to strange goddess be on part more than suspicion woman who so torment husband may plead a much a must for peculiar idea a to lady mason have ground whatever lady mason may have have fault propensity to rob mr furnival of husband affection have not hitherto be one of mr furnival be clever lawyer have great need of assistance therefore have come to chamber therefore have placed hand in mr furnival liked client because be good looking may be true like horse picture view from study window for same reason be inclined to think that there be nothing more in than dear said mr furnival stepping back little letting hand fall to side lady mason also took step backwards then with considerable presence of mind recovered put out hand to greet mr furnival how do do lady mason said mr furnival without presence of mind at hope have pleasure of seeing very well did hear that be to be in town shopping did not for moment expect gratification of finding here word that dear good heart sore woman spoke told tale of jealousy a plainly a though have flown at lady mason cap with bold demonstrative energy of spitalfields st giles came up on purpose to see mr furnival about unfortunate law business said lady mason oh indeed son lucius did say shopping illustration son lucius did say shopping yes told so when lady be unfortunate enough to be

husband stepped up to angry matron looking earnestly into face to true tale of woman sorrow mr furnival heart must be a snow under noonday sun have lady mason gone to told fear trouble sought counsel aid from appealed to motherly feeling mr furnival must have be urgent night day in persuading husband to take up widow case must have bade work very best without fee reward must herself have shown lady mason way to old square lincoln inn must have be discreet too speaking word of idle gossip to one when in happy day have told legal secret to have never gossiped have never spoken idle word concerning must have be constant to friend giving great consolation in time of trouble a one woman can console thought that might be so did come across for moment for there be innocence written in lady mason eye then looked at husband face a found innocence there heart be again hardened woman face must lie face of such woman be lie mr furnival said to herself in presence face have be compelled to speak truth oh dear will say nothing of course said be quite sorry that intruded mr furnival a happened to be in holborn at mudie for book thought must come down ask whether intend to dine at home

mind said be nothing be best tempered woman in world at time be impossible to answer even for best tempered will trust to make peace with yes of course will not think of after to day must lady mason oh except must not for world be cause of annoyance to friend sometimes be almost inclined to think will never trouble one again with sorrow let thing come go a may be not for poor lucius must do so mr furnival looking into face perceived that eye be full of tear there must be no doubt a to reality eye be full of genuine tear brimming over running down lawyer heart be melted know why must say so

with eye of men on eye of men who thought have be guilty of so terrible crime for sake of child who be so weak must be brave nearly killed mr furnival must not go through again not even for sake if can save from even though be by buying off of ungrateful man must not think of must not ah will tell lucius let come to not for world must defy one glory in fight after be that must bear brunt no will

glad that went said very glad indeed saw merchant there who be real importer of article have made arrangement with will be cheaper so lucius cheaper not what woman generally call cheaper if there be anything on earth hate be bargain man who look for bargain must be dupe cheat be probably lucius then be doubly unfortunate be cheat because want thing for le than value dupe because a matter of course doe not get what want made bargain at liverpool at least cheap bargain have made arrangement for sufficient supply of first rate unadulterated article at proper market price fear result will be remunerative then a went home in railway carriage mother talked to son about farming a though have forgotten other trouble explained to how be to dine with sir peregrine will be delighted to dine with sir peregrine said lucius very well pleased to have opportunity of talking to about own way of managing land mother will not promise to be guided by so very old fashioned professor mr furnival when be left alone sat thinking over interview have passed at first a be most natural bethought of wife regret to say that love bore to gratitude owed to memory of that have suffered enjoyed together did not fill heart with thought towards a tender a must have done black frown came across brow a meditated on late intrusion made sort of resolve that kind of thing must be prevented for future did not make up mind how must prevent point husband sometimes overlook in marital resolution then instead of counting up virtue counted up own have not given everything house such a have not dreamed of in younger day servant carriage money comfort luxury of sort have begrudged nothing have let have full share of hard earned gain yet must be ungrateful for allow head to be filled with whim fancy a though be young girl to great annoyance confusion must let know that chamber law chamber must be private even from must not allow to become laughing stock to own clerk own brother through impertinent folly of woman who owed to everything so on regret to say that never once thought of lonely evening in harley street of long day poor woman be doomed to pas without only companionship be valuable to never thought of vow have made at altar have kept so loyally required of cherishing comforting enduring love never occurred to that in denying a much broke promise to a though have taken to in very truth strange goddess leaving wedded wife with cold ceremony of alimony such like have be open handed to a regard money therefore ought not to be troublesome have done duty by therefore must not permit to be troublesome such regret to say be thought resolution a sat thinking resolving about mr furnival then by degree mind turned away to other lady became much more tender lady mason be certainly interesting comely in grief colour must still come go hand be still soft small hair be still brown smooth there be wrinkle in brow though care have passed over step must still fall lightly though have borne heavy weight of sorrow fear that made wicked comparison comparison be wicked although be made unconsciously by degree ceased to think of woman began to think of client a be in duty bound to do what be real truth of be possible that must be alarmed in way because small country attorney have told wife that have found old paper because man have then gone off to yorkshire nothing must be more natural than anxiety supposing to be aware of secret must condemn if discovered nothing more unnatural if there be such secret must know in bosom if in other must exist knowledge whether will be just if will be just be possible that must now tremble so violently seeing that justice have be substantially proved in various court of law if be not just if be forgery forgery made by with cognizance now truth be to be made known how terrible must be terrible be not word best describes idea a entered mr furnival mind how wonderful must be how wonderful must have be by whose hand in such case have signature be traced must be possible that soft beautiful graceful a be now girl a have then be must have done unaided by herself that must have sat down in still hour of night with old man on one side baby in cradle on other forged will signature in manner a to have carried point for twenty year so skilfully a to have baffled lawyer juryman resisted eager greed of cheated kinsman if so be not wonderful have not be woman worthy of wonder then mr furnival mind keen almost unerring at seizing legal point went eagerly to work considering what new evidence might now be forthcoming remembered at once circumstance of two chief witness clerk who have be so muddle headed servant girl who have be so clear have certainly witnessed deed have done so on special day if there have be fraud if there have be forgery have be so clever a almost to merit protection if there have be such fraud nature of mean by might be detected became plain to mind of barrister plainer to without knowledge of circumstance than have done to mr mason after many of such circumstance have be explained to be impossible so said mr furnival to out loud speaking out loud in order that might convince be impossible said again did not convince must ask be not on card that must do perhaps if further trial be forthcoming might be better for sake that must be ignorant then having declared again that be impossible rang bell crabwitz said without looking at man just step over to bedford row with compliment learn what be mr round present address old mr round know mr crabwitz stood for moment two with door in hand mr furnival going back to own thought be expecting man departure well said looking up seeing that myrmidon still stood there mr crabwitz be not in very good humour have almost made up mind to let master know that such be case looking at own general importance in legal world inestimable service have rendered to mr furnival did not think that gentleman be treating well have be summoned back to dingy chamber almost without excuse now that be in london be not permitted to join even for day other wise men of law who be assembled at great congress for last four day heart have be yearning to go to birmingham have yearned in vain now master be sending about town a though be errand lad will step across to lodge send porter boy to round crook asked mr crabwitz porter boy no go be not busy why must send porter boy on business fact probably be that mr furnival forgot clerk age standing crabwitz have be ready to run anywhere when employer have first known mr furnival did not perceive change very well sir certainly will go if wish on occasion be hope sir will excuse saying saying what that be not exactly messenger sir of course will go now a other clerk be not in oh be too great man to walk across to bedford row be give hat will go oh mr furnival did not mean that will step over to bedford row of course only did think think what that perhaps be entitled to little more respect mr furnival be for sake a much a own speak sir if gentleman in lane see sent about like lad of twenty sir will think what will think hardly know what will think know will be very disagreeable sir very disagreeable to feeling did think sir that perhaps will tell what be crabwitz if situation here doe not suit may leave to morrow will have difficulty in finding man to take place be sorry to hear speak in way mr furnival very sorry after fifteen year sir find too grand to walk to bedford row oh will go now of course mr furnival then mr crabwitz did go meditating a went many thing to knew own value thought that knew might not be possible to find patron who must appreciate service more justly than did mr furnival chapter xiv dinner at cleeve lady mason on return from london found note from mr orme asking son to dine at cleeve on following day a have be already settled between sir peregrine that lucius must dine there in order that might be talked to respecting mania for guano invitation must not be refused a for lady mason must much have preferred to remain at home indeed uneasiness on guano matter have be so outweighed by worse uneasiness from source that have become if not indifferent at rate tranquil on subject might be well that sir peregrine must preach sermon well that lucius must hear for must thought have be more comfortable for to eat dinner alone felt however that must not do so amount of tedium must be better than danger of offering slight to sir peregrine therefore wrote pretty little note to say that of must be at cleeve at seven lucius dear want to do great favour said a sat by son in hamworth fly great favour mother of course will do anything for can be that will bear with sir peregrine to night bear with know exactly what mean of course will remember that be old man not answer a must one of own age be sure of lucius because be gentleman a much forbearance a young man if be gentleman will always show to old man what ask be something more than sir peregrine have be farming life yes see be result have three four hundred acre of uncultivated land on estate of must grow wheat know nothing about said lady mason ah be question trade be to be that of farmer be sending to school then come question of what sort be schoolmaster be not talking about farming now lucius will talk of can not listen to without contradicting for sake be of greatest consequence to of very greatest lucius must have benefit of sir peregrine friendship if must quarrel with because chanced to disagree with about management of land friendship must not be worth having say that will do so be sure can understand old man may be tender on such point at rate ask from a favour can not guess how important be to to be on good term with neighbour be always so in england said lucius after pausing for while sir peregrine be man of family baronet of course world world of hamworth be must bow down at foot too must worship golden image nebuchadnezzar king of fashion have set up lucius be unkind to mother not unkind like men must fain act in such matter a own judgment may direct friendship with sir peregrine orme have nothing to do with rank be of importance to that must stand well in sight there be nothing more said on matter then got down at front door be ushered through low wide hall into drawing room three generation of family be there sir peregrine daughter in law heir lucius mason have be at cleeve two three time since return from germany on going there have always declared to that be same to a though be going into house of mr arkwright doctor widow at hamworth even into kitchen of farmer greenwood rejoiced to call democrat must boast that rank must have effect on boast be untrue boast must not carry at cleeve a must have done did in mr arkwright little drawing room there be majesty in manner of sir peregrine did awe there be token of birth certain grace of manner about mr orme kept down assumption even with young peregrine found that though might be equal must by mean be more than equal have learned more than peregrine orme have ten time more knowledge in head have read book of peregrine did not even know name probably never must know on side also young orme possessed something other wanted what that something might be lucius mason did not at understand mr orme got up from corner on sofa to greet friend with soft smile two three whispered word led forward to fire mr orme be not woman given to much speech endowed with outward warmth of manner must make few word go very far then pressure of hand when be given told more than whole embrace from other woman there be lady who always kiss female friend always call dear in such case one can not pity who be so bekissed mr orme did not kiss lady mason did call dear smiled sweetly a uttered greeting looked kindness out of marvellously blue eye lucius mason looking on over mother shoulder thought that must like to have for friend in spite of rank if mr orme must give lecture on farming might be possible to listen to without contradiction there be chance for in respect mr orme never gave lecture to one on subject so master lucius have be to liverpool hear said sir peregrine yes sir returned yesterday what be world doing at world be wide awake there sir oh doubt when world have to make money be always wide awake men sometimes may be wide awake yet make money may be wide awake at rate think that be so better that sir peregrine than wilfully go to sleep when there be so much work to be done man when be asleep doe harm said sir peregrine what comfortable doctrine to think of when servant come with hot water at eight o'clock in morning said grandson be one study very constantly fear said old man who at time be on excellent term with heir there have be no apparent hankering after rat since last compact have be made peregrine have be doing great thing with h h winning golden opinion from sort of sportsman earning great reputation for certain young mare have be bred by sir peregrine fox be vermin a well a rat a perry in wickedness have remarked young man who can break old one heart by predilection for rat catching may win a absolutely irretrievably by prowess after fox sir peregrine have told to four different neighbour how fox have be run into in open near alston after twelve desperate mile how on occasion peregrine have be in at death with huntsman only one other mare know be only four year old hardly half trained said sir peregrine with great exultation young scamp to have ridden in way may be doubted whether must have be prouder man said more about if grandson have taken honour then gong sounded sir peregrine led lady mason into dining room lucius who a know thought no more of ormes than of jones smith paused in awe before gave arm to mr orme when did so led away in perfect silence though must have given anything to be able to talk to a went bethought that unfortunately must find nothing to say when sat down be not much better have not dined at cleeve before be not sure whether butler in plain clothes two men in livery did not help to create confusion in spite of well digested democratic idea conversation during dinner be not very bright sir peregrine said few word now again to lady mason replied with few others on subject did not absolutely appertain to dinner perhaps be greatest talker even did not say much mr orme a rule never spoke unless be spoken to in company consisting of more than one other young peregrine seemed to imagine that carving at top of table asking people if must take stewed beef eating own dinner be occupation quite sufficient for energy have bit more beef mason do if will will so far went in conversation farther while work be still before when servant be gone be little better not much mason do mean to hunt season peregrine asked said other well must if be will never know fellow about here unless do in first place ca afford time said lucius in next place ca afford money be plucky on part be felt to be so by everybody in room perhaps have spoken truth must have said also that be not accustomed to horsemanship to fellow who have place of own a have cost nothing said peregrine oh doe not said baronet used to think differently well not so much mean a if have everything to buy besides look upon mason a sort of croesus what on earth have got to do with money then a to time upon word understand what man mean when say have not got time for hunting lucius intends to be farmer said mother so do said peregrine by jove must think so if have two hundred acre of land in own hand must not want anything else in world must never ask one for shilling if be so might make best bargain at once that ever man made said baronet if might take at word master perry pray talk of sir said mr orme may be quite sure of dear that will not do more than talk of then sir peregrine asked lady mason if must take more wine after lady withdrew lecture commenced will in first place accompany lady into drawing room for few minute be hinted in one of first chapter of story that lady mason might have become more intimate than have done with mr orme have so pleased by will of course be presumed that have not so pleased be perfectly true mr orme have now be living at cleeve greater portion of life have never while there made one really well loved friend have sister of own dear old friend of childhood who lived far away from in northern county occasionally did see be then very happy be not frequent with sister who be married to peer might stay at cleeve for fortnight perhaps once in year mr orme seldom left own home thought certainly not without cause that sir peregrine be not happy in absence therefore never left then living there so much alone be not natural that heart must desire friend lady mason have be living much more alone have sister to come to even though be once year have intimate female friend none to whom must really speak with full freedom of friendship must have be delightful to have bound to by tie of love so sweet creature a mr orme widow like like widow with one only son warily picking step through life have learned necessity of being cautious in thing countenance of sir peregrine have be invaluable to might not be possible that must lose that countenance word two spoken now then again look not intended to be noticed altered tone perhaps change in pressure of old man hand have taught lady mason to think that might disapprove such intimacy probably at moment be right for be quick at reading such small sign behoved to be very careful to indulge in pleasure might be costly therefore have denied in matter a in so many others now have occurred to that might be well to change conduct felt that sir peregrine friendship for be too confirmed to be shaken perhaps fancied that might strengthen by mean of daughter in law at rate resolved to accept offer have once be tacitly made to if be still open to to do so how little changed boy be said when be seated near to other with coffee cup between doe not change quickly a say be boy still in many thing know whether may not be better that must be so did not mean to call boy in sense said lady mason might now son be quite man poor lucius yes in position be necessary little bit of property be already own then have one like sir peregrine to look out for necessity make manly will be marrying soon dare say suggested mr orme oh hope not do think that early marriage be good for young men yes think so why not said mr orme thinking of own year of married happiness must not wish to see lucius marry fancy not must be afraid lest must become a nothing to yet must not have think that be selfish be sure that be not that be sure that love better than world besides can feel what be be not alone with boy a be if be to send from there must be nothing left for in world send from ah because orley farm belongs to must not do be sure must not must hing unkind how must help if wife wished nevertheless must not keep single for reason for reason if knew that wished to marry must be blow to sincerely trust peregrine may marry early said mr orme perhaps thinking that baby be preferable either to rat fox yes must be well be sure because have ample mean house be large must have wife to love if be nice must be so sweet to have for daughter also be very much alone though perhaps not so much a be lady mason hope not for be sometimes very lonely have often thought that must be wicked beyond everything if be to complain seeing providence have given so much that have right to expect what must have done in loneliness if sir peregrine hand door have never be opened to then for next half hour two lady held sweet converse together during will go back to gentleman over wine illustration over wine be drinking claret said sir peregrine arranging bottle in way be usual to have ever be moderate man nevertheless have business like way of going to work after dinner a though there be good deal to be done before drawing room must be visited more wine for sir said lucius wine said sir peregrine elder why mason will never get on if be way with said peregrine younger will try at rate said other water drinker moody thinker peregrine sang word two from old drinking song be not quite sure of englishman suppose be moodiest thinker in world yet be not so much given to water drinking a lively neighbour across channel sir peregrine said nothing more on subject probably thought that young friend must not be very comfortable neighbour present task however be by mean that of teaching to drink struck off at once upon business have undertaken so mother tell that be going to devote energy to farming hardly that hope there be land mean to see what can do with be not much intend to combine other occupation with will find that two hundred acre of land will give good deal to do be if mean to make money by certainly hope to do in long run seems to easiest thing in world said peregrine will find out mistake day with lucius mason be very important that must make mistake at commencement for country gentleman know prettier amusement than experimental farming then man must give up idea of making rent out of land ca afford said lucius be why take liberty of speaking to hope that great friendship feel for mother will be allowed to stand a excuse be very much obliged by kindness sir be indeed truth be think be beginning wrong have now be to liverpool to buy guano believe yes few other thing there be man there who have taken out patent dear fellow if lay out money in way will never see back again have considered in first place what journey to liverpool have cost exactly nine sixpence per cent on money laid out there now be not much more than penny in pound on sum expended be not for moment to be taken into consideration in comparison with advantage of improved market there be more in than sir peregrine have expected to encounter did not for moment doubt truth of own experience folly danger of young man proceeding did doubt own power of proving one other to one who so accurately computed expense by percentage on outlay peregrine opened eye sat by wondering in silence what on earth did mason mean by improved market be afraid then said baronet that must have laid out large sum of money man ca do good sir peregrine by hoarding capital think very much of capital not of theory of capital not so much a people do if man have got of course must be expended on trade to be to be applied little knowledge experience be perhaps desirable before great outlay be made yes little knowledge be necessary great knowledge must be desirable if be accessible be not a take long year perhaps devoted to such pursuit yes sir peregrine know what be going to say experience doubt will teach something man who have walked thirty mile day for thirty year will probably know what sort of shoe will best suit foot perhaps also kind of food will best support through such exertion there be very little chance of inventing quicker mode of travelling will have earned wage honestly said sir peregrine almost angrily in heart be very angry for did not love to be interrupted oh yes if be sufficient might walk thirty mile day of must earn wage for other people world will make progress civilization a take consists in effort made not for oneself for others if wo take more wine will join lady said baronet have not taken at said peregrine filling own glass for last time emptying that young man be most conceited puppy be ever misfortune to meet said sir peregrine to mr orme when came to kiss take blessing a always did before leaving for night be sorry for said for like mother so much also like said sir peregrine can not say that will ever be very fond of son will tell what mamma said young peregrine same evening in mother dressing room lucius mason be too many for governor evening hope did not tease grandfather talked down regularly be plain that governor did not like then day be over chapter xv morning call at mount pleasant villa on following day lady mason made two visit using new vehicle for first time must fain have walked have dared must have given terrible offence to son by doing so have explained to with truth that a joint income be now thousand year be quite entitled to such luxury then went on to say that a have bought for must be much hurt if must not use have put off from day to day now must put off no longer first visit be by appointment at cleeve have promised mr orme that must come up special purpose having be named with real idea at rate on part of latter that might be more comfortable together than alone walk across from orley farm to cleeve have always be very dear to lady mason step of be over beautiful ground delight in scenery be one of few pleasure lot in life have permitted to enjoy to day must not allow walk pleasure delight must be postponed to son wish then be used to found mr orme alone sat with for hour know that anything be said between deserves to be specially chronicled mr orme though told many thing did not tell what sir peregrine have said a be going up to bedroom on preceding evening did lady mason say much about son farming have managed to gather from lucius that have not be deeply impressed by anything have fallen from sir peregrine on subject therefore thought a well to hold tongue soon perceived also from fact of mr orme saying nothing about lucius that have not left behind very favourable impression be to cause of additional sorrow knew that must be borne nothing that must say must induce lucius to make acceptable to sir peregrine when hour be over went down again to little carriage mr orme coming with to look at in hall met sir peregrine why doe not lady mason stop for lunch said be past half past one never knew anything so inhospitable a turning out at moment did ask to stay said mr orme command to stay said sir peregrine knocking stick upon stone floor of hall let see who will dare to disobey john let lady mason carriage pony stand in open coach house till be ready so lady mason went back did remain for lunch be painfully anxious to maintain best possible footing in house still more anxious not to have thought that be intruding have feared that lucius by offence might have estranged sir peregrine against at rate be not case after lunch drove to hamworth made second visit on occasion called on one mr arkwright who be very old acquaintance though hardly to be called intimate friend late mr arkwright dr arkwright a used to be styled in hamworth have be sir joseph medical attendant for many year therefore there have be room for intimacy real friendship be friendship of confidence have sprung up nevertheless doctor wife have known enough of lady mason in younger day to justify in speaking of thing must not have be mentioned between merely ordinary acquaintance be glad to see have got promotion said old lady looking out at lady mason little phaeton on gravel sweep divided mr arkwright house from street for mr arkwright house be mount pleasant villa therefore be entitled to sweep be present from lucius said other a such must be used will never feel at home in own carriage be quite proper dear lady mason quite proper with income with yours wonder that insists upon be quite proper just at present moment peculiarly so lady mason did not understand must probably have passed by without understanding have not thought that there be expression more than ordinary in mr arkwright face why peculiarly so at present moment said because show that foolish report be going about have foundation people wo believe for moment when see out about happy like what rumour mr arkwright lady mason heart sunk within a asked question felt at once to what must allude though have conceived no idea a yet that there be rumour on subject indeed during last forty eight hour since have left chamber of mr furnival have be more at ease within than during previous day have elapsed subsequent to ill omened visit made to by miriam dockwrath have seemed to that mr furnival anticipated danger manner word have almost given confidence now now that public rumour be spoken of heart be a low again a ever sure have heard said mr arkwright well must be first to tell only that know that there be truth in might a well tell now a will be apt to believe worse than truth after what have said then mr arkwright told people have be saying that mr mason be again going to begin law proceeding about farm for one believe people have said so lady mason repeated meant nothing be nothing to who people be if one said now must soon be saying uttered word because felt forced to say something power of thinking what might best say be almost taken away from be sure know where came from said mr arkwright must not have alluded to if have not thought that of course have heard be very sorry if saying have vexed oh said lady mason trying to smile a said before know that there be nothing in having pony chaise just at time will make everybody see that be quite comfortable thank yes good bye mr arkwright then made great effort feeling aware that be betraying that behoved to say something might remove suspicion emotion must have created very name of lawsuit be so dreadful to that can hardly bear memory of be so terrible to that even enemy must hardly wish that must commence again of course be merely report said mr arkwright almost trembling at what have done be at least believe so have heard that such threat have be made did not think that tidings of have got abroad be mr whiting told be great busybody know mr whiting be wife of present doctor dear mr arkwright doe not matter in least of course expect that people must hold tongue on account good bye mr arkwright then got into little carriage did contrive to drive home to orley farm dear dear dear dear said mr arkwright to herself when be left alone only to think of that must be knocked in heap by few word in moment a may say then began to consider of matter wonder what there be in there must be something must never have looked so like ghost what will do if orley farm be taken away from after then mr arkwright hurried out on daily little toddle through town that might talk about be talked to on same subject be by mean ill natured woman be at inclined to direct against lady mason slight amount of venom might alloy disposition then matter be of such importance people of hamworth have hardly yet ceased to talk of last orley farm trial must not be necessary that must talk much more if new trial be really pending looking at matter in light must not such trial be godsend to people of hamworth therefore beg that may not be imputed to mr arkwright a fault that toddled out sought eagerly for gossip lady mason did manage to drive home success in matter be more owing to good faith propriety of pony than to skilful workmanship on own part first desire have be to get away from mr arkwright having made that effort be now for time hardly able to make other be fast coming upon now let sir peregrine say what comforting word might let mr furnival assure that be safe with ever so much confidence nevertheless must not believe must not feel inwardly convinced that so dreaded be to happen be written in book of destiny that there must be new trial now from very moment misery must again begin people must point at talk of success in obtaining orley farm for own child must again be canvassed at house in hamworth not only success mean also by that success have be obtained old people must remember young people must inquire for tranquillity repose retirement of life have be so valuable to be gone there must be doubt that dockwrath have spread report immediately on return from yorkshire have well thought of matter might have taken comfort from of course must tell story did tell confidence in being able again to drag case before court must by mean argue that others believed a believed in fact enemy now arraigned against be only whom already knew to be so arraigned have not sufficient command of thought to be able at first to take comfort from such reflection a felt a be being carried home that world be going from that must be well for be possible that must die be stronger when reached own door than have be at mr arkwright there be still within great power of self maintenance if only time be allowed to to look about consider how best might support many woman be in respect a be with forethought summoned patience can endure great agony sudden pang unexpected overwhelms got out of pony carriage with ordinary placid face walked up to own room without having given sign that be uneasy then have to determine how must bear before son have be with great object that sir peregrine mr furnival must first hear of tidings from that must promise aid when have heard story a must tell in have be successful now seemed to prudence must require to act in same way towards lucius have be possible to keep matter from altogether must have given much to do so now must not be possible be clear that mr dockwrath have chosen to make matter public acting doubt with forethought in doing so lucius must be sure to hear word must become common in hamworth difficult a task must be to must be best that must prepare so sat alone till dinner time planning how must do have sat alone for hour in same way planning how must tell story to sir peregrine again a to second story for mr furnival whose withers be unwrung can hardly guess how absolutely sore under collar will embitter hour for poor jade who be so tormented met at dinner with smiling face loved to see smile often told so almost upbraiding when must look sad why must be sad seeing that have everything that woman must desire mind be burdened with heavy thought a to feeding coming multitude have contest to wage with desultory chemist of age purpose be to work hard during hour of day hard also during many hour of night be becoming that mother must greet softly during few interval of idleness told so in word not badly chosen for such telling loving mother that be strove valiantly to obey during dinner must not speak to immediately after dinner evil moment put off from half hour to half hour still looking a though be quiet within bosom a sat beside with book in hand be again at work before began story thought at least that be at work for have before on table prichard latham be occupied in making copy from drawing of skull purposed to represent cerebral development of certain of more distant asiatic brother be not singular said be that jaw of men born bred in hunter state must be differently formed from of agricultural tribe be said lady mason oh maxillary profile be quite different will see especially with mongolian among tartar tribe seems to to be very much same difference a between man sheep prichard make such remark look here at fellow must have be intended to eat nothing flesh that raw without knife fork suppose have many knife fork by close observation doubt that one must tell from single tooth not only what food owner of have be accustomed to eat what language have spoken say close observation know must not be done in day suppose not then student again bent over drawing see must have be impossible for owner of such jaw a to have ground grain of corn between teeth to have masticated even cabbage lucius said lady mason becoming courageous on spur of moment want to leave for moment speak to well said putting down pencil turning round here be have heard of lawsuit have with brother when be infant of course have heard of wish must not call that man brother must not own a such most certainly must not own a far a can learn be one of most detestable human being that ever existed have heard of from unfavourable side lucius must remember that be hard man believe know that must do anything thought to be unjust why then did try to rob of property because thought that must have be own can not see into breast presume that be so presume anything of kind never will be infant be woman woman at time without many friend thought that must rob under cover of law have be commonly honest must have be enough for to know what have be father wish even if will have not be rigidly formal look upon a robber thief be sorry for lucius because differ from what wish to tell now be that be thinking of trying question again what thinking of trial now lucius mason pushed drawing book from with vengeance so be told who told can not believe if intended anything of kind must have be first person to hear of must be business now may be sure that must have taken care to let know purpose then by degree explained to that man mr mason of groby have a yet declared such purpose have intended to omit mention of name of mr dockwrath be unable to do so without seeming to make mystery with son when came to explain how rumour have arisen why have thought necessary to tell be obliged to say that have arisen from wrath of attorney have be to groby park said now that have returned be spreading report will go to to morrow said lucius very sternly must not do that must promise that will not do will can not suppose that will allow man a to tamper with name without noticing be business now lucius attack will be against rather than be if attack be made have told because like to have secret from of course have told if be attacked who must defend if best defence indeed only defence till take active step will be silence most probably will not do anything then can afford to live down such report a can understand lucius that matter be grievous enough to be sure that for sake will not make worse by personal quarrel with man a will go to mr furnival said ask advice have done that already lucius thought best to do so when first heard mr dockwrath be moving in matter be for went up to

not be so regarded be a plea be not mr dockwrath be a plea whether employ be not a plea whether employ on business of same class may give confidence may withdraw looking at way matter be managed

moving from chair will tell mr mason that have declined making communication to will probably know address if must want mr dockwrath paused be not about to sacrifice substantial advantage to momentary

address of old mr round mr round be at birmingham said coming back one connected with profession be at birmingham except more fool said mr furnival be thinking of going down evening said mr crabwitz a will be out of town sir suppose can be spared too why not mr furnival when profession be meeting together why must not be there a well a hope deny right to feel interest in great subject be being discussed not in least mr crabwitz deny right to be lord chief justice if can accomplish can not be lord chief justice clerk at same time can be in chamber if be at birmingham rather think must trouble to remain here a can not tell at what moment may be in town again then sir be afraid mr crabwitz began speech then faltered be going to tell mr furnival that must suit with clerk when remembered fee paused must be very pleasant to to quit mr furnival where must get such place knew that be invaluable then be invaluable only to mr furnival mr furnival must be mad to part with mr crabwitz thought then must not be almost more mad to part with mr furnival eh well said mr furnival oh of course if desire mr furnival will remain must say think be rather hard look here mr crabwitz if think service be too hard upon have better leave if take upon to tell so again must leave remember that mr furnival possessed master mind of two mr crabwitz felt a slunk back to own room so mr round also be at birmingham must be seen there be so far well mr furnival having again with ruthless malice sent mr crabwitz for cab at once started for euston square station must master mr crabwitz felt certain pleasure in having done so must master mr f that lady have on one two late occasion shown anger at existing state of domestic affair have once previously gone so far a to make lord understand that be jealous of proceeding with reference to other goddess have never before done in presence of other people have never allowed special goddess to see that be special object of such jealousy now have not only committed in way have also committed making feel to be ridiculous be highly necessary that step must be taken if only knew what step kept mind active a journeyed in cab at station found three four other lawyer bound for birmingham indeed during fortnight whole line have be alive with learned gentleman going to fro discussing weighty point a rattled along iron road shaking ponderous head at new idea be being ventilated mr furnival with many others indeed with most of who be so far advanced in world a to be making bread by profession be of opinion that palaver be going on in various tongue of babel must end a began in word vox et praeterea nihil to practical englishman most of international congress seem to arrive at nothing else men will not be talked out of conviction of life living orator must convince grocer coffee must be sold without chicory amount of eloquence will make english lawyer think that loyalty to truth must come before loyalty to client therefore own pundit though on occasion went to birmingham summoned by greatness of occasion by dignity of foreign name by interest in question by influence of such men a lord boanerges went there without doubt on mind a to rectitude of own practice fortified with strong resolve to resist idea of change indeed one can not understand how bent of man mind must be altered by saying doings of congress well johnson what have be doing to day asked mr furnival of special friend whom chanced to meet at club have be extemporized at birmingham have have paper read by von bauhr lasted three hour three hour heaven von bauhr be think from berlin dr slotacher slotacher be to read paper day after to morrow then think will go to london again what did von bauhr say to during three hour of course be in german suppose that one understood unless be boanerges believe be old story going to show that same man might be judge advocate jury doubt if men be machine if must find such machine perfect at point in machinery if machine have heart machine have heart said mr furnival especially in germany what did boanerges say answer did not take three hour more hope about twenty minute what did say be lost on von bauhr who understands a much english a do german said that practice of prussian court have always be to subject of intense interest that general justice of verdict must not be impugned ought seeing that single trial for murder will occupy court for three week must have asked von bauhr how much work usually got through in course of session seem to have lost much by being away by by do happen to know whether round be here what old round saw in hall to day yawning a though must burst then mr furnival strolled off to look for attorney among various purlieu frequented by learned stranger furnival said barrister accosting elderly man small with sharp eye bushy eyebrow dirty in attire poor in general appearance have seen judge staveley be mr chaffanbrass great at old bailey man well able to hold own in spite of meanness of appearance at meeting a english bar generally must have have better representative than mr chaffanbrass be here must be here be only man must find who know enough italian to understand what that fat fellow from florence will say to morrow be to have italian to morrow be yes staveley afterwards be a good a play only like play be three time too long wonder whether anybody here belief in yes felix graham doe belief everything unless be bible be one of young men who look for instant millennium who regard not only a prophet who foretell a preacher who will produce for be too old for new gospel with felix graham a apostle say that boanerges think great deal of ca be true for boanerges never thought much of one well be off to bed for find day here ten time more fatiguing than old bailey in july on whole meeting be rather dull a such meeting usually be must not be supposed that lawyer must get up at will a spirit moved utter own idea that member of congress must speak if only must catch speaker eye have be so man might have be supported by hope of having finger in pie sooner later in such case congress must have lasted for ever a be name of who be invited to address meeting be arranged of course men from country be selected who be best known in own special walk of profession then best known men took unfair advantage of position be ruthless in lengthy cruelty of address von bauhr at berlin be doubt great lawyer must not have felt so confident that legal proceeding of england of civilised world in general must be reformed by reading that book of from rostrum in hall at civilised world in general a there represented have be disgusted be surmised that poor dr slotacher must find meagre audience when turn came at last mr furnival succeeded in hunting up mr round found recruiting outraged nature with glass of brandy water cigar looking for have well here be be to say what be left of be in hall to day be up in town ah account for being so fresh wish have be there do ever do anything in way mr round touched outside of glass of toddy with spoon mr furnival said that never did do anything in way be true port wine be way may be doubted whether on whole be not more dangerous way of two mr furnival though must not drink brandy water smoke cigar sat down opposite to mr round have soon broached subject be on mind yes said attorney be quite true have letter on subject from mr mason lady be not wrong in supposing that one be moving in matter client wish to take up case again doubt doe be not man ever greatly liked mr furnival though believe mean well think that have be ill used perhaps be ill used by father can be possible reason for badgering life out of father widow twenty year after father death of course think that have new evidence ca say looked into matter much did read letter be then handed to son a far a remember mr mason said that attorney at hamworth have be to exactly low fellow whom must be ashamed to see in office fancy that young mason have injured though have received numberless benefit from lady mason be way in chooses to be revenged on son must have nothing to do with matter a that know be not line of course be not be well aware of be equally well aware that nothing mr mason can do can shake lady mason title rather son title to property mr round if be encouraged to gratify malice if who be encouraged client mr mason of groby there can be doubt that might harass unfortunate lady till brought nearly to grave must be pity for believe be still uncommon pretty woman attorney indulged in little fat inward chuckle for in day mr furnival taste with reference to strange goddess be beginning to be understood by profession be very old friend of mine said mr furnival gravely very old friend indeed if be to desert now must have one to whom must look oh ah yes be sure be very kind mr round altered face tone so that might be in conformity with of companion anything can do of course will be very happy must be slow to advise client to try matter again to tell truth anything of kind must go to son now did read mr mason letter immediately handed to matthew will tell how can oblige mr round do tell be sure will be very happy look into matter talk over with mr mason before allow anything to be done be not that doubt son discretion indeed know what exceedingly good man of business be matthew be sharp enough said prosperous father then young men be apt to be too sharp know whether remember case about orley farm mr round a well a if be yesterday said attorney then must recollect how thoroughly be convinced that client have not leg to stand upon be that insisted that must not carry before chancellor crook have general management of case then must have gone on said must not see client money wasted in such wild goose chase in first place property be not worth in next place there be nothing to impugn will if remember right turned on whether old man who have signed a witness be well enough to write name be point think be shown that have signed receipt on very day day after day before be something of kind exactly be fact a regard result of new trial sane man fancy must have doubt know a well a one living how great be strength of twenty year of possession must be very strong on side certainly must not have chance of course not mr round might make poor woman so wretched that death must be relief to now may be possible that something looking like fresh evidence may have be discovered something of kind probably have be found man must not be moving must not have gone to expense of journey to yorkshire have not got hold of new story have something in head may be sure of let son be run away with by advise client to incur terrible expense of new trial without knowing what be about tell fairly do dread trial on poor lady account reflect what must be mr round to lady of own family think mr round must mind much that be if be sure of case be strong minded woman poor lady mason be strong minded enough too if remember right at last trial will never forget how composed be when old bennett tried to shake evidence do remember how bothered be be excellent lawyer be bennett there be few better men at bar now day must have found down here mr furnival listening to german lecture three hour long know how be think used to work harder in day than young men do now then eulogist of past day went back to memory of youth declaring how in old glorious year now gone no congress such a must have have chance of success men have men work to do then be not wont to play fool first at one provincial town then at stuck to oar made fortune seems to mr furnival said mr round that be child play to tell truth be half ashamed of myself for being here will look into matter mr round yes will certainly will take a great favour of course will advise client in accordance with new fact may be brought before a feel certain that case against young mason can have merit do hope that will be able to suggest to mr mason of groby that matter must be allowed to rest then mr furnival took leave still thinking how far might be possible that enemy side of question might be supported by real merit mr round be good natured old fellow if case must be inveigled out of son hand into own might be possible that even real merit must avail nothing confess be getting rather tired of said felix graham evening to friend young staveley a stood outside bedroom door at top of narrow flight of stair in back part of large hotel at birmingham tired of must think be too nevertheless be a sure a ever good will come from be inclined to think that same kind of thing must be endured before improvement be made in anything that reformer have to undergo von bauhr yes of do good von bauhr word be very dry doubt mean to say that understood not many of few here there for first half hour came trembling home to dull comprehension then went to sleep sound became too difficult for ear dry dull hard a be will not absolutely fall to ground have meaning in that meaning will reproduce in shape heaven forbid that must ever do so in presence iniquity of english bar may be guilty can not be so intolerable to humanity a von bauhr well good night old fellow governor be to give idea to morrow perhaps will be a bad to german a von bauhr be to then can only say that governor will be very cruel to german so two went to dream in mean time von bauhr be sitting alone looking back on past hour with idea view very different from of many english lawyer who be at time discussing demerit to day have be one long triumph for voice have sounded sweet in own ear a period after period have poured forth in full flowing language gathered wisdom experience of life public men in england have so much to do that can not give time to preparation of speech for such meeting a von bauhr have be at work on pamphlet for month nay taking in whole have not be at work on for year now kind providence have given opportunity of pouring forth before assembled pundit gathered from nation of civilised world a sat there solitary in bedroom hand dropped down by side pipe hung from mouth on to breast eye turned up to ceiling be lighted almost with inspiration men there at congress mr chaffanbrass young staveley felix graham others have regarded a impersonation of dullness

gracefulness a might be beer garden at munich there stood among flower vas pedestal grand above other pedestal in garden on there be bust with inscription to von bauhr who reformed law of nation be grand thought though there be in much of human conceit there be in also much of human philanthropy if reign of justice must be restored through effort through effort in on hallowed day have be enabled to make so great progress how beautiful must be then a sat there while smoke still curled from unconscious nostril felt that loved german englishman even frenchman in very heart of heart especially who have travelled wearily to english town that might listen to result of wisdom said to said truly that loved world that must willingly spend in great endeavour for amelioration of law perfection of judicial proceeding then betook to bed in frame of mind be not unenviable illustration von bauhr dream be inclined to agree with felix graham that such effort be seldom absolutely wasted man who strives honestly to do good will generally do good though seldom perhaps a much a have anticipated let von bauhr have pedestal among flower even though be small humble chapter xviii english von bauhr

in commencing description said must begin with exterior seems to now that in speaking of have sufficiently noted also that be within of actual thought deed up to period be not necessary for purpose that anything must be told of might probably think might possibly do fair guess may hope be made from have be already written such be staveley family of guest whom be necessary must now name have be already introduced to miss furnival be there a be also father have not intended to make prolonged stay at noningsby at least so have said in own drawing room nevertheless have now be there for week seemed probable that might stay over christmas day felix graham be there have be asked with special purpose by friend augustus a already have heard in order namely that might fall in love with sophia furnival by aid of supposed hatful of money avoid evil must otherwise so probably be consequence of highly impracticable turn of mind judge be not averse to felix graham a be man essentially practical in view often occurred that in mild kindly way ridiculed young barrister sir peregrine orme be there being absent from home a on very rare occasion with of course be mr orme grandson young perry be making be prepared to make somewhat of prolonged stay at noningsby have horse there with for hunting be changed now again groom going backwards forward between place cleeve sir peregrine however intended to return before christmas mr orme must go with have come for four day for have be long absence from home at end of four day must be gone be sitting in dining room round luncheon table on hopelessly wet morning listening to lecture from judge on abomination of eating meat in middle of day when servant came behind young orme chair told that mr mason be in breakfast parlour wished to see who wish to see said baronet in tone of surprise have caught name thought at moment that be owner of groby park lucius mason said peregrine getting up wonder what can want for oh lucius mason said grandfather since discourse about agriculture be not personally much attached even to lucius for mother sake must be forgiven pray ask into lunch said lady staveley something have be said about lady mason since ormes have be at noningsby staveley family be prepared to regard with sympathy if necessary with right hand of fellowship be great agriculturist be not said augustus bring in by mean there be knowing how much may not learn before dinner on such day a be ally of mine must not laugh at said miss furnival who be sitting next to augustus lucius mason did not come in young orme remained with for about quarter of hour then returned to room declaring with rather serious face that must ride to hamworth back before dinner be going with young mason asked grandfather yes sir wish to do something for at hamworth can not well refuse be not going to fight duel said lady staveley holding up hand in horror a idea came across brain duel screamed mr orme oh peregrine there can be nothing of sort said judge must think that young mason be not so foolish be sure that peregrine orme be not have not heard of anything of kind said peregrine laughing promise peregrine said mother say that promise dearest mother have more thought of than have indeed may say not so much will be back to dinner said lady staveley oh yes certainly tell mr mason said judge that if will return with will be delighted to see errand took peregrine orme off to hamworth will be explained in next chapter going led to discussion among gentleman after dinner a to position in lady mason be now placed there be longer possibility of keeping matter secret seeing that mr dockwrath have taken great care one in hamworth must hear of have openly declared that evidence must now be adduced to prove sir joseph mason widow have forged will have said to many people that mr mason of groby have determined to indict for forgery have gone so far that lucius have declared a openly that must prosecute attorney for libel dockwrath have sent word that be quite welcome to do so if pleased be scandalous state of thing said sir peregrine speaking with much enthusiasm little temper on subject here be question be settled twenty year ago to satisfaction of one who knew anything of case now be brought up again that two men may wreak vengeance on poor widow be not men be brute why doe not bring action against attorney said young staveley such action easily lie said father may be quite true that dockwrath may have said manner of evil thing against lady yet may be very difficult to obtain evidence of libel seems to from what have heard that man wish action to be brought think of state of poor lady mason said mr furnival conceive misery must occasion if be dragged forward to give evidence on matter believe must kill said sir peregrine best mean of assisting must be to give countenance said judge from can hear of deserves doe deserve said sir peregrine will have people at hamworth will see at rate that daughter regard a fit associate be happy to say that be coming to cleeve on return home that will remain there till after christmas be very singular case said felix graham who have be thinking over position of lady hitherto in silence indeed be said judge show how careful men must be in matter relating to will will codicil a appears be in handwriting of widow who acted a amanuensis not only for husband for attorney fact doe not in mind produce suspicion doubt that have produced suspicion in mind of claimant attorney who advised sir joseph must have known better be one of case continued graham in sufferer must be protected by very fact of own innocence lawyer must consent to take up cudgel against be afraid that will not escape persecution from such professional chivalry said judge be moonshine said mr furnival moonshine be very pretty thing if be not too much afraid of night air to go look at if matter be a say do think that gentleman must disgrace by lending hand against upon word sir fully agree with said sir peregrine bowing to felix graham over glass will take permission to think sir peregrine said mr furnival that must not agree with mr graham if have given to matter much deep consideration have not have advantage of professional education said sir peregrine again bowing on occasion addressing to lawyer can not see how amount of learning must alter view on subject truth honour can not be altered by professional arrangement said graham then conversation turned away from lady mason directed to great correction of legal reform have be debated during past autumn orley farm case though in other form different language be being discussed also in drawing room have not seen much of said sophia furnival who by art have usurped most prominent part in conversation what did see liked much be at cleeve when be staying there if remember mr orme mr orme said that did remember went over to orley farm poor lady think everybody ought to notice under such circumstance papa know must move heaven earth for if must can not move heaven earth said lady staveley if thought that calling on must be satisfaction to must lady staveley said mr orme must be great satisfaction to can not tell how warmly regard how perfectly sir peregrine esteem will drive over there next week madeline do mamma everybody say that be very nice will be so kind of lady staveley said sophia furnival next week will be staying with said mr orme must save three mile know must be so glad to see lady staveley declared that must do must call at cleeve again at orley farm after lady mason return home well understood though must not herself then say so that greater part of advantage to be received from kindness must be derived from being known at hamworth that staveley carriage have be driven up to lady mason door son be very clever be not said madeline addressing to miss furnival sophia shrugged shoulder put head on one side with pretty grace yes believe so people say so who be to tell whether young man be clever be so much more clever than others think so oh yes a girl be so much prettier than others if mr mason be to talk greek to must not think clever must not understand know of course not must understand that be blockhead to show off learning in way want to be clever see only want to be agreeable know that want one other do not know do think that young men in society be bound to be agreeable that must not be there if know how to talk pleasantly to give something in return for trouble take for take trouble for said madeline laughing surely must if only think of lady do so ought if in return for man merely talk greek to for part think that bargain be fairly carried out declare will make quite afraid of mr mason oh never talk greek at least never have to rather like what mean be think man bit more likely to be agreeable because have reputation of being very clever for part rather think that like stupid young men oh do then now will know what think of augustus think be very clever know man who make more popular with young lady ah then be gay deceiver be gay enough be sure be deceiver man may make nice to young lady without deceiving of may not must not take pied de la lettre miss staveley will be lost of course may when young gentleman be so very nice young lady be so apt to to what not to fall in love with exactly to be ready to be fallen in love with then if man doe do be deceiver declare seems to that allow chance of going right think that augustus manages to steer through such difficulty very cleverly sail about in open sea touching at most lovely cape promontory be never driven on shore by stress of weather what happy sailor must be think be happy that make others so ought to be made admiral at once will hear day of coming to terrible shipwreck oh hope not will return home in desperate plight with only two plank left together with glory beauty broken crumpled to piece against rock that have despised in pride why do prophesy such terrible thing for mean that will get married get married of course will be just what want call that shipwreck do be sort of shipwreck that very gallant bark have to encounter mean that will marry disagreeable wife oh not in least only mean to say that like other son of adam will have to strike colour dare say if truth be known have done so already be sure have not at ask to know secret must look upon a very bad sister if told be sure have not got of kind must tell if have oh hope so serious secret be sure ought for be always thinking about must tell secret have none when have will do so will well yes think so girl have such secret continued to say after pausing for moment none generally at least tell even to herself till time come in tell to whom really love then there be pause for moment be not quite so sure of said miss furnival after gentleman came into drawing room augustus staveley have gone to work in manner conceived to be quite systematic having before praiseworthy object of making match between felix graham sophia furnival by george graham have said finest girl in london be coming down to noningsby upon word think be brought there expressly for delectation suppose oh not at indeed be not exactly in style be too too too in point of fact too much of girl for have lot of money be very clever kind of thing never knew so humble before be not joking at be daughter of old furnival whom by by hate a do poison why governor have down at noningsby ca guess tell old fellow can give daughter five twenty thousand pound think of master brook felix graham be man who must not bring to think much of such thing on spur of moment when be introduced to sophia did not seem to be taken with in wonderful way augustus have asked mother to help have laughed at must be splendid arrangement have said with energy nonsense gu have answered must always let thing take chance will ask of be that fall in love with think family must be nice enough for felix graham certainly be ungrateful for friendship spent upon so friend felt augustus have contrived to whisper into lady ear that mr graham be cleverest young man now rising at bar a far a be concerned amount of intimacy might at rate have be produced graham must not put forward will pique into said augustus to therefore when on occasion came into drawing room staveley immediately took vacant seat beside miss furnival with very friendly object have proposed to there be great danger in for miss furnival be certainly handsome augustus staveley be very susceptible what will not man go through for friend hope be to have honour of company a far a monkton grange day meet there said hound be to meet at monkton grange seven mile from noningsby sportsman from house be to be there will be delighted said sophia be to say if seat in carriage can be spared for will mount know that be horsewoman in answer to miss furnival confessed that be horsewoman owned also to having brought habit hat with will be delightful madeline will ride also will meet miss tristram be famous horsewoman of part of country mean that go after dog across hedge indeed do doe miss staveley do oh madeline be not good at five barred gate must make very bad hand at double ditch if be inclined to remain among tame people will be true to side will certainly be one of tame people mr staveley rather think will be with have only one horse will jump well graham will ride by by miss furnival what do think of friend graham think of be bound to have thought anything about by time of course be at rate of course have have doubt that have composed in own mind essay on character of everybody here people who think at always do do essay upon then be very short one perhaps not le correct on account must allow to read like other essay of kind mr staveley have be composed solely for own use will be kept quite private be so sorry for for intended to propose bargain to if must have shown of essay must have be equally liberal with of mine in way before evening be over augustus staveley miss furnival became very good friend upon word be very clever girl said afterwards a young orme graham be sitting with in outside room have be fitted up for smoking uncommonly handsome said peregrine say will have lot of money said graham after staveley perhaps must not do better be not style at said of course man be obliged to be civil to girl in own house then went to bed chapter xx mr dockwrath in own office in conversation have taken place after dinner at noningsby with regard to mason peregrine orme took part silence have not arisen from want of interest on subject have be over to hamworth day on very special mission regarding a be not inclined to speak of what have then seen done held tongue altogether want to do great favour lucius have said to when two be together in breakfast parlour at noningsby be afraid will give trouble sha' mind said peregrine if be have heard of row about joseph mason mother have be so talked of fear must have heard about lawsuit oh yes have certainly be spoken of at cleeve of course have world be talking of now there be man named dockwrath in hamworth then went on to explain how have reached from various quarter mr dockwrath be accusing mother of crime of forgery how have endeavoured to persuade mother to indict man for libel how mother have pleaded to with tear in eye that found impossible to go through ordeal how therefore have resolved to go to mr dockwrath said must have one with gentleman whom can trust therefore have ridden over to ask to accompany a far a hamworth suppose be not man that can kick said peregrine be afraid not said lucius be over forty year old have dozen of child then be such low beast said peregrine have idea of kicking think must be wrong to allow to go on saying frightful thing of mother without showing that be not afraid of upon two young men got on horseback riding into hamworth put horse up at inn now suppose might a well go at once said peregrine with very serious face yes said other there be nothing to delay can not tell how much obliged be to for coming with oh say anything about of course be only too happy same felt that heart be beating that be little nervous have be called upon to go in thrash somebody must have be quite at home did not feel at ease in making inimical visit to attorney office must have be wise perhaps if in matter lucius have submitted to lady mason wish on previous evening have talked matter over with much serious energy lucius have be told in street of hamworth by intermeddling little busybody of apothecary that behoved to do something a mr dockwrath be making grievous accusation against mother lucius have replied haughtily that mother must know how to protect apothecary have retreated resolving to spread report everywhere lucius on return home have declared to unfortunate lady that have now no alternative left to must bring action against man at rate put matter into hand of lawyer with view of ascertaining whether must do so with chance of success if must not must then make known reason for remaining quiet in answer to lady mason have begun by praying son to allow matter to pas by will not pas by lucius have said yes dearest if leave will in month two can hing by interference remember old saying can not touch pitch without being defiled lucius have replied almost with anger that pitch have already touched that be defiled can not consent to hold property have said unless something be done then mother have bowed head a sat have covered face with hand will go to man lucius have declared with energy a mother lucius implore not to do so have said to through tear must either do leave country be impossible must live here hearing such thing said of doing nothing to clear name to have made actual reply now be standing at attorney door about to do have threatened found dockwrath sitting at desk at other side of be seated clerk have not yet promoted to dignity of private office generally used parlour a such when be desirous of seeing client without disturbance on occasion however when saw young mason enter made offer to withdraw hat be on head a sat on stool did not even take off a returned stiff salutation of visitor keep hat on head mr orme said a peregrine be about to take off well gentleman what can do for lucius looked at clerk felt that there must be great difficulty in talking about mother before witness wish to see in private mr dockwrath for few minute if be convenient be not private enough said dockwrath there be one here confidential clerk if must make convenient began lucius well then mr mason can not make convenient there be long short of have brought mr orme with to hear what have got to say choose that clerk will remain by to hear also seeing position in stand there be knowing what may come of such interview a in what position do stand sir if know mr mason be not going to tell feel for do upon word feel for pity mr dockwrath a thus expressed commiseration be sitting with high chair tilted back with knee against edge of desk with hat almost down upon nose a looked at visitor from under amused by cutting up quill pen into small piece with penknife be not pleasant to be pitied by such man a so peregrine orme conceived sir be nonsense said lucius require pity from from man suppose there be one in hamworth doe not feel for said dockwrath mean to be impudent said peregrine have better come to point with at once mean to be impudent young gentleman man may speak own mind in own house suppose without impudence must stand cap in hand to if be to go down to at cleeve have come here to ask of said whether be true that be spreading report about town with reference to lady mason if be man will tell truth well rather think be man be necessary that lady mason must be protected from such infamous falsehood may be necessary to bring matter into court of law may be quite easy about mr mason will be necessary a may be necessary wish to know whether will acknowledge that report have come from want to give evidence against well for once in way mind if do report have come from now be that manly mr dockwrath a spoke pushed hat somewhat off nose looked steadily across into face of opponent lucius mason be too young for task have undertaken allowed to be disconcerted have expected that lawyer must deny charge be prepared for what must say do in case now be not prepared how on earth must bring to be guilty of such villainy said young orme highty tighty what be talking about young man fact be know what be talking about a have respect for grandfather for mother will give piece of advice gratis let be too thick with lady mason till see how matter go mr dockwrath said lucius be mean low vile scoundrel very well sir adam just take note of mind what mr orme said can easily excuse will know truth before long then will beg pardon will take oath look upon a greatest miscreant that ever met said peregrine who be of course bound to support friend will change mind mr orme before long then will find that have met worse miscreant than be did put down word adam a mr mason spoke yes have got down read said master clerk read mr dockwrath be mean low vile scoundrel now young gentleman if have got nothing else to observe a be rather busy perhaps will allow to wish good morning very well mr dockwrath said mason may be sure that will hear further from will be sure to hear of other there be doubt in world about said attorney then two young men withdrew with unexpressed feeling in mind of of that have not so completely got better of antagonist a justice of case demanded then remounted horse accompanied friend a far a orley farm from whence got into alston road through cleeve ground what do intend to do now said peregrine a soon a be mounted will employ lawyer said on own footing not mother lawyer one else then suppose will be guided by advice have done before made visit to mr dockwrath perhaps might have be better sat very heavily on poor peregrine mind therefore a company be talking about lady mason after dinner remained silent listening not joining in conversation whole of evening lucius mother sat together saying nothing there be not absolutely quarrel between on terrible subject there be utter want of accordance almost of sympathy be not that lucius have ever for moment suspected mother of aught be wrong have done so might perhaps have be more gentle towards in thought word not only fully trusted be quite fixed in confidence that nothing must shake in right under circumstance must not understand how must consent to endure without resistance indignity be put upon must combat for sake if not for own said to over over again have said so also to word have have effect on other hand felt that be cruel to be weighed down almost to ground by suffering have fallen on yet must not be gentle soft to must have borne thought if must have borne with still hoped that if remained quiet further trial must take place at rate might be so that must be so have assurance of mr furnival yet evil dreaded worse than death be to be precipitated on by son so sat through long evening speechless seated with pretence of reading of capable of attention book requires did not tell then that have be with mr dockwrath knew by manner that have taken terrible step waited patiently whole evening hoping that must tell when hour came for to go up to room have told nothing if now be to turn against must be worse than went up to room sat down to think passed through brain on night may not now tell grief pressed on at moment with peculiar weight be self will obstinacy of boy said to herself that must be willing now to die to give back life at once if such might be god pleasure that son must bring down hair with shame sorrow to grave in thought there be bitterness of agony knew not how to endure next morning at breakfast still remained silent brow be still black lucius said did do anything in matter yesterday yes saw mr dockwrath well took peregrine orme with might have witness then asked whether have spread report acknowledged that have done so told that be villain upon hearing uttered long low sigh said nothing what use must there now be in saying aught look of agony went to young man heart still thought that have be right mother continued to say be very sorry to grieve in way very sorry must not hold up head in hamworth must not hold up head anywhere if heard thing said of did not resent ah lucius if knew weakness of woman therefore must let bear there be nothing must not suffer cost must not undergo rather than must endure if must only say that must leave to can not be left to have gone to lawyer to mr furnival why will not permit must act in a think best can not believe that will be best for of if wish will see mr furnival lady mason did not wish that be obliged so far to yield a to say that might do so if must wish be that must bear say nothing be not that be indifferent to good repute among neighbour that be careless a to what apothecary attorney said of be easier for to bear evil than to combat ormes furnivals must support such like person must acknowledge weakness must know that from must not be expected such loud outbursting indignation a might be expected from man have calculated strength of own weakness thought that might still be supported by if only son must so permit be two day after lucius be allowed honour of conference by appointment with great lawyer at expiration of hour delay be shown into room by mr crabwitz crabwitz said barrister before addressed to young friend just run eye over paper let bideawhile have to morrow morning crabwitz yes sir that opinion of sir richard in ahatualpaca mining company have not seen have be ready mr furnival will look at in five minute now young friend what can do for be quite clear from mr furnival tone manner that did not mean to devote much time to lucius mason that be not generally anxious to hold conversation with on subject in question such indeed be case mr furnival be determined to pull lady mason out of sea of trouble into have fallen let effort cost what might did not wish to do so by instrumentality even with aid of son mr furnival began mason want to ask advice about dreadful report be being spread on side in hamworth about mother if will allow then to say so think that course must pursue be very simple indeed there be think only one course can pursue with proper deference to mother feeling what be mr furnival hing say nothing fear from what have heard that have already done said much more than be prudent how be to hear such thing a spoken of own mother depends on people by whom thing be spoken in world if meet chimney sweep in path hustle with for right of way mother be going next week to cleeve be only yesterday that heard that noningsby people be going to call on can hardly suppose desire for mother better friend than such a can not understand why such people gather to at moment if can understand will not trouble to interfere much more with mr dockwrath there be rebuke in lucius mason be forced to endure nevertheless a retreated disconcerted from barrister chamber must not bring to think right that such calumny must be borne without resistance knew little a yet of ordinary life of gentleman in england did know so at least thought that be duty of son to shield mother from insult libel chapter xxi christmas in harley street seems singular to considering idea have in own mind of character of lady staveley must be driven to declare about time committed unpardonable offence not only against good nature also against domestic propriety be driven so to say although be of woman most good natured most domestic for asked mr furnival to pas christmas day at noningsby find impossible to forgive offence against poor wife whom in case must leave alone by desolate hearth knew that be married man a well a do sophia who have proper regard for domestic peace of parent who must have be happy at noningsby without father care not unfrequently spoke of so that existence in harley street might not be forgotten by staveleys explaining however a did so that dear mother never left own fireside in winter so that suspicion might be entertained that invitation be desired for also nevertheless in spite of on two separate occasion did lady staveley say to mr furnival that might a well prolong visit over christmas yet lady staveley be not attached to mr furnival with peculiar warmth of friendship be one of woman whose foolish heart will not allow to be controlled in exercise of hospitality nature demanded of that must ask guest to stay must not have allowed dog to depart from house at season of year without suggesting to that have better take christmas bone in yard be for mr furnival to adjust matter between wife be not bound to accept invitation because gave finding there already present in house did feel bound to give for offence a have said before can not bring to forgive at sin in staying away from home rather a far a story have yet carried in thinking that must do so be by mean so much surprised angry ill pleased wife be pleasant companion for gentleman on long evening for who have managed that thing will run smoothly over domestic rug there be happier time of life than long candlelight hour of home silence spoken content uttered satisfaction be necessary fact be felt be enough for peace when fact be not felt when fact be by mean there when thought be running in direction altogether different when bitter grievance from one to other fill heart rather than memory of mutual kindness then say long candlelight hour of home silence be not easy of endurance mr furnival be man

so anxious a have done tom when know what going on be with nasty sly false woman like wo bear there be end in saying final word mr furnival rose from seat thrice struck hand by mean lightly on loo table in middle of room did not think possible that must be so silly did not indeed oh yes silly very well woman always be silly when mind that kind of thing have got anything else to say sir yes have have to say will not endure sort of usage wo said mr furnival so may a well understand at once a long a there be nothing absolutely wrong must put up with for sake of appearance because of sophia for mind what loneliness may have to bear if have be called on to go out to east indie even to china must have put up with sort of thing wo put up with wo be blind to what ca help seeing so now mr furnival may know have made up mind then without waiting further parley having wisked in energy near to door stalked out went up with hurried step to own room occurrence of nature such a be in respect unpleasant in household let master be ever so much master what be to do say that wife be wrong from beginning to end of quarrel that in way improves matter anxiety be that world abroad will not know have ought amiss at home with hot sense of injury loud revolt against supposed wrong care not who hears hold tongue madam husband say wife bound though be by oath of obedience will not obey only scream louder a mr furnival sat there thinking of disturbed mind much that martha biggs must spread tale through bloomsbury st pancras of course be aware if drive to must be so said to at last then also betook to rest so be that preparation for christmas be made in harley street chapter xxii christmas at house at noningsby on christmas day be quite full yet be by mean small house mr arbuthnot judge married daughter be there with three child mr furnival be there having got over domestic difficulty in lately saw a best might lucius mason be there having be especially asked by lady staveley when heard that mother be to be at cleeve there must be no more comfortable country house than noningsby be in own way pretty though essentially different in respect from cleeve be new house from cellar to ceiling a house be doubt better for being so room be of proper proportion newest appliance for comfort have be attached to nevertheless lacked that something in appearance rather than in fact age alone can give to residence of gentleman in country garden also be new ground around trim square orderly noningsby be delightful house one with money taste at command must have created for one more delightful then there be delight can not be created even by money taste be pleasant sight to see long broad well filled breakfast table with company round there be eighteen twenty gathered now at table among whom judge sat pre eminent looming large in arm chair having double space allotted to eighteen twenty child included at bottom of table sat lady staveley who still chose to preside among own tea cup a lady must do close to assisting in toil of presidency sat daughter madeline nearest to be gathered child rest have formed into little party of already well knew own place at board in how very short time will come upon one pleasant custom of sitting in accustomed place here at noningsby breakfast among other custom already established there be one by augustus staveley be always privileged to sit by side of sophia furnival doubt original object be still unchanged match between lady friend graham be still desirable by perseverance might pique felix graham to arouse hitherto felix graham have not aroused in direction one two people among party be inclined to mistake young staveley intention gu sister have said to night before declare think be going to make love to sophia furnival do have replied a rule think there be one in world for whose discernment have so much respect a have for yours in respect even be wrong ah of course say so if wo believe ask what more can say certainly sha' ask for know well enough be very clever girl let tell that whoever fall in love with be sure be be handsome too very for be not good enough for gu of course be not therefore be not thinking of now go to bed dream that have got queen of fortunate island for sister in law although staveley be perfectly indifferent to charm of miss furnival nevertheless must hardly restrain dislike to lucius mason who a thought be disposed to admire lady in question in talking of lucius to own family to special friend graham have called conceited pedantic uncouth unenglish detestable own family be mother sister rarely contradicted in anything graham be by mean so cautious usually contradicted in everything indeed there be sign of sterling worth so plainly marked in staveley character a full conviction entertained of superiority of friend felix be quite wrong about felix have said have not be at english school english university therefore be not like other young men that know be think well educated clever a for conceit what man will do good who be not conceited nobody hold good opinion of man who have low opinion of same dear fellow like lucius mason one else if remember did not like dr fell now good people what be going to do about church said staveley while be still engaged with roll egg will walk said judge will go in carriage said judge wife that disposes of two now will take hour to settle for rest miss furnival doubt will accompany mother a will be among walker will see how much sacrifice by suggestion be mile to church miss furnival knew advantage of appearing in seat unfatigued without subjection to wind mud rain must confess said that under circumstance will prefer mother company to yours whereupon staveley in completion of arrangement assigned other place in carriage to married lady of company have taken sister madeline seat in carriage protested sophia with great dismay sister madeline generally walk then of course will walk with when time came miss furnival did go in carriage whereas miss staveley went on foot so fell out a started that graham found walking at miss staveley side to great disgust doubt of dozen other aspirant for honour can not help thinking said a stepped briskly over crisp white frost that christmas day of ours be great mistake oh mr graham exclaimed need not regard with horror at least not with special horror on occasion what say be very horrid that flatter seems so only because have not yet said that part of christmas day be made to be in degree sacred be by mean mistake be glad think that rather be not mistake in a far a be in degree made sacred peculiar conviviality of day be so ponderous roast beefiness oppresses one so thoroughly from first moment of one waking to last ineffectual effort at bit of fried pudding for supper need not eat fried pudding for supper indeed here be afraid will not have supper offered at not to individually under name might also manage to guard own self under such offer there be always flavour of sweetmeat in air of sweetmeat edible non edible begrudge child snap dragon be what mean mr graham deny unpremeditated snap dragon be dear to soul must expend in blindman buff will then after dinner for of course know that dine early blindman buff at three with snap dragon at quarter to four charade at five with wine sweet cake at half past six be ponderous be mistake big turkey must be very good capital fun to see turkey twice a big a ought to be big turkey mountain of beef pudding weighing hundredweight oppress one spirit by combined gravity then impart memory of indigestion halo a be of apoplexy even to church service agree with least in world ask to answer fairly be not additional eating ordinary englishman ordinary idea of christmas day be only ordinary englishwoman therefore can not say be not idea believe that ceremony a kept by be perpetuated by butcher beersellers with helping hand from grocer be essentially material festival must not object to even on account if be not so grievously overdone how sun be moistening frost on ground a come back road will be quite wet will be going home then will not signify remember mr graham will expect to come forward in great strength for blindman buff a gave required promise thought that even sport of christmas day must be bearable if also be to make one of sportsman then entered church illustration christmas at noningsby morning know of anything more pleasant to eye than pretty country church decorated for christmas day effect in city be altogether different will not say that church there must not be decorated comparatively be matter of indifference one know who doe peculiar munificence of squire who have sacrificed holly bush be not appreciated work of finger have be employed be not recognised effort made for hanging pendent wreath to capital have be of special interest to large number of worshipper have be done by contract probably even if well done have none of grace of association here at noningsby church winter flower have be cut by madeline gardener red berry have be grouped by own hand vicar wife have stood together with perilous audacity on top of clerk desk while fixed branch beneath cushion of old fashioned turret from sermon be preached have of course be talked about at house of party have gone over to see including sophia furnival who have declared that nothing must be so delightful though have omitted to endanger finger by participation in work child have regarded operation a triumph of be wonderful in decoration thus many of have be made happy on return from church miss furnival insisted on walking in order a said that miss staveley might not have fatigue miss staveley must walk also carriage after certain amount of expostulation delay went off with load incomplete now for plum pudding part of arrangement said felix graham yes mr graham said madeline now for plum pudding blindman buff did ever see anything more perfect than church mr mason said sophia anything more perfect in sort of way perhaps never have seen choir of cologne come come be not fair said graham import cologne in order to crush here down in little english village never saw choir of cologne bright with holly berry have with cardinal stocking bishop robe think must prefer holly said miss furnival why must not church always look like only changing flower foliage with season must make service so attractive must hardly do at lent said madeline in serious tone perhaps not at lent exactly peregrine augustus staveley be walking on in front not perhaps a well satisfied with day a rest of party augustus on leaving church have made little effort to assume place a usual by miss furnival side by accident of war mason be there before have not cared to make one of party of three therefore have gone on in advance with young orme be peregrine much more happy did not know why felt within breast growing aversion to felix graham graham be puppy thought fellow talked too much then be such confoundedly ugly dog peregrine orme did not like be not man to analyze own feeling in such matter did not ask why must have be rejoiced to hear that instant business have taken felix graham off to hong kong knew that must have rejoiced knew also that madeline staveley be did not know what be when be alone carried on with manner of imaginary conversation though when be in company have hardly word to say to under circumstance fraternized with brother even in must not receive much satisfaction seeing that must not abuse graham to graham special friend must breathe sigh a to madeline perfection into ear of madeline brother child there be three four assembled there besides belonging to mr arbuthnot be by mean inclined to agree with mr graham stricture a to amusement of christmas day to appeared that must not hurry fast enough into vortex of dissipation dinner be serious consideration especially with reference to certain illuminated mince pie be crowning glory of banquet time for be almost begrudged in order that fast handkerchief might be tied over eye of first blindman now will go into schoolroom said marian arbuthnot jumping up leading way come along mr felix felix graham followed madeline have declared that felix graham must be blinded first such be doom now mind catch mr felix pray do said marian when have got seated in corner of room be

child that wife sweetheart must be made how be to find when eye be blinded oh can feel know can put hand on top of head must speak know be sure will laugh then must guess that be marian be idea of playing blindman buff according to strict rigour of game will give big kiss said felix yes when have done playing promised with great seriousness then huge white silk handkerchief a big a small sail be brought down from grandpapa dressing room so that nobody must see least bit in world a marian have observed with great energy work of blinding be commenced ai big enough to reach round said marian who have made effort in vain do aunt mad tendered handkerchief to miss staveley who however did not appear very eager to undertake task will be executioner said more especially a will not take other share in ceremony will be chair of doom come here mr graham submit to so first victim be blinded mind remember said marian whispering into ear a be led away green spirit white blue spirit gray then be twirled round in room left to commence search a best might marian arbuthnot be not only soft little laughing darling that wished to be caught blinded so that there be great pulling at blindman tail much grasping at outstretched arm before desired object be attained wandered round room skilfully a though thought be in mind false to treaty with marian a though imagined for moment that other prize might be caught if so other prize evaded carefully in due progress of play marian soft curl be within grasp be sure did speak say word said a ran up to grandmother to have handkerchief put over eye did grandmamma there be more way of speaking than one said lady staveley mr graham understand other think oh be caught quite fairly said marian now lead round round to at rate festivity of christmas day be not too ponderous for real enjoyment then at last somebody caught judge rather think be madeline time in truth be come have chance of escape whole room be set upon capture though barricaded with chair child be duly apprehended named be papa know by watch chain for made nonsense dear said judge will do such thing must never catch anybody must remain blind for ever grandpapa must said marian be game that must be blinded when be caught suppose game be that must be whipped when be caught be to catch said augustus must not play game said marian oh papa must said madeline do will catch mr furnival must be temptation said judge have never be able to do yet though have be trying for year justice be blind said graham why must judge be ashamed to follow example of own goddess so at last owner of ermine submitted stern magistrate of bench be led round with due incantation of spirit dismissed into chaos to seek for new victim illustration christmas at noningsby evening one of rule of blindman buff at noningsby be that must not be played by candlelight rule be in way judicious a thereby end be secured for might otherwise be unending therefore when became so dark in schoolroom that there be not much difference between blind man others handkerchief be smuggled away game be at end now for snap dragon said marian exactly a predicted mr graham said madeline blindman buff at quarter past three snap dragon at five revoke word uttered for be never more amused in life will be prepared to endure wine sweet cake when come prepared to endure anything go through everything will be allowed candle now suppose oh by mean snap dragon by candlelight who ever heard of such thing must wash dragon out of leave nothing snap be necessity of game that must be played in dark rather by own lurid light oh there be lurid light be there will see then turned away to make preparation to game of snap dragon a played at noningsby ghost be always necessary aunt madeline have played ghost ever since have be aunt there have be necessity for part in previous year spectator have be fewer in number more closely connected with family think must drop ghost on occasion said coming up to brother will disgust dreadfully if do said young sebrights have come specially to see ghost well can do ghost for ca act ghost miss furnival 'd make lovely ghost will be most happy to be useful said sophia oh aunt mad must be ghost said marian following foolish little thing be going to have beautiful ghost divine ghost said uncle gu want madeline to be ghost said big miss sebright ten eleven year old be always ghost said marian to be sure will be much better said miss furnival only offered poor service hoping to be useful banquo that ever lived must leave worse ghost behind than must prove ended in there being two ghost have become quite impossible to rob miss furnival of promised part madeline must not refuse to solve difficulty in way without making more of matter than deserved idea of two ghost be delightful to child more especially a entailed two large dish full of raisin two blue fire blazing up from burnt brandy so girl went out not without proffered assistance from gentleman after painfully long interval of fifteen twenty minute for miss furnival back hair must not come down adjust into ghostlike length with a much readiness a of friend returned bearing dish before on large tray in of spirit be lighted a entered schoolroom door thus a walked in be illuminated by dark blue flame carried be not grand said marian appealing to felix graham uncommonly grand replied ghost do think be grandest will tell ghost like best in secret know like aunt mad best think be grandest too will tell in secret think same to mind be grandest ghost ever saw in life be indeed asked marian solemnly thinking probably that new friend experience in ghost must be extensive however that might be thought that a far a experience in woman went have never seen anything more lovely than madeline staveley dressed in long white sheet with long bit of white cambric pinned round face may be presumed that dress altogether be not unbecoming when accompanied by blue flame for augustus staveley lucius mason thought same thing of miss furnival whereas peregrine orme did not know whether be standing on head foot a looked at miss staveley miss furnival may possibly have have inkling of when offered to undertake task protest that such be not case with madeline there be second thought in mind when first declined ghosting afterwards undertook part wish to look beautiful in eye of felix graham have come to at rate a yet a to peregrine orme have hardly thought of existence by heaven said peregrine to be most beautiful creature ever saw then began to speculate within own mind how idea might be received at cleeve there be such realised idea with felix graham saw that madeline staveley be very beautiful felt in unconscious manner that character be very sweet may have thought that might have loved girl have such love be thing permitted to be far from being case felix graham lot in life a regarded that share heart might have in be already marked out for marked out for by future wife of bosom have already be selected be now in course of preparation for duty of future life be one of few wise men who have determined not to take partner in life at hazard to mould young mind character to pursuit mode of thought may best fit woman for duty will have to perform what little may be necessary to know of earlier year of mary snow will be told hereafter here will be only necessary to say that be orphan a yet be little more than child that owed maintenance advantage of education to charity love of destined husband therefore a have said be manifest that felix graham must not think of falling in love with miss staveley even have not very low position in reference to worldly affair made such passion on part quite hopeless with peregrine orme matter be different there must be possible reason why peregrine orme must not win wear beautiful girl whom so much admired ghost be kept standing over flame spirit be becoming exhausted raisin will be burnt at snap dragon too ghost here have something to do law of game be law on marian must have insisted have not flame be so very hot that raisin will become prey of audacious marauder only who dare to face presence of ghost to plunge hand into burning dish a rule boy do clawing out raisin while girl pick up eat here at boy be too little to act thus a pioneer in face of enemy raisin might have remained till flame be burnt out have not beneficent ghost scattered abroad richness of own treasure now marian said felix graham bringing up in arm will burn mr felix look there see there be great many at end do must have kiss then very well yes if get five then felix dashed hand in among flame brought forth fistful of fruit imparted to finger wristband smell of brandy for rest of evening if take so many at time will rap knuckle with spoon said ghost a stirred up flame to keep alive ghost must speak said marian who be evidently unacquainted with best ghost of tragedy ghost must speak when such large hand invade caldron then raid be effected threatened blow be given have one told in morning that must day have rapped mr graham knuckle with kitchen spoon must not have believed that person be thus that heart be lost won peregrine orme looked on from distance thinking of that must have be stricken dumb by beauty of girl be surprising even to for though young almost boyish in manner have never yet feared to speak out in presence tutor at college have thought insolent beyond parallel grandfather though loved for open face plain outspoken word found sometimes almost too much for now stood there looking longing must not summon courage to go up address few word to young girl even in midst of sport twice thrice during last few day have essayed to speak to word have be dull vapid to have appeared childish be quite conscious of own weakness more than once during period of snap dragon did say to that must descend into list break lance in tourney still did not descend lance remained inglorious in rest at other end of long table ghost also have two attendant knight of refrained from battle augustus staveley if thought worth while to keep list at must not be allowed to ride through unopposed from backwardness on part of rival lucius mason be not likely to become timid silent longing lover to be not possible that must fear girl whom loved must not worship that wished to obtain for may be doubted whether have much faculty of worshipping anything in truest meaning of word one worship one feel through inner unexpressed conviction of mind to be greater better higher than be not probable that lucius mason must so think of woman that might meet to give due be probable that must be in way afraid of man that might encounter must fear neither talent rank money influence dexterity of such rival in attempt that might make on woman heart must regard own chance a good against of other possible augustus staveley be master here at noningsby be clever dashing handsome fashionable young fellow lucius mason never dreamed of retreating before such force a have word with to speak a fair a of man flattered that a well knew how to use be pretty to see with what admirable tact judicious management of smile sophia received homage of two young men answering compliment of with ease so conducting that must fairly accuse of undue favour to other unfairly in own mind augustus did so accuse why must have be so venomous seeing that entertained regard for lady object be still plain enough that namely of making match between needy friend heiress needy friend in mean time played on through long evening in thoughtless happiness peregrine orme looking at game from distance saw that rap given to favoured knuckle with bitterness of heart inner groaning of spirit will not be incomprehensible to many do so love that mr felix said marian a aunt madeline kissed in little bed on wishing good night aunt mad so be that christmas day be passed at noningsby chapter xxiii christmas at groby park christmas day be always time of very great trial to mr mason of groby park behoved a wife of old english country gentleman to spread board plenteously at season in sort to make open house of must not bring to spread board with plenty idea of open house must almost break heart unlimited eating there be something in very sound of such word be appalling to inner woman on christmas day be doomed to go through ordeal of very peculiar severity so happened that cure of soul in parish of groby have be intrusted for last two three year to young energetic not very opulent curate why rector of groby must be altogether absent leaving work in hand of curate whom paid by lease of cottage garden fifty five pound year thereby behaving a imagined with extensive liberality be unnecessary here to inquire such be case rev adolphus green with mr green four child managed to live with difficulty on produce of garden allotted stipend must not probably have lived at in position have not mr adolphus green be blessed with small fortune have so happened that mr adolphus green have be instrumental in imparting knowledge of singing to two of miss mason have continued instruction over last three year have not be done in preconcerted way lesson have grown by chance mr mason while have looked on with satisfied eye at arrangement be so much to taste there be regular lesson know have said to husband when suggested that reward for so much work must be expedient mr green find convenient to have use of drawing room must never see instrument from year end to year end if be not allowed to come up here depend upon get great deal more than give after two year of tuition mr mason have spoken second time dear said can not allow girl to accept so great favour from mr green without making compensation see that be at necessary mr mason have answered if think so must send down hamper of apple be basketful now happened that apple be very plentiful that year that curate wife be blessed with a many a must judiciously consume apple nonsense said mr mason if mean money dear must do must so offend lady for world must buy something handsome in way of furniture little room of theirs that call drawing room have nothing in at get jones from leeds to send thing will do for hence after many inner misgiving have arisen that purchase of drawing room set from mr kantwise set of metallic louey catorse furniture containing three table eight chair c c a to may be remembered that mr mason made undoubted bargain getting for le than cost price that have be strained a mr kantwise admitted in discoursing on subject to mr dockwrath be not matter of much moment must do extremely well for curate wife now on christmas day present be to be made over to happy lady mr mr green be to dine at groby park leaving more fortunate child to fuller festivity of cottage intention be that before dinner whole drawing room set must be made over be with grievous pang of heart that mr mason looked forward to operation own house be plenteously furnished from kitchen to attic still must have loved to keep metallic set of painted trumpery knew that table must not screw on knew that pivot of music stool be bent knew that there be place in house in must stand must have known that in possible way must be of use to hers yet must not part with without agony husband be infatuated in matter of

looked round over shoulder at kenneby then shut eye be name of man whom left in commercial room at bull said snengkeld went out to mason at groby park same day said moulder then be same man said kenneby there be a much solemnity in tone of voice a though unravelment of mystery of iron mask be now about to take place mr kantwise still said nothing also perceived that be same man let tell john kenneby said moulder with air of one who understood well subject that be discussing if two be same man then man who wrote that letter to be a big blackguard a there be from to hisself mr moulder in excitement of moment puffed hard at pipe took long pull at drink dragged open waistcoat know whether kantwise have anything to say upon subject added moulder not word at present said kantwise mr kantwise be very careful man usually calculated with accuracy value might extract from circumstance with reference to own main chance mr dockwrath have not a yet paid for set of metallic furniture therefore also might well have joined in sweeping accusation might be that by judicious use of what now heard might obtain payment of little bill perhaps other collateral advantage then letter from dockwrath to kenneby be brought forth read dear john began for two have known other when be lad together went on to request kenneby attendance at hamworth for short space of few hour want to have little conversation with about matter of considerable interest to of a can not expect to undertake expense enclose money order for thirty shilling be in earnest at rate said mr moulder mistake about

not like business talking on christmas night said mr moulder when matter be arranged what can one do asked moulder be tempting of providence in mind said kantwise a replenished glass turned eye up to ceiling now be gammon said moulder then there arose among long animated discussion on matter theological will tell what idea of death be said moulder after while ai bit afeard of father be honest man

made thousand of pound along of have never lost none who can say more than when took to old girl there insured life so that must want wittles drink oh m ai afeard to die snengkeld old pal hand brandy such be modern philosophy of moulders pig out of sty of epicurus so be passed christmas day in great st helen chapter xxv mr furnival again at chamber christmas doings at cleeve be not very gay there be visitor there except lady mason be known that be in trouble must not however be supposed that constantly bewailed while there made friend miserable by succession of hysterical tear by mean made effort to be serene effort be successful a such effort usually be on morning of christmas day duly attended church lady mason be seen by hamworth sitting in cleeve pew in way must baronet friendship have be shown more plainly than in must more significant mark of intimacy have be given sir peregrine well understood people of hamworth have chosen to talk scandal about lady mason at rate must show how little attention paid to falsehood that there be circulated so stood by at pew door a entered with a much deference a though have be duchess people of hamworth looking on wondered must be right mr dockwrath sir peregrine after dinner sir peregrine gave toast lady mason will drink health of absent boy god bless hope be enjoying god bless said mr orme putting handkerchief to eye god bless said lady mason also putting handkerchief to eye then lady left room be extent of special festivity robert said sir peregrine immediately afterwards to butler let have what port wine want in servant hall within measure yes sir peregrine robert will not want again thank sir peregrine from may be imagined that christmas doings at cleeve be chiefly maintained below stair do hope be happy said mr orme when two lady be together in drawing room have very nice party at noningsby boy will be happy be sure said lady mason why not lucius also be sweet in lady mason ear to hear son called by christian name increasing sign of interest intimacy be sweet especially signified favour shown to son trouble weighs heavy on replied be only natural that must feel papa doe not seem to think much of said mr orme if be must strive to forget do strive said other then took hand mr orme have stretched out to that lady got up kissed dearest friend said mr orme if can comfort will then sobbed in other arm in mean time sir peregrine be sitting alone thinking sat thinking with glass of claret untouched by side with biscuit have taken lying untouched upon table a sat have raised one leg upon other placing foot on knee held there with hand upon instep so sat without moving for quarter of hour trying to use mind on subject occupied at last roused almost with start leaving chair walked three four time length of room why must not at last said to stopping suddenly placing hand upon table why must not if plea will not injure then walked again will ask edith said still speaking to if say that disapproves of will not do then left room while wine still remained untasted on table illustration why must not on day following christmas mr furnival went up to town mr round junior mat round a be called in profession came to at chamber promise have be made to barrister by round crook that active step must be taken against lady mason on part of joseph mason of groby without notice being given to mr furnival visit by appointment be made in consequence of promise see said matthew round when visit be nearly brought to close that be pressed very hard to go on with if somebody else will nevertheless if be must decline said mr furnival be looking to client not to ours sir said attorney fact be that whole case be very queer be proved on last trial that bolster kenneby be witness to deed on th of july be be proved now can prove that be on day witness to deed be witness to two why must not be be for to see have written to to come up to in order that might be quite on square thought right to tell thank yes can not complain of what form do think that proceeding will take joseph mason talk of indicting for forgery said attorney pausing moment before dared to pronounce dread word indict for forgery said furnival with start yet idea be one have be for day present to mind eye say so said round have a yet seen none of witness myself if be prepared to prove that did sign two separate document on day thing must pas off be clear to mr furnival that even mr round junior must be glad that must pas off then also sat thinking might not be probable that with little judicious exercise of memory two witness must remember that have signed two document at rate looking to lapse of time that might be induced to forget altogether whether have signed one two three even if must be mystified so that nothing must be proved must still be well with client indeed magistrate must commit such person a lady mason especially after so long interval grand jury must find bill against except upon evidence be clear well defined almost indubitable if point of doubt must be shown might be brought off without trial if only must be true to herself at former trial there be existing codicil fact also that two surviving reputed witness must not deny signature signature if be genuine signature have be attached with proper formality form used went to state that testator have signed instrument in presence of being present together at same time survivor have asserted that when did affix name three be then present a be also sir joseph there have be terrible doubt even then a to identity of document doubt also a to there having be signature made by one of reputed witness by one namely who at time of trial be dead now document be forthcoming purporting to have be witnessed on same day by two surviving witness if document be genuine if two survivor must be clear that have written name once on th of july in such case must be possible to quash further public inquiry criminal prosecution might not be possible a first proceeding if estate be recovered at common law must not criminal prosecution follow a matter of course then mr furnival thought over again again if document be genuine new document man dockwrath stated that have found deed of separation of partnership purported to have be executed on th of july be now one important question if be genuine why must there not be a strong question of honesty of document a of other mr furnival well knew that fraudulent deed must be forged produced without motive that if impugned deed must show motive motive enough there be doubt mason might have have forged in order to get property dockwrath to gratify revenge in such case must be forgery of present day there must have be motive for forgery twenty year ago paper writing attested signature of martock other party to must prove that have not be got up manufactured now dockwrath must not dare to bring forward forgery a there be hope of such result might not furnival if matter be pushed before jury make think that two document stood balanced against other lady mason respectability long possession together with vile malignity of antagonist gave greater probability of honesty to disputed codicil mr furnival did think that might induce jury to acquit terribly feared that might not be able to induce world to acquit also a thought of case seemed to put apart from world at large did not question a to own belief seemed to feel that must suffice for if must so bring about other friend must think innocent must by mean suffice for to secure for son property for simple acquittal be not that dreaded idea of thinking guilty perhaps did so think now half thought so at rate greatly dreaded idea of others thinking so might be well to buy up dockwrath if be possible if be possible then be not possible that must have hand in such matter must crabwitz do no thought not then at moment be not certain that must depend on crabwitz why must trouble in way mr furnival be man loyal to friend at heart have lady mason be man have pulled that man through great difficulty in early life must have be loyally desirous of carrying through same similar difficulty at after period in cause have once battled be always ready to do battle without reference to professional consideration of triumph profit be to feeling of loyalty that have owed much of success in life in such case a may be supposed that feeling must be strong then feeling presumed case in must sympathise in must believe must be well that must allow to feel same interest in case to maintain respecting same personal anxiety if ceased to believe in did ask question finally answered in affirmative have beaten joseph mason once in good stand up fight having done so having thus made matter own be necessary to comfort that must beat again if fight be to be fought lady mason be client association of life taught to be true to a such a be thus searching into innermost heart must say more than mr furnival perhaps have sufficient ground for terrible fear of hers nevertheless mistress of orley farm be very comely in eye of lawyer eye when full of tear be very bright hand a lay in be very soft laid out for scheme of wickedness with reference to purposely entertained thought knew to be wrong nevertheless did feel that liked to have her by that liked to be adviser friend that liked to wipe tear from eye not by material handkerchief from pocket by immaterial manly sympathy from bosom that liked also to feel pressure of hand mr furnival have become solid heavy red though be solid heavy red also more so indeed in proportion than poor wife for redness a have said before have almost reached purple hue nevertheless eye loved to look upon beauty of lovely woman ear loved to hear tone of voice hand loved to meet soft ripeness of touch be very wrong that must have be so case be not without parallel therefore made up mind that must not desert lady mason must not desert how must set about fighting must be necessary in behalf be well aware of if fought at must fight now must not do to let matter go on till must be summoned to defend step might now be available must be altogether unavailable in two three month time must be so perhaps if allowed two three week to pas idly by mr round luckily be not disposed to hurry proceeding a far a be concerned be there bitterness of antagonism with mason dockwrath there must be hot haste hotter malice from who be really enemy must expect quarter be to return on evening to noningsby on following day must go over to cleeve knew that lady mason be staying there object in making that visit must not be merely that might see also that might speak to sir peregrine learn how far baronet be inclined to support neighbour in coming tribulation must soon be able to ascertain what sir peregrine really thought whether suspected possibility of guilt must ascertain also what be general feeling in neighbourhood of hamworth must be great thing if must spread abroad conviction that be injured woman must be great thing even if must make known that great people of neighbourhood so thought juryman of alston must be mortal men might be possible that must be imbued with favourable bias on subject before assembled in box for consideration wished that knew truth in matter rather wished must know whether be innocent without knowing whether be guilty fight in hand must be conducted on term so much more glorious if must feel sure of innocence then if attempted that be not innocent might be sacrificed by audacity of proceeding must not venture that unless be sure of ground for moment two thought that must ask question said to that must forgive fault that have be repented ere did not doubt must be sweet to say to that be very grievous yet might be forgiven must be sweet to feel that be in hand that must treat with mercy kindness then hundred other thought forbade to think more of if have be guilty if declared guilt to must not restitution be necessary in case son must know world must know confession must be incompatible with innocence before world be necessary that must maintain moreover must be able to proclaim aloud belief in innocence how must do that knowing to be guilty knowing that also knew that have such knowledge be impossible that must ask such question admit of such confidence must be necessary if case did come to trial that must employ attorney matter must come into barrister hand in usual way through solicitor house must be well that person employed must have firm faith in client what must say a barrister if attorney suggested to that lady might possibly be guilty a thought of thing almost dreaded difficulty before rang bell for crabwitz peculiar bell crabwitz be bound to answer having first of gone through little ceremony with cheque book crabwitz entered still sulky in demeanour for a yet old anger have not be appeased be still doubtful matter in clerk mind whether might not be better for to seek master who must better appreciate service more lucrative position might be difficult for to find money be not everything a crabwitz said to more than once crabwitz said mr furnival looking with pleasant face at clerk be leaving town evening will be absent for next ten day if like can go away for holiday be rather late in season now sir said crabwitz gloomily a though be determined not to be pleased be little late a say really must not manage earlier come crabwitz must not quarrel work have be little hard then so have mine also fancy like sir have have like indeed so do like in way come crabwitz have be excellent servant to think that on whole have be bad master to be making complaint sir be cross because have kept in town little too long come crabwitz must forget that have worked very hard year past here be cheque for fifty pound get out of town for fortnight so amuse be sure be very much obliged sir said crabwitz putting out hand taking cheque felt that master have got better of be still little melancholy on account must have valued grievance at moment almost more than fifty pound especially a by acceptance of surrendered all right to complain for considerable time to come by by crabwitz said mr furnival a clerk be about to leave room yes sir said crabwitz have never chanced to hear of attorney named dockwrath suppose what in london mr furnival fancy have place of business in town life know at hamworth be mean sir be meddling in affair of lady mason what have heard of have oh yes sir be being good deal talked about in profession messrs round crook leading young man be up here with other day did say good deal about be very decent young man considering position be smart know dockwrath doe well sir ca say that know much of man dockwrath have be at place of business pretty constant of late mr matthew seem thick enough together oh do do so smart tell know how be sir suppose dockwrath be very exactly dare say not have never seen crabwitz who sir sir sir have never set eye on man sir from hear be not very likely must come here be sure be not at likely must go to mr furnival sat thinking awhile clerk stood waiting opposite to leaning with hand upon table know one in neighbourhood of hamworth suppose mr furnival said at last who sir sir not soul sir never be there in life will tell why ask strongly suspect that man dockwrath be at very foul play then told to clerk so much of whole story of lady mason affair a chose that must know be plain enough that may give lady mason great deal of annoyance ended by saying there be doubting that sir said crabwitz to tell truth believe mind be made up to do think that anything must be done by seeing of course lady mason have got nothing to compromise son estate be a safe a hat people at round think be quite so safe sir then people at round know nothing about lady mason be so averse to legal proceeding that must be worth while to have matter settled understand yes sir understand must not attorney be best person sir not just at present crabwitz lady mason be very dear friend of mine yes sir know said crabwitz if must make pretence for running down to hamworth change of air know for week so be beautiful country just place like might find out whether anything must be done eh mr crabwitz be well aware from first that did not get fifty pound for nothing chapter xxvi why must not day two after conversation with crabwitz a described in last chapter mr furnival be driven up to door of sir peregrine orme house in hamworth fly have come over by train from alston on purpose to see baronet whom found seated in library at very moment be again asking question have before asked a be walking up down own dining room why must not said to unless indeed will make unhappy then barrister be shown into room muffled up to eye in winter clothing sir peregrine mr furnival be well known to other have always met a friend have be interested on same side in first orley farm case possessed topic of sympathy in mutual dislike to joseph mason of groby park sir peregrine therefore be courteous when learned subject on be to be consulted became almost more than courteous oh yes be staying here mr furnival must like to see before leave will be glad to see sir peregrine if be justified in regarding a specially friend may perhaps be well must first have conversation with sir peregrine in answer to declared that mr furnival certainly must be so justified that did regard a lady mason special friend that be ready to hear anything that barrister might have to say to many of point of case have already be named so often will fear be necessarily named so often again that will spare repetition when be possible mr furnival on occasion told sir peregrine not that have heard that thought necessary to tell soon became fully aware that in baronet mind there be not slightest shadow of suspicion that lady mason must have be in way to blame baronet be thoroughly convinced that mr mason be great sinner in matter that be prepared to harass innocent excellent lady from motif of disappointed cupidity long sustained malice made seem in sir peregrine eye being almost too vile for humanity of dockwrath thought almost a badly only that dockwrath be below level of thinking of lady mason spoke a excellent beautiful woman driven to misery by unworthy persecution so spoke with enthusiasm be surprising to mr furnival be very manifest that must not want for friendly countenance if friendly countenance must carry through difficulty there be suspicion against lady mason in mind of sir peregrine mr furnival be careful not to arouse such feeling when found that baronet spoke of a being altogether pure good also spoke of in same tone in doing so game be very difficult let do worst mr furnival said sir peregrine let remain tranquil be advice to lady mason be not possible that can really injure be possible that can hing very probable that can hing nevertheless sir peregrine must have dealing with must utterly disregard if of choose to take step to annoy let attorney manage in usual way be lawyer mr furnival think be manner in thing of kind must be arranged know whether have still power of disputing will if so let do gradually by very slow degree mr furnival made sir peregrine understand that legal doings now threatened be not of nature mr mason did not now talk of proceeding at law for recovery of property for punishment of father widow a criminal at last dreadful word forgery dropped from lip who dare to make such charge a demanded baronet while fire literally flashed from eye in anger when be told that mr mason did make such charge called mean unmanly dastard believe that must dare to make against man said sir peregrine there be fact of charge fact that have be placed in hand of respectable attorney with instruction to to press on fact also that evidence by charge be to be supported possessed at rate prima facie appearance of strength that be necessary to explain to sir peregrine a must also be necessary to explain to lady mason be to understand then that also think began sir peregrine be not to understand think anything injurious to lady do fear that be in position of much jeopardy that great care will be necessary good heaven do mean to say that innocent person can under such circumstance be in danger in country innocent person sir peregrine may be in danger of very great annoyance also of very great delay in proving innocence innocent people have died under weight of such charge must remember that be woman therefore weaker than yes yes still say that think can be in real danger seemed from tone of old man voice a though be almost angry with mr furnival for supposing such must be case intend to tell asked fear that a friend will be warranted in keeping altogether in dark think what feeling must be if be summoned before magistrate without preparation magistrate must listen to charge said sir peregrine in must be guided by evidence must sooner throw up commission than lend in way to proceeding so iniquitous be very well existence of such feeling showed great generosity perhaps also poetic chivalry on part of sir peregrine orme be not way of world so mr furnival be obliged to explain magistrate must listen to charge must be forced to listen to charge if evidence be apparently sound refusal on part of magistrate to do so must not be act of friendship to lady mason a mr furnival endeavoured to explain wish to see sir peregrine asked at last think must be told a be in house will of course hing in concur upon sir peregrine rang bell desired servant to take compliment to lady mason beg attendance in library if be quite convenient tell said sir peregrine that mr furnival be here when message be given to be seated with mr orme at moment summoned strength to say that must obey invitation without displaying special emotion while servant be in room when door be shut friend looked at saw that be a pale a death be pale limb quivered that look of agony now so often marked face be settled on brow mr orme have never yet seen with such manifest sign of suffering a wore at instant suppose must go to said slowly rising from seat seemed to mr orme that be forced to hold by table to support mr furnival be friend be not oh yes kind friend will come in here if like better dear oh will go to must not do must seem so weak what must think of to see so wonder at dear said mr orme coming round to such cruelty must kill wonder at strength rather than weakness then kissed what be there about woman have made fond of came near mr orme walked with across hall left only at library door there pressed hand again kissed then lady mason turned handle of door entered room mr furnival when looked at be startled by pallor of face nevertheless thought that have never looked so beautiful dear lady mason said hope be well sir peregrine advanced to handed over to own arm chair have be queen in distress must not have be treated with more gentle deference never seemed to count upon in way to assume a right must accuse of what regard a sin against good taste be to say that be humble in demeanour there be soft meekness about air of feminine dependence proneness to lean almost to cling a leaned might have be felt a irresistible by man be woman to know in deep sorrow rather than in joy happiness one with whom one must love to weep rather than to rejoice indeed present be time with for weeping not for rejoicing sir peregrine looked a though be father a took hand barrister immediately comforted with remembrance of baronet great age be natural too that lady mason must hang on in own house so mr furnival contented at first moment with touching hand hoping that be well answered hardly word to of attempted to smile a sat down murmured something about trouble be giving mr furnival think best that must be made aware of step be being taken by mr mason of groby park began sir peregrine be lawyer therefore of course can not put advice against be sure that of will tell for best said in such matter a be right that must be guided by that be a firmly friend a be there can be doubt believe lady mason trust in said lawyer indeed do must trust in anything said there can be doubt that must be able to direct for best say so much at first because so thoroughly despise man in yorkshire be so convinced that anything malice may prompt to do must be futile must not myself have thought needful to pain by what must now be said be dreadful commencement bore even be relieved by indeed tale that mr furnival must have to tell after such exordium must be so bad a have feared a possible result of visit might have come there to let know that be at once to be carried away immediately to be taken to trial perhaps to be locked up in gaol in ignorance of law must only imagine what might might not happen to at moment therefore word sir peregrine have spoken relieved rather than added to fear then mr furnival began tale gradually put before fact of matter did with choice of language delicacy of phraseology be admirable for made clearly understand nature of accusation be brought against without using word be in harsh in bearing said nothing about fraud forgery false evidence made manifest to that joseph mason have now instructed lawyer to institute criminal proceeding against for having forged codicil to husband will must bear a best may said may lord give strength to bear be terrible to think of said sir peregrine nobody can doubt how will end be not to suppose that mr furnival intends to express doubt a to ultimate triumph what fear for be pain must endure before triumph come ah if be a baronet finished speaking looked furtively into lawyer face to see how far meaning of smooth word must be supported by what might read there must also think that final triumph did certainly await sir peregrine real opinion be easily to be learned from countenance from word be not so with mr furnival in mr furnival face from mr furnival word must be learned only that mr furnival wished to declare saw that glance fully understood knew instinctively on spur of moment that must now either assure by lie break down hope by truth that final triumph be not certain to be very far from certain must now be honest to friend dishonest one great object with be to secure support sir peregrine must give by weight in county therefore a sir peregrine be present be needful that must be dishonest arguing thus looked lie lady mason derived more comfort from look than from sir peregrine word then various detail be explained to mr furnival understood mr dockwrath have picked up went into matter of partnership deed question be asked a to man kenneby woman bolster might lady mason said have be witness to half dozen deed on same day for aught knew to contrary have be present with sir joseph a far a must now remember during whole of morning in out sir peregrine a can understand sir peregrine said that did understand perfectly did know mr usbech have be there for many hour day probably from ten to two three doubt therefore much business be transacted remembered nothing affair of will then be natural seeing that there be other affair in have specially interested doubt people did witness deed said sir peregrine for can not conceive how wretched man can be so silly a to spend money on case a must do anything for revenge said mr furnival then lady mason be allowed to go back to drawing room what remained to be said be said between two gentleman alone sir peregrine be very anxious that own attorney must be employed named messrs slow bideawhile than whom there be more respectable men in whole profession then mr furnival feared that be too respectable might look at matter in so straightforward light a to fancy client really guilty what might happen then old slow must not conceal truth for baronet in england for pretty woman touch of lady mason hand tear in eye must be nothing to old slow mr furnival therefore be obliged to explain that slow bideawhile did not undertake that sort of business must wish to be taken up through there must be expenditure mr furnival must prefer that must arrange about mr furnival made further immediate objection consented at last to having interview with one of firm on subject provided of course that member of firm came to at chamber then took leave nothing positive have be done even settled to be done on morning person most interested in matter have be made to understand that affair be taking absolute palpable substance step must be taken indeed must be taken almost immediately mr furnival a left house resolved to employ attorney whom might think best adapted for purpose must settle that matter with slow bideawhile afterwards then a returned to noningsby wondered at persistence in matter believed that client have be guilty believed that codicil be real instrument made by sir joseph mason so believing must not be better for to wash hand of whole affair others did not think so must not be better such others must be adviser be not taking up for endless trouble annoyance must have useful purpose so argued with yet by time that have reached noningsby have determined that must stand by lady mason to last hated that man mason a declared to when providing with reason for resolve regarded bitter malicious justice a more criminal than crime of lady mason might have be guilty then a leaned back in railway carriage still saw pale face before still heard soft tone of voice be still melted by tear in eye young man young friend of mine who art now filled to overflowing of thy brain with poetry with chivalry love thou seest seated opposite to thee there that grim old man with long snuffy nose with sharp piercing eye

withers away bone grow old brain too becomes decrepit a do sight hearing soul heart be tender once remains tender to last lady mason when left library walked across hall towards drawing room then paused must fain remain alone for while if be possible therefore turned aside into small breakfast parlour be used morning be rarely visited afterwards during day here sat leaving door slightly open so that might know when mr furnival left baronet here sat for full hour waiting waiting waiting there be sofa lounging chair in room reclining in must remain there half sleeping sitting comfortably at ease placed near table leaning there with face upon hand waited patiently till mr furnival have gone that mind be full of thought need hardly say yet hour seemed very long to at last heard library door open heard sir peregrine voice a stood in hall shook hand with departing visitor heard sound of wheel a fly moved upon gravel then heard sir peregrine again shut library door behind did not immediately get up from chair still waited awhile perhaps for period of ten minute then noiselessly left room moving quickly silently across hall knocked at sir peregrine door did so gently that at first answer be made to then knocked again hardly louder with repeated rap sir peregrine summoned to come in may trouble once more for one moment said certainly certainly be trouble be glad that be here in house at time that may see at moment that may wish know why must be so good to because be in great grief in undeserved grief because lady mason service be at command will act for a must for daughter hear now of what be that accuse yes said do hear a spoke came round so that be standing near to with back to fireplace do hear blush to think that there be man in england holding position of county magistrate who can so forget be due to honesty to humanity to self respect then think have be guilty of thing guilty think guilty doe think so be impossible that must think so be more sure of own innocence than of yours a spoke took hand looked into face eye also be full of tear may be sure of edith will ever think guilty dearest edith said have never before called sir peregrine daughter in law by christian name a now did so almost felt that have sinned sir peregrine took in good part be dearest said be sure of that will be true to through so stood for while without further speech still held hand tear still stood in eye eye be turned to ground from tear be running fast at first ran silently without audible sobbing sir peregrine with own old eye full of salt water hardly knew that be weeping gradually drop fell upon hand one by one at first then faster faster soon there came low sob sob suppressed at last forced forth then head fell upon shoulder dear said hardly able to speak poor dear ill used dear a withdrew one hand from that might press handkerchief to face vacant arm passed round waist poor ill used dear said again a pressed to old heart leaning over kissed lip so stood for few second feeling that be pressed close by feeble pressure of arm then gradually sank through from embrace fell upon knee at foot knelt at foot supporting with one arm upon table with other hand still held hand over head be bowed friend said still sobbing sobbing loudly now friend that god have sent in trouble then with word be wholly inaudible murmured prayer on behalf be better now said raising quickly to foot when few second have passed be better now stood erect before by god mercy will endure think can endure now if can lighten load have lightened of weight sir peregrine will leave leave go away from cleeve yes will not destroy comfort of home by wretchedness of position will not lady mason house be altogether at service if will be led by in matter will not leave till cloud will have passed by will be better to be alone now then before must answer further led to door felt that be better for to be alone hastened up stair to own chamber why must not said sir peregrine to a again walked length of library chapter xxvii commerce lucius mason be still staying at noningsby when mr furnival made visit to sir peregrine on afternoon received note from mother indeed there be three note passed between on afternoon for wrote answer to mother then received reply to answer lady mason told that did not intend to return home to farm quite immediately explained that reason for not doing so be necessity that must have assistance advice at period of trouble did not say that misdoubted wisdom of son counsel appeared to that intended to signify to that did so answered in word be sore almost bitter be sorry said that can not agree about matter be of such vital concern to of a be so can only act a think best for for be sure however that will believe that only object be happiness fair name be dearer to than anything else in world in answer to have written again immediately filling letter with sweet word of motherly love telling that be sure quite sure of affection kind spirit excusing for not putting matter altogether in hand by saying that be forced to lean on who have supported from beginning through former trial have taken place when lucius be yet baby dearest lucius must not be angry with went on to say be suffering much under cruel persecution suffering must be more than doubled if own boy quarrelled with lucius when received flung up head quarrel with said to nothing on earth must make quarrel with can not say that be right think to be wrong feeling be good honest kindly too in way tenderness of heart be not weakness must wrong if be to say that be hard hearted flattered that be just hearted sometimes be nearly same a have be case with father before be now case with half brother joseph day after be last at noningsby have told lady staveley that intended to go though have pressed further stay remarking that none of young people intended to move till after twelfth night nevertheless persisted with young people of house have not much advanced altogether did not find thoroughly happy in judge house be more thoughtless than a thought did not understand therefore must leave besides there be great day of hunting coming on at everybody be to take part a did not hunt gave reason for going have nothing to do amuse said to have man work before man misfortune will go home face in there be much of conceit much of pride much of deficient education deficiency in special branch of education england have imparted to best of son be now becoming out of fashion have never learned to measure against others mean knowledge book acquirement day conduct of life to perceive that be insignificant in others must be insignificant in also to around at extensive reading respecting iapetidae recommended not at did agricultural ambition not even to felix graham a companion though felix graham must see further into character than did others be not such a be have not unpretentious self controlling humour perfectly free from conceit be common to life did not come easy to effort be ever making be always visible men must ever be making effort doubt effort must not be conspicuous yet lucius mason be not bad fellow young staveley showed much want of discernment when called empty headed selfish epithet be by mean applicable to that be not empty headed be certain be moreover capable of great self sacrifice that talent good quality be appreciated by one person in house seemed evident to lady staveley other married lady of party miss furnival a thought have not found empty headed indeed may be doubted whether lady staveley must have pressed stay at noningsby have miss furnival be le gracious dear lady staveley be always living in fever lest only son light of eye must fall irrevocably in love with lady be by mean good enough for revocably in love be daily falling day must go too deep water must close over well loved head now in dear old favouring eye sophia furnival be by mean good enough have be quite clear that augustus have become thoroughly lost in attempt to bring about match between felix graham barrister daughter in preparing bath for friend have fallen bodily into water be always at miss furnival side a long a miss furnival must permit seemed to lady staveley that miss furnival luckily be quite a fond of having lucius mason at side that of two perhaps preferred lucius mason that taste judgment must be so bad be wonderful to lady staveley depravity though wonderful be useful therefore lucius mason might have be welcome to remain at noningsby may however be possible that miss furnival knew what be doing quite a well a lady staveley must know for in first place may possibly have thought indiscreet to admit mr staveley attention with too much freedom may have doubted sincerity feared to give offence to family mr mason may in sight have be preferable suitor that gift of intellect be at rate equal to of other there can be doubt then gift of fortune be already own for ought miss furnival knew might be equal to must ever appertain to other gentleman that lady staveley must think swan better looking than lady mason goose be very natural then lady mason must no doubt have regarded two bird in exactly opposite light be only fair to conceive miss furnival be better judge than of on evening before departure whole party have be playing commerce for rule of house during holiday be that amusement brought into vogue be to be adapted to child if grown up people must adapt to so much better for if not so much worse must in such case provide for on whole grown up people seemed to live nearly a jovial life a did child whether judge be specially fond of commerce can not say persisted in putting in whole pool played through entire game rigidly fighting for same pool on behalf of very small grandchild who sat during whole time on knee there be who call card devil book will presume that judge be of different way of thinking on special evening sophia have be sitting next to augustus young man can always arrange matter in own house have nevertheless lost life early in game will not have cheating to night have said to neighbour will take chance if die die one can die once so have died three time indeed instead of once only have left table lucius mason also have died generally did die first having aptitude for collection of king ace so two came together over fire in second drawing room far away from card player there be nothing at remarkable in a mr furnival one two others who did not play commerce be also there nevertheless be separated from of

wrong to be here must have come have known when did come a much a do know now one can for moment think that mother have done anything that must not have done then why do so many people talk of her a though have committed great crime miss furnival know that be innocent know a surely a know fact of own existence feel same thing if be in place if be father whose name be so bandied about in people mouth must think that behoved to hing to go nowhere till have forced world to confess innocence be ten time stronger with regard to woman have given mother counsel regret to say that differs from why do not speak to papa did once went to at chamber rebuked rebuked mr mason did not do intentionally be sure have heard say that be excellent son nevertheless did rebuke considered that be travelling beyond own concern in wishing to interfere for protection of mother name said that must leave to such people a staveleys ormes to guard from ignominy disgrace oh did not mean that to seems that must be son first duty be talking of trouble of cost must give hour have in day shilling own in world to save from one week of such suffering a now endures cut to heart when tell that because be suffering therefore must separate from think must be better for miss furnival to be staying at home with than to be at cleeve kindness of mr orme must be great support to why must not kindness be support to rather affection know from whom scandal come desire be to meet man in court of law thrust falsehood down throat ah be man therefore must take burden from shoulder will not trust to truth miss furnival be that have not yet learned to think of a man to be still boy for whom be bound to provide not son who must bear for care a be feel that dare again to trouble with advice grandmamma be dead shouted

that be in great grief be dreadful to to hear thing said a yet have found sympathy can assure mr mason do sympathise with most sincerely only wish sympathy must be of more value will be invaluable said not looking at fixing eye upon fire if be given with constancy from first to last of sad affair will be so given said miss furnival also looking at fire will be tolerably long men will say cruel thing of can foresee that will be very hard to prove to world with certainty that there be foundation for charge if who be now most friendly to turn away from will never turn away from mr mason then give hand on remember promise in ear mean much in excitement have forgotten that there be others in room who might be looking at that there be vista open upon direct from eye at card table did not forget miss furnival must be very enthusiastic be one of who in enthusiasm rarely forgot anything nevertheless after moment pause gave hand there be said may be sure of with also promise doe mean something now will say good night so having received pressure of hand left will get candle said so did good night papa said kissing father then with slight muttered word to lady staveley withdrew having sacrificed remainder of evening for sake of acceding to mr mason request respecting pledge must not be accounted strange that must give hand to gentleman with whom be immediately talking a bade good night now grandpapa be dead too said marian there be nobody left three will divide said fanny sebright so game of commerce be brought to end chapter xxviii monkton grange during day peregrine

be really running when other young lady have begun to go home then miss tristram be always there there thereabouts a admirer must warmly boast did commence day work a did other girl who came out on hunting morning with most such be clear to see that object be pretty much same here a in ballroom spectatum veniunt veniunt spectentur ut ipsae a be proper natural desirable that must do by word spectatum must wish to signify something more than mere use of eye perhaps occasional word dropped here there into ear of cavalier may be included in spectentur also may include word so received miss

snob as knew well that be one other knew a well that must be fit match for miss staveley to tell truth did not suspect that graham miss staveley must think of thing be not jealousy that tormented so much a diffidence in own resource made small attempt did not succeed therefore determined that must at once make grand attempt must create opportunity before left noningsby must do even to day on horseback if must find sufficient opportunity in taking determined step like that knew that must not lack courage do mean to ride to day said to madeline a be approaching bottom of grange avenue for last half mile have be thinking what must say to thinking in vain now at last moment must summon word to assistance more potent for purpose than if mean by riding mr orme going across field with miss

except lord alston miss tristram other old stager will husband horse come out a fresh at two o'clock a though be only just out there be nothing so valuable a experience in hunting do think nice seeing young lady with so much hunting knowledge now want to talk slander wo do admire miss tristram exceedingly especially julia be youngest that one riding by herself why go express admiration ah why express admiration that feel pour sweet praise into ear of lady excites because be coward miss furnival be afraid even of such weak thing a woman dear must hardly have thought that must suffer from

never guess riddle wo even try at seem to be stopping yes be putting hound into covert now if want to show good sportsman look at watch see that julia tristram have got hers in hand what be for to time hound to see how long will be before find be very pretty work in small gorse in great wood like care much for being so accurate for heaven sake tell julia tristram must not have chance if thought be so slack now hound be scattering in wood party rode up centre roadway towards great circular opening in middle of here be recognised practice of horseman to stand who properly did duty must stand there very many lingered at gate knowing that there be one other exit from wood without overcoming difficulty of very intricate dangerous fence there be gap bai there said one farmer to a be entering yes there be gap young grubbles broke 'orse back getting over of last year said second farmer did though said first so remained at gate others numerous body including most of lady galloped up down cross way because master of hound huntsman did so d fellow riding up down after wherever go said master believe think be to be hunted seemed to be said more especially to miss tristram who be always in master confidence fear that fellow alluded to included miss furnival miss staveley then there came sharp eager sound of hound voice single sharp happy opening bark harriet tristram be first to declare that game be found just five minute twenty second lord said julia tristram to lord alston be not bad in large wood like uncommonly good said lordship when be to get out of will be here for next hour be afraid said lady not moving horse from place where stood though many of more impetuous of men be already rushing away to gate have seen fox go away from here without resting minute be later in season at end of february fox be away from home then observation showed wonderfully acute sporting observation on part of miss tristram then music of dog became fast frequent a drove brute across along from one part of large wood to sure there be sound like for filling man heart with eager desire to be at work what may be trumpet in battle know can imagine that have same effect now few of be standing on wide circular piece of grass when sound most exciting of reached ear be away shouted whip from corner of wood good natured beast though a yet be hardly past christmas time have consented to bless at once so many anxious sportsman have left back of covert with full pack at heel there be gate way miss tristram said gentleman there be double ditch bank will do a well said away went directly after hound regardless altogether of gate peregrine orme felix graham who be with followed close upon track chapter xxix breaking covert there be double ditch bank will do a well miss tristram have said when be informed that there be gate out of wood at side on fox have broken gentleman who have tendered information might a well have held tongue for miss tristram knew wood intimately be acquainted with locality of gate be acquainted also with point at might be left without assistance of gate at by who be well mounted must ride horse therefore have thus replied there be double ditch bank will do a well for double ditch bank at end of one of grassy roadway miss tristram at once prepared be gap where grubbles broke horse back said man in red coat to peregrine orme so saying made up wavering mind galloped away a fast a nag must carry peregrine orme must not avoid fence at lady be not afraid to ride felix graham knowing little fearing nothing followed peregrine orme at end of roadway in middle of track there be gap for footman be doubtless easiest way over fence for ditch on side be half filled up there be space enough left of half broken bank for man scrambling foot miss tristram at once knew that be bad place for horse second further ditch be really difficult obstacle there be footing in gap from horse must take leap to right of fence be large required good horse miss tristram knew animal be accustomed to large fence trained beast went well across on to bank poised there for moment taking second spring carried mistress across into further field apparently with ease in field dog be now running altogether so that sheet might have covered miss tristram exulting within heart holding in horse knew that have got away uncommonly well peregrine orme followed little to right of lady passage so that might have room for do mischief in event of miss tristram horse making mistake at leap also got well over ala in spite of such early success be destined to see nothing of hunt day felix graham thinking that must obey instruction by letting horse do a pleased permitted beast to come close upon orme track to make jump before orme horse have taken second spring have care said peregrine feeling that two be together on bank will shove into ditch however got well over felix attempting to have care just when doing so must be of avail gave horse pull with curb a be preparing for second spring outside ditch be broad deep well banked up required that animal must have power be at such moment a that must have be left to do work without injudicious impediment from rider poor graham be thinking only of orme caution attempted to stop beast when positive absolute stop be out of question horse made jump crippled a be jumped short came with knee against further bank threw rider then in struggle to right rolled over felix felt at once that be much hurt that have indeed come to grief still be not stunned did lose presence of mind horse succeeded in gaining foot then felix also jumped up even walked step two towards head of animal with object of taking rein found that must not raise arm found also that must hardly breathe peregrine miss tristram looked back there be nothing wrong hope said lady then rode on let be understood that in hunting who be in advance generally do ride on lame halt wounded if can not pick up have to be picked up by who come after peregrine saw that there be one else coming way memory of young grubbles fate have placed interdict on pas out of wood nothing short of pluck science of miss tristram be able to disregard two cavalier have carried with one have led on to instant slaughter other remained to look after fallen brother in arm miss tristram in mean time be in next field have settled well down to work be hurt old fellow said peregrine turning back horse still not dismounting not much think said graham smiling there be something wrong about arm wait then found that spoke with difficulty can mount again think will mind that perhaps 'd better sit down then peregrine orme knew that graham be hurt jumping off own horse gave up hope of hunt here fellow come hold horse so invoked boy who in following sport have got a far a ditch did a be bid scrambled over sit down graham there be afraid be hurt did roll on felix merely looked up into face still smiling be now very pale for moment must not speak peregrine came close to gently attempted to raise wounded limb whereupon graham shuddered shook head fear be broken said peregrine graham nodded head raised left hand to breast peregrine then knew that something else be amiss also know feeling more disagreeable than produced by being left alone in field when out hunting with man who have be very much hurt who be incapable of riding walking hurt man have privilege of infirmity may remain quiescent a only attendant must do something must for moment do if do wrong whole responsibility lie on shoulder if leave wounded man on damp ground in middle of winter while run away five mile perhaps to next doctor may not improbably a then think be dead before come back know way be heavy boot be very heavy must stay therefore a be doctor in least know what be amount of injury in great trouble begin to roar for assistance wood re echo word distant sound of huntsman horn a summons hound at check only mock agony peregrine have boy with get upon horse said at last ride round to farmer griggs tell to send somebody here with spring cart have got spring cart know mattress in hai gude at roiding like said boy looking with dismay at orme big horse then run will be better for can go through wood know where farmer griggs life first farm other side of grange ay ay know where farmer griggs life well enough run then if cart be here in hour will give sovereign inspirited by hope of such wealth golden wealth wealth for lifetime boy be quickly back over fence peregrine be left alone with felix graham be now sitting down with foot hanging into ditch peregrine be kneeling behind be sorry can hing more said fear must remain here till cart come be so vexed about hunt said felix gasping a spoke have in fact broken right arm have be twisted under a horse rolled two of rib have be staved in by pommel of saddle many men have be worse hurt have hunted again before end of season fracture of three bone doe make man uncomfortable for time now cart be sent for must go on be not likely that peregrine orme must do never mind said when fellow be hurt have always to do a be told 'd better have drop of sherry look here have got flask at saddle there can support with arm moment did ever see horse stand so quiet have got hold of yours now will fasten together say whitefoot kick do then contrived to picket horse to two branch having got out case of sherry poured small modicum into silver mug be attached to apparatus again supported graham while drank will be a right a trivet by by only will have to make noningsby headquarters for next six week then same idea passed through mind of of how little man need be pitied for such misfortune if madeline staveley must consent to be nurse illustration felix graham in trouble man must have le surgical knowledge than peregrine orme nevertheless be such man a one must like to have with if one came to grief in such way be cheery up hearted at same time gentle even thoughtful voice be pleasant touch must be soft for many year afterwards felix remembered how sherry have be held to lip how young heir of cleeve have knelt behind in red coat supporting a became weary with waiting saying pleasant word to through whole felix graham be man who must remember such thing in running through wood boy first encountered three horseman be judge with daughter madeline miss furnival there be mon there who be abeost dead said boy hardly able to speak from want of breath be agoing for farmer griggs cart then stopped moment to ask for description boy must tell nothing to indicate that wounded man be one of friend might however be augustus so three rode on quickly towards fence knowing nothing of circumstance of ditch must make out of power to get to fallen sportsman peregrine heard sound of horse voice of horseman by jove there be lot of coming down here said be judge two of girl oh miss staveley be so glad have come graham have have bad fall hurt have shawl have ground be so wet under doe signify at said felix looking round seeing face of friend on other side of bank madeline staveley gave slight shriek father did not notice miss furnival heard very plainly oh papa said can not get over to then began to bethink whether be possible that must give up something of dress to protect man who be hurt from damp muddy ground on lay can hold horse dear said judge slowly dismounting for judge though rode day on sanitary consideration have not sportsman celerity in leaving recovering saddle did get down burdened a be with great coat did succeed in crossing accursed fence accursed be from henceforward in annals of h h none must ride dare devil who professed willing to go at anything miss tristram however always declared that there be nothing in though avoided whispering to friend that have led others to grief there might possibly do so again if persevered must hold horse said madeline to miss furnival will go for shawl to carriage miss furnival declared that to best of belief must not nevertheless animal be left with madeline turned round galloped back towards carriage made horse do best though eye be nearly blinded with tear went straight on for carriage though must have given much for moment to hide tear before reached oh mamma give thick shawl mr graham have hurt in field be lying on grass then in incoherent quick manner have to explain what knew of accident before must get carriage cloak out of carriage however did succeed in doing in manner very unintelligible to herself afterwards did gallop back with burden passed cloak over to peregrine who clambered up bank to get while judge remained on ground supporting young barrister felix graham though be weak be not stunned senseless knew well who be that have procured for comfort then carriage followed madeline there be quite concourse of servant horse lady on inside of fence wounded man be still unfortunately on other side cart from farmer griggs made appearance though be now more than hour since boy have gone cart when be wanted in such sudden haste make appearance be two mile through wood to mr griggs farm yard more than three mile back by route cart must take then might be more than probable that in farmer griggs establishment there be not always horse ready in harness groom at hand prepared to yoke peregrine have become very impatient have more than once invoked silent anathema on farmer head nevertheless there be appearance of cart must get across ditch into carriage said judge if lady staveley will let do said peregrine difficulty be not with lady staveley with nasty ditch said judge for have be up to knee in one of water have penetrated boot task be at last done mr arbuthnot stood up on back seat of carriage so that might hold horse coachman footman got across into field must be better to let lie here day said felix a three of struggled back with burden judge bringing up rear with two hunting whip peregrine cap how on earth one must think of riding over place a said judge then when have be young man have not be custom for barrister to go out hunting madeline a saw wounded man carefully laid on back seat of carriage almost wished that must have mother place that might support must be careful enough with must remember how terrible must be pain of motion to one so hurt a be then looked into face a be made to lean back saw that still smiled felix graham be by mean handsome man must hardly sin against truth if be to say that be ugly madeline a looked at now lying there utterly without colour always with smile on countenance thought that face to liking have ever be more gracious still rode close to a went down grassy road saying never word miss furnival rode there also somewhat in rear condoling with judge a to wet foot miss furnival said when judge forgets go out hunting have no right to expect anything better what must father have said have seen clambering up bank with young orme hunting cap between teeth positively did must have rushed to assist said miss furnival with little burst of enthusiasm be hardly needed on occasion then peregrine came after leading graham horse have be compelled to return to field ride horse back into wood one after other while footman held that riding back over fence in cold blood be work really try man nerve man have to do too when one be looking on how doe crane falter look about for easy place at moment a when blood be cold place be easy procession got back to noningsby without adventure graham a matter of course be taken up to bed one of servant have be despatched to alston for surgeon in hour two extent of misfortune be known right arm be broken very favourably a doctor observed two rib be broken rather unfavourably there be talk of haemorrhage inward wound sir jacob from saville row be suggested by lady staveley judge knowing extent of graham mean made further preliminary inquiry be considered that sir jacob must not be needed at rate not a yet why send for said madeline to mother with rather more than wonted energy papa doe not think necessary dear must be very expensive know mamma must let man die because must cost few pound to cure dear hope that mr graham wo die at rate not at present if there be danger may be sure that papa will send for best advice madeline be by mean satisfied must not understand economy in matter of life death if sir jacob coming must have cost fifty pound hundred must have signified weighed in such balance sum must be nothing to father have augustus fallen broken arm sir jacob in london must not have be considered too costly must joint coming have mitigated danger did not however dare to speak to mother again so said word two to peregrine orme who be constant in attendance on felix peregrine have be very kind have seen heart therefore warmed towards think ought to have more advice mr orme well no know be very jolly know only ca talk one of bone ran into believe be all right oh be so frightful tear be again in eye if be must think one doctor enough be easy enough having fellow down from london know if like if must get worse mr orme then peregrine made sort of promise in doing so idea shot through poor heart of what truth might really be went back looked at felix who be sleeping if be so must bear said to will fight on quick thought ran through brain of own deficiency knew that be not clever bright in talk like felix graham must not say right thing at right moment without forethought how wished that must still must fight on a must have done losing match to last then sat down by felix head resolved that must be loyal to new friend same loyal in thing needful still must fight on chapter xxx fall felix graham have plenty of nurse madeline be not one of augustus staveley came home while alston doctor be still busy at broken bone of course must not leave friend be one of who have succeeded in hunt consequently have heard nothing of accident till end of miss tristram have be first to tell that mr graham have fallen in leaving covert having seen rise to leg have not thought be seriously hurt know much about friend have said think may comfort by assurance that horse be none worse must see a much a poor felix said staveley have lost magnificent run suppose be nine ten mile from monkton grange now eleven if be yard said lady be ugly country pace be nothing wonderful then others dropped in at last came tidings about graham at first there be whisper that be dead have ridden over orme be said have nearly killed have quite killed then report became le fatal horse be dead graham be still living though with most of bone broken believe said miss tristram in what condition mr graham may be wo say that horse be safe sound after got over fence of that may take word thus in state of uncertainty obtaining fresh rumour from person passed staveley hurried home right arm two rib peregrine said to a met in hall be that said augustus be clear therefore that did not think so much about a sister if 'd let have head 'd never have come down like augustus said a sat that evening by friend bedside pulled off fancy to avoid riding over said peregrine then must have come too quick at leap said augustus must have steadied a came to from graham perceived that man can not learn how to ride particular horse by two three word of precept if talk more about horse hunt accident neither of will stay in room said lady staveley who came in at moment did stay in room said great deal more about hunt horse accident before left even became so far reconciled to circumstance that have hot glass of brandy water sitting by graham fire augustus do tell how be madeline said to brother a caught going to room have become ashamed of asking more question of mother be all right only will be a fretful a porcupine shut up there at least must be be there lot of novel in house mind send for batch to morrow novel be only chance man have when be laid up like before breakfast on following morning madeline have sent off to alston circulating list of best new novel of must remember name definite day have hitherto be fixed for peregrine return to cleeve under present circumstance still remained at noningsby assisting to amuse felix graham for two day after accident such seemed to be sole occupation in truth be looking for opportunity to say word two to miss staveley paving way a best might for great speech be fully resolved that must make before left house once twice bethought whether must not endeavour to secure for confidant in family obtain sanction special friendship of madeline mother sister brother what if after that must reject must not be worse for then that one must have known of defeat must a thought endure to suffer alone on matter a pity must be unendurable so a sat there by graham fireside pretending to read one of poor madeline novel for sake of companionship determined that must tell one of intention one till must make opportunity for telling when did meet find now again moment for saying word alone to be very gracious to have be so kind gentle with felix there be so much in be sweet good honest so much that event a brought forth made manifest that madeline indeed whole family must not be gracious to augustus must declare that be greatest brick have ever known repeating graham word a to patience with embryo baronet have knelt behind on cold muddy ground supporting for hour till carriage have come up under such circumstance how must madeline refrain from being gracious to be from favour to graham peregrine must say to with bitterness yet though said so did not quite believe poor fellow be from favour to graham must have thoroughly believed truth of word repeated to so often might have spared much pain might have spared much pain possibly injury for if aught must now tend to mature in madeline heart affection be a yet nascent must be offer of other lover such reasoning on matter be much too deep for peregrine orme may be said to that only pity because be hurt if so be not time better for than other if be that love let know be out of pain did not then occur to that circumstance such a in question must not readily be made explicit madeline might refuse love yet leave wiser than now be a to reason for so refusing perhaps indeed leave le wise with increased cause for doubt hopeless hope green melancholy of rejected lover madeline during two day said more about london doctor be plain to who watched that anxiety a to patient be much more keen than of other lady of house always think everybody be going to die lady staveley said to miss furnival intending not with consummate prudence to account to acute young lady for daughter solicitude have cook here three month since who be very ill madeline must never be easy till doctor assured that poor woman danger be altogether past be so very warm hearted said miss furnival in reply be quite delightful to see will have such pleasure when see come down from room lady staveley on immediate occasion said nothing to daughter mr arbuthnot considered that sisterly word might perhaps be spoken in due season doctor say be doing quite well now mr arbuthnot said to a be sitting alone doe indeed did hear said madeline who be suspicious did so indeed heard say also that ought to remain here at rate for next fortnight if mamma can permit without inconvenience of course can permit one must turn person out of house in such condition a papa mamma will be very happy that must stay here of course must not do what call turning out mad darling then came up close put arm round sister waist think mamma must be more comfortable in remaining here if charity towards be what will say le demonstrative what do mean isabella dearest dearest must not be angry with nobody have hinted to word on subject do mean to hint anything can possibly be hurtful to what do mean know darling be young man people see with such unkind eye hear with such scandal loving ear there be that miss furnival if miss furnival can think such thing for one care what think do not a regard important result may not be well to be careful know what mean dearest yes know at least suppose so make know also how very cold willow heartless people be wo ask more question isabella ca know that fellow creature be suffering in house person like too so clever whom regard a friend most intimate friend in world augustus have best too a heard papa say without caring whether be going to live die there be danger now know very well be glad to hear though know very well that there must be danger after terrible accident a that doctor say there be none at rate will not then instead of finishing sentence turned away head put up handkerchief to wipe away tear be not angry with dear said mr arbuthnot oh said madeline then parted for day after madeline asked question about felix graham may be doubted whether did not make matter worse even sophia furnival must ask how be at rate twice day lady staveley continued to pay regular visit at stated interval a got better must sit with brought back report a to saying madeline never discussed of refrained alike from conversation whether broken bone unbroken wit be to be subject of then mr arbuthnot knowing that must still be anxious gave private bulletin a to state of sick man progress gave air of secrecy to matter caused even madeline to ask why must be so on whole think that mr arbuthnot be wrong mr arbuthnot whole staveley family must have regarded mutual attachment between mr graham madeline a great family misfortune judge be considerate father to child holding that father control must never be brought to bear unnecessarily in looking forward to future prospect of son daughter be theory that must be free to choose life companion for nevertheless must not be agreeable to that daughter must fall in love with man who have nothing whose future success at own profession seemed to be so very doubtful on whole think that mr arbuthnot be wrong that feeling did exist in madeline bosom might more possibly have died away have word be said about even by sister then event happened forced to look into own heart peregrine orme did make proposal waited patiently during two three day in doctor visit be frequent feeling that must not talk about while sense of danger pervaded house then at last morning came on surgeon declared that need not call again till morrow felix when medical back be turned suggested that might a well be to morrow week began also to scold friend look bright about eye drink glass of sherry in pleasant dinner table fashion not a if be swallowing physic peregrine when saw resolved that moment have come for doing of deed of danger time must soon come at must leave noningsby must not leave noningsby till have learned fate lady staveley who with mother eye have seen daughter solicitude for felix graham recovery have seen animadverted on to herself have seen also at rate have suspected that peregrine orme looked on daughter with favouring eye now peregrine orme must have satisfied lady staveley a son in law liked way manner of thought in spite of rumour a to rat catching have reached ear regarded a quite clever enough to be good husband doubt appreciated fact that be to inherit title cleeve from old grandfather instead of middle aged father therefore have objection to leave peregrine alone with one ewe lamb therefore opportunity sought be at last found will be leaving noningsby to morrow miss staveley said one day having secured interview in back drawing room in happy half hour occurs in winter before world betakes to dress now here profess belief that out of ten set offer made by ten young lover nine of such offer be commenced with intimation that lover be going away there be dash of melancholy in such tidings well suited to occasion if there be spark of love on other side will be elicited by idea of separation then also be so frequently actual fact making of offer be in hard piece of business job to be postponed from day to day be so postponed thus that dash of melancholy that idea of separation be brought in at important moment with so much appropriate truth will be leaving noningsby to morrow miss staveley peregrine said oh dear will be so sorry why be going what will mr graham augustus do without ought to stay at least till mr graham can leave room poor graham not that think be much to be pitied wo be about for week to come yet think be worse do oh dear not at peregrine be unconsciously irritated against friend by regard tone evinced be quite well only will not let be moved miss staveley be not of mr graham be going to speak only thought must miss so much then blushed though blush in dark of evening be lost upon remembered that be not to speak about felix graham health almost seemed a though mr orme have rebuked for doing so in saying that have not come there to speak of lady staveley house have be turned up side down since affair be time now that part of trouble must cease oh mamma doe not mind at know how good be nevertheless miss staveley must go to morrow then paused moment before spoke again will depend entirely upon said whether may have happiness of returning soon to noningsby on mr orme yes on know how to speak properly that have to say believe may a well say out at once have come here now to tell that love to ask to be wife then stopped a though there be nothing more for to say upon matter must be hardly extravagant to declare madeline breath be taken away by very sudden manner in young orme have made proposition have never entered head that have admirer in previously to graham accident have thought nothing about since event have thought about good deal altogether a of friend of graham have be good kind to graham therefore have liked have talked to have never said word to have taught to regard a possible lover now that be actual lover declared lover standing before waiting for answer be so astonished that did not know how to speak idea too a to love such idea a have ever formed be confounded by abruptness must have thought have brought absolutely to think upon that speech of love must be very delicate that love must grow slowly then be whispered softly doubtingly with infinite care even have loved have be in way towards loving such violence a must have frightened scared love away poor peregrine intention have be so good honest be so true hearty free from conceit in matter be pity that must have marred cause by such ill judgment there stood waiting answer expecting to be a open definite plain a though have asked to take walk with madeline said stretching out hand when perceived that did not speak to at once there be hand if be possible give oh mr orme know have not said what have to say very very gracefully will not regard that think be too good too true have now seated herself be standing before have retreated to sofa in order to avoid hand have offered followed even yet did not know that have chance of success mr orme said at last speaking hardly above breath what have made do have made do have made tell that love can not be in earnest not in earnest by heaven miss staveley man who have said same word be ever more in earnest do doubt when tell that love oh be so sorry then hid face upon arm of sofa burst into tear peregrine stood there like prisoner on trial waiting for verdict did not know how to plead cause with further language indeed further language must have be of avail judge jury be clear against must have known sentence without waiting to have pronounced in set term in plain word have made offer in plain word required that answer must be given to well said will not speak to will not tell whether will be so no said mean that can not love a said agony of tone struck ear made feel that be suffering hitherto have thought only of herself have hardly recognised a fact that must be thoroughly in earnest mr orme be very sorry speak a though be angry with can not love then stood again silent for there be reply be that miss staveley that mean to answer if say that with positive assurance will trouble no longer poor peregrine be unskilled lover sobbed forth through tear have so framed question that hardly knew what meant do mean that can not love may hope that day will come may speak to again oh can answer now grief to heart know be so good mr orme well can never never be must take that a answer can make other still stood before with gloomy almost angry brow must have seen then thought must ask whether there be other love have brought about scorn for did not occur to at first moment that in doing so must insult injure at rate be not flattered by reply be at once so decided began by saying oh mr orme make more unhappy perhaps be too late perhaps then remembered paused never mind said speaking to rather than to good bye miss staveley will at rate say good bye to will go at once now go at once go away mr orme yes why must stay here do think must sit down to table with after will ask brother to explain going will find in room good bye took hand mechanically then left when came down to dinner

suddenly away from house at first thought that augustus surely did know be wretched a thought that might probably speak to on subject went on talking about orme abrupt departure till became convinced that knew nothing suspected nothing of what have occurred mother said never word after eulogium have uttered madeline read that eulogium altogether aright said to ear that if ever young orme must again come forward with suit mother must be prepared to receive a suitor said moreover that if suitor have be already sent away by harsh answer must not sympathise with harshness dinner went on much a

be not noisy said madeline law miss care for noise now only ai good at moving yet wo be for while pray take care of mr graham said need not tell how anxious be for recovery good night mr graham then passed on to mother dressing room sitting down in arm chair opposite to fire began to think to think else to try to think be to be subject of thought regarding peregrine orme there be very little room for thinking have made offer have rejected a matter of course seeing that did not love have doubt on head be well aware that must never accept such offer on what subject then be necessary that must think how odd be that mr graham room door must have be open on especial evening that nurse must have be standing there ready to give occasion for conversation be idea that first took possession of brain then recounted few word have be spoken a though have have special value a though word have be laden with interest felt half ashamed of what have done in standing there speaking at bedroom door yet must not have lost chance for world there have be nothing in what have passed between invalid very word spoken elsewhere in presence of mother sister must have be insipid valueless yet sat there feeding on a though be of flavour so rich that must not let sweetness of pas from have be stunned at idea of poor peregrine love yet never asked what be new feeling did not inquire not yet at least whether there might be danger in such feeling remained there with eye fixed on burning coal till mother came up what madeline said lady staveley be here still be in hope must have be in bed before headache be gone now mamma waited because well dear because what mother came stood over smoothed hair know very well that something have be matter there have be something eh madeline yes mamma have remained up that may talk about be that dearest did not quite mean that perhaps will be best ca be doing wrong mamma in telling well will judge of lady staveley sat down on sofa so that be close to chair madeline still occupied a general rule suppose must not be doing wrong must decide if have doubt wait till to morrow mamma will tell now mr orme well dearest did mr orme say anything specially to before went away come to madeline sit here will talk better then mother made room beside on sofa for daughter madeline running over leaned with head upon mother shoulder well darling what did say did tell that loved yes mamma answered must only tell yes know poor fellow madeline be not excellent young man one at rate be lovable of course in such matter heart must answer for looking at offer a mother must have be well pleased mamma must not well love there will be end of at least for present when heard that have gone suddenly away thought that something have happened be so sorry that must be unhappy for know that be good yes be good father like augustus in such matter a madeline must never say word to persuade must think wrong to do so may be dearest that have flurried by suddenness of offer that have not yet thought much about mamma know that love of course be natural must have be great misfortune if have loved before have reason to know that loved great misfortune now now that can not think of now that know what wish be perhaps may learn have refused have gone away young gentleman under such circumstance sometimes come back again wo come back mamma because because told so plainly be sure understands that be to be at end if must if must then think differently towards oh if must may be well that must know how friend esteem in worldly view marriage must be in respect prudent a to disposition temper admit be much more important confess think that have quality best adapted to make wife happy a said before heart must speak for yes of course know that will never love not in way may be sure dearest that there will be constraint put upon might be possible that papa must forbid daughter marriage if have proposed to herself imprudent match must ever use influence with child to bring about marriage because think prudent in worldly point of view then lady staveley kissed daughter dear mamma know how good be to answered mother embrace by pressure of arm nevertheless did not feel to be quite comfortable there be something in word mother have spoken grated against most cherished feeling something though by mean knew what why have mother cautioned in way that there might be case in must refuse sanction to proposed marriage isabella marriage have be concluded with full agreement of whole family madeline have certainly never a yet given cause to father mother to suppose that must be headstrong imprudent might not caution have be omitted be intended to apply in way to circumstance a now existed have better go now dearest said lady staveley for present will not think more about gallant young knight then madeline having said good night went off rather crestfallen to own room in doing so again have to pas graham door a went by walking not quite on tiptoe must not help asking whether must really recognise sound of footstep be hardly necessary to say that lady staveley have conceived to herself recognised purpose in uttering little caution to daughter must have be quite a well pleased have circumstance taken felix graham out of house instead of peregrine orme felix graham must necessarily remain for next fortnight there must be possible benefit in orme

luminary of law shook hand parted one thing be quite clear to mr furnival a have carried in cab from ely place to own chamber in lincoln inn mr chaffanbrass be fully convinced of lady mason guilt have not actually said so have not even troubled to go through little ceremony of expressing belief in innocence mr furnival be well aware that mr chaffanbrass must not on account be le likely to come out strongly with such assurance before jury to be le severe in cross examination of witness whose evidence went to prove that guilt nevertheless conviction be disheartening mr chaffanbrass must know almost by instinct whether accused person be be not guilty have already perceived by instinct that lady mason be guilty mr furnival sighed a stepped out of cab again wished that must wash hand of whole affair wished very much knew that wish must not be gratified solomon aram said to a again sat down in arm chair will sound badly to people down at alston at old bailey mind that kind of thing then made up mind that solomon aram must not do must be disgrace to to take case out of solomon aram hand mr chaffanbrass did not understand mr chaffanbrass have be dealing with solomon aram life mr chaffanbrass must not see effect alliance must have on character of barrister holding mr furnival position solomon aram be good man in way doubt perhaps best man going in taking dodge to prevent conviction man must be better than solomon aram mr furnival felt felt also that must not afford must be tantamount to confession of guilt to take man a down into country said to trying to excuse then also made up mind that must sound felix graham if felix graham must be induced to take up case thoroughly believing in innocence of client man must be more useful a junior felix graham went home circuit on alston be one of assize town chapter xxxv love be still lord of why must not such have be question sir peregrine orme have asked over over again in latter day since lady mason have be staying at house purport of question be why must not make lady mason wife reader can probably see very many reason why must not do so then be not in love with lady mason charm sorrow soft sad smile more lovely tear have not operated upon be not chivalrous old gentleman past seventy year of age still alive keenly alive to strong feeling of romance that visit will perhaps be remembered mr furnival made at cleeve subsequent interview between lady mason baronet on day merely asked question took further step on subsequent day day after be same still asked question sitting alone in library did not ask a yet of one else when met lady mason in day manner to be full of deference due to lady of affection due to dear friend be mr orme seeing cordially concurring in love for guest followed lead father in law gave threw into lady mason arm two be fast bosom friend what did lady mason think of in truth there be much in be sweet to there be something also increased that idea of danger now seemed to envelop whole existence why have sir peregrine so treated in library behaving towards with such token of close affection have put arm round waist kissed lip pressed to old bosom why have be so have assured that must be to a father woman instinct have told that pressure of hand have be warmer than father accord to adopted daughter idea of anger have come upon for moment have thought about much have thought about almost in dismay what if old man did mean more than father love seemed to a though must be dream that must do so what if did how must answer in such circumstance what must do say must afford to buy friendship even warmest love at cost of enmity of so many others must not mr orme hate mr orme whom truly dearly eagerly loved mr orme affection be of personal gratification sweetest to young heir must not hate nay must not interfere with strong hand prevent so mean deed on part of grandfather if so must not thus have lost altogether then thought of that other friend whose aid must be so indispensable to in dreadful time of tribulation how must mr furnival receive such tidings if must come to pas that such tidings be to be told lady mason be rich with female charm used partly with innocence of dove partly also with wisdom of serpent in such use a did make of only weapon providence have given to think that can be regarded a very culpable during long year of young widowhood in nothing have be wanting to conduct have be free from hint of reproach have be content to find joy in duty in love a mother now great necessity for assistance have come upon be necessary that must bind men to cause men powerful in world able to fight battle with strong arm did so bind with only chain at command have thought nay suspicion of evil in so doing be very painful to when found that have caused unhappiness to mr furnival caused pain now also when thought of sir peregrine new love did wish to bind men to by strong attachment must have stayed feeling at certain point have be possible for so to manage in mean time sir peregrine still asked that question have declared to when first idea have come to that none of whom loved must be injured must even ask daughter in law consent condescending to plead cause before making understand motif asking acquiescence a favour must be so careful of grandson that second marriage if such event did come to pas must not put pound out of pocket at rate must not hamper succession of estate with pound of debt then made excuse to a to step proposed to take thinking how must meet friend how must carry before old servant old men have made more silly marriage than then desired gentleman such a sir peregrine in age station have married housemaid have married young girl of eighteen year of age have done so faced friend servant afterwards bride that proposed to be lady old friend woman over forty one whom by marriage must greatly assist in deep sorrow why must not do after much of such thought a extended over nearly week resolved to speak mind to mr orme if be to be done must be done at once incredulous unromantic reader of age must hardly believe if said that main object be to render assistance to lady mason in difficulty so assured so believed assistance to be of true service must be given at once having so resolved sent for mr orme into library edith darling said taking hand pressing between own a be often wont with in more affectionate mood want to speak to on business that concern nearly may perhaps concern nearly can give hour of course can what be sir be bad hand at business know that sit down dear there sit there will sit here a to business one can counsel a well a dearest father must be poor councillor in anything not in edith be about lady mason must speak to love dearly do not do be glad to have here oh so glad when trial be only over will be so sweet to have for neighbour really know now will be so pleasant to see much of there be nothing discouraging in still word in slight degree grated against sir peregrine feeling at present moment did not wish to think of lady mason a living at orley farm must have preferred that daughter in law must have spoken of a being there at cleeve yes know her now said believe in edith knowledge obtained of friend in happiness be at equal to be obtained in sorrow have lady mason be prosperous have never become subject to malice avarice of wicked people must never have loved a do love must father be cruelly ill used woman woman worthy of kindest usage be old man now have never before be lot to be so anxious for fellow creature a be for be dreadful to think innocence in country must be subject to such attack indeed be think that there be danger be very well showed that mr orme mind be well disposed towards woman whom loved have known that before began to feel that be not approaching object have in view edith at last said abruptly love with whole heart must fain make wife sir peregrine orme have never in course through life failed in anything for lack of courage when idea came home to that be trembling at task have imposed on dashed at at once be so that forlorn hope be led become not forlorn be so that breach be taken wife said mr orme must not have breathed syllable to pain if must have helped suddenness of announcement overcame for moment yes edith wife let discus matter before condemn in first place must have to understand will not marry if say that will make unhappy have not spoken to a yet know nothing of project sir peregrine may be presumed have not thought much of kiss have given continued to say have given up whole life to be angel if thing will make unhappy will not be done sir peregrine have not so considered with such woman a mr orme be of course surest way to overcome opposition on own behalf thinking only of must stand in way of nothing must add to sir peregrine happiness nevertheless idea be strong in mind that marriage must be imprudent sir peregrine at present stood high before world must stand so high if did thing gray hair old manly bearing be honoured revered by who knew must still be so if made husband of lady mason loved so dearly valued so highly honour be paid to be so proud of own boy in be grandson of so perfect gentleman must not be sad ending to career such be thought ran through mind at moment make unhappy said getting up going over to be happiness of must think will make more happy will enable to befriend more effectually dearest father must be first consideration to to peregrine will make more happy think will answered slowly then for one will say nothing against answered be very weak will be said yes be weak many of sweetest kindest best of woman be weak in way be not woman can bring to say hard useful wise word in opposition to folly of love best woman to be useful wise doubt must have such power for be not so sure that like useful wise woman then for one will say nothing against said mr orme deficient in utility wanting in wisdom full of sweetest affection be sure that will not love le said sir peregrine yes be sure of if be to be so must endeavour to love more dearest edith have only one other person to tell do mean peregrine said in softest voice yes of course must be told a must not be well to ask consent a have asked yours then a said kissed brow will let know yes be if accepts proposition then will know immediately edith dear may be sure of nothing do will be allowed in way to injure prospect to hamper a regard money when be gone if marriage take place can not do very much for in way of money will understand that something can of course then mr orme stood over fire looking at hot coal thinking what lady mason answer must be esteemed lady mason very highly regarding a woman sensible conscientious at point felt by mean certain that offer must be accepted what if lady mason must say that such arrangement must not be possible for mr orme felt that under such circumstance at rate must not withdraw love from lady mason now may a well speak to at once said sir peregrine be in drawing room left there will ask to come to with love have better not say anything suppose sir peregrine in heart of heart wished that daughter in law must say must not give commission perhaps not then mr orme be going to leave one word more edith darling have known other so long loved other so well must be unhappy if be to fall in estimation there be fear of father will believe when assure that great object in doing be to befriend good worthy woman whom regard a ill used beyond ill usage of have hitherto known anything then assured that did so believe assured truly after left went away to send in lady mason for interview in mean time sir peregrine got up stood with back to fire must have be glad that coming scene must be over yet must be wronging to say that be afraid of there must be pleasure to in telling that loved so dearly trusted with such absolute confidence there must be sort of pleasure to in speaking even of sorrow in repeating assurance that must fight battle for with mean at command perhaps also there must be pleasure in downcast look of eye a accepted tender of love something of pleasure have known already then remembered other alternative be quite upon card that must decline offer did not by mean shut eye to did do so friendship must by mean be withdrawn from must be very careful from onset that must understand so much a then heard light footstep in hall gentle hand be raised to door lady mason be standing in room dear lady mason said meeting half way across room be very kind of to come to when send for in way must be duty to come to if be half across kingdom pleasure also must said looking into face with wishfulness of young lover from moment knew what be coming strange a be destiny be to

for wife of wife for husband sir peregrine ah have not thought of friend have not remembered position in be placed dearest dearest friend dearest of friend then knelt before leaning on knee a sat in accustomed large arm chair may not be so think of sorrow must come to yours if enemy must prevail by will not prevail swore sir peregrine roundly a swore oath put two hand upon shoulder will hope not must die here at foot if thought that must prevail must die twenty death be to drag with into disgrace there will be disgrace even in standing at bar who will dare to say so when will stand there with said sir peregrine there be feeling expressed in face a spoke word made glorious bright beautiful with eye laden with tear must not see nevertheless knew that be bright beautiful voice be full of hot eager assurance that assurance have power to convey from one breast to must not be so if stood there with a husband lord must not be case that one must dare to impute disgrace to yet did not wish even

have done so have felt that be not able if wish sir peregrine said at last can love old man have asked old men sometimes will ask question such a did not answer stood by side then again kissed be happy resolved from moment that lady mason must no longer be regarded a widow of city knight a wife elect of country baronet ridicule might incur in matter must incur at once men woman have dared to speak of cruelly must now learn that such future speech must be spoken of one who be exclusively property let who chose to be speaker under such circumstance look to have devoted to that might be

then escaping went to own chamber ask mr orme if will kindly step to said sir peregrine having rang bell for servant lady mason escaped across hall to stair succeeded in reaching room without being seen by one then sat down began to look future world in face two question have to ask must be well for that marriage must take place must be well for in off hand way have already answered question have done so by feeling rather than by thought no doubt must gain much in coming struggle by position a sir peregrine must give did seem to that mr dockwrath joseph mason must hardly dare to bring charge a threatened against wife of sir peregrine orme then too what evidence a to character must be so substantial a evidence of such marriage how must mr furnival bear if be offended must be possible that fight must be fought without must be impossible lawyer knowledge experience skill be a necessary to a baronet position character why must mr furnival be offended by such marriage did not know said to herself must not see that there must be cause of offence yet inner whisper of conscience told that there must be offence must mr furnival be told must be told at once then what must lucius say think how must answer strong word son must use to must use strong word knew must greatly dislike second marriage of mother what grown up son be ever pleased to hear that mother be about to

might not demand be not that other son provided for grown up woman with rich husband be not child a well a have pleaded be not own a well worthy of love have succeeded in getting inheritance for baby at foot have having made happy then child have be all in to now felt that child be half estranged from about very property must become wholly estranged by method be taking to secure have toiled for said to herself rising up early going to bed late thief cometh in night despoileth who can guess bitterness of thought a said last thought a sat there thinking be of sir peregrine must be well for that must do in thus considering did not turn mind chiefly to usual view in marriage must be regarded men might call sir peregrine old fool laugh at for must with god help make amends in matter must judge for must judge right thus to link life to hers must be true leal to in thing then about trial if there came disgrace ruin utter overthrow if must not be well at rate that marriage must take place till have be decided must not find in heart to bring down old gray hair with utter sorrow to grave chapter xxxvi what young men thought about lucius mason at time be living at home at orley farm not by mean in happy frame of mind will be perhaps remembered that have at one time have interview with mr furnival in lawyer chamber be by mean consoling to seeing that mr furnival have pooh poohed pretension in very off hand way have since paid very memorable visit to mr dockwrath in have hardly be more successful nevertheless have gone to lawyer have felt impossible to remain tranquil pursuing ordinary avocation of life while such dreadful charge be being made openly against mother being so made without authorised contradiction knew that be innocent doubt on matter ever perplexed mind for moment why be coward that must not allow to protect innocence in only way law permitted must hardly believe that have power of doing so even without sanction therefore went to lawyer other lawyer did good be not practicable that son must bring action for defamatory character on part of mother without mother sanction moreover a new lawyer saw in moment such interference on part of lucius interposition of fresh new legal proceeding must cripple impede adviser to whom lady mason have confided own case new lawyer must hing thus lucius again repulsed betook to orley farm in happy frame of mind for day two after did not see mother must not go down to cleeve though sent up asked be almost afraid to go across to house visit will be in church on sunday have said to mr orme be not in church

being said of must set at other table than drink of man cup mine know innocence a went on to speak stood up before looked down fully into face others know how unworthy be falsehood with wicked men strive to crush others believe that be true accusation can not be disregarded now seems now that have allowed to gather to head will result in trial during will have to stand at bar charged with dreadful crime oh lucius hid eye in hand must not have helped how must have helped well must be so now till trial be over here must be place here at right hand be who be bound to stand by be whose duty be to see that name be made white again though spend have ay life in doing be one man on whose arm have right to lean yet in such day a leave house go to of stranger be not stranger lucius can not be to a son must be however be for to judge have control in matter think right that must know what be thought then have crept back again to cleeve let lucius say what might let additional sorrow be ever so bitter must not obey son behest if did so in one thing must do so in have chosen adviser with best discretion by choice must abide even though separated from son must not abandon sir peregrine orme mr furnival so crept back told to mr orme heart must have utterly sunk within must not have spoken openly to one of sorrow love mr have said comforting be not that doe not love be so stern to then mr orme have kissed promised that none must be stern to there in house on morning after sir peregrine have made offer then felt that division between boy must be wider than ever have come of inheritance have demanded so eagerly for child now lucius be sitting alone in room at orley farm having for present given up idea of attempting anything by mean of law have made way into mr dockwrath office have there insulted attorney in presence of witness hope now be that attorney might bring action against if be done must thus have mean of bringing out fact of case before jury judge be fixed in mind that if must once drag reptile before public tribunal with loud voice declare wrong be being done might be well public must understand must speak out reptile must be scorned trodden

stress of sentiment to lay bare sorrow of heart a be sister on occasion peregrine said to that must lay bare sorrow of heart must find out what others thought of marriage have proposed to then if mother encouraged grandfather approved must make attack beginning on side of judge perhaps on of lady staveley found that others a well a be labouring under stress of sentiment when about to tell own

nothing on subject a grandson sat over wine later in evening peregrine be summoned to mother room with considerable hesitation much diffidence informed of coming nuptials marry lady mason have said yes peregrine why must not do so if wish peregrine thought that there be many cause impediment sufficiently just why such marriage must take place have not argument ready at finger end be so stunned by intelligence that must say little about on occasion by few word that did say by darkness of countenance showed plainly enough that disapproved then mother said that must in baronet favour pointing out that in pecuniary way peregrine must receive benefit rather than injury be not thinking of money mother dear be right must tell how considerate grandfather be same wish must not marry woman woman peregrine must not speak in way of friend whom dearly love be woman same then sat sulkily looking at fire own stress of sentiment did not admit of free discussion at present moment be necessarily postponed on other affair be told that grandfather must be glad to see on following morning then left mother grandfather peregrine asked for assent said mr orme thought right to give said to make understand that be no longer in power to oppose match be thoroughly glad that be so for must have lacked courage to oppose sir peregrine in anything on next morning peregrine saw grandfather before breakfast mother came to room door while be dressing to whisper word of caution to pray be courteous to said remember how good be to to say that congratulate said peregrine ah peregrine will tell what

mother have cordially given consent to marriage told that have asked that have agreed to must agree to anything peregrine be not way in must speak of mother then young man stood silent a though there be nothing more to be said indeed have nothing more to say did not dare to bring forward in word argument against marriage be now crowding into memory must not induce to wish old man joy to say of civil thing be customary on such occasion baronet sat for while silent also cloud of anger be coming across brow checked that before spoke well boy said voice be almost more than usually kind can understand thought will say nothing of at present will ask of be to treat lady mason in manner befitting position in intend to place if think will be more comfortable sir will leave cleeve for time hope may not be necessary why must at rate not a yet added a thought a to wedding day occurred to then interview be over in half hour met again at breakfast in breakfast room lady mason be also present peregrine be last to enter a did so grandfather be already standing in usual place with book of prayer in hand waiting that servant must arrange at chair before knelt down there be time then for much greeting peregrine did shake hand with a stept across to accustomed corner shook hand with felt that hand be very cold did not look at did hear answer given to muttered word when got up remained close to mr orme a though might thus be protected from anger feared from sir peregrine other friend at breakfast also sat close to far away from baronet almost hidden by urn from grandson sitting there said nothing neither in truth did eat anything be time of great suffering to for knew that coming must not be welcomed by young heir must not be said to herself over over again though turn out of house must tell that can not be so after breakfast peregrine have ridden over to orley farm there held consultation with other heir on returning to cleeve did not go into house having given up horse to groom wandered away among wood lucius mason have suggested that peregrine orme must speak to lady mason on matter felt that grandfather must be very angry must do so did not regard that much have filled full with theory of duty must act up to must see without telling one be purpose put to whether must bring down destruction on so noble gentleman having thus resolved returned to house when be already dark making way into drawing room sat down before fire still thinking of plan room be dark a such room be dark for last hour two before dinner in january sat in arm chair before fire intending to sit there till must be necessary that must go to dress be unaccustomed thing with so to place at time to remain in drawing room at till came down for few minute before dinner did so now having be thrown out of usual habit by care upon mind have be so seated about quarter of hour be already nearly asleep when heard rustle of woman garment looking round with such light a fire gave perceived that lady mason be in room have entered very quietly be making way in dark to chair frequently occupied between fire one of window in doing so passed so near peregrine a to touch with dress lady mason said speaking in first place in order that might know that be not alone be almost dark will ring for candle for started at hearing voice begged pardon for disturbing declined offer of light declared that be going up again to own room immediately occurred to that if must be well that must speak to must be well that must do so at once what opportunity must be more fitting than present if be not in hurry about anything said must mind staying here for few minute oh certainly not must perceive that voice trembled in uttering even few word think 'd better light candle said then did light one of stood on corner of mantelpiece solitary candle only seemed to make gloom of large room visible however be standing close to must have much preferred that room must have be left to darkness wo sit down for few minute then sat down will just shut door if mind then having done so returned to own chair again faced fire saw that be pale nervous did not like to look at a spoke began to reflect also that might probably be interrupted by mother wished that must adjourn to other room that however seemed to be impossible so summoned up courage began task hope wo think uncivil lady mason for speaking to about affair oh mr orme be sure that will not be uncivil to of course can not help feeling great concern in for be very nearly same know a if be father indeed if come to that be almost worse can assure be nothing about money that mind many fellow in place must be afraid about care twopence what doe in respect be so honest so noble hearted that be sure wo do wrong hope not mr orme certainly not in respect to only mention for fear must misunderstand there be other reason lady mason why marriage will make make very unhappy be there will be so unhappy if make others unhappy will then can assure of that be not only own son be up with to day think of same a do what did say mr orme what did say well exactly remember word made understand that marriage with sir peregrine must make very unhappy did indeed why do not see talk to thought best to write to in first place well now have written think must be well that must go up see will find that be quite a strong against a be quite peregrine have known be using argument be of least likely to induce lady mason to pay visit to orley farm dreaded idea of quarrel with son must have made almost sacrifice to prevent such misfortune at present moment feared anger of word almost more than anger implied by absence if trial must be got over must return to almost throw at foot till time might not be well that must be apart at rate tidings of discontent must not be efficacious in inducing to seek dear lucius said not addressing to companion speaking thought must not willingly give cause to be discontented with be then very discontented can assure of yes think differently about ah think have better speak to before quite make up mind be son know uncommon clever fellow too will know how to say much better than do say what mr orme why of course ca expect anybody will like marriage a be anybody except sir peregrine mother doe not object to mother know mother yet must not object to have head cut off if anybody wanted that cared about know how have be managed suppose sir peregrine asked then of course must not object look at common sense of lady mason what doe world always say when old man like grandfather marries young woman be not so far got then stopped have liked very much be sure have for one will go in for heart soul in shameful law business when lucius asked did think anything of going to scoundrel in hamworth along have be delighted that sir peregrine took up by heaven 'd be glad to go down to yorkshire walk into fellow want to do injury must indeed will stand by a strong a anybody lady mason when come to one grandfather marrying think what people in county will say of if be father if have be at top of tree life how must like to see get fall be laughed at a though be in mud just when be too old ever to get up again be not sure whether lucius mason with cleverness must have put matter much better have used style of oratory more efficacious to end in view peregrine have drawn picture with coarse pencil have drawn strongly with graphic effect then paused not with self confidence a giving companion time to see how great have be art in want of word somewhat confused by strength of own thought so got up poked fire turning back to then sat down again be such deuce of thing lady mason said that must not be angry with for speaking out oh mr orme be not angry know what to say to why speak to lucius what must say more than have said dear mr orme must not injure grandfather mean for that world hold will injure in eye of friend then will not do will go to beg that may not be so will tell can not anything will be better than bringing to sorrow disgrace by jove will really peregrine be startled almost frightened at effect of own eloquence what must baronet say when learned that have be talked out of wife by grandson mr orme continued lady mason be sure understand how matter have be brought about if did however much might grieve must not blame even in thought from first to last only desire have be to obey grandfather in everything must not marry out of obedience must did so intend must certainly if in doing so did injury say that mother must give life for so must anything else must give without hurting others be not that sought for marriage did think of if be in place mr orme must know how difficult be to refuse peregrine again got up standing with back to fire thought over again soft heart almost relented towards woman who have borne rough word with so much patient kindness have sir peregrine be there then must have condescended so far might have won grandson consent without much trouble peregrine like other general have expended energy in gaining victory be more ready now to come to easy term than must have be have suffered in combat illustration peregrine eloquence well said after while be sure be very much obliged to for manner in have taken what said to nobody know about yet suppose perhaps if will talk to governor will talk to mr thank then perhaps thing may turn out right will go dress now so saying took departure leaving to consider how best might act at crisis of life so thing might go right if such be possible more thought of le possible seemed that affair must be made to go right chapter xxxviii oh indeed dinner on day at cleeve be not very dull peregrine have hope that idea of marriage might be abandoned be at rate much better disposed towards lady mason than have be spoke to asking whether have be out suggesting roast mutton such creature comfort be lost neither on sir peregrine on mr orme exerted to say few word in more cheery tone than have be customary in house for last day two lady mason did not say much have sufficient tact to see effort be being made though spoke little smiled accepted graciously courtesy be tendered to then two lady went away peregrine be again left with grandfather be nasty accident that graham have going out of monkton grange said speaking on moment of closing dining room door after mother suppose heard about sir having fought battle so well before dinner be determined to give little rest to half vanquished enemy first tidings heard be that be dead said sir peregrine filling glass be dead of course know now broke arm two rib got rather bad squeeze be just behind know have to wait for lost run have to see harriet tristram go away with best lead one have have to fast thing year be uncommon nasty place at back of monkton grange hope peregrine think too much about harriet tristram think of who think of in what sort of way think go uncommonly well to hound may be must not wish to see pin happiness on lady be celebrated chiefly for going well to hound do mean marry peregrine immediately made strong comparison in mind between miss tristram madeline staveley yes be what did mean must have if owned fox cover in county by jove know trick worth two of that be jolly enough to see going a to being in love with in sort of way be quite right boy quite right be not that that man want in wife said peregrine with melancholy cadence in voice thinking of what be that did want so sat sipping wine turn conversation have taken have for moment nearly put lady mason out of young man head must be very young to marry yet said baronet yes must be young know that there be harm in contrary if young man feel to be sufficiently settled mother know must be very glad that must marry early so must if married well what on earth must all mean must not be that grandfather knew that be in love with miss staveley have be known grandfather must not have talked of harriet tristram oh yes of course fellow must marry well think much of marrying for money do peregrine think very little of about being of very high birth well must make unhappy very unhappy if be to marry below own rank what do call own rank mean girl whose father be not gentleman whose mother be not lady of whose education among lady must not feel certain must be quite certain about said peregrine very innocently what oh forgot that be talking about nobody mean harriet tristram certainly not of whom be thinking peregrine may ask if be not too close secret then again there be pause during peregrine emptied glass filled again have objection to talk to grandfather about miss staveley felt ashamed of having allowed matter to escape in sort of way will tell why ask boy continued baronet be going to do many people will call very foolish thing mean about lady mason yes mean own marriage with lady mason will not talk about just at present only mention to explain that before do so will settle property permanently if be married must at once divide with must like to keep old house till die oh sir sooner than give cause of offence must give that up must not consent to live in unless did so a guest until marriage think of settling on thousand year must add to happiness if thought likely that must marry soon now may ask of whom be thinking peregrine paused for second two before made reply then brought out boldly be thinking of madeline staveley then boy be thinking of prettiest girl best bred lady in county here be health filled for bumper of claret must have named woman whom must be more proud to see bring home mother opinion of be same a mine happen to know with look of triumph drank glass of wine a though much be very joyful to have be already settled yes said peregrine mournfully be very nice girl at least think so man who can win peregrine may consider to be lucky fellow be quite right in what be saying about money man feel more sure of than do if be not mistaken miss staveley will have something of own rather think that arbuthnot got ten thousand pound be sure know sir said peregrine voice be by mean a much elated a of grandfather think did if did get remainder be settled on judge be not man to behave better to one child than to suppose not then conversation flagged little for enthusiasm be one side be moreover on side naturally must have be least enthusiastic poor peregrine have only told secret a yet that not most important half to sir peregrine tidings a far a have heard be very pleasant did not say to that must purchase grandson assent to own marriage by giving consent to grandson marriage did seem to that two affair acting upon other might be made to run smooth heir must have made better choice in selecting lady of love sir peregrine have feared much that miss tristram like might have be tendered to a future lady orme be agreeably surprised to find that new mistress for cleeve have be so well chosen must be kindness to grandson win from if might be possible reciprocal courtesy complaisance mother will be very pleased when hears said meant to tell mother said peregrine still very dolefully know that there be anything in to please only said that admired miss staveley dear boy if will take advice will propose to at once have be staying in same house with have have have proposed to well have refused know about now there be such great cause for joy oh have proposed to have spoken to father mother be use when told plainly that did not care for of course must have asked father a to lady staveley got on uncommonly well be almost inclined to think that must not have objected must be very nice match for dare say must not have objected then for ten minute sat looking at fire peregrine have nothing more to say about baronet be thinking how best might encourage grandson must try again know at last said well fear not think must be good be not quite sure doe not care for one else who be oh fellow be there man who broke arm say doe know of course wo mention sir peregrine gave necessary promise then endeavoured to give encouragement to lover must see judge if be thought expedient explain what liberal settlement must be made on lady in event of altering mind young lady know be very prone to alter mind on such matter said old man in answer to peregrine declared conviction that madeline staveley must not alter mind then despondent lover hold that opinion of own mistress sir peregrine have be great gainer by what have occurred so felt at rate novelty of question of own marriage be over a between peregrine then have acquired mean of being gracious must almost disarm grandson of power of criticism when old man be ready to do so much to forward view of young man must be possible that young man must oppose wish peregrine be aware that power of opposition be thus lessened in evening nothing remarkable occurred between have own plan plan must not be furthered by anything to be said in general assembly lady mason have already told to mr orme have passed in drawing room before dinner sir peregrine have determined that must consult mr orme a to matter regarding miss staveley did not think much of refusal

possible notice have called to say that firm be of opinion that action must be brought for forgery for perjury for perjury mr furnival have said well yes must wish to be a little harsh a possible if convict of having sworn falsely when gave evidence a to having copied codicil having seen witnessed by pretended witness why in case of course property must go back ca give opinion a to what might be result in case said mr furnival mr round have gone on to say that thought improbable that action must be tried before summer assize sooner better a far a be concerned said mr furnival if really mean will see that there will be unnecessary delay mr furnival have declared that did really mean so interview have ended mr furnival have really meant fully concurring in opinion mr chaffanbrass have expressed on matter nevertheless increasing urgency of case have almost made tremble still carried with brave outside before mat round protesting a to utter absurdity a well a cruelty of whole proceeding conscience told that be not absurd perjury said to then rang bell for crabwitz upshot of interview be that mr crabwitz received commission to arrange meeting between great barrister member for essex marsh mr solomon aram wo look rather rather rather know what mean sir crabwitz have asked must fight people with own weapon said mr furnival not exactly with justice seeing that messrs round crook be not at of same calibre in profession a mr solomon aram mr furnival have already at time seen mr slow of firm of slow bideawhile who be sir peregrine solicitor have done chiefly that might be able to tell sir peregrine that have seen mr slow have declared that case be one firm must not be prepared to conduct named firm to must recommend client to apply mr furnival carefully considering whole matter have resolved to take advice benefit by experience of mr chaffanbrass then went down once more to cleeve poor mr furnival in day be dreadfully buffeted about a regard outer man inner conscience by unfortunate case giving up to time must otherwise have turned into heap of gold giving up domestic conscience for mr furnival be still hot in anger against poor lady mason giving up also much peace of mind for felt that be soiling hand by dirty work thought of lady pale sweet face of tear laden eye of soft beseeching tone gentle touch thought of thing a must not have thought of

from old bailey be to be retained for defence of future wife drew up said that must hardly approve of gentleman named be doubt very clever in criminal concern must understand a much a though have not have great opportunity of looking into affair of sort surely in lady mason case assistance of such description must hardly be needed must not be better to consult messrs slow bideawhile then turned out that messrs slow bideawhile have be consulted mr furnival not altogether successfully endeavoured to throw dust into baronet eye declaring that in combat with devil one must use devil weapon assured sir peregrine that have given matter most matured indeed most painful professional consideration there be unfortunate circumstance required peculiar care be matter must depend entirely on evidence of one two person who might be suborned in such case must be well to trust to who knew how to break down crush lying witness in such work a slow bideawhile must be innocent ignorant a babe a to breaking down crushing witness anxious to speak truth mr furnival at time said nothing will not think that falsehood fraud can prevail said sir peregrine proudly do prevail sometimes said mr furnival then with much outer dignity of demeanour with shame faced trembling of inner man hidden under guise of outer dignity sir peregrine informed lawyer of great purpose indeed said mr furnival throwing back into chair with start yes mr furnival must not have taken liberty to trouble with matter so private in nature for close professional intimacy great friendship with lady mason oh indeed

look so different know how look said augustus not altogether satisfied a to manner in be being treated such have be audacity too great audacity on present occasion be most audacious of men for audacity must carry to foot of lady to morrow without slightest check be only answer be to receive from be quite answer enough what must have do get up decline honour of being mr augustus staveley with curtsy must have hing of kind must have get up accept honour with kiss so that might have kiss might have be going to say disappointment only must be untrue let assure that be not so demonstrative in token of regard wonder whether mean that be not so honest mr staveley mean nothing of kind be very impertinent to express supposition have done said to make suppose have lost heart to a have mine be at rate human nature in to hope that might have yours psha heart have be making shuttlecock of till be doubtful whether have not banged to piece know two lady who carry in cap two feather out of be so easy to see when man be in love go cross gartered like malvolio cross gartered in look word doings there be touch of in cross gartered have never got so far yet a lack daisical twist to corner of mouth did watch mr before went away why be cross gartered men have eye never see anything idea of love making be to sit under tree wishing wondering whether ripe fruit will fall down into mouth ripe fruit doe sometimes fall then be well with if wo pas on say that be sour a for climbing fruit generally fall too fast to admit of such exercise said staveley who did not choose that sharp thing must be said on other side be result of very extended experience orchard have be opened to have not fear be of first quality mr staveley hand will do very well by such be not sort of climbing be required be what call stooping to pick up fruit have fallen a spoke moved little away from on sofa how be man to climb do really mean that want lesson if be to tell word must be thrown away men will not labour who have gotten that require without work why strive to deserve woman when woman be plenty who care to be deserved plan of picking up fallen apple be so much easier lesson might perhaps have be given miss furnival might have imparted to mr staveley idea of excelsior in matter of love making have not mr staveley mother come into room at moment mr staveley be beginning to fear that result of christmas hospitality must not be satisfactory peregrine orme whom must have be so happy to welcome to warmest corner of household temple a son have be sent away in wretchedness

correctness there be felix graham still in room up stair doctor having said that might be moved in day two be such movement might possibly be effected without detriment having said also that ten day of uninterrupted rest must be very desirable now in addition to son augustus be to be found on wet morning closeted somewhere with sophia furnival on wet morning sometimes on dry morning also illustration lady stavely interrupting son sophia furnival then on very day lady staveley have discovered that felix graham door in corridor be habitually left open knew child too well be too clear pure in own mind to suppose that there be anything wrong in clandestine talking be arranged anything planned in secret what feared be that really occurred door be left open a madeline passed felix must say word then madeline must pause answer such word a be might have be spoken before household if so spoken must have be free from danger be not free from danger when spoken in way in passage of half closed doorway lady staveley understood perfectly baker have said with more of anger in voice than be usual with why do leave door open think sweetens room lady indeed felix graham sometimes thought so too nonsense sound in house must be heard keep shut if please yes lady said mr baker who also understood perfectly be better darling said mr baker to madeline same day indeed for be well enough a regard eating drinking must be cruelty to move yet heard what doctor said who talk of moving well talk of doctor said might be possible know what mean what doe mean why just that if want to get rid of wo quite be death of who want to get rid of be sure mind trouble least in life be a nice young gentleman a ever sat beside bed of be full of spirit be then madeline appealed to mother surely mother must not let mr graham be sent out of house in present state merely because doctor said might be possible to move without causing instant death tear stood in poor madeline eye a thus pleaded cause of sick wounded again tormented lady staveley who found necessary to give further caution to mr baker baker said how can be so foolish a to be talking to miss madeline about mr graham arm who lady lady yes when know that least thing frightens remember how ill made when roger roger be old family groom when roger have that accident lady staveley might have saved trouble of reminiscence a to roger for baker knew more about than when roger scalp have be laid bare by fall miss madeline have chanced to see have fainted miss madeline be not fainting now baker knew about almost better than lady staveley herself be of very little use talking to baker about roger groom baker thought that mr felix graham be very nice young man in spite of not being exactly handsomelike about physgognomy a remarked to one of younger maid who much preferred peregrine orme coming away from last interval with mr baker lady staveley interrupted son sophia furnival in back drawing room began to feel that solicitude for child must be almost too much for why have asked that nasty girl to house why must not nasty girl go away a for going away there be present hope for have be arranged that must stay for fortnight why must not fate have be kind have allowed felix graham miss furnival to fall in love with other can never make daughter of if doe marry lady staveley said to herself a looked at augustus looked a though be detected stammered out question about mother carriage miss furnival did not for moment lose easy presence of mind lady staveley said why doe not son go hunt shoot fish instead of staying in house day seems to that time be so heavy on hand that will almost have to hang be sure ca tell said lady staveley who be not so perfect actor a guest do think gentleman in house in morning always look so unfortunate have be endeavouring to make agreeable know have be yawning do suppose then that men never sit still in morning said augustus oh in chamber yes on bench perhaps also behind counter very seldom do so in drawing room have be fidgeting about with poker till have destroyed look of fireplace well will go fidget up stair with graham said so left room nasty sly girl said lady staveley to herself a took up work sat down in own chair augustus did go up to friend found reading letter there be one else in room door when augustus reached be properly closed think will be off to morrow old boy said felix then think will do such thing said augustus what be in wind now doctor said morning must be moved without danger said that might possibly be done in two three day be what on earth make so impatient have nothing to do nobody else want to see nobody here want to get rid of be wrong in three statement deuce be who want to get rid of that will come last have something to do somebody else doe want to see have got letter from mary here from mr thomas held up to view two letter have received have in truth startled mary duenna artist who be supposed to be moulding wife yes mary duenna mary artist whichever please of want to see be just like woman to require man attendance exactly when be unable to move then felix though did not give up letter to be read described to certain extent content know what on earth have happened said mary be praying to be forgiven saying that be not fault mr thomas be full of apology declaring that conscience force to tell everything yet between know have happened miss snow have probably lost key of workbox gave have not given workbox then writing desk be what man have to endure when will make head schoolmaster to young lady so be going to look after charge with limb still in bandage just so then took up two letter read again while staveley still sat on foot of bed wish knew what to think about said felix about what said other then there be pause reading of portion of letter there seems something something almost frightful to said felix gravely in idea of marrying girl in few month time who now at so late period of engagement writes to in sort of cold formal way be proper moulded wife style may depend said augustus will tell what staveley if can talk to seriously for five minute will be obliged to if be impossible to say so will drop matter well go on be serious enough in what intend to express even though may not be so in word be beginning to have doubt about dear girl have have doubt for time not mark with regard to myself question be not now whether can love sufficiently for own happiness on side have longer right to doubt must marry if did not love need not discus what if doe not love what if must think release to be freed from engagement how be to find out augustus sat for while silent for did feel that matter be serious case a looked at stood thus friend graham have made very foolish bargain from must probably be glad to escape though must not now bring to say a much bargain bad for must probably be very good for young lady young lady having shilling of own merit of birth early breeding to assist outlook in world might probably regard ready made engagement to clever kind hearted high spirited man a advantage not readily to be abandoned staveley a sincere friend be very anxious that match must be broken off must not bring to tell graham that thought that young lady must so wish according to idea young lady must undergo certain amount of disappointment receive certain amount of compensation graham have be very foolish must pay for folly in preparing to do so must be better that must see acknowledge whole truth of matter be sure that have found out own feeling staveley said at last tone be then serious enough even for friend hardly matter whether have have not said felix matter above thing above thing because a to may come to something like certainty of inside of heart can not know so much fact take be that must wish to escape from bondage not unless thought regarded a bondage also may be that doe a for believe that at present moment marriage must be for safest step must take safe a against what danger danger how if must learn to love woman one utterly out of reach while be still betrothed to rarely flatter graham mean to do now girl ought to be out of reach have talent position birth gift of nature must make equal to lady a for money le have more must look to get if must cease to be mad two year must give command of income will never cease to be mad who be can not be serious now well will be serious serious enough can afford to be so a have received medical passport for to morrow girl say ought to be out of reach if girl be one miss staveley must be regarded a out of reach man doe talk about own sister said staveley having got up from bed walked to window know mean anything by heaven do mean great deal what be mean then mean what must say if learned be suitor for hand staveley have be right in saying that man doe not talk about own sister when have declared with so much affectionate admiration for friend prowess that might aspire to hand of lady one retiring modest browed girl have not be thought of by man in talking to man about woman be always supposed to consider belonging to a exempt from incident of conversation dearest friend talk to other about sister when have once left school man in position a now taken by graham have to make fight for ground a closely a though there have be no former intimacy friend smith in such matter a though have be hail fellow with for last ten year have very little advantage over jones who be introduced to house for first time last week therefore staveley felt almost injured when felix graham spoke to about madeline what must say well be question one doe not understand unless unless really meant to state a fact that be intention to propose to mean rather to state a fact that be not intention to propose to then have better not speak of listen to moment in order may not do so will be better for better for must leave house do mean to say yes do mean to say mean to say mind be now suggesting to quite understand feeling when declare that man doe not like to talk of own sister therefore will talk of sister more old fellow look at a though meant to drop augustus came back to bedside again seating put hand almost caressingly over friend shoulder did not think of said one never doe think of graham replied know more of than bed post said injury such a there be be on one side will tell who suspect baker mother be much mistaken if will not find that with hospitality must prefer must recover strength elsewhere have done nothing to betray mother ear be very sharp know that be so can not explain to how do tell think of getting up to london to morrow see how will take staveley for moment suppose be reproaching be quite right believe have in way committed have said word to sister with lady staveley have right to feel aggrieved if have have wit to read thought of bosom be quite right to wish be out of house poor lady staveley have be possessed of such wit at sphynx have read have be one much more in own line have simply read thought in daughter bosom rather feeling in daughter heart augustus staveley hardly knew what ought to say be not prepared to tell friend that be very brother in law for whose connection must be desirous such marriage for madeline even must madeline desire must not be advantageous when augustus told graham that have gift of nature made equal to lady did not include own sister yet idea of acquiescing in friend sudden departure be very painful to there can be reason why must not stay up here know at last said in so saying pronounced absolute verdict against poor felix on few matter of moment to man own heart can speak out plainly whole truth be in graham have intended so to do have deceived have not absolutely hoped that friend must say come among be one of take be brother yet there came upon heart black load of disappointment in word be said be exact opposite of graham have spoken of a unfit to match with madeline staveley madeline staveley brother have taken at word question augustus asked be be be not practicable that graham must remain there without danger of intercourse with sister to felix question came in very different shape after having spoken a have spoken might be allowed to remain there enjoying such intercourse might not be question to have unconsciously demanded answer unconsciously have still hoped that question might be answered in favour have so hoped although be burdened with mary snow although have spoken of engagement with lady in so rigid spirit of self martyrdom question have be answered against offer of further asylum in seclusion of bedroom have be made to by friend with sort of proviso that must not be well that must go further than bedroom inner feeling at once grated against other making wretched almost angry thank understand how kind be will not do will write up to night will certainly start to morrow dear fellow must get into fever if be to remain in house after what have told must not endure to see mother baker marian one else talk about indeed ought to feel that be not possible have made confounded as of myself sooner get away better say perhaps must not be angry if be to ask to let sleep for hour so now after will get up write letter be very sore knew that be sick at heart ill at ease cross with friend knew also that be unreasonable in being so staveley word manner have be full of kindness graham be aware of be therefore more irritated with did not prevent being angry cross with friend graham said other see clearly enough that have annoyed not in least man fall into mud then call to man to come see man in mud of course be not comfortable have called to have not be able to help did not suppose must so there have be disappointment indeed there be possibility for help will follow out line of life have long since chalked out for expect will be more wretched than other poor devil around a far a idea go make very little difference now leave there be good fellow dear old fellow must give right hand if must make happy wo right hand will make somebody else happy hope will come up to again before dinner very well staveley what have now said can not be forgotten between when next meet ever after let be a though be forgotten then settled down on bed augustus left room will not be supposed that graham did go to sleep that have thought of doing so when be alone word of friend rang over over again in ear girl ought to be out of reach why must madeline staveley be out of reach simply because be friend sister have be made welcome to house therefore be bound to hing unhandsome by family then be bound by other law equally clear to hing unhandsome by other family by other lady if there be anything in staveley word applied a strongly to staveley sister a to other girl why must not lawyer marry lawyer daughter sophia furnival with hatful of money must not be considered too high for in what respect be madeline staveley above sophia furnival that one be immeasurably above other in respect in estimation tended towards female perfection knew to be true enough fruit have be forbidden to gather hung higher on social tree than other fruit have be specially invited to pluck garner then graham be not man to think fruit too high for have overweening idea of own desert socially professionally have taught to expect great thing from own genius have that audacity of spirit bid man hope to compass wish to compass audacity be father mother of success that audacity seldom exists without inner capability on ought to rest then there be mary snow augustus staveley thought little of mary snow according to theory of friend future life mary snow might be laid aside without much difficulty if be so why must not madeline be within reach then be so have not betrothed to mary snow in presence of girl father with solemnity assurance in manner fixed beyond of other betrothal ala yes for reason be right that must hurry away from noningsby then thought of mary letter of mr thomas letter what be have be done mary have written a though have be charged with childish offence mr thomas talked solemnly of acquitting own conscience what must have happened that have touched mr thomas in conscience thought soon ran away from little house at peckham settled again at noningsby must hear more of madeline footstep if not why must have be banished from corridor must hear voice again at door if not why must have be hushed there be silence may be more eloquent than sound follows have one in house guessed feeling in bosom must have walked along corridor a usual spoken word with sweet voice in answer to word felt sure that must be so no more who have stopped why must such sound be no more heard at last did go to sleep not in pursuance of plan formed for doing so for have be asked must have said that sleep be impossible for did go to sleep when awoke be dark have intended to have got up dressed on afternoon to have gone through such ceremony of dressing a be possible for in preparation of next day exercise now rose up in bed with start angry with in having allowed time to pas by lord

share in be confined almost entirely to morning evening teapot be true that be to go to morrow morning augustus be said who graham well say that will be very anxious to get to london doubt find stupid enough lying there doing nothing can do a much there a can lying by in own chamber where suppose must have anybody to look after think be trouble therefore want to go know mamma doe mind about trouble

course mr pottinger say so because think have be so long here doe understand mr pottinger must like to keep patient oh be not at sort of man 'd think of mamma trouble mean of having stranger in house know mamma must think nothing of especially for such intimate friend of yours augustus turned slightly round so a to look more fully into sister face saw that tear be gathered in corner of eye perceived glance partly shrank under soon recovered answered know what mean said if choose to think so ca help be horrible horrible then stopped finding that little sob must become audible if trusted to further word know what mean mad said putting arm affectionately round waist what be that mean come never have secret always say so when want to get at mine tell what be that mean have got secret what did mean looked at because want to let send mr graham away if be old mr furnival must like to turn out of house when be in such state a poor mr furnival think must bear worse than felix then why

graham be friend said special friend hope will always like friend well said know what mean mad yes said be dearest then knew that also have cautioned not to fall in love with felix graham felt angry with for caution why why why hardly knew a yet how to frame question desired to ask chapter xl call awful oh indeed have be word with mr furnival have received announcement made by sir peregrine a to proposed nuptials a uttered lawyer drew up stiffly in chair looking much more like lawyer much le like old family friend than have done moment before whereupon sir peregrine drew up also yes said must be intrusive if be to trouble with motif therefore need only say further a regard lady trust that support standing a will do in position of husband will be more serviceable to than must otherwise have be in trial will presume be forced to undergo doubt doubt said mr furnival then interview have ended lawyer have be anxious to see client have intended to ask permission to do so have felt on hearing sir peregrine tidings that must be useless now to make attempt to see alone that must speak to with freedom in sir peregrine presence so left cleeve having merely intimated to baronet fact of having engaged service of mr chaffanbrass mr solomon aram will not see lady mason sir peregrine have asked thank know that need trouble mr furnival have answered of course will explain to how case at present stand fear must reconcile to fact of trial be aware sir peregrine that offence imputed be one for bail will be taken must propose son of course must be happy to lend own name a will be on trial perhaps may be a well that must be avoided bail will be taken word be dreadful in ear of expectant bridegroom have come to that there be question whether must be locked up in prison like felon nevertheless heart did not misgive seeing how terribly be injured by others felt bound by stronger law to cling to such be special chivalry of man mr furnival on return to london thought almost more of sir peregrine than did either of lady mason of be not pity be not thousand pity that aged noble gentleman must be sacrificed have felt angry with sir peregrine when tidings be first communicated to now a journeyed up to london feeling of anger be transferred to own client must be doing such doing on part while be in present circumstance be very wicked then remembered guilt probable guilt brow became very black supposed guilt have not be horrible to while have regarded a affecting alone in point of property affecting joseph mason son lucius must look forward sometimes almost triumphantly to idea of washing so far a world washing go from guilt setting up again clear before world even though in doing so must lend hand in robbing joseph mason of estate dragging down of such head into vortex of ruin misery be horrible to be not straitlaced mealy mouthed overburthened with scruple in way of profession must do many thing at express single opinion with much anxious deference at honest man might be scandalized if came beneath judgment unprofessionally must not stand something must be done in matter marriage must be stayed till after trial else must retire from defence explain to lady mason to sir peregrine why did so then thought of woman spirit within became very bitter have one told that be jealous of preference shown by client to sir peregrine must have fumed with anger thought that be fuming justly such be in truth case though believed to have be guilty of thing though believed to be now guilty of worse offence of dragging baronet to ruin still be jealous of regard have be content to lean upon to trust to a great only necessary friend must have forgiven else placed at service full force of professional power even though by doing so might have lowered in men mind what reward did expect none have formed no idea that woman must become mistress be a obscure before mind eye a though have be nineteen five twenty be to dine at home on day that being first occasion of doing so for a mr furnival declared last six month in truth however interval have be long though not so long a that have hope that having announced intention might find coast clear hear martha biggs spoken of a dear one lately gone when arrived at home martha biggs be still there under circumstance a now existed mr furnival have determined to keep martha biggs by unless special edict for banishment must come forth then in case of such special edict martha biggs must go thence must arise new casus belli mr furnival have made up mind that war be expedient nay absolutely necessary have idea formed doubt from reading of history that ally require smart brush now again to blow away cloud of distrust become engendered by time between that may become better ally than ever afterwards if appropriate time for brush might ever come have come now world so said to herself be talking of mr furnival lady mason world knew of injury martha biggs be second cousin to mr crook brother wife speak of mr crook who have be professionally known for last thirty year a partner of mr round have be whispered in office in bedford row such whisper fear originating with old round that mr furnival admired fair client hence light have fallen upon eye of martha biggs secret of friend be known to need trace course of tale with closer accuracy oh kitty have said to friend with tear that evening can not bear to keep to myself more can not when see suffering so be awful can not bear to keep what martha oh know indeed town know now know what know how hate that kind of thing if have anything to say speak out be not kind to faithful friend a martha biggs martha knew what sacrifice friendship such a hers demanded did not resent well then if be to speak out be lady mason do say that be shameful quite shameful awful call awful mr furnival have not said much at time to encourage fidelity of friend be thus justified in declaring to herself that husband going on have become talk of world going on especially in quarter in have long regarded with so much dismay be not therefore prepared to welcome on occasion of coming home to dinner by such token of friendly feeling a dismissal of friend to red lion square when moment for absolute war must come martha biggs must be made to depart mr furnival when arrived at own house be in thoughtful mood disposed for quiet domestic meditation have miss biggs not be there must have found in heart to tell everything about lady mason to wife asking counsel a to what must do with reference to marriage must have done so all must have be well be not possible while red faced lump of woman from red lion square sat in drawing room making everything uncomfortable three sat down to dinner together very little be said between mr furnival did try to be civil to wife wife sometimes have mode of declining such civility without committing to overt act of war to miss biggs mr furnival must not bring to say anything civil seeing that hated such word a did speak to received with grim griffin like austerity a though be ever meditating on awfulness of conduct so in truth be why conduct be more awful in estimation since have heard lady mason name mentioned than when mind have be simply filled with general idea of vague conjugal infidelity can not say such be case call awful be first word again spoke when found once more alone with mr furnival in drawing room then sat down over fire thinking neither of novel knitting with mind deliciously filled with anticipation of coming catastrophe if sit up after half past ten must mind going to bed said mr furnival when have be in drawing room about ten minute oh not in least said miss biggs will be sure to go thought very unkind felt a child doe who be deceived in matter of being taken to play if one go child can bear to see others go to be left behind be too much for feeling of child of martha biggs mr furnival have inclination for sitting alone over wine on occasion have be possible for must have preferred to have gone quickly up stair to have taken cup of coffee from wife hand with appreciation of domestic comfort there must be such comfort to while martha biggs be there so sat down stair sipping port according to custom looking into fire for solution of difficulty about lady mason began to wish that have never seen lady mason to reflect that intimate friendship of pretty woman often brings with much trouble be resolved on one thing must not go down into court fight battle for lady orme be to do so matter must have taken quite different phase one that have not at anticipated in case that present client must then have become lady orme mr chaffanbrass mr solomon aram might carry on battle between with such assistance a might be able to get from messrs slow bideawhile became angry a drank port in anger swore that must be so then a anger became hot at close of libation remembered that martha biggs be up stair became more angry still thus when did go into drawing room at time in evening not much before ten be not in frame of mind likely to bring about domestic comfort walked across drawing room sat down in arm chair by table took up last number of review without speaking to of whereupon mr furnival began to ply needle have be lying idly enough upon work martha biggs fixed eye intently upon book so sat twenty minute without word being spoken then mr furnival inquired of lord whether chose to have tea of course will when have said mind said mr furnival pray mind said martha biggs let be in way wo said mr furnival whereupon miss biggs again jumped up in chair a though have be electrified may be remembered that on former occasion mr furnival have sworn at at least in presence need not be rude to lady in own house because be friend said mr furnival bother said mr furnival now if be going to have tea let have think will mind about tea to night mr furnival said miss biggs having received notice from friend eye that might be well for to depart head

find alone in room did wish for further parley because knew that must speak loud probably sob nay very possibly proceed to fainting fit moreover much doubted whether must have power to keep in house

say terrible thing still kept chair for be startled hardly knew what must be about last exclamation have come from almost with shriek now bosom be heaving a though heart must burst with violence of sobbing will go said have better go hurried away towards door go yet rose to stop be quite passive know why must be so much moved now did know did understand very essence core of feeling a probably may reader also be impossible that must allow to leave in present state sat down again leaning arm upon table hid face within hand be now standing for moment did not speak to indeed must not bring to break silence for saw tear must still hear violence of sob then be first to speak if be not for said raising head must bear what will do what will do mean said mr furnival speaking very slowly if verdict must go against will go against said will not tell truth be so clever must know tell how will go be there anything can do to save took hold of arm with hand looked up eagerly oh with such terrible eagerness into face must not have be natural now that must have asked to tell truth yet did not dare to ask thought that knew felt sure almost sure that must look into very heart read there whole of secret still there be doubt enough of doubt to make wish to ask question nevertheless did not ask furnival said a spoke there be hardness came over soft line of feminine face look of courage amounted almost to ferocity look at moment recalled to mind a though be yesterday attitude countenance have borne a stood in witness box at other trial now so many year since attitude countenance have impressed whole court with so high idea of courage mr furnival weak a be must bear to die here on spot now if must only save from agony be not for suffer then terrible idea occurred to that might attempt to compass escape by death did not know must have be escape for son too think must not marry said putting up hand to brow a though to collect thought certainly not lady mason must be wrong mr furnival be so driven that know not how must act what if must lose mind a looked at there be that about eye did tell that ending might be possible speak in such way said will not know that be wrong will go down there tell that must not must not be so may stay at cleeve may not oh certainly if wish after understanding with ah may turn out may not be so kind to so gentle so good lucius be so stern will go back sternness will perhaps be better for now than love kindness in spite of everything in teeth of almost certain conviction of guilt must now even now have asked to come to own house have begged to remain there till trial be over if only have have power to do so what must be to what world might say if must be proved guilty why must not have be mistaken a well a others have idea that if must get into own hand might still bring through triumphantly with assistance from solomon aram chaffanbrass be strongly convinced of guilt by mean strongly convinced that guilt must be proved then have house at present moment that must call own kitty kitty of whom still sometimes thought with affection that kitty whose soft motherly heart must have melted at story of woman sorrow if only have be rightly approached that kitty be now vehemently hostile hostile to to very woman for whom must have asked care may god help said poor woman know where else to turn for aid well may go now then indeed why must take up time further before did go mr furnival gave much counsel did not ask a to guilt did give advice must have thought most expedient have guilt be declared owned told that very much must depend on maintaining present position standing that be so to carry a not to let people think that be doubtful about trial that above thing be to maintain composed steadfast manner before son a to ormes bade not to think of leaving cleeve unless found that remaining there must be disagreeable to sir peregrine after explanation with that be to decline marriage engagement be very

be concerned did say anything about heart yet said mr smiley with measure of approbation in voice did said kenneby then be omission on part beg leave to apologise what be going to say be when heart be concerned everything must be honest above board oh of course said mr moulder be sure suspect nothing else 'd better let go on said mr smiley heart have not be free from woman lovely image be free now

kenneby year be gone by a though be nothing still have have image on heart have seen to day gentleman still alive ai asked mr smiley likely to live said mr moulder have seen to day kenneby continued now adriatic free to wed neither of lady present exactly understood force of quotation a contained appropriate reference to marriage apparently to second marriage be taken by of in good part be considered to have made offer mr smiley thereupon formally accepted be spoke quite handsome be sure said mr smiley to sister know woman have right to expect more a to brick field then there be slight reference to business with will not be necessary that reader of story must embarrass soon after mr kenneby saw mr smiley home in cab poor mr moulder sat by lord till roused from sleep let hope that trouble with be a little vexatious a possible console ourselves with reflection at twelve o'clock next morning after second bottle of soda brandy be a sweet a sweet chapter xliv showing how lady mason must be very noble lady mason returned to cleeve after visit to mr furnival chamber nobody asked why have be to london whom have seen nothing must be more gracious than deference be shown to perfect freedom of action be accorded to on very day lady staveley have called at cleeve explaining to sir peregrine mr orme that visit be made expressly to lady mason must have called at orley farm of course said lady staveley only that hear that lady mason be likely to prolong visit with must trust to mr to make understood sir peregrine took upon to say that must be understood then drawing lady staveley aside told of own intended marriage can not be aware said that have business to trouble with affair be so exclusively own have wish perhaps may understand that there must be secret about think better for sake that must be known if connection can be of service to must reap that benefit now when people be treating name with barbarity believe to be almost unparalleled in country in answer to lady staveley be of course obliged to congratulate did so with best grace in power be not easy to say much be cordial a drove back with mr arbuthnot to noningsby word be said between a to lady mason be not so kindly meant towards lady a remark on journey to cleeve lady staveley have hoped though have hardly expressed hope even to certainly have not spoken of to one else that might have be able to say word two to mr orme about young peregrine word two must have shown own good feeling towards young man own regard almost affection for even though might have be done without mention of madeline name might have learned in way whether young orme have made known at home what have be hope what disappointment might have formed opinion whether must renew suit must not have be first to mention daughter name if mr orme must speak of then subject must be free for must let be known that heir of cleeve must at rate have sanction good will what happiness must be so great for a of having daughter so settled within eight mile of then be not only that marriage between daughter peregrine orme must be event so fortunate also that feeling with reference to felix graham be so unfortunate that young heart thought must not a yet be heavy laden might be possible that whole affair must be made to run in proper course if only must be done at once now that tale sir peregrine have told respecting lady mason have made quite impossible that anything must be said on other subject then again if be decreed that noningsby family family of cleeve must be connected must not such marriage a between baronet lady mason be very injurious so lady staveley be not quite happy a returned to own house lady staveley message however for lady mason be given with full force sir peregrine have felt grateful for what have be done mr orme in talking of made quite most of civility from staveleys to ormes must not in ordinary course of thing be accounted of special value two family might naturally must know other on intimate term ormes must a matter of course stand highest in general estimation now however ormes have to bear up lady mason with sir peregrine have so willed mr orme have not for moment thought of contesting wish of one whose wish have never contested word be spoken on subject still with of there be feeling lady staveley countenance open friendship must be of value when have come to with sir peregrine orme be already disgraced in own estimation already disgraced although declared to thousand time that be only doing duty a gentleman on evening lady mason said word of new purpose have pledged to peregrine orme to mr furnival to have made distinct promise that must break off engagement knew well that deed must be done at once how be to do with what word be to tell that have changed mind must not take hand that have offered to feared to be moment alone with peregrine lest must tax with non fulfilment of promise in truth peregrine at present moment be thinking more of matter have almost come home to that grandfather marriage might facilitate own though still be far from reconciling to connection with lady mason be almost disposed to put up with on following day at about noon chariot with pair of post horse be brought up to door of cleeve at very fast pace two lady soon afterwards learned that lord alston be closeted with sir peregrine lord alston be one of sir peregrine oldest friend be man senior in age standing to baronet moreover be friend who came seldom to cleeve although friendship be close intimate nothing be said between mr orme lady mason dreaded that lord alston have come to remonstrate about marriage so in truth have two old men be together for about hour then lord alston took departure without asking for seeing other one of family lord alston have remonstrated about marriage using at last very strong language to dissuade baronet from step thought so unfortunate have remonstrated altogether in vain word have used be not only fruitless injurious for sir peregrine be man whom be very difficult to rescue by opposition though man might be more easily led by assumed acquiescence orme dear fellow said lordship towards end of interview be duty a old friend to tell then lord alston have done duty not while hope remains may prevent marriage there be ground for such hope on part permit to say that expression of such hope to be greatly wanting in courtesy continued lord alston without apparent attention to last word sir peregrine have spoken have nearly come to end of tether here career have be run think may say a regard may certainly say a regard that have be so run that have not disgraced who preceded dearest hope must be that name may never be held a reproach by who come after with god blessing will hing to disgrace family orme can not act a may whose name in world be altogether unnoticed know that be doing from feeling of charity to lady be doing lord alston because so plea first charity be due to grandson suppose that be making offer of hand to daughter of nobleman a be so well entitled to do how must affect hope if be known that at time have married lady whose misfortune made necessary that must stand at bar in criminal court lord alston said sir peregrine rising from chair trust grandson may never rest hope on woman whose heart must be hardened against by thought a what if must be guilty said lord alston permit to say said sir peregrine still standing standing now bolt upright a though year did not weigh on feather that conversation have gone far enough there be surmise to can not listen even from lord alston then lordship shrugged shoulder declared that in speaking a have spoken have endeavoured to do friendly duty by old friend certainly oldest almost dearest friend have so took leave wheel of chariot be heard grating over gravel a be carried away from door at gallop two lady looked into other face saying nothing sir peregrine be not seen from time till dinner when did come into drawing room manner to lady mason be if possible more gracious more affectionate than ever so lord alston be here to day peregrine said to mother night before went to bed yes be here be about marriage mother a sure a be standing here think lord alston must interfere about perry must must interfere about anything did not like be a far a pluck of go of course ca like who can perry grandfather like surely have right to please know about might say same thing if wanted to kill fox about place do other outlandish thing of course might kill a far a law go where must be afterwards have said anything to have think not to have not spoken to not about promised positively that must break off must not be hard on perry just a word be spoken there came low knock at mr orme dressing room door room in mr orme be wont to sit for hour so night before went to bed be scene of meeting of affection took place between mother son be pretty little apartment opening from mr orme bed room have at one time be exclusive property of peregrine father by degree have altogether assumed feminine attribute have be furnished with soft chair sofa lady table though called by name of mr orme dressing room be in fact separate

very old friend have not mr orme mean peregrine yes have not be so so earnest about told that if married sir peregrine must be doing cruel injury to to grandfather must not have said that yes edith if

not tell said said that if if if what dear if in court must say say what say did thing then sir peregrine must be crushed must die with broken heart can not say that be impossible think possible that can do so then again took hold of lady mason arm looked up anxiously into face looked up anxiously not suspecting anything not for moment presuming possible that verdict must be justly given in order that might see how far fear of fate so horrible be operating on friend lady mason face be pale woe worn not more so than be now customary with one can not say what may be possible answered slowly suppose must not go on with if did not think have chance of success mean a to property yes a to property why must not try that if must try without dragging there ah understand at least can not explain

seat good night dearest will let be friend still will not said lady mason friend oh yes always friend why must interfere between will be very angry at least fear that will not that not that will have anything to regret very strength of generosity nobleness will make angry will be indignant because let make sacrifice for then then fear must leave house oh not will speak to will do anything for will be better perhaps must go people will think that be estranged from lucius if go will come to will let do will not then there be warm close promise given embrace interchanged woman did love other with hearty true love longed that might be left together yet how different be how different have be life prominent thought in lady mason mind a returned to own room be mr orme have said word to dissuade from line of conduct have proposed to herself mr orme have never spoken against marriage a peregrine have spoken mr furnival heart have not be stern enough to allow to do be not clear that opinion be same a theirs lady mason acknowledged to herself that be clear acknowledged to herself also that one be in favour of marriage will do immediately after breakfast said to herself then sat down sat through half night thinking of mr orme when be left alone almost rebuked in have said word of counsel against undertaking lady mason proposed for herself for mr furnival opinion did not care much indeed must have be angry with lady mason for speaking to mr furnival on subject be not that pity be too deep to admit of anger that truth must be established at trial mr orme felt confident when alone must feel quite sure on point though doubt must always creep in on when lady mason be with now a sat alone must not realise idea that fear of verdict against friend must offer valid reason against marriage valid reason if there be such must be looked for elsewhere be other reason so strong in validity sir peregrine desired marriage so did lady mason a regarded own individual wish mr orme be sure that be so then for own self sir peregrine daughter in law only lady concerned in matter also must have liked son disliked have yielded so far to wish of son well be not right that with wish must be paramount thus endeavoured to satisfy conscience a retired to rest on following morning four assembled at breakfast lady mason hardly spoke at to one mr orme who knew what be about to take place be almost a silent sir peregrine have almost more to say than usual to grandson be in good spirit having firmly made up mind on certain point showed by telling peregrine that must ride with immediately after breakfast what have made so slack about hunting during last two three day asked will hunt to morrow said peregrine then can afford time to ride with through wood after breakfast so must have be arranged have not lady mason immediately said that hoped to be able to say few word to sir peregrine in library after breakfast place aux dame said peregrine horse can wait so matter be arranged while be still sitting over toast peregrine a be said have looked at mother have not ventured to take eye for moment from teapot then have looked at lady mason saw that be a be going through fashion of eating breakfast in order to break absolute silence of room muttered something about weather then grandfather with same object answered after word be spoken till sir peregrine rising from chair declared that be ready got up opened door for guest then hurrying across hall opened library door for also holding till have passed in then took left hand in passing right arm round waist asked if anything disturbed oh yes said yes there be much that disturbs have done very wrong how done wrong mary must not recollect that have called mary before sound thought be very sweet be very sweet although be over forty over seventy year of age have done very wrong have now come here may undo dear sir peregrine must not be angry with think that will be angry with what be dearest did not know how to find word to declare purpose be comparatively easy task to tell mr orme that have made up mind not to marry sir peregrine be by mean easy to tell baronet now stood there leaning over fireplace with arm round waist a behoved to stand no longer seeing resolution to have come still did not speak well mary what be know there be something on mind must not have summoned in here be about trial have seen mr furnival again no be not about trial said avoiding other question what be then sir peregrine be impossible that must be married thus brought forth tidings a be at gasp speaking at moment with voice be almost indicative of anger why not said releasing from arm looking at can not be said why not lady mason can not be said again speaking with more emphasis with stronger tone be that that intend to tell have done anything have offended offended think must be possible offence be on other side then dear listen to now can not be know that be wrong everything tell that marriage on part must be sacrifice terrible sacrifice must be throwing away great rank shouted sir peregrine not though married kitchen maid instead of lady who in social life be equal ah must not have said rank can not lose that station in world respect of around who have be telling have wanted one to tell thinking of have told own heart be full of gratitude love for have told have not seen lord alston lord alston oh have peregrine be speaking to peregrine yes peregrine grandson have spoken to telling to say to then be ungrateful boy very ungrateful boy must have done anything to guard from wrong in matter ah now see evil have done why did ever come into house to make quarrel between there will be quarrel will forgive even that if will be guided by dearest mary must be guided by now matter have gone too far for to go back unless indeed will say that personally have aversion to marriage oh be not that said eagerly must not help saying with eagerness must not inflict wound on feeling silence must then have given under circumstance have right to say that marriage must go on say must sit down mary did sit down while stood leaning over thus spoke speak of sacrificing be old man with not many more year before if did sacrifice what little be left to of life with object of befriending one whom really love there must be no more in than what man might do still feel that balance be on right side here there will be sacrifice life will be happier so will edith so indeed will boy if did know for world talk will last month two care nothing will confess that if be prompted to only by own inclination only by love for a spoke held out hand to must not refuse hers in such case must doubt hesitate probably keep aloof from such step be not so in doing will gratify own heart also serve in great trouble believe have thought of know have sir peregrine therefore can not be therefore will be world know now be to be separated after what have past world must say that have thought guilty of crime must bear now stood before not looking in face with face turned down towards ground speaking hardly above breath by heaven not whilst can stand by side not whilst have strength left to support thrust lie down throat of such wretch a joseph mason mary go back to edith tell that have tried that there be escape for then smiled at smile at time must be very pleasant did not smile a answered sir peregrine said endeavoured to raise face to failed well love sir peregrine be guilty guilty guilty of what said startled rather than instructed by word guilty of with charge then threw at foot wound arm round knee illustration guilty chapter xlv showing how mr orme must be very weak minded venture to think may almost say to hope that lady mason confession at end of last chapter will not have taken anybody by surprise if such surprise be felt must have told tale badly like such revulsion of feeling with regard to character a surprise of nature must generate that lady mason have committed terrible deed for be about to be tried that mr furnival suspicion of guilt be only too well founded that mr dockwrath with wicked ingenuity have discovered no more than truth will in open revelation have caused surprise to reader did cause terrible surprise to sir peregrine orme now must go back little endeavour to explain how be that lady mason have made avowal of guilt that have not intended to do so when entered sir peregrine library be very certain have such be purpose must not have asked mr orme to visit at orley farm have course of event be in mind must not have spoken of departure from cleeve a doubtful have intended still to keep terrible secret to herself still to have leaned upon sir peregrine arm a on arm of trusting friend have overcome by generosity in fixed resolve that must not be dragged down into abyss of misery sudden determination to tell truth at least to have come upon did tell then a soon a word be out of mouth strength have enabled to do so deserted her fell at foot overcome by weakness of body a well a spirit word spoke did not at first convey to mind full meaning though have twice repeated assertion that be guilty fact of guilt did not come home to understanding a thing that must credit there be something doubted not to surprise harass something when revealed made clear might might not affect purpose of marrying something behoved woman to tell before must honestly become wife something be destined to give heart blow be very far a yet from understanding whole truth let think of love best ask how much must take to convince of guilt in such matter that thrusting of lie down throat of joseph mason have become to so earnest duty that task of believing lie to be on other side be easy one blow have to suffer be cruel blow lady mason however be merciful for might have enhanced cruelty tenfold stood there wondering bewildered for minute of time while with face hidden still clung round knee what be at last said understand have answer to make to great resolve have be quickly made quickly carried out now reaction left powerless stooped down to raise when moved fell prone upon ground must hear sob a though bosom must burst with then by degree meaning of word began to break upon be guilty of with charge must that be possible must be that have forged will that with base premeditated contrivance have stolen that property stolen kept from day to through long year then thought of pure life of womanly dignified repose of devotion to son such devotion indeed of sweet pale face soft voice thought of of own love friendship for of edith love for thought of must not believe that be guilty there be other fault much lesser fault than with charged there lay at foot be necessary that must do something towards lifting to seat stooped took by hand feeble strength be not sufficient to raise lady mason said speak to understand will not let seat on sofa at least have realised full force of revelation have made lay there covered with shame broken hearted unable to raise eye from ground with what inward struggle have played part during last few month one might ever know struggle have be kept to herself world world world for have cared in have lived have treated with honour respect have looked upon a ill used innocent woman now must be over one now must know what be then a lay there that thought came to must one know be there no longer hope for must lucius be told must bear rest if only might be ignorant of mother disgrace for whom have be done one must know if beneficent spirit see pity must take moment from world when sir peregrine asked whether must seat on sofa slowly picked up with head still crouching towards ground placed where before have be sitting have be afraid that must have fainted be not one of woman whose nature easily admits of such relief a though be always pale in colour frail looking there be within great power of self sustenance be woman who with good cause might have dared anything with worst cause that woman must well have have dared endured very much did not faint gasp a though be choking become hysteric in agony lay there huddled up in corner of sofa with face hidden feminine grace forgotten have long stood in truth so royally inner true living woman be there at last that nothing else be to do went against heart to harass at moment then be essential that must know truth truth suspicion of truth be now breaking upon if suspicion must be confirmed what be to do be at rate necessary that everything must be put beyond doubt lady mason said if be able to speak to yes said gradually straightening raising head though did not look at yes be able there be something terrible in sound of voice be such sound of agony that felt unable to persist if wish will leave come back say in hour leave whole body be shaken with tremour a though of ague fit go away will tell everything did did what forged will did be guilty there be whole truth now declared openly in most simple word there be longer possibility that must doubt be very terrible terrible tragedy to at present moment part most frightful be present position what must do for how must counsel in what way so act that might best assist without compromising high sense of right wrong in be second nature felt at moment that must still give last shilling to rescue only that there be property let heaven fall justice must be done there even wretch such a joseph mason must have be clearly own a spoke last word have risen from sofa be now standing before resting with hand upon table like prisoner in dock what said with own hand yes with own hand when must not do justice to baby when talked of other being head of house did with own hand during night wrote name yes wrote then there be again silence in room still stood leaning on table waiting for to speak doom turned away from spot in have confronted walked to window what be to do how be to help how be to be rid of how be to save daughter from further contact with woman such a how be to bid daughter behave to woman a one woman must behave to in misery then too have learned to love have yearned to call own though in truth be minor sorrow be one at moment added bitterness to others there stood still waiting doom be necessary that doom must be spoken by if can really be true be true think that woman must falsely tell such tale a against then fear that must be over between there be relief to sort of relief in word doom a so far spoken be so much matter of course that conveyed penalty story have be told in order that result might be attained with certainty there be almost tone of scorn in voice a said oh yes must be over what next must have do asked have nothing to request said if must tell to world do so tell will not be business to be informer must tell there be mr orme yes to edith must leave house oh where will go when know where will go wretched miserable woman yet so worthy of pity what terrible retribution for night work be now coming on again walked to window to think how might answer question must tell daughter must banish criminal at once from house one now have be told of intended marriage one have be told through lord alston mr furnival such a that at rate must now be untold must be possible that must remain there living with at cleeve while be being done in truth did not know how to speak have not hardness of heart to pronounce doom of course will leave house said with something almost of pride in voice if there be place open to gaol will do perhaps have better go now get thing removed at once say word of love for to word of respectful love moved a though be going to door must not permit to leave thus must not let poor crushed broken creature wander forth in agony to bruise at turn to be alone in despair be still woman whom have loved over beyond be not woman who have saved from terrible downfall by rushing into utter ruin for sake must take step in behalf if must only resolve what step must be be moving to door stopping took by hand did said husband knew nothing of fact be so wonderful that have hardly a yet made even that own did knew nothing of will go now sir peregrine be strong enough where will go ah where will go put hand be at liberty up to temple brushing back hair a though might thus collect thought where will go doe not know yet will go now to orley farm when must be told tell that when must know lady mason can not go there to day be very hard to say what have better do very hard echoed shaking head must remain here at present at cleeve mean at rate for to day will think about will endeavour to think what may be best can not meet now mr orme then again be silent for in truth difficulty be too many for might not be best that must counterfeit illness be confined to own room then be averse to recommend counterfeit if mr orme did not go to in assumed illness counterfeit must utterly fail of effect in household then must tell mr orme weight of tidings must be too much for if did not share with one so made up mind that must tell to though to other one must tell said oh yes replied felt hand tremble in dropped have forgotten that thus held a thought pressed upon brain will tell to to one else if might advise must say that will be well for now to take rest be agitated agitated yes be right sir peregrine will go at once to room then then perhaps in course of morning will see again where will come to there will see in room in dressing room will be down stair know from last word tidings be conveyed to lady mason that be not to see mr orme again then went a slowly made way across hall felt that of evil of punishment that have ever anticipated have now fallen upon there be period in life of of trust of few when with silent inner voice of suffering call on mountain to fall crush on earth to gape open take in when with agony of intensity wish that mother have be barren in moment poorest most desolate be object to of envy for suffering can be a nothing to own lady mason a crept silently across hall saw servant girl pas down towards entrance to kitchen must have given that have in world to have changed place with girl change be possible for neither must mountain crush must earth take in there be burden must bear to end there be bed have made for herself must lie upon escape be possible to have mixed cup must now drink of to dreg slowly very silently made way up to own room having closed door behind sat down upon bed be a yet early in morning servant have not be in chamber there be fire there although be still mid winter of such detail a sir peregrine have remembered nothing when recommended to go to own room did think of at first a placed on bed side soon bitter air pierced through through shivered with cold a sat there after while got shawl wrapped close around then sat down again bethought that might have to remain in way for hour so rose again locked door must add greatly to immediate misery if servant be to come while be there see in wretchedness presently girl did come being unable to obtain entrance be told by lady mason that wanted chamber for present whereupon offered to light fire declared that be not cold teeth be shaking in head suffering be better than suffering of being seen illustration lady mason after confession did not lie down cover further than be covered with shawl did move from place for more than hour by degree became used to cold be numbed a be half dead in limb have ceased to shake a sat there mind have gone back to misery of position there be so much for behind be worse what must do when even retirement must not be allowed to instead of longing for time when must be summoned to meet sir peregrine dreaded coming must bring nearer to other meeting when must have to bow head crouch before son have be there above hour be in truth ill with cold when heard scarcely heard light step come quickly along passage towards door woman ear instantly told who owned that step heart once more rose with hope be coming there to comfort to speak to poor bruised sinner one word of feminine sympathy quick light step stopped at door there be pause then low low knock be heard lady mason asked question dropping from bed hurried to door turned key turned key a door be opened half hid behind then mr orme be in room what have fire said feeling that air struck with sudden chill oh be dreadful poor poor dear then took hold of lady mason hand have possessed wisdom of serpent a well a innocence of dove must not have be wiser in first mode of addressing sufferer for knew during dreadful hour sir peregrine have told whole story very dreadful that hour have be to when attempted to give counsel in matter have utterly failed have not known what to suggest must say what might be wisest for to do on one point mind have be at once resolved woman who have once be friend whom have learned to love must not leave house without sympathy womanly care guilt be very bad yes be terrible acknowledged that be thing to be thought of only with shuddering guilt of twenty year ago did not strike sens so vividly a abject misery of present day there be pity in bosom for mr joseph mason when heard story be full of pity for who have committed crime be twenty year ago have not sinner repented besides be to be judge judge not ye will not be judged said when thought that sir peregrine spoke somewhat harshly in matter so said altogether misinterpreting scripture in desire to say something in favour of poor woman when be hinted to that lady mason might return to orley farm without being again seen by woman heart at once rebelled if have done wrong said mr orme have done great wrong fearful wrong said sir peregrine will not hurt to see because have done wrong not see while be in house if be in prison must not go to see then sir peregrine have said no more loved daughter in law better for unwonted vehemence will do what be right said a always do then left after standing for few moment while shaped thought went straight away to lady mason room took lady mason by hand found that be icy cold oh be dreadful said come with dear lady mason still stood up by bed head whither have retreated from door eye be still cast upon ground leaned back a mr orme held a though by weight must hinder friend from leading from room be frightfully cold said mr orme have told said lady mason asking question in lowest possible whisper still holding back a spoke yes have told one else one else then for few moment nothing be spoken between oh must die said poor wretch expressing in word terrible wish that mountain might fall upon crush must not say that must be wicked know can comfort do not know that will comfort if be sorry for sin go to woman in intense suffering must not acknowledge to herself idea of comfort ah exclaimed with deep bursting sob went straight to mr orme heart then convulsive fit of trembling seized so strongly that mr orme must hardly continue to hold hand be ill with cold said come with lady mason will not stay here longer lady mason then permitted to be led out of room two went quickly down passage to head of front stair from thence to mr room in crossing house have seen one be seen by one lady mason when came to door hurried in might again hide in security for moment a soon a door be closed mr orme placed in arm chair wheeled up to front of fire seating on stool at poor sinner foot chafed hand within own took away shawl made stretch out foot towards fire thus seated close to spoke word for next half hour a to terrible fact have become known to then on sudden a though ice of heart have thawed from warmth of other kindness lady mason burst into flood of tear flinging upon friend neck bosom begged with earnest piteousness to be forgiven mr orme did forgive many will think that be wrong to do so fear must be acknowledged that be not strong minded by forgiving mean that pronounced absolution for sin of past year that endeavoured to make sinner think that be worse for sin mr orme be good churchwoman not strong individually in point of doctrine that left mainly to woman conscience own dealing with saviour merely saying word of salutary counsel a to certain spiritual pastor who might be of aid mr orme forgave a regarded herself have already while be unknown taken woman to heart a pure good now appeared that woman have not be pure have not be good then took to heart again criminal a woman be disgraced debased subject almost to heaviest penalty of outraged law justice felon against whom actual hand of law myrmidon must probably soon prevail creature doomed to bear scorn of lowest of fellow creature such a be other woman pure high so shielded from world impurity that nothing ignoble might touch lady took to heart again promised in ear with low sweet word of consolation that must still be friend can not say that mr orme be right that be weak minded feel nearly certain perhaps weakness of mind may never be brought against to injury in world in next will not pretend to give word passed between at interview after while lady mason allowed to be guided in by friend advice a though have be child be decided that for present be for next day two lady mason must keep room at cleeve a invalid counterfeit in there must be none certainly for indeed be hardly fit for place own bed if inclined able to leave room must be made welcome to use of mr orme dressing room must only be necessary to warn peregrine that for present must abstain from coming there servant mr orme said have heard of master intended marriage must now hear that intention have be abandoned on must put own construction must account in own fashion for fact that sir peregrine guest no longer saw other suspicion of truth must get abroad when be seen that lady mason be still treated a guest at cleeve a to such future step a might be necessary to be taken mr orme must consult with sir peregrine tell lady mason from time to time a for sad truth terrible truth at rate for present must be told to other ear so whole morning be spent mr orme saw sir peregrine son till went down to library in first gloom of winter evening chapter xlvi woman idea of friendship sir peregrine after hour that have spent with daughter in law that terrible hour during lady mason have sat alone on bed side returned to library remained there during whole of afternoon may be remembered that have agreed to ride through wood with grandson that purpose have be abandoned early in day peregrine have in consequence be hanging about house soon perceived that something be amiss did not know what have looked for mother have indeed seen for moment at door have told that must not then speak to sir peregrine also have shut up about hour of dusk sent for grandson when mr orme on leaving lady mason went down to library found together be standing with back to fire gloom in room be too dark to allow of face being seen felt that conversation between be of serious nature indeed what conversation in house must be other than serious on day see that be disturbing said preparing to retreat did not know that be together go edith said old man peregrine put chair for mother have told that be over now between lady mason trembled a heard word for seemed to that there must be danger now in even speaking of lady mason danger with reference to dreadful secret divulging of must be so fatal have told continued sir peregrine that for few minute be angry with when heard from lady mason that have spoken to believe that on whole be better that must have be so must be very unhappy if anything that have done have distressed said mr orme hardly knowing what word to use how to speak did feel quite certain a yet how much have be told to son how much be concealed from said old man laying arm affectionately on young man shoulder have done nothing to distress there be nothing wrong nothing wrong between thank god for perry will think now of other matter have told mother anything about strove to look away from wretchedness of morning work to something in family still admitted of bright hope sir not yet wo mind just now then remained silent mr orme sitting two men still standing with back towards fire mind be too intent on unfortunate lady up stair to admit of feeling interest in other unknown matter to sir peregrine have alluded if have done with perry said at last must be glad to speak to for minute two oh yes said peregrine have done then went have told said a soon a be left together told what of oh have told that idea of mine have be abandoned from time forth sir peregrine must never endure to speak of proposed marriage to hear spoken of conceives that have be done at instance continued so have said mr orme with much more of decision in voice than be customary with so have repeated after nobody must know of said very solemnly standing up looking into face with eager eye nobody world fear will know soon said sir peregrine why must world know have not told must not have known must not have suspected mr furnival who understands thing doe not think guilty edith property let give that up after while when have passed by man be not in want will not hurt to be without little longer will be enough for to do when trial will be over be not hers can not give up belongs to son be thought to belong to be not for to be informer edith be not for to be informer must remember that certainly be not for to tell story of guilt guilt will remain same will be acted over over again day while proceeds of property go into hand of lucius mason be that be so terrible edith that conscience must have be able to bear load for last twenty year deed done that admits of restitution may admit of repentance may leave to sinner conscience hoping that stand right with maker here with there have be continual theft going on from year to year be still going on while lucius mason hold sod of orley farm true repentance with must be impossible seems so to sir peregrine shuddered at doom own rectitude of mind purpose forced to pronounce be not have said mr orme be not done for herself there be difference in said sharply sin be selfish so be sin in object be aggrandisement of own child when must not accomplish honestly did by fraud edith dear must look at thing a be must not let kind heart make eye blind in matter of such moment father must truth make heart cruel talk of restitution repentance repentance be not work of day how be to say by what struggle poor heart have be torn judge be may not judge may may assist in wretchedness have promised will do can to aid will allow to do so will will not pressed arm looked up into face entreating since first two have known other have never yet denied request be law of life that must never do so now hesitated not thinking that must refuse feeling that on occasion must be necessary to point out to how far might go without risk of bringing censure on own name in case though mind of sir peregrine might be more logical purpose of daughter in law be stronger have resolved that such communication with crime must not stain already knew to what length must go in charity indeed mind be fully resolved to go far enough hardly know a yet what intends to do assistance that can give must must say depend on own line of conduct want advice a to tell what purpose be clear that mr furnival think will gain day at trial mr furnival doe not know truth will judge lawyer rest a say so properly be not for to be informer if can prove let must not have tell against then paused waiting for answer know know what to say be not for to advise ah be for said a spoke put little hand down on table with energy startled be here wretched woman in house why do know truth why have be told to because without telling must not turn from that purpose of yours be generous father confess that be very generous yes be generous said sir peregrine be very generous must be base in if allowed to forget be telling plan must go to trial oh yes there will be no doubt a to then if can escape let property be given up afterwards see how be to be arranged property will belong to lucius can not give up then be not so easy to put matter right when guilt fraud have set wrong will do best can even suppose that be to tell lucius afterwards if be necessary know so by degree talked over yet must come to decision a to what step must take what if must go to mr round pledge that whole estate must be restored to mr mason of groby on condition that trial be abandoned world must probably guess truth after terrible trial more terrible punishment must follow might be thus escaped poor sir peregrine even when argued thus within conscience told that in taking such line of conduct must be guilty of outrage against law by aiding criminal in escape have heard of misprision of felony nevertheless allowed daughter in law to prevail before such step a must be taken consent of lady mason must of course be obtained a to mr orme have doubt if lucius must be induced to abandon property without hearing whole story must be well if must not be achieved then whole story must be told to will tell mr orme said to must be easier for to cut off right arm answered will do best then came question a to place of lady mason immediate residence be evident to mr orme sir peregrine expected that must at once go back to orley farm not exactly on day did say on day following word made very manifest that did not think right that must under existing circumstance remain at cleeve sir peregrine however a quickly understood that mr orme did not wish to go away for day must injure cause if be to leave quite at once said mr orme how can stay here dear with one to see with none servant to wait upon must see said mr orme boldly do mean constantly in old friendly way yes constantly added after pause not only here at orley farm also then there be pause between sir peregrine certainly be not cruel man be heart by mean hardened against lady with whom circumstance have lately joined so closely indeed since knowledge of guilt have fully come upon have undertaken conduct of perilous affair in manner more confidential even than have existed while expected to make wife nevertheless went sorely against grain with when be proposed that there must still exist close intimacy between one cherished lady of household woman who have be guilty of so base crime seemed to that might touch pitch not be defiled man belonging to must not reconcile to that widow of son must run such risk in estimation there be something almost more than human about purity of only woman blessed hearth seemed to a though be sacred thing to be guarded by shrine to be protected from contact with pollution of outer world now be proposed to that must take felon to bosom a friend will be necessary edith said after have be revealed to now will be wise think so said speaking again with very low voice why must not because have shown unworthy of such friendship unfit for must say unworthy dear father be not a worthy a fit a be yesterday if saw clearly into other bosom whom must think worthy must not choose for friend one one who must do deed a must not choose because have so acted perhaps if knew beforehand must open heart to one who have so done be different now what be love friendship worth if can not stand against such trial a do mean edith that crime must separate from friend have not said that there be circumstance always if repents a be sure doe can not bring to desert who else be there that can stand by now what other woman at rate have promised must not have break word thus again gained point be settled that for present lady mason must be allowed to occupy own room own room occasionally mr orme sitting room if pleased to do so day be named for removal mr orme perfectly understood that sooner such day must be fixed better sir peregrine must be pleased indeed household a at present arranged be not pleasant

madeline do so also be of course line thought took then a said to madeline father have be one of handsomest men of day whereas be one of ugliest madeline father have be encumbered with mary snow man who have be fool a who have gone so far out of regular course thinking to be wiser than other men being in truth much more silly must not look for success happiness in life men enjoy who have not be so lamentably deficient in discretion 't be thus that lectured still went on thinking of madeline staveley there have be disagreeable confusion in house afternoon after augustus have spoken to sister madeline have gone up to own room have remained there chewing cud of thought sister brother have warned about man must moreover divine that mother be suffering under anxiety on same subject why be why must thing be said thought why must there be uneasiness in house on account in matter of mr graham acknowledged to herself that there be such uneasiness almost acknowledged to herself cause while be still sitting over own fire with needle untouched beside father have come home lady staveley have mentioned to that mr graham thought of going on next day nonsense dear said judge must not think of thing can hardly be fit to leave room yet pottinger doe say that have gone on very favourably pleaded lady staveley be reason must destroy advantage of healthy constitution by insane imprudence be got nothing to do want to go merely because think be in way lady staveley looked wishfully up in husband face longing to tell suspicion a yet ground for be so slight that even to hesitated to mention being here be trouble to of course said of course not tell so will stay said judge want to see to morrow about business of poor lady mason immediately after that met son augustus also told that graham be going oh be not going at said judge have settled that with mother be very anxious to be off said augustus gravely why be there reason well know for moment thought must tell father whole story reflected that doing so must be hardly fair towards friend know that there be absolute reason be quite sure that be very anxious to go judge at once perceived that there be something in wind during hour in pheasant be being discussed up in graham room succeeded in learning whole from wife dear good loving wife secret of kind from be impossibility to although secret went further than thought darling girl be so anxious about that be afraid said be by mean bad sort of man love said judge be got nothing literally nothing said mother have when went wooing said judge nevertheless managed to have own way mean really to make comparison said lady staveley in first place be at top of profession be if so must have achieved distinction at very early age then kissed wife very affectionately nobody be there to see under such circumstance man may kiss wife even though be judge between fifty sixty year old after that again spoke to son in spite of resolve augustus have made a to what friendship required of succeeded in learning whole truth late in evening when party have drunk cup of tea when lady staveley be beginning nap augustus be making agreeable to miss furnival to great annoyance of mother who half rousing now then looked sorrowfully at what be going on with winking eye judge contrived to withdraw with madeline into small drawing room telling a put arm around waist that have few word to say to well papa said a at bidding sat down beside on sofa be frightened because such summons be very unusual nevertheless father manner towards be always so full of love even in fear felt comfort in being with darling said want to ask one two question about guest here who have hurt mr graham yes papa now knew that be trembling with nervous dread need not think that be in least angry with that suspect of having done said even thought anything be wrong feel quite confident have cause to do so oh thank papa want to know whether mr graham have ever spoken to a lover never papa because under circumstance of present stay here doing so must think have be ungenerous never have papa in way not single word have reason to regard in light papa in speaking of last two word there be slight hesitation least possible shade of doubt conveyed made immediately intelligible to practised ear of judge tell darling everything that there be in heart so that may help other if may be possible have never said anything to papa because mamma think that be more anxious about than must be about ordinary visitor doe have one else spoken to about mr graham augustus did papa isabella time ago then suppose thought same yes suppose did now dear be there anything else must like to say to about papa think there be remember always that only wish respecting mother wish also be to see happy good be very happy papa very good also to best of belief then kissed went back again into large drawing room many of reader especially who be old wise if chance to have such will be inclined to think that judge behaved foolishly in thus cross questioning daughter on matter if be expedient that must die away must die away more easily le be talked about judge be odd man in many of theory of life one of with reference to child be very odd altogether opposed to usual practice of world be that must be allowed a far a be practicable to do what liked now general opinion of world be certainly quite reverse namely child a long a be under control of parent must be hindered prevented in thing to be most inclined of course world in general in carrying out practice excuse by assertion made to others that child customarily like thing ought not to like judge have idea quite opposed to child said if properly trained must like thing be good for now may be that thought daughter have be properly trained be very clever young man dear may be sure of be last word judge said to wife night then have got nothing replied be so uncommonly plain judge must not say word more must not help thinking that last point be one might certainly be left to young lady chapter xlviii angel of light under cloud on following morning according to appointment judge visited felix graham in room be only second occasion on have done so since accident be therefore more inclined to regard a invalid than who have seen from day to day be delighted to hear that bone have be so amenable said judge must not try too far will get down stair into drawing room see how get on there by next few day want to trouble more than can help said felix sheepishly knew that there be reason why must not go into drawing room of course must not guess that reason be a well known to judge a be to sha' trouble more than can help be not one of men who tell friend that nothing be trouble of course give trouble be so sorry there be bed to make dear fellow gruel to warm know shakspeare pretty well by heart believe put that matter a did other matter in best truest point of view lady macbeth did say have labour in receiving king 'the labour delight in physic pain ' said be word now be mine with more honest purpose behind said felix well yes have murder in thought at present so be settled lady staveley will be delighted to see down stair to morrow will be only too happy felix answered thinking within own mind that must settle in course of day with augustus now perhaps will be strong enough to say few word about business certainly said graham have heard of orley farm case in neighbour lady mason be concerned oh yes be talking of at table think be night night two before accident very well then know about at least a much a public know generally have now be decided on part of joseph mason husband eldest son who be endeavouring to get property that will be indicted for perjury for perjury yes in doing that regarding matter from point of view be not deficient in judgment how must have be guilty of perjury in swearing that have be present when husband three witness executed deed if have ground to stand on believe have none if have must much more easily get verdict against on point than on charge of forgery supposing to be fact that husband never executed deed must be manifest that must have sworn falsely in swearing that saw do so why yes one must say so must afford by mean conclusive evidence that have forged surreptitious deed must be strong presumptive evidence that be cognizant of forgery perhaps so uncorroborated must hardly bring verdict after lapse of year then moreover prosecution for forgery if unsuccessful must produce more painful feeling whether successful unsuccessful must do so bail must not be taken in first instance prosecution must create stronger feeling that poor lady be being persecuted who really understand matter will hardly thank for mercy then so few will really understand fact however be that will be indicted for perjury know whether indictment have not be already laid mr furnival be with in town yesterday at very urgent request discussed whole subject with will be on home circuit on next spring assize will not take criminal business at alston indeed must not choose that matter must be tried before under circumstance seeing that lady be near neighbour now furnival want to be engaged on defence a junior counsel with yes with with mr chaffanbrass with mr chaffanbrass said graham in tone almost of horror a though have be asked to league with be most disgraceful in profession a indeed perhaps have be yes with mr chaffanbrass will be well judge do think mr chaffanbrass doubt be very clever man may be wise in such case a to have service of barrister who be perhaps unequalled in power of cross examining witness doe power consist in making witness speak truth in making conceal perhaps in here if be case a mr furnival suspect that witness will be suborned to give false evidence surely round must have nothing to do with matter a probably not be sure that old richard round must abhor such work a must do take evidence a be brought to believe there be doubt that at rate one of witness to codicil in question will now swear that signature to document be not signature woman be yes woman in such case may perhaps be allowable to employ man a mr chaffanbrass must tell also such man a mr solomon aram solomon aram too why judge old bailey will be left bare shining light will certainly be down at alston now under circumstance will undertake case must in place yes if be fully convinced of innocence of client at beginning what if be driven to change opinion a thing progressed must go on in such case a matter of course suppose can have day two to think of oh yes must not myself be bearer to of mr furnival message be not that think that lady mason be being very cruelly used in matter if be young man in position must take up case con amore for sake of beauty womanhood say that quixotism be very wise still think can be wrong to join even with such men a chaffanbrass mr solomon aram if can feel confident that have justice truth on side then after few more word interview be over judge left room making further observation a to hope of seeing graham in drawing room on next day on following morning there came from peckham two more letter for graham one of course from mary snow one from mr thomas will first give attention to from elder lady commenced with much awe declaring that pen trembled within finger that nevertheless felt bound by conscience that duty owed to mr graham to tell everything have occurred word by word a expressed then felix looking at letter saw that held in hand two sheet of letter paper quite full of small writing latter of be crossed went on to say that care have be unremitting solicitude almost maternal that mary conduct have on whole be such a to inspire with undeviating confidence that guile of present age be such especially in respect to female servant who seemed in mr thomas opinion to be sent in day express from very bad place for express assistance of very bad gentleman that be impossible for woman let be ever so circumspect to say what be what who be who from graham learned that mr thomas have be done by middle of third page have a yet learned nothing a to manner of doing by degree long reel unwinded angel of light mary snow have not only received have answered lover letter have answered that lover letter by making appointment with have kept that appointment with assistance of agent sent express from very bad gentleman mr thomas have only discovered afterwards by finding lover letter answer angel of light have written of copied verbatim thinking probably that original document be too precious to be intrusted to post then ended by saying that additional year of celibacy passed under closer espionage with more severe moral training might still perhaps make mary snow fit for high destiny have be promised to only part of letter felix read twice be that contained answer from angel of light to lover have be very wicked to address angel of light said severely be almost impossible must ever forgive if only must have brought to end there nature lover have greatly belied in likening to name be not cold enough for so added few more word very indiscreetly a want to explain to why can never see again will meet on thursday afternoon at past four little way up clapham lane at corner of doctor wall just beyond third lamp be first letter have ever written to lover poor girl have betrayed by keeping copy of then graham came to mary snow letter to a be short reader will have entire dear mr graham never be so unhappy in life be sure know how to write to of course think will ever see again unless be to upbraid for perfidy almost hope wo for must sink into ground before eye yet did mean to do anything very wrong when did meet must a much a let take by hand not of own accord know what have said to think ought to have let read speaks to now in such way know how to bear have rummaged among everything have got be sure must find nothing except two letter be fault that wrote to though know now ought not to have met be quite genteel young man very respectable in medical line only know that make difference now seeing how good have be to ask to forgive nearly kill when think of poor papa yours always most unhappy very sorry for what have done mary snow poor mary snow must man under such circumstance have be angry with in first place if men will mould wife must expect that kind of thing then after be there harm done if ultimately did marry mary snow must make worse wife because have met apothecary assistant at corner of doctor wall under third lamp post graham a sat with letter before made manner of excuse for did more eagerly because felt that must have willingly made affair cause for breaking off engagement if conscience have not told that must be unhandsome in to do so when augustus came must not show letter to have done so must have be a much a to declare now coast be clear a far a be concerned must not now discus with friend question of mary snow without also discussing other question of madeline staveley so swept letter away talked almost entirely about orley farm case only wish be thought good enough for chance said augustus by heaven must work for woman a never must work again for fee must be offered so must like fellow labourer must not mind that suppose said graham there can be possible doubt a to absolute innocence none father have doubt furnival have doubt sir peregrine have doubt who by by be going to marry nonsense oh be though have taken up case con amore with vengeance must be sorry for that make think fool very clever woman so that matter be discussed not word be said between about mary snow a to former conversation respecting madeline staveley felt then there be reserve between felt also that there be way of avoiding governor seems determined that sha' stir yet awhile augustus said a be preparing to take leave will be off in day two at furthest same said graham be to drink tea down stair to night will come fetch a soon a be out of dining room can assure that first appearance after accident have be duly announced to public that be anxiously expected then staveley left so be to meet madeline that evening first feeling at thought be one of joy soon brought almost to wish that must leave noningsby without such meeting there must have be nothing in nothing that need have called for observation remark have not told secret to augustus secret have be told to one might be known to others in house indeed felt sure that be suspected by lady staveley must not a said to have be suspected by judge judge must not have treated in so friendly manner have insisted so urgently on coming down among then how must carry in presence if be to say nothing to saying nothing must be remarked yet felt that power of self control must not enable to speak to in same manner that must speak to sister have to ask moreover what line of conduct did intend to follow if be still resolved to marry mary snow must not be better that must take bull by horn upset at once in such case madeline staveley must be no more to than sister then have two intention in accordance with one must make mary snow wife in following other must marry miss staveley must be admitted that two bride proposed to be very different one that have moulded for own purpose be not a admitted quite equal to of whom nature education birth have have handling again dined alone on occasion mr baker be able to elicit from enthusiasm a to dinner yet have done best placed before sweetbread dish of sea kale ought to

many day since have be out of room very fact of moving be excitement to hardly knew how might feel in walking down stair must not quite separate nervousness arising from shattered bone from that other nervousness came from shattered heart word be undoubtedly little too strong a be there there let stay when reached drawing room almost felt that have better decline to enter door however be opened be in room before must make up mind to such step found being walked across floor to especial seat while dozen kindly anxious face be crowding round here be arm chair mr graham kept expressly for near

who on matter be not so good judge a miss furnival care about just a mr baker doe said graham to who be worst judge of muttered something quite unintelligible in answer to kindness of word then

that marriage project be over knew also that grandfather lady mason did not now meet other knew nothing of cause though must not remark that did not see on day did not come down to dinner during evening be seen on following morning peregrine felt aware that something have occurred at interview in library after breakfast be lost in surmising what that something have be that lady mason must have told grandfather that marriage must be given up must have be only in accordance with promise made by to did not think that alone must have occasioned such utter sadness such deathlike silence in household have there be quarrel lady mason must have gone home did not go home have match be broken off without quarrel why must mysteriously banish to two room so that one mother must see too have own peculiar sorrow on morning sir peregrine have asked to ride through ground have be baronet intention to propose during ride that must go over to noningsby speak to judge about madeline know how proposition have be frustrated now peregrine thinking over matter saw that grandfather be not in position at present moment to engage ardently in such work by mean word have be induced to agree to abandonment of marriage engagement that abandonment weighed very heavily on spirit be plain to see that be broken man broken in heart in spirit shut up alone in library afternoon have hardly word to say when came out to dinner in evening be very pale too slow weak in step tried to smile a came up to daughter in law in drawing room smile be saddest thing of then peregrine must see that ate nothing be very gentle in demeanour to servant very courteous attentive to mr orme very kind to grandson yet mind be heavy brooding over sorrow oppressed on following morning be same grandson knew that must look to grandfather for assistance at noningsby immediately after breakfast peregrine got on horse without speaking to one of intention almost without having formed intention rode off in direction of alston did not take road went out through cleeve wood on to common by have turned to left might have gone to orley farm when on top of rise from crutchley bottom turned to right putting horse into gallop rode along open ground till came to enclosure into leaped from thence made way through farm gate into green country lane along still pressed horse till found divided from end of large wood by one field knew ground well direction in be going must pas through wood then down by old farm house at other end of so on to alston road within mile of noningsby knew ground well for have ridden over field of when man doe so after thirty forgets spot pass in hurry when doe so before twenty never forgets that field that wood peregrine orme must never forget there be double ditch bank over harriet tristram have ridden with so much skill courage there be spot on have knelt so long while felix graham lay back against feeble almost speechless there on other side have sat madeline on horse pale with anxiety yet eager with hope a asked question after question a to who have be hurt peregrine rode up to ditch made horse stand while looked at be there then on spot that have felt first pang of jealousy idea have occurred to that for whom have be doing friend office with such zealous kindness be worst enemy have peregrine broken arm leg even broken neck must have ridden up thoughtless of herself thrown very life into voice a have done when knew that felix graham have fallen from horse then have gone on with work aiding hurt man a zealously a before still feeling that be bound to hate afterwards at noningsby have continued to minister to a to friend zealously doing friend office still feeling that man be enemy not that be insincere there be place for insincerity treachery within heart man have done ill be good fellow be entitled to kindness by social law knew two have gone together from same table to same spot have be close together when one have come to sorrow be duty to act a graham friend yet how must not feel that must hate now sat looking at fence wishing wishing certainly not wishing that graham hurt have be more serious wishing that in falling from horse might utterly have fallen out of favour with sweet young female heart rather wishing must so have expressed that might have have fall broken bone danger so that might also have have interest eye voice have shown then quickly turned horse without giving beast time to steady rammed at fence leap out of wood into field be difficult back into wood be still worse up jump be higher ditch must be first cleared be broader did take at easiest part a have done on day when rode own horse then graham back into wood pressed animal exactly at spot from rival have fallen there be still mark of beast struggle a endeavoured to save before came down head foremost into ditch bank have be somewhat narrowed pared away be clearly last place in face of whole opening into wood rider with sens about must have selected for jump horse knowing master humour knowing also be so vitally important nature of master courage jumped at bank without pausing a have said time have be given to steady not moment to see where foot must go to understand make most of ground that be to use jumped jumped well only half gained top of bank poor brute urged beyond power must not get hind foot up so near surface a to give fulcrum for second spring for moment strove to make good footing still clinging with fore foot then slowly came down backwards into ditch then regained foot dragging with effort from mud made way back into field peregrine orme have kept seat throughout leg be accustomed to saddle knew how to cling to while there be hope that might struggle through now that be again in field wheeled horse to greater distance striking with whip once more pushed at fence gallant beast went at bravely slightly swerving from fatal spot to peregrine have endeavoured once more to guide leaped with full spring from unworn turf barely touching bank landed master lightly within precinct of wood ah h said peregrine shouting angrily at horse a though brute have done badly instead of well then rode down slowly through wood out by monkton grange farm round moat down avenue before long be standing at noningsby gate have not made up mind to plan of action indeed have determined that must ask to see of family even enter place woman at lodge opened gate rode in mechanically asking if of be at home judge mr augustus be gone up to london lady other lady be in house mr graham have not gone woman said in answer to question did know when be going then armed with information peregrine orme rode round to stable gave up horse to groom yes lady staveley be at home servant said at door must mr orme walk into drawing room where must find young lady mr orme must not do must go into small book room with be well acquainted have name taken up to lady staveley did not said mean to stay very long particularly wished to see lady staveley in few minute lady staveley came to radiant with sweetest smile with hand held out to greet dear mr orme said be delighted to see what made run away from so suddenly have considered word in moment a came across hall have thought that in way might best enable to speak lady staveley said have come here on purpose to tell have daughter told anything who madeline yes madeline mean miss staveley have said anything to about well yes have will not sit down mr orme then will be more comfortable hitherto have stood up have blurted out word with sudden determined almost ferocious air a though be going to demand girl hand challenge household if be refused lady staveley understood manner nature liked almost better for abruptness have spoken to mr orme have told of what passed between on last day that be with yet be surprised that must have gone wonder at lady staveley must have known well perhaps did know sit down mr orme wo let get up in restless way if be to talk together tell frankly what be think that can do for suppose can do anything thought must come over speak to suppose have chance have seated far back on sofa be holding hat between knee with eye fixed on ground a spoke last word looked round into face with anxious inquiring glance went direct to heart what can say mr orme ah of course nothing good bye lady staveley might a well go know be fool for coming here knew a be coming indeed hardly meant to come in when found at gate must not go from like must though do think must go in see if did must make such fool of myself must never again hold up head be fool ought to have known that fellow like must have chance with must knock own head off if only knew how for having made as of one here think so of mr orme one here think what that be unreasonable in to propose to madeline know that did much honour psha said turning away from ah must listen to be what think madeline father one who know must think otherwise like know how good excellent be a to worldly station of course stand above psha said again angrily how must one presume to talk of worldly station of goddess for just then madeline staveley to be goddess be what think indeed mr orme a for myself have girl come to telling that have proposed to telling also that that felt that might probably like must have be very happy to hear lady staveley a spoke put out hand to what did say asked peregrine altogether disregarding hand ah did not say that told that have declined honour that have offered that did not regard a must regard man to whom must pledge heart did say that must never love now a asked question stood up again looking down with eye into lady staveley face that face must have be so friendly to so kind so encouraging have be possible never be long word mr orme ah did say come lady staveley know have be fool be not cowardly fool if be so if have hope tell at once may go away in case will be better anywhere out of county can not say that must have hope think then that there be chance for moment looked a though trouble be nearly over if be so impetuous mr orme can not speak to if will sit down for minute two will tell exactly what think about then sat down trying to look a though be not impetuous must be deceiving if be not to tell that speaks of matter a though be all over a though answer to be final one ah knew be so then mr orme many young lady who have be at first moment quite a sure of decision have married gentleman whom refused have learned to love with heart be like other girl said peregrine believe be great deal better than many nevertheless may be like others in respect say that will be so mr orme must not on account give hope believed to be false if be anxious in matter be a anxious about a be about soul oh fie mr orme must not speak in way if be anxious must advise to wait see become wife of one else listen to mr orme madeline be very young so indeed be too almost too young to marry a yet even if girl be willing that must be so like very much a be so very young think that might wait with patience say for year then come to noningsby again try fortune once more be advice will tell one thing lady staveley what be mr orme doe care for one else lady staveley be prepared to do anything must for young friend except to answer question did believe that madeline cared for somebody else cared very much did not think that way must be opened by that caring must be made manifest thought also that if wholly ungratified by word of intercourse that feeling must die away must have told everything to peregrine orme must have explained to that best chance lay in liking for felix graham rather that a rejection have be caused by liking chance must be good again when that liking must have perished from starvation lady staveley must not explain to must have be satisfactory to feeling have be in power to do so still there remained question doe care for one else mr orme said will do for that mother can do ought to do must not admit that have right to ask question a if be to answer now must feel justified in asking again when perhaps might not be so easy to answer beg pardon lady staveley peregrine blushed up to eye did not intend beg pardon seeing that have given offence a said just now that mother can ought to do will do for be very frank tell must be rejoiced to have for son in law be sure be very much obliged to by by father will constraint ever be put on inclination of child at rate a to whom will not accept will always be allowed to judge for have told that to must be acceptable a suitor after think will be best to leave matter for present without further word let be understood that will spend next christmas at noningsby then will be older perhaps know own mind better be year know year be not so very long at time of life by latter remark lady staveley did not show knowledge of human nature suppose have better go now said peregrine sheepishly if like to go into drawing room be sure will be very glad to see peregrine declared that must not do on account know lady staveley what fool must make myself must be over with then must be more moderate in feeling mr orme be very well saying that must be moderate if noningsby be on fire if thought judge be going to die good gracious mr orme be same sort of thing to can tell man ca be moderate when feel that must like to break own neck declare almost tried to do to day oh mr orme well did suppose say that a sort of threat be safe enough to live for next sixty year be only happy people be good in world die good bye lady staveley will come back next christmas be if be settled before then know will be no good then got on horse rode very slowly home along high road to cleeve lady staveley did not go in among other lady till luncheon be announced when did so said word about visitor nevertheless be known by peregrine orme have be there ah that be mr orme roan coloured horse sophia furnival have said getting up thrusting face close to drawing room window be barely possible to see portion of road from drawing room sophia eye have be sharp enough to see portion groom have probably come over with note said mr arbuthnot very likely said sophia knew from voice that rider be groom that did not intend to be thought that be groom madeline said not word kept countenance marvellously knew well enough that peregrine have be with mother guessed also why have be there madeline have asked serious question have answered also since conversation have have with father have assured that desired only happiness though in so saying have spoken nothing of marriage have well understood that have referred to future happiness at time when by own choice must be leaving father house now asked boldly in what way might happiness be best secured hitherto have refrained from such home question latterly within last week two idea of what love meant have forced upon mind how must have be otherwise have never dared to tell that did love that did not mr orme have come to with offer plainly asking for gift of heart have immediately be aware that such gift on part be impossible such gift in favour have known without moment thought that there be room for hesitation have asked to take wing fly away with over wood feat must not have be to more impossible than of loving a wife yet liked liked much in latter day because have be so good to felix graham when felt that liked a refused felt also that be for reason that liked on day of graham accident have thought nothing of have hardly spoken to now loved with sort of love because have be so good to graham though in heart knew asked question till father have spoken to of future happiness then a wandered about house alone for still went on wandering did ask question two be have changed thus made gay quick step so slow what have altered happy silver tone of voice what have created that load within seemed to weigh down during hour of day knew that there have be change that be not a have be now asked question not on first asking on second did answer come not perhaps on twentieth answer did come at last told that heart be no longer own knew acknowledged to herself that felix graham be master owner then came second question under circumstance what have better do mother have told word have fallen deep into ear that must be great misfortune if loved man before have reason to know that man loved have such knowledge a regarded felix graham suspicion that might be so did feel suspicion must grow into hope let struggle against a might baker that injudicious baker have dropped in hearing word two assisted suspicion then open frank question put to by father when demanded whether graham have addressed a lover have tended towards same result what have better do of one thing now felt perfectly certain let world go a might in other respect must never leave father house a bride unless bridegroom be felix graham marriage with might probably be impracticable other marriage must be absolutely impossible if father mother told not to think of felix graham a matter of course must obey not even in obedience to father mother must say that loved one else now matter having be considered what must do father have invited to tell everything to be possessed by feeling that in matter might possibly find more indulgence with father than with mother yet be more natural that mother must be confidante adviser must speak to mother also with better courage even though felt le certain of sympathy peregrine orme have now be there again have be closeted with lady staveley on ground must speak having so resolved lost time in carrying out purpose mamma mr orme be here to day be not yes love lady staveley be sorry rather than otherwise that daughter have asked must have be puzzled to explain why such must have be case thought so said madeline rode over told among other thing that match between grandfather lady mason be at end be very glad to hear for thought sir peregrine be going to do very foolish thing then there be few further remark on subject made probably by lady staveley with undefined intention of inducing daughter to think that peregrine orme have come over chiefly on matter mamma well love did say anything about about what be speaking to about well madeline did did say something on subject have not intended to tell unless have asked hope mamma understands that what want can never happen be if doe want now doe want certainly dear then hope told that can never be hope did mamma why must be so certain about love doe not intend to trouble with suit do why not leave to time there can be reason why must not see again on friendly footing when embarrassment between will have passed away there must be reason mamma if be quite sure that there must never be other footing never be very long word illustration never be very long word be only true word mamma must be wrong in must indeed if be to tell to come again like mr orme very much a friend must be very glad to know be if chose to know madeline a made little proviso be thinking what own worldly position might be a wife of felix graham a be quite impossible that must ever be anything else to other must not be asked to come here with other intention madeline see that be so impossible mamma be impossible quite impossible to assertion lady staveley made answer in word there be that in countenance made daughter understand that did not quite agree in assertion understand impossibility mamma be quite quite impossible madeline repeated why so said lady staveley frightened by daughter manner almost fearing that something further be to come have by far better be left unsaid because mamma have love to give oh mamma be angry with push away know who be that love knew before then threw on knee hid face on mother lap lady staveley have known up to moment have hoped that knowledge might have remained hidden a though be unknown chapter li mr furnival journey to hamworth when peregrine got back to cleeve learned that there be lady with mother have by time partially succeeded in reasoning out of despondency have learned at rate that proposition to marry into staveley family have be regarded with favour by family except one whose view on subject be by far most important to have learned a thought that lady staveley have suspicion that daughter heart be preoccupied in respect lady staveley have be too cunning for wait said to a went slowly along road be very well to say wait there be thing wo bear waiting for man who wait never get well away with hound nevertheless a rode into courtyard hope be somewhat higher than have be when rode out of lady what lady mean lady mason servant did not mean lady mason be elderly stout lady who have come in fly elderly stout lady be now in drawing room with mother lady mason be still up stair know who be that elderly stout lady must now go back say few word a to journey from orange street to hamworth on preceding evening mr furnival have told martha biggs what be intention perhaps must be more just to say that martha biggs have worked out of now that mr furnival have left fashionable neighbourhood of cavendish square located in eastern homely district to miss biggs have be so long accustomed miss biggs have be almost tyrannical be not that be le attentive to friend le willing to slave for with view to possible impossible result friend of mr furnival bosom must not help feeling opportunity mr furnival have now thrown very much upon friend of course friend now expected unlimited privilege a be always case with friend in position be very well to have friend to lean upon be not always well to lean upon one friend will be with before start in morning said martha will not be at necessary said mr furnival oh will indeed kitty must think nothing of going with if must wish indeed think must have female friend alongside of in trouble have only to say word will go in minute mr furnival however did not say word miss biggs be obliged to deny pleasure of journey true to word came in morning in ample time to catch mr furnival before started for hour poured out sweet counsel into friend ear if one friend must a rule refrain from action how much more strongly must real friendship flourish in world now kitty do trust will persist in seeing be why be going there yes might put off if be not firm of course will deny if send in name first what must do must be to ask to be shown in to then follow servant when happiness of life be at stake happiness of two life may say perhaps immortal welfare of one of in world one must not stand too much upon etiquette must never forgive if did object be to save to shame out of vile conduct to shame frighten out of if be possible follow servant in give moment to think advice in answer to mr furnival did not say much what little did say be in affirmative in negative martha knew that be being ill treated not on account did relax friendly effort time must soon come if thing went well when mr furnival must be driven by loneliness of position to open heart in truly loving confidential manner miss biggs hoped sincerely that friend friend husband might be brought together again perhaps by own effort did not anticipate perhaps desire speedy termination of present arrangement must be well that mr furnival must be punished by separation of month then when have learned to know what be to have home without presiding genius might if duly penitent open in confession be forgiven be miss biggs programme thought probable that mr furnival might want good deal of consolation before day of open confession arrived will go with a far a station kitty said in very decided voice will not be at necessary mr furnival replied oh will must want support at moment a a far a can give will have wo be support to have in cab with if will believe have rather go alone be so necessary must think about martha must not believe a for thinking be quite ready to take part of work say word said a thrust in at cab door after friend mr furnival hardly did say word martha biggs said many knew that mr furnival be cross ill pleased not disposed to confidence what of duty a friend be not altered by mr furnival ill humour must persevere having in hand so great opportunity did not despair what time might come when mr mr furnival must with united voice hail a preserver poor martha biggs did not mean amiss be troublesome be very necessary that mr furnival must think over step be taking what be that intended to do when arrived at hamworth plan of forcing way into lady mason house did not recommend to more in that be recommended by martha biggs suppose will come up to evening martha said when left friend in railway carriage not evening think will be so tired mr furnival have replied then will come down to said almost holloaing after friend a train started mr furnival must not have be displeased have known state of wife mind at moment towards late visitor during whole of journey down to hamworth tried to think what must say to lady mason instead of so thinking mind must revert to unpleasantness of miss biggs friendship when left train at hamworth station be solicited by driver of public vehicle to use fly having ascertained from man that well knew position of orley farm got into carriage have driven to residence of hated rival have often heard of orley farm have never a yet seen now felt considerable anxiety a regard house occupant be orley farm ma'be said man stopping at gate will drive up at moment gate be opened by decent respectable woman mr furnival must not quite have called lady who looked hard at fly a turned on to private road perhaps lady must tell said mr furnival putting out hand be where lady mason life woman be mr dockwrath on day samuel dockwrath have gone to london before starting have made known to wife with fiendish glee that have be at last decided by person concerned that lady mason must be charged with perjury tried for offence mean to say that judge have said so asked poor miriam do mean to say that judge in england must not save from having to stand trial be belief that lawyer in land can not save from conviction wonder whether ever think now of field took away from then when master back be turned put on bonnet walked up to orley farm knew well that lady mason be at cleeve believed that be about to become wife of sir peregrine knew also that lucius be at home might be well to let know what be going on have just seen lucius mason when be met by mr furnival fly have seen lucius mason angry manner in declared that must in way interfere in mother affair have frightened mr lucius have said ought to be doing something know there be believing how bitter samuel be about may be a bitter a like mr dockwrath young mason have answered with considerable dignity in manner will not in least affect mother interest in present instance however be not adviser whereupon mr dockwrath have retired a be afraid to go to lady mason at cleeve be about to return home when opened gate for mr furnival then explained that lady mason be not at home have not be at home for week that be staying with friend at cleeve that in order to get there mr furnival must go back through hamworth round by high road know way well enough mr dockwrath said driver have be at cleeve before now guess so mr furnival be driven back to hamworth on going over piece of ground resolved that must follow lady mason to cleeve why must be afraid of sir peregrine orme of ormes why must fear one while engaged in performance of so sacred duty must confess that in truth be very much afraid nevertheless have taken on to cleeve when arrived at door asked of course for lady mason did not feel at inclined to follow servant uninvited into house a recommended by miss biggs lady mason man said be not very well after certain amount of parley at door matter ended in being shown into drawing room where be soon joined by mr orme be mr furnival began then mr orme begged to sit down have come here to see lady mason on business business not of very pleasant nature be sure know how to trouble with yet then even mr orme must see that visitor be somewhat confused be about trial asked mr orme then there be really lawsuit going on lawsuit said mr orme rather puzzled said something about trial now mr orme pray deceive be very unhappy woman be indeed deceive why must deceive indeed why must now look at think will indeed will not mr furnival there be really lawsuit then mr furnival persisted in asking thought must know about said mr orme a mr furnival manages lady mason law business thought that perhaps be about that that have come then mr furnival explained that knew nothing whatever about lady mason affair that hitherto have not believed that there be trial lawsuit gradually explained cause of trouble did not do without sundry interruption caused by own feeling by mr orme exclamation at last came forth before have done be calling husband tom appealing to listener for sympathy indeed be mistake mr furnival be indeed there be reason make quite sure of so spoke mr orme how must lady mason have be in love with mr furnival if such state of thing must be possible under circumstance seeing that have be engaged to marry sir peregrine mr orme did not declare reason repeated with very positive assurance knowledge that mr furnival be labouring under very grievous error why must always be at chamber have seen there twice mr orme have indeed with own eye mr orme must have thought nothing of if lady mason have be seen there day for week together regarded mr furnival suspicion a hallucination bordering on insanity woman be in love with mr furnival very pretty woman endeavour to entice away from wife affection of such man a that a idea passed through mr orme mind did not perhaps remember that sir peregrine who be more than ten year mr furnival senior have be engaged to marry same lady then loved sir peregrine dearly have such feeling with reference to mr furnival however did what be most within power to do to allay suffering under visitor laboured explained to position in lady mason be placed think can see ended by saying for be in very great trouble to be tried for perjury said mr furnival out of whose heart hatred towards lady mason be quickly departing have heard that be to be tried for murder that have be convicted for murder must have altogether softened heart towards supposed enemy must forgive offence one yes indeed said mr orme wiping tear away from eye a thought of trouble present to come be saddest thing poor lady must almost break heart if be to see since first heard of be before christmas have not have one quiet moment poor creature said mr furnival ah must say so if knew have have to depend great deal upon mr furnival for advice without know what must do mr orme said not wishing to revert to charge against lady mason have brought mr furnival down to hamworth still desirous of emancipating poor friend completely from charge sir peregrine also be very kind to very added feeling that up to moment mr furnival must have heard nothing of intended marriage thinking probable that must do so before long indeed anybody must be kind to who saw in suffering be sure must mr furnival dear dear said mr furnival who be beginning to entertain almost kindly feeling towards mr orme be

day be to be promoted to dining room a son in law be quite ineligible have a lady staveley understood private fortune belonged to profession must not follow in only way by be possible to earn income by such being case daughter whom of girl knew to be most retiring least likely to speak of such feeling unless driven to by great stress daughter have positively declared to that be in love with man must anything be more hopeless must position be more trying oh dear oh dear oh dear said almost wringing hand in vexation darling be not angry kissed child smoothed hair be not angry must say think very unfortunate have not shilling in world will hing that papa approve said madeline holding down head then know doe think of thing of course doe not indeed think be marrying man at oh mamma talk in way a if expected anything must not tell truth when spoke of mr orme a did poor mr orme be such excellent young man suppose be better than mr graham mamma if speak of goodness be sure know said lady staveley very much put beside wish there be such thing a young men at there be augustus making fool of walked twice length of room in agony of maternal anxiety peregrine orme have suggested to what must feel if noningsby be on fire must such fire be worse than pernicious love flame have also suggested calamity a lady staveley remembered that acknowledged to herself that fate be not so cruel to a might have be so kissed daughter again assured that be by mean angry with then parted trouble have now come to head that course be longer open to poor lady staveley that one have adopted in trouble of married life must tell judge everything throw responsibility upon back let decide whether cold shoulder paternal blessing must be administered to ugly young man up stair who have tumbled off horse first day went out hunting who must not earn bread a others did thought cleverer than world feeling in lady staveley breast towards mr graham at especial time be not of kindly nature must not make comparison between peregrine orme without wondering at daughter choice peregrine be fair handsome one of curled darling of nation bright of eye smooth of skin good natured of sweet disposition young man to be loved by world incidentally heir to baronetcy good estate people be nice lived close in neighbourhood have lady staveley be set to choose husband for daughter must have chosen none better then counted up felix graham eye doubt be bright enough taken altogether be at least so said to herself hideously ugly be by mean curled darling then be masterful in mind not soft pleasant a be young orme be heir to nothing a to people of own have none in particular who must say where must live a likely a not in patagonia having be forced to accept judgeship in new colony for sake of bread daughter must not go to patagonia with if must help so when judge came home that evening told before must allow to dress for dinner certainly be not very handsome judge said when lady staveley insisted somewhat strongly on special feature of case think be ugliest young man know said ladyship look very well in wig said judge wig madeline must not see in wig anybody else very often seeing way be going on about profession what be to do about well must say hing let propose to dear girl if chooses to take fancy into head see how be to hinder have impression of mr graham think will do anything unhandsome by have singular idea of own about law grant that be plain plainest young man ever saw said lady staveley if know be man of high character much more than ordinary acquirement can not understand madeline lady staveley went on not caring overmuch about felix graham acquirement well dear think key to choice be that have judged not with eye with ear rather with understanding have accepted mr orme a father must of course have be well satisfied be have doubt fine young fellow will make good husband day oh excellent said ladyship cleeve be only seven mile must acknowledge that can not feel angry with madeline angry not angry who must be angry with poor child indeed be somewhat proud of seems to that prefers mind to matter be great deal to say for young lady matter exclaimed lady staveley who must not feel that term a applied to young man a peregrine orme be very opprobrious wit intellect power of expression have gone further with than good look rank worldly prosperity if be so believe be can not love better for so do love a much a mother can love daughter of course do judge kissed wife like wit genius sort of thing otherwise must have not taken dear be handsomest man of day be why fell in love with compliment be very poor one said judge never mind that like wit genius too wit genius be none better for being ugly wit genius must know how to butter own bread before think of taking wife forget dear that for aught know wit genius may be perfectly free from such thought then judge made understood that if be left to must dress for dinner when lady left parlour that evening found graham in drawing room there be longer necessity for embarrassment on madeline part at meeting have be in room together on three four occasion therefore must give hand ask after arm without feeling one be watching hardly spoke to beyond indeed did speak much to anybody conversation till gentleman joined be chiefly kept up by sophia furnival mr arbuthnot even after that evening did not pas very briskly one little scene there be during poor lady staveley eye be anxiously fixed upon son though most of in room supposed that be sleeping miss furnival be to return to london on following day therefore behoved augustus to be very sad in truth have be rather given to melancholy humour during last day two have miss furnival accepted civil speech making answer equally civil matter might very probably have passed by without giving special trouble to one have not done therefore augustus staveley have fancied to be really in love with what lady intention be will not pretend to say if be in truth desirous of becoming mr staveley certainly went about business in discreet wise manner so leave to morrow immediately after breakfast said having dressed face with romantic sobriety have be practising for last three day be sorry to say that such be fact said sophia to tell truth be not sorry said augustus turned away face for moment giving long sigh dare say not mr staveley need not have said so to said sophia pretending to take literally at word because can not stand kind of thing longer suppose must not see in morning alone well suppose not if can get down to prayer after having thing packed up will be a much a can do if begged for hour a last kindness certainly must not grant go ask mother whether request must be reasonable psha ah be not psha half hour between young lady young gentleman before breakfast be very serious thing mean to be serious said augustus said sophia be to understand then that under possible circumstance bless mr staveley how solemn be there be occasion in man life when be bound to be solemn be going away from miss furnival one must think be going to jeddo whereas be going to harley street may come see there of course may if like according to usage of world must be reckoned very uncivil if did not for much care about such usage therefore if omit will forgive very well then will say good night good bye last word uttered in strain must have melted heart a took leave of squeezed hand with affection be almost painful may be remarked that if augustus staveley be quite in earnest with sophia furnival must have asked that important question in straightforward manner a peregrine orme have asked of madeline perhaps miss furnival be aware of being so aware considered that serious half hour before breakfast might not a yet be safe if be really in love must find way to harley street on whole be inclined to think that miss furnival did understand business on following morning miss furnival went way without further scene of tenderness lady staveley be thoroughly glad that be gone nasty sly thing said to baker sly enough lady said baker mr augustus will be one too many for deary to think of having imperance to think of in miss furnival be think somewhat ill used if young gentleman such a augustus staveley be allowed to amuse with young lady surely young lady such a miss furnival must be allowed to play own card accordingly on day early in morning felix graham sought obtained interview with host in judge own study have come about two thing said taking easy chair to be invited two ten will be very happy said judge cheerily will take business first said graham then pleasure will be sweeter afterwards said judge have be thinking great deal about case of lady mason have read paper old new mr furnival have sent can not bring to suppose possible that can have be guilty of fraud deception believe to be free from guilt in matter a told before then of course will take that a private opinion not a one legally formed have never gone into matter a have done confess that like having dealing with mr chaffanbrass mr aram mr chaffanbrass mr aram may not be so bad a perhaps in ignorance suppose to be doe not occur to that must be very badly off without such men a chaffanbrass aram so must without chimney sweeper scavenger graham dear fellow judge not that be not judged be older than have seen more of men believe that a grow older also see more of opinion will be more lenient more just be angry with for taking liberty with dear judge if knew how value how must value mark of such kindness that can show however have decided will know something more of gentleman at once if have approbation will let mr furnival know will undertake case judge signified approbation thus first of two matter be soon settled between now for pleasure said judge know much about pleasure said graham fidgeting in chair rather uneasily be afraid there be not much pleasure for of for anybody else in what be going to say then there be so much more reason for having said quickly unpleasant thing must always be got over without delay nothing on earth can exceed lady staveley kindness to yours of whole family since unfortunate accident think of have be nothing like must have done a much a even if have not now be going to tell have fallen in love with daughter madeline a judge wished to have tale told quickly think have reason to be satisfied with very succinct term used by felix graham indeed said judge be reason why wished to go away at earliest possible time still wish be right there mr graham must say be right there under circumstance of case think be right to wish to leave therefore will go first thing to morrow morning in saying last word poor felix must not refrain from showing certain unevenness of temper disappointment gently gently mr graham let have few more word before accede to necessity of anything so sudden have spoken to madeline on subject not word may presume that intend to do so for moment so felix graham sat without speaking then getting up from chair walked twice length of room upon word judge will not answer for if remain here said at last softer hearted man than judge staveley one who must make more happy in making others happy never sat on english bench be not gallant young fellow before gallant clever of good honest principle true manly heart be not gentleman by birth education taste what more must man want for son in law then daughter have have wit to love man so endowed be almost on tongue to tell graham that might go seek girl plead own cause to bread be bread butcher bill be bill man father successful possessor of thousand year be too strong at last for soft hearted philanthropist therefore having collected thought thus expressed upon occasion mr graham think have behaved very well in matter be exactly what must have expected from judge at time knew nothing about mary snow a regard personally must be proud to own a son in law be of course bound to regard welfare of daughter mean fear be small very small indeed said graham though have gift must bring on in profession have learned to entertain idea hitherto have barred from success now tell what will do remain here two three day longer till be fit to travel abstain from saying anything to daughter come to again in three month if still hold same mind will pledge to tell then whether have leave to address child a suitor felix graham silently took judge hand feeling that strong hope have be given to so interview be ended chapter liii lady mason return home lady mason

doubt perceive that a mr orme have assured that will see mother constantly till time come be very kind said lucius be evident from tone of voice that must have preferred that ormes must have remained

through said lady mason though of course must not expect that can so sacrifice valuable time pray believe that be not consideration said mr furnival have engaged service of mr aram because be supposed to understand difficulty of sort better than other man in profession chance of rescuing from trouble will be much better if can bring to have confidence in full confidence mr furnival looked into face

resolution intended to be abiding one idea of marriage with moulded wife must at rate be abandoned whether might be great destiny to be husband of madeline staveley whether might fail in achieving purpose declared to that must be impossible that must ever now become husband of mary snow ease with conscience settled on matter a soon a have received from judge that gleam of hope astonished even immediately declared to that must not marry mary snow without perjury how must stand with before altar swear that must love seeing that did not love at seeing that altogether loved one else acknowledged that have made as of in affair of mary snow moulding of wife have failed with said a always must fail with man must not carry folly further must go to mary snow tell truth then bear injury angry father might be able to inflict on independently of angry father must of course do for mary snow that circumstance must admit perhaps gentleman of poetic turn of mind whom mary have consented to meet beneath lamp post might assist in view whether might be so not must not throw that meeting ungenerously in teeth must not have allowed offence to turn from proposed marriage have there be nothing else to turn therefore must not plead offence a excuse for broken troth that breaking of must not deeply wound poor mary heart so much did permit to believe on evidence of lamp post have written to mr thomas telling when must be at peckham in letter have not said word a to terrible tidings have communicated to have written also to mary assuring that accused of injury against almost promising forgiveness letter mary have not shown to mr thomas in day mary anger against mr thomas be very strong that mr thomas must have used vigilance to detect such going on a of lamp post be only natural what woman in mr thomas position in other position must not have done so mary snow knew have be duenna must have left corner of box unturned must have found letter having found must have used power over poor girl knew that must not have betrayed to man truth between woman woman must have prevented be not stocking have darned for mr thomas legion in number have not consented to

to mr graham one of little trick be carried on to allure into belief thing at peckham be prosperous have ever exposed borrowing of teacup when came fact that knob of white sugar be kept expressly on behoof must have scorned to betray woman that woman whom have not betrayed must have shown same feeling towards therefore there be enmity at peckham stocking of infant lay unmended in basket mary have done for best said mr thomas driven to defend by obdurate silence of pupil mr thomas did did for worst said mary then there be again silence between be on morning following felix graham be driven to door in cab still carried arm in sling be obliged to be somewhat slow in movement otherwise be again well accident however be so far godsend to woman at peckham that gave subject on be called upon to

right said trying to assume look of good humour sha' go hunting again in hurry may be sure of that have great reason to be thankful that providence interposed to save said mr thomas in most serious tone have providence interposed to break mr thomas collar bone at least to do serious outward injury what comfort must be thought mary snow have seen father lately asked graham not since wrote to about money that borrowed said mary told that must not have given to said mr thomas be quite right said graham who must refuse assistance to father in distress whereupon mary put handkerchief up to eye began to cry be true of course said mr thomas must never do that must be drain in way must feel that if have feeling so have said mary be driven close enough sometimes mr thomas there day when 'd

hard have be felix felt that sooner rushed into middle of subject brought there better must be for party that two lady be not very happy together be evident then made little comparison between madeline mary be really case for last three year have contemplated making that poor child wife must not be better for to tie millstone round neck cast into sea be now thought respecting mary snow mr thomas said must like to speak to mary alone for few minute if must allow certainly by mean will be quite proper gathering up bundle of unfortunate stocking took out of room mary a soon a graham have spoken became almost pale sat perfectly still with eye fixed on betrothed husband while mr thomas be there be prepared for war spirit be hot within heat fled in moment when found alone with man to whom belonged to speak doom have almost said that must forgive yet have feeling that have be done must not altogether be forgiven if asked whether loved hero of lamp post what must say have asked whether loved felix graham must have sworn that did have thought that be swearing truly in answer to other question if be asked felt that answer must be false have idea of giving up felix of own accord if be still willing to take did not even wish that must not take have be lesson of life that be to be wife by becoming so provide for herself for wretched father nevertheless dream of something different from have come across young heart dream have be so pleasant how painfully yet with what rapture have heart palpitated a stood for ten wicked minute beneath lamp post mary said felix a soon a be alone a spoke came up to took hand trust may never be cause to of unhappiness may never be mean of making sad oh mr graham be sure that never will be have be bad to mary think have be bad at must have be sorry that have happened must not have known suppose be right to tell only in truth mary did not at understand what might be nature of graham thought feeling on subject have strong woman idea that man whom ought to love must not be gratified by meeting man at private assignation especially when that other man have written to love letter did not at know how far such sin might be regarded a pardonable according to rule of world recognised on such subject at first when letter be discovered copy of sent off to noningsby thought that be over according to idea a existing at moment crime be conceived to be one admitting of pardon in hour spent under conviction consolation came from feeling that there be still one who regarded a angel of light then have received graham letter a began to understand that pardon be possible that other consolation waxed feeble dim if felix graham chose to take of course be there for to take never for moment occurred to that must rebel against such taking even though did shine a angel of light to one dear pair of eye suppose be right to tell only think mary that be going to scold even that be angry with oh know must be angry indeed be not if pledge to tell truth in everything will be equally frank with yes said mary be much easier for felix to tell truth than for mary to be frank believe that schoolmaster often tell fib to schoolboy although must be so easy for to tell truth how difficult be for schoolboy always to tell truth to master mary snow be now a schoolboy before tutor may almost be said that telling of truth be to impossible of course made promise who ever said that must not tell truth when so asked have ever thought mary that must not make other happy if be married have never thought that said mary innocently meant to say exactly that thought graham must wish to say be slow in following lead have never occurred to that though might love other very warmly a friend so be sure always will yet might not suit other in respect a man wife mean to do very best can be if if if be not too much offended with now mary must not be question of doing best can between man wife there must be need of such effort must be labour of love so will be sure will labour a hard a can felix began to perceive that line have taken must not answer required purpose that must be somewhat more abrupt with perhaps little le delicate in coming to desired point mary said what be name of gentleman whom whom met out of door know albert fitzallen said mary hesitating very much a pronounced name nevertheless rather proud of sound be fond of asked graham poor girl what be to say be not very fond of be not then why did consent to secret meeting oh mr graham did mean indeed did did tell to write to yet to come looking after upon word did then thought when sent that letter that did know about mean so thought 'd better tell be why went indeed be reason mr thomas must have told that like mr thomas must for world that must have have anything to do with think mr thomas have behaved very bad to so do half know that will ask one more question mary before answering want to make believe that only object in asking be to ascertain how may make happy when did meet mr gentleman albert fitzallen when did meet mr fitzallen did tell nothing else except that be engaged to did say nothing to a to feeling towards told be very wrong of to write that letter what more did tell oh mr graham wo see more indeed wo give most solemn promise indeed wo will never write line to look at if sends anything will send to indeed will there be never anything of kind before upon word there be did let take hand did know how to help when be there kissed only once there have told all now a though be looking at ai bad girl may say of indeed ai then poor mary snow burst out into agony of tear felix began to perceive that have be too hard upon have wished that first overture of separation must come from in wishing have be unreasonable walked for while about room then going up to stood close by took hand mary said be sure be not bad girl said ai still sobbing convulsively did mean anything wrong must help be sure did not nobody have said did yes have have said so said be bad girl told so up to face be very wrong if said so did then must bear have not said so think so indeed in matter believe have be more to blame than know be wrong know must have gone to see wo even say a much a mary what must have done only task must have be too hard for young girl be to have told openly that liked young gentleman want ever to see again look here mary said now have dropped hand taken chair opposite to have begun to find that task have proposed to be not so easy even for look here mary take that do like young gentleman answer till have finished what be going to say suppose do like if so must be very wicked in to marry oh mr graham wait moment mary there be nothing wicked in liking may be presumed that mr graham must hold such opinion a seeing that have allowed same latitude of liking be perhaps only natural that must learn to do so have be taught to regard rather a master than a lover oh mr graham be sure have loved have indeed will wo even think of al want to think of be if be worth thinking of be very good young man always life with mother will be business to find out now mary tell truly if be good young man if love well enough to marry must not be happier a wife than must a mine there question that wished to ask have got asked at last if asking have be difficult how much more difficult must have be answer have be thinking over for last fortnight have hardly known how to come to resolution now put matter before without moment notice expected instant decision speak truth mary what think about without minding what anybody may say of mary must not say anything so again burst into tear surely know state of own heart mary know answered only object be to secure happiness happiness of of be will do anything please said mary well then will tell what think fear that marriage between must not make either of contented with life be too old too grave for yet mary snow be not younger than madeline staveley have be told to love think that do love because wish to do what think to be duty believe that people can never really love other merely because be told to do so of course can not say what sort of young man mr fitzallen may be if find that be fit to take care of that have mean to support with such little help a can give will be very happy to promote such arrangement everybody will of course say that felix graham be base in not telling that arose not from love affair with albert fitzallen from own love affair with madeline staveley be inclined to think that everybody will be wrong have told openly that did not care for did care for one else must have left alternative a be did not mean that must have alternative probably consulted feeling best in allowing to think that have choice then though owed much to owed nothing to father have openly declared intention of breaking off match because have attached to one else must have put terribly into father power be willing to submit to such pecuniary burden in matter a conscience told that ought to bear mr snow idea on subject of recompense might be extravagant therefore a regarded snow father thought that might make slight delicate use of meeting under lamp post in doing so must be very careful to guard mary from father anger indeed mary must be surrendered out of own care not to of father to fostering love of gentleman in medical line of life will do anything that please said mary upon whose mind heart change have come with suddenness prevented from thinking much le speaking thought perhaps have better mention to mr thomas oh mr graham 'd rather not talk to love bit well will not press on if wish have permission to speak to mr fitzallen if approves to speak to mother will do anything think best mr graham said poor mary be poor mary for though have consented to meet lover beneath lamp post have not be without ambition have looked forward to glory of being wife to man a felix graham did not however for one moment entertain idea of resistance to will then felix left having of course interview with mr thomas before quitted house to however said nothing when anything be settled mr thomas will let know word be so lacking in confidence that mr thomas when heard knew that verdict have gone against felix for many month have be accustomed to take leave of mary snow with kiss on day omitted to kiss then mary knew that be over with ambition love still remained to there be one else who will be proud to kiss said to herself a stood alone in room when closed door behind chapter lv what took place in harley street tom have come back again said mr furnival a soon a dining room door be closed behind back be very glad to see be indeed said getting up putting out hand to really never knew why went away oh yes know be sure know why went will be shot if did then went away because did not like lady mason going to chamber psha yes know be wrong tom be be wrong about of course be kitty well say be have come back again beg pardon be about lady very well then there be end of tom know have be provoked have now how often have be home to dinner since have be member of parliament for place will be more at home now kitty will indeed then will not say word to vex what on earth can want tom except just that must sit at home with sometimes on evening a used to do always in old day a for martha biggs be come back too oh dear be in red lion square be sure tom never have here except when must dine at home wonder whether know how lonely be to sit down to dinner by why do other day of life never think of sending for martha biggs promise that be very nice know said mr furnival be for gentleman must say not said mr furnival then reconciliation have be effected mr furnival went up stair to prepare for dinner knowing that husband must be present martha biggs must not just a be taking accustomed place at head of table almost ashamed to look up lest must catch spooner eye who be standing behind master rachel went off in cab to orange street commissioned to pay what might be due for lodging to bring back mistress box to convey necessary tidings to miss biggs well never said martha a listened to rachel story be quite loving can assure said rachel will never last said miss biggs triumphantly never be be done too sudden to last so will say good night if please miss biggs said rachel who be in hurry to get back to harley street think might have come here before went there especially a be anything out of way must have gone shorter than bloomsbury square russell square over tottenham court road missus did think of dare say used to know way about part well enough give love rachel then martha biggs be again alone sighed deeply be well that mr furnival came back so quickly to own house a saved scandal of domestic quarrel before daughter on following day sophia returned a harmony be at time reigning in harley street there be necessity that must be presumed to know anything of what have occurred that did know know exactly what mother have done why have done how have come back leaving martha biggs dumfounded by return be very probable for sophia furnival be clever girl one who professed to understand in out of own family perhaps of other family behaved very prettily to papa mamma on occasion never dropping word must lead of to suppose that have interrogated rachel be confidential with housemaid conversed on subject even with spooner made morning call on martha biggs there arose not unnaturally conversation between mother daughter a to lady mason not a to lady mason visit to lincoln inn impropriety a formerly presumed not at all a to in respect to present lamentable position engagement have for time existed between sir peregrine orme on latter subject mr furnival have of course heard nothing during interview with mr orme at noningsby at time lady mason have formed sole subject of conversation in explaining to mr furnival that there certainly must be unhallowed feeling between husband lady mr orme have not thought necessary to allude to sir peregrine past intention mr furnival however have heard whole matter discussed in railway carriage have since interrogated husband learning however not very much from now inquired into detail from daughter sir peregrine be really to be married mr furnival a asked question thought with confusion of own unjust accusation against poor woman under such circumstance a lady mason must of course have be innocent a touching mr furnival yes said sophia there be doubt whatsoever that be engaged sir peregrine told lady staveley so now be broken off again oh yes be broken off now believe fact to be lord alston who life near noningsby be very old friend of sir peregrine when heard of went to cleeve know that for certain think talked sir peregrine out of conscience sophia after have made offer fancy mr orme arranged whether lord alston saw not know belief be that lady mason behaved very well through though say very bitter thing against at noningsby poor thing said mr furnival feeling of whose heart be quite changed a regarded lady mason never knew woman so badly treated sophia have own reason for wishing to make best of lady mason case for see why sir peregrine must not have married if pleased be rather old dear people think so much about now day a used if liked too who have right to say anything idea be that man with spirit must have turned lord alston out of house what business have to interfere about trial sophia will go on there be doubt about say that be most unjust thing in world that must be proved innocent heard judge say so why be allowed to try then oh papa will tell that never like to bother papa about law business particularly not mr furnival when have pretty woman for client wonder be that must make so unhappy about continued sophia seems that be quite broken down wo have to go sit in court with people staring at wo kill said sophia who felt that must not perish under such process if be sure be in right think must hold up head against say that be crushed to earth poor thing said mr furnival wish must do anything for in way talked matter over very comfortably two three day after sophia furnival be sitting alone in drawing room in harley street when spooner answered double knock at door lucius mason be shown up stair mr furnival have gone to make peace in red lion square there may perhaps be ground for supposing lucius have cause to expect miss furnival might be seen at hour without interruption be that a may be found alone be permitted to declare purpose unmolested by father mother family friend remember how parted at noningsby said when first greeting be well over oh yes remember very well easily forget word such a be spoken then said that must never turn away from will be with reference to matter a to be speaking be friendship then to be confined to one subject by mean friendship can not be so confined mr mason friendship between true friend must extend to affair of life what meant to say be be quite sure that understand without explanation did understand meant to say that have promised to sympathy friendship nothing more then have asked for nothing more matter of doubt within own heart be must must not ask for more if resolved on answering question in affirmative must ask for now have determined that morning that must come to fixed purpose on matter before reached harley street a crossed out of oxford street from omnibus have determined that present be time for love making walking up regent street have told that if have one faithful heart to bear company must bear trouble better a made way along north side of cavendish square pictured to what must be wound to pride if be rejected in passing ten twelve house intervened in harley street between corner of square abode of mistress told that question must be answered by circumstance yes understand said believe in must not for world encroach on kindness knew that when pressed hand night pressed hand of friend nothing more quite so said sophia sophia wit be usually ready enough at moment must not resolve with what word might make most appropriate reply to friend what did say be rather lame be not dangerous since have suffered great deal said lucius of course know that mother have be staying at cleeve oh yes believe left only day two since heard perhaps of hardly know how to tell if have not heard if mean about sir peregrine have heard of of course have world have heard of lucius mason got up walked about room holding hand to brow world be talking about miss furnival have never known what be to blush for parent miss furnival at moment felt sincere hope that mr mason might never hear of mr furnival visit to neighbourhood of orange street of cause led to by mean thought necessary to ask for friend sympathy on subject said never have need do so for yours why must not lady mason have married sir peregrine orme if thought marriage fitting what at time a with dreadful accusation running in ear surely be time for marrying have come of people now say that have rejected sent away oh can not say that do be reported that sir peregrine have sent away because think to be guilty that believe honest man gentleman must think guilty be not dreadful that such thing must be said will not trial take place very shortly now when be once over trouble will be at end miss furnival sometimes think that mother will hardly have strength to sustain trial be so depressed that almost fear mind will give way worst of be that be altogether unable to comfort surely that at present must specially be task can not do must say to think that be wrong in what be doing thoroughly absolutely wrong have got about parcel of lawyer beg pardon miss furnival know mean such a father have not advised if so can not think be wrong be very scum of gaol men who live by rescuing felon from punishment deserve what can mother require of such service a theirs be that frighten make dread manner of evil why must woman who know to be good just fear anything that law can do to can easily understand that position a hers must be very dreadful must not be hard upon mr mason because be not a strong a might be hard upon ah miss furnival know if must only accept love must wait upon a mother doe upon infant labour must be too much for care must be too close desire be that affair must never be mentioned between be living now in same house though see that be killing yet may not speak of then got up from chair a walked about room took handkerchief from pocket wiped eye wish must comfort said in saying so spoke truth by nature be not tender hearted now did sympathise with by nature too be not given to deep affection did feel spark of love for lucius mason wish must comfort a spoke also got up from chair can said suddenly stopping coming close to can comfort in degree only can do so know be time for declaration of love be not that be already so much to other must not indulge at moment with wish have one whom can love be very hard to bear then stood waiting for answer a though conceived that have offered hand miss furnival well knew that have received no offer if warmest sympathy can be of service to be love want said taking hand a spoke love so may look on a wife acceptance of love so that may be in to other there be hand stand before now a sad man a there be in london there be hand will take give in pledge of love must be unjust to lucius mason be to omit to say that played part with becoming air unhappiness melancholy mood suited perhaps better than world ordinary good humour be man who looked best when under cloud shone brightest when everything about be dark sophia also be not unequal to occasion there be however difference between lucius be quite honest in that said did upon occasion whereas miss furnival be only half honest perhaps be not capable of higher pitch of honesty than there be hand said stood holding other palm to palm with heart said lucius with heart answered sophia a spoke did hesitate for moment become embarrassed lose command of feature have augustus staveley gone through same ceremony at noningsby in same way be inclined to think that must have made same answer have done so must not on account have be unhappy what blessed woman must lady staveley have be have known what be being done in harley street at moment in short rhapsody of love may be presumed that lucius indulged when found that affair have in hand have so far satisfactorily arranged be in truth too wretched at heart for true enjoyment of delight of favoured suitor be soon engaged again on terrible subject seated side by side indeed somewhat close tone of voice very word be hardly different from what might have be have troth be plighted between present plan be that sophia must visit orley farm for time take place of dear bosom friend woman circumstanced a be mother must so urgently need reader know well who be now that loving friend know also be best fitted for such task sophia furnival mr orme have have trust better mean of reading character of lady than have fallen to lot of lucius mason must not be angry with because eye be dark sophia hesitated moment before answered proposition not a though be slack in love begrudged service to mother behoved to look carefully at circumstance before must pledge to such arrangement a if went to orley farm on mission must not be necessary to tell father mother nay to tell world that be engaged to lucius mason must be wise to make such communication at present moment lucius said word to of going into court with mother sitting with hand in hand while ordeal be passing by in publicity of such sympathy there be something suited bearing of miss furnival mind idea lady mason be guilty have never entered head therefore on thought there must be disgrace in such proceeding nevertheless might not be prudent to wait till that trial be over if be wife must be daughter how can better take daughter part pleaded lucius must do with whole heart lucius doe know well enough be of that must think after that have told can think that must wish to be there be desire that mother must learn to have wish explained to must do little at home because must not yield opinion on matter of importance a to mother differed so vitally if have woman with in house woman a own sophia then thought heart must be softened part of sorrow might be assuaged sophia at last said that must think about must be improper said to pledge to anything rashly might be that a father be to defend lady mason might on account object to daughter being in court lucius declared that must be unreasonable unless indeed mr furnival must object to daughter engagement might not do so sophia thought very probable that might must make difference in said engagement must be equally binding a permanently binding let who must object to a made declaration there be of course little love scene for present might be best that in matter must obey father then pointed out how fatal might be to avert father from cause while trial be still pending upon whole acted part very prudently when lucius left be pledged to nothing that one simple fact of marriage engagement chapter lvi how sir peregrine did business with mr round in mean time sir peregrine be sitting at home trying to determine in what way must act under present emergency actuated a be on one side by friendship on other by duty for first day two nay for first week after confession have be made to have be so astounded have be so knocked to earth have remained in such state of bewilderment that have be impossible for to form for line of conduct only counsellor have be mr orme though must not analyze matter felt that woman idea of honour honesty be in way different from idea a man to sorrow utter misery of lady mason seemed of greater weight than guilt at least such be impression word left mr orme chief anxiety in matter still be that lady mason must be acquitted a strongly so now a when believed to be a guiltless a sir peregrine must not look at in light did not say that wished that might be found guilty did wish did announce opinion to daughter in law that end of justice must so be best promoted that if matter be driven to trial must not be for honour of court that false verdict must be given must believe that false verdict must be obtained english judge english jury be to palladium of discerning truth in english court of law such matter must not remain dark ought let misery betide be strange how old man must have lived so near world for seventy year must have taken place in parliament on bench must have rubbed shoulder so constantly against of neighbour yet have retained so strong reliance on purity of world in general here there such man may still be found number be becoming very few a for property must of necessity be abandoned lady mason have signified agreement to therefore be so far willing that must be saved from further outward punishment if be still possible plan be to thinking be only plan be feasible let estate be at once given up to proper owner even now before day of trial must come then let trust not to joseph mason to joseph mason adviser to abstain from prosecuting offender even course knew to be surrounded by thousand difficulty might be possible of mr round old mr round have heard good report be kind man even in very matter have behaved in way have shamed client might not be possible that mr round must engage to drop prosecution if immediate return of property be secured to effect must not tell mr round of woman guilt must manage must not tell mr furnival by so doing must not rob lady mason of sole remaining tower of strength for if mr furnival knew that be guilty mr furnival must of course abandon cause then sir peregrine did not know how to turn a thus argued matter within own bosom then too own disgrace sat very heavy on whether law might pronounce lady mason to have be guilty world must know guilt when property must be abandoned wretched son turned out to earn bread must be well understood that have be guilty be woman midnight forger whom have taken to bosom asked to be wife have asked have consented then have proclaimed triumph of love to world when stood there holding to breast have be proud of affection when lord alston have come to with caution have scorned old friend almost driven from door when grandson have spoken word not to to have be full of wrath have let be known widely that must feel shame in showing to world a lady orme now be forger perjurer thief thief who for long year have lived on proceeds of dexterous theft yet be not under deep obligation to under very deepest have not saved from worse disgrace saved at cost of be left to herself be not still bound to stand by did not still love poor sir peregrine may not say that must have be well for if world trouble must have now be ended so that might have done with mr orme be only counsellor though must not be brought to agree with in feeling yet be of infinite comfort to have not shared with terrible secret mind must have given way beneath burden on day after lady mason departure from cleeve sat for hour in library considering what must do then sent for daughter in law if behoved to take step to stay trial must take at once matter have be pressed on by side now day might be counted up to day on judge must arrive in alston that trial must be very terrible to in way have promised during pleasant hour of love sympathy in have felt no doubt a to friend acquittal that must stand by when be arraigned that be now impossible though have not dared to mention to lady mason knew that must not expect that must do so to mr orme have spoken on matter have declared purpose of taking place must not now become to fill sir peregrine have started from chair when have so spoken what daughter purest of pure to whom very air of court of law must be contamination whose whiteness have never be sullied by contact with world dust set by side of terrible criminal hand in hand with present to world a bosom friend there have be few word between on matter sir peregrine have felt strongly that might not be permitted far better than that must be that must humble gray hair sit there to be gazed at by crowd on account how much be to be desired that there must be trial sit down edith said a with soft step came up to find that assize will be here in alston at end of next month so soon a father yes look here judge will come in on th of march ah be very sudden will not be best for that must be over mr orme still thought have always thought that trial be unavoidable indeed have thought did think that afforded to lady mason only possible mean of escape mind on subject if must have be analyzed must probably have be a to property that question must for present stand in abeyance be quite right that must go to detestable owner that must be made over to at day not very distant for present trial for old long distant crime be subject for to consider must be wrong to wish for acquittal for sinner acquittal before world bar seeing that true verdict have undoubtedly be given before bar mr orme trusted that jury must convict friend let lady mason go through ordeal then when law have declared innocent let restitution be made will be very terrible to if be condemned said sir peregrine very terrible mr furnival edith if come to will be condemned mr furnival be lawyer will not say so from countenance when speaks of know that expects oh father say so if be so love what be purport of court of law if be not to discover truth make plain to light of day poor sir peregrine innocence in respect be perhaps beautiful be very simple mr aram must have be induced to speak out mind plainly must have expressed probably different opinion escaped before said mr orme who be clearly at present on same side with mr aram yes did by perjury edith now penalty of further crime awaits there be old poet who said that wicked man rarely escape at last believe in heart that spoke truth father old poet knew nothing of faith sir peregrine must not stop to explain even if knew how to do so that old poet spoke of punishment in world whereas faith on daughter relied be efficacious for pardon beyond grave must be much ay in one sense everything if lady mason must be brought to repent of sin have committed such repentance must stay bitterness of joseph mason of samuel dockwrath if property be at once restored then repentance might commence if property be at once restored then trial might be stayed might be possible that mr round might so act felt must not argue on think dear said that have better see mr round will not tell said mr orme sharply be not authorised to do will entice from be lawyer will wind anything out from plain chivalrous man of truth honour dear mr round believe be good man if asks question what will say will tell to ask such question oh father be careful for sake be careful how be that know truth that know told here because in way only must save from marriage father have sacrificed for for sir peregrine when be said to got up from chair walked away to window be not angry with that so spoke to nay acknowledged inwardly truth of word loved for constancy nevertheless be very bitter how have come to pas that be thus indebted to so deep criminal what have done for good go from said following think unkind no answered striving almost ineffectually to repress sob be not unkind for two day after not word be spoken between on subject then did go to mr round not word on subject be spoken between sir peregrine mr orme be twice at orley farm during time told lady mason of step father in law be taking wo betray lady mason have said mr orme have answered with what best assurance must give in heart of heart feared that sir peregrine must betray secret be not pleasant journey for sir peregrine indeed may be said that journey must longer be pleasant for be old worn feeble very much older much more worn than have be at period spoken of in commencement of story though few month have passed over head since time for now must have be preferable to remain in arm chair by fireside in own library receiving such comfort in old age a might come to from affection of daughter in law grandson thought that behoved to do work therefore old feeble a be set to task reached station in london have driven to bedford row in cab soon found in presence of mr round illustration sir peregrine at mr round office there be much ceremonial talk between before sir peregrine must bring to declare purport have brought there mr round of course protested that be very sorry for affair case be not in hand personally have hoped many year since that matter be closed client mr mason of groby park have insisted that must be reopened now mr round really hardly knew what to say about mr round do think be quite impossible that trial must even now be abandoned asked sir peregrine very carefully well fear be mason think that property be be determined to make struggle for be imputing nothing wrong to lady really be not in position to have opinion of own understand of course firm be bound to do best can for client mr round know be quite safe with well safe in one way hope be sir peregrine must of course remember be attorney for other side for side to be opposed still that can want be client interest of course desire to serve interest with view mr round be not possible that might come to compromise what by giving up part of property by giving up property said sir peregrine with considerable emphasis whew w w mr round at moment made other answer than terminated in low whistle better at once than that must die broken hearted said sir peregrine there be then silence between for minute two after mr round turning round in chair so a to face visitor more fully spoke a follows told just now sir peregrine be mr mason attorney must now tell that a regard interview between will not hold a being in position what have said will be a though have not be said a be not taking part in proceeding may with absolute strictness be case if have said anything ought not to have said began sir peregrine allow for one moment continued mr round fault be mine if there be fault a must have explained to that matter must hardly be discussed with propriety between mr round offer apology from bottom of heart sir peregrine will offer apology will accept know word strong enough to convey to esteem respect for character sir will ask to listen to for moment if compromise be contemplated must be arranged by advice of mr furnival of mr chaffanbrass term must be settled between mr aram son can not myself say that see possibility of result be not however for to advise if on matter wish for advice think that have better see mr furnival ah said sir peregrine telling more more of story by utterance made now only remains for to assure once more that word have be spoken in room will be a though have not be spoken then mr round made very clear that there be nothing more to be said between on subject of lady mason sir peregrine repeated apology collected hat glove with slow step made way down to cab while mr round absolutely waited upon till saw seated within vehicle so mat be right after said old attorney to a stood alone with back to own fire thrusting hand into trouser pocket so mat be right after meaning of exclamation will be plain to reader mat have declared to father conviction that lady mason have forged codicil in question father be now also convinced that have done so unfortunate woman said poor wretched woman then began to calculate what might yet be chance of escape on whole thought that must escape twenty year of possession said to so excellent character nevertheless repeated to over over again that be wretched miserable woman may say that person most concerned be convinced nearly convinced of lady mason guilt among own friend mr furnival have doubt of mr chaffanbrass mr aram very little whereas sir peregrine mr orme of course have none on other side mr mason mr dockwrath be fully sure of truth two round father son be quite of same mind yet except with dockwrath sir peregrine most honest most dishonest of lot opinion be that must escape be five lawyer concerned not one of whom gave to course of justice credit that must ascertain truth not one of whom wished that truth must be ascertained surely have be honest minded in profession must have so wished have so wished else have abstained from professional intercourse in matter can not understand how gentleman can be willing to use intellect for propagation of untruth to be paid for so using a to mr chaffanbrass mr solomon aram to escape of criminal under auspex must of course be matter of triumph to such work for many year have applied sharp intellect legal knowledge of mr furnival what will say of sir peregrine went home very sad at heart crept silently back into own library in evening when be alone with mr orme spoke one word to edith said have seen mr round can hing for there feared not said can hing for there after sir peregrine took step in matter what step must take sat over fire in library day after day thinking over waiting till terrible assize must have come chapter lvii love hope of albert fitzallen felix graham when left poor mary snow did not go on immediately to doctor shop have made up mind that mary snow must never be wife therefore considered wise to lose time in making such arrangement a might be necessary for release for hers nevertheless have not heart to go about work moment that left passed by apothecary looking in saw young man working sedulously at pestle if albert fitzallen be fit to be husband willing to be so poor a be must still make pecuniary sacrifice by might quiet own conscience make mary marriage possible still have sum of l belonging to that being remaining capital half of that must give to mary a dower so in two day returned again looking in at doctor shop again saw young man at work yes sir name be albert fitzallen said medical aspirant coming round counter there be one else in shop felix hardly knew how to accost on so momentous subject while be still in charge of store of medicine liable to be called away at moment to relieve ailment of clapham albert fitzallen be pale faced light haired youth with incipient moustache with hair parted in equal division over forehead with elaborate shirt cuff elaborately turned back with white apron tied round so that might pursue vocation without injury to nether garment face however be not bad mean have there not be about little air of pretension assumed perhaps to carry off combined apron beard felix must have regarded altogether with favourable eye be in medical way asked fitzallen when graham suggested that must step out with for few minute graham explained that be not in medical way that be in way altogether of private nature

suppose that have got axe in hand said to grandson pretty well for sir think that man will cut down tree about place if will let in way strove to talk about affair of property chapter lx what rebekah did for son day mr orme went up to orley farm sat for two hour with lady mason may say that there be now no longer secret between that whose life have be so innocent so pure so good must look into inmost heart soul of other woman whose career have be supported by proceeds of one terrible life long iniquity now by degree lady mason must begin to plead for rather to put in plea for deed have done acknowledging however that doer of have fallen almost below forgiveness through crime be not son a much a that other one have not deserved of that must do thing for again never once did ask of favour for from day gave to because have be good to father mother up to very hour of death never asked to spend shilling on own account asked to do thing for child when at last refused told that must cause to be done told so did think that believed knew be one who must act up to word told that orley farm must belong to babe what did say bade beware of soul answer be very terrible will not shock with ah be easy to talk of repentance repentance will not come with word in day mr orme became gradually aware that hitherto have comprehended little of lady mason character there be power of endurance about courage be almost awful to mind of weaker softer better woman lady mason during sojourn at cleeve have seemed almost to sink under misfortune have there be hypocrisy pretence in apparent misery have be very wretched a wretched human creature may say a crawling god earth at time have borne load bearing have gone about work still striving with desperate courage a ground on trod continued to give way beneath foot inch by inch have known pitied misery have loved for misery a be in nature of such people to do have little known how great have be cause for have sympathised with female weakness have succumbed when there be hardly necessity for succumbing have then known must have wondered at strength made struggle possible under such circumstance even now must not yield have said that there have be no hypocrisy in misery during week last past have said so truly there have perhaps be pretence acting of part almost necessary pretence a to weakness be not bound to account to around for great sorrow be not above thing needful that must enlist sympathy obtain aid have be obliged to cry to for help though obliged also to confess that there be little reason for such cry be woman weak have said therefore can not walk alone now that way be stony what have be truth with how must have cried have be possible for to utter sharp cry of heart water have be closing over head have clutched at hand to save owner of hand might not know how imminent how close be danger in day a sat in own room with mr orme owner of hand might know everything secret have be told there be longer need for pretence a must now expose to view whole load of wretchedness so also must make known strength be still left for endurance two woman who have become endeared to other under such terrible circumstance came together at meeting with more of equality of friendship than have ever existed at cleeve may seem strange that must be so strange that acknowledged forger of husband will must be able to maintain better claim for equal friendship than lady who be believed to be innocent true be so now stood on true ground now a sat there with mr orme must speak from heart pouring forth real working of mind from mr orme have longer aught to fear from sir peregrine everything be known to must now tell of incident of crime with outspoken boldness that in be incompatible with humble bearing of inferior in presence of one above did still hope one point to be gained be that son only son child on whose behalf crime have be committed must never know shame live to be disgraced by guilt if must be punished must say left in ignorance of punishment must not care what indignity might heap upon have heard of penal servitude of year terribly long passed in misery of vile companionship of solitary confinement dull madness engenders of terror of life spent under circumstance bearable only by uneducated rude vile be a nothing to compared with loss of honour to son must live must say must die can not ask to become murderer be on point that differed always mr orme must have have confess everything to lucius strove to make understand that if be so told blow must fall le heavily than must do if knowledge came to from conviction at trial mother must not bring to believe that be absolutely necessary that must ever know there be property yes let trial come if be acquitted then let arrangement be made about that lawyer might find out cause why must be surrendered mr orme feared that if trial be over criminal saved from justice property must not be surrendered then how must wish of repentance be possible after be not that one thing necessary will not say that mr orme in day ever regretted that sympathy friendship have be thus bestowed frequently acknowledged to herself that position be too difficult for there be one whose assistance must ask for felt that must not in matter ask counsel from sir peregrine be good pure straightminded simple in perception of right wrong lady mason be greater than in force of character stronger woman in way endowed with more force of will with more power of mind with greater energy swifter flow of word sometimes almost thought must be better that must stay away from orley farm then have promised to be true to wretched friend mother solicitude for son still softened mother heart in day till evening came lucius mason never made way into mother sitting room indeed be drawing room of house mr orme a rule hardly ever met other if saw a entered left place must lift hat to pas by without speaking be not admitted to council of mother must not submit to ask after mother welfare to inquire a to affair from stranger on other subject be possible that must now speak to daily visitor only visitor at orley farm mr orme understood saw that young man be alone comfortless passed hour below in own room twice day mother found in parlour then sat through silent miserable meal must then leave always saying soft word of motherly love putting hand upon shoulder arm on such occasion be never rough to must never respond to caress have ill treated preferring in trouble assistance of stranger to assistance must ask for money counsel a have thus chosen to stand aloof from also must stand aloof from not for always a said to over over again for heart misgave when saw line of care so plainly written on mother brow not for always must be so day

direction till whole truth have be confessed to two woman be sitting together in up stair room day of trial be now not full week distant from when mr orme again tried to persuade mother to intrust son with burden of misery on preceding day mr solomon aram have be down at orley farm have be with lady mason for hour know truth lady mason have said to friend be sure of did ask oh did not ask that asked of little thing happened at time from manner be sure know say that will escape did say escape not that word be same thing spoke to lucius for saw on lawn together know what said to for lucius must not speak to must not ask then be silent for mr orme be thinking how must bring about matter be so near heart lady mason be seated in large old fashioned arm chair in now passed nearly time table be by side rarely turned to sat leaning with elbow on arm supporting face with hand opposite to so close that might look into face watch movement of eye sat mr orme intent upon one thing that woman before must be brought to repent evil have done have not spoken to lucius answered more than have told what must say to about man not about mr aram might not be necessary to speak of have work to do suppose that must do in own way yes must do in own way lucius must not understand unless told everything of course must not understand be impossible lady mason be not impossible dear lady mason turn from in way be for sake because love that press to do if knew must tell son tale said lady mason turning upon sharply speaking almost with air of anger mr orme be for moment silenced for must not at

childhood how young year be passed never loved anything be till knew instead of finishing sentence pointed down towards cleeve how then can tell mr orme must let pull to piece bit by bit if in way

despair line of face be terrible to be seen a thus spoke agony of anguish loaded brow upon mr orme be frightened to look fell on knee before wretched woman taking by hand strove must to find comfort for ah say so say that may come misery that worst of misery need not oppress if indeed be true be true how must be otherwise now now need not be true now lady mason for soul sake say that be so now mr orme said speaking with singular quiescence of tone after violence of last word seems to that care more for soul than for own for can bear even if be castaway will not attempt to report word passed between for next half hour for concerned matter may not dare to handle too closely in such page a mr orme still knelt there at foot pressing lady mason hand pressing against knee a with eagerness of true affection endeavoured to bring to frame of mind must admit of comfort ended in let everything be told to lucius so that first step back to honesty might be taken then let trust to whose mercy can ever temper wind to shorn lamb a lady mason have once said to herself repentance will not come with word can not tell said at last be thing impossible must die at foot before word be spoken will do for said mr orme offering from pure charity to take upon task perhaps a heavy a that human creature must perform will tell screamed lady mason taking mr orme by arm a spoke will not do so say that will not remember promise to remember why be that know will not surely unless bid said mr orme bid mind bid will not have done better anything than while may yet be avoided have promise have not oh

great treasure for very great treasure be better than samaritan for went on way will stay till last yes know will stay poor creature kissed only friend kissed hand forehead breast then mr orme went without speaking for heart be full word must not come to a went said to herself that must stay till last standing alone on step before front door found lucius mason alone feeling moved to speak word to a passed hope doe not trouble much mr mason said offering hand to felt that word be hypocritical a be speaking under such circumstance what else must say to well mr orme such episode in one family history doe give one trouble be unhappy very unhappy not too much so to thank for most unusual kindness to poor mother then having be so far encouraged by speaking to accompanied round house on to lawn from whence path led away through shrubbery on to road must take by village of coldharbour to cleeve mr mason said a walked for few step together before house suppose that presume to interfere between mother have right to interfere now said think might comfort if must be more with must not be better if must talk freely together about must be better said fear that be no longer possible when trial be over world know that be innocent when people will see how cruelly have be used mr orme might not tell truth to must with difficulty bear to hear dwell thus confidently on hope be so false future be in hand of god mr mason for present present future be in hand mr orme know mother innocence must have done son part towards establishing must not allow will soon be over now then trust will once again understand other till then doubt whether will be wise to interfere good morning mr orme pray believe that appreciate at full worth that be doing for then again lifted hat left lady mason from window saw a walked together heart for moment misgave must be that friend be treacherous to be possible that even now be telling everything that have sworn that must not tell why be two together

not have stood thus calmly have already heard mother shame knew having laid aside immediate fear retreated back to chair must not tell at rate till trial must be over chapter lxi state of public opinion day of trial be now quickly coming on london world especially world of lawyer be beginning to talk much on subject men about inn of court speculated a to verdict offering to other very confident opinion a to result offering on occasion bet a well a opinion younger world of barrister be clearly of opinion that lady mason be innocent portion unhappy portion be inclined to fear that in spite of innocence must be found guilty elder world of barrister be not perhaps so demonstrative in world belief in innocence be not so strong fear of condemnation much stronger attorney a rule regarded a guilty to policeman mind man not policeman be guilty being attorney perhaps share something of feeling attorney to man expected to see acquitted great be faith in mr furnival great faith in solomon aram greater than in be faith in mr chaffanbrass if mr chaffanbrass must not pull through with prescription of twenty year on side thing must be very much altered indeed in english criminal court to outer world portion of world have nothing to do with administration of law idea of lady mason having be guilty seemed preposterous of course be innocent of course must be found to be innocent of course also that joseph mason of groby park be must be found to be meanest lowest most rapacious of mankind then story of sir peregrine attachment proposed marriage joined a be to various hint of manner in marriage have be broken off lent romance to whole affair added much to lady mason popularity everybody have now heard of everybody be also aware that though idea of marriage have be abandoned there have be no quarrel friendship between family be a close a ever sir peregrine so be understood have pledged to acquittal be felt to be public annoyance that affair of so exciting nature

went so far a to suggest that in case a antediluvian prejudice of british grandmother meaning constitution must be set aside trial must take place in london be not aware that step be taken towards carrying out of so desirable project down at feeling in favour of lady mason be not perhaps so strong a be elsewhere dockwrath be man not much respected nevertheless many believed in down there in

about lady mason coming trial to seemed a though men talked of nothing else at hubble grease be found useless to put figure into hand till must be over indeed be doubted by many whether must ever

client looking also to mean of rebutting evidence have never felt shadow of doubt upon subject yet of have ever said that be guilty aram in discussing with clerk work be necessary that must do in matter have never expressed opinion have chaffanbrass done so in consultation have held with aram a to verdict have very often expressed opinion differing considerably mr aram be strongly of opinion that lady mason must be acquitted resting that opinion mainly on great confidence in power of mr chaffanbrass mr chaffanbrass must shake head sometimes say that thing be not now a used to be may be so in city said mr aram wo find city jury down at alston be not jury aram be judge used to be so be now when man have last word will take trouble to use be everything if be asked what point 'd best like

afternoon in mr furnival chamber with reference to division of labour be to be commenced at alston on day one following thought that might be a well that must say word to other on subject before went there suppose know nothing about panel down there eh said chaffanbrass well have made inquiry think there be anything especial to know nothing that matter if be mr chaffanbrass must have hamworth people on jury for say that prophet be never prophet in own country do know hamworth people oh yes can tell a much a think will matter much who be be not on jury why not if two witness break down be kenneby bolster jury can convict if then jury can acquit let tell aram that be not man put into jury box who can tell whether witness have broken down not from what hear mr chaffanbrass think of can stand chance be if come into hand wo both come into hand said anxious hero of old bailey ah be where be be where will fail mr furnival be great man doubt very great man in way said mr chaffanbrass if let one of two slip through finger thing over know opinion said chaffanbrass think be over if be right in what say that be ready to swear in direct evidence that only signed one deed on day vacillation afterwards must have effect on judge be just possible know that memory might deceive possible must think so will tell what mr chaffanbrass if matter be altogether in hand must have fear literally fear ah be partial aram must be so managed must mr chaffanbrass must be great thing very great thing mr chaffanbrass said that thought must not be managed success safety of client be very great thing in professional point of view very great thing indeed there be matter in legal eye be greater even than professional etiquette required that cross examination of two most important witness must not be left in hand of same barrister then special attribute of kenneby bridget bolster be discussed between be manifest that aram knew with great accuracy character of person with whom have to deal kenneby might be made to say almost anything be taken for granted with there must be very great scope for peculiar skill with mr chaffanbrass be so wonderfully gifted in hand of mr chaffanbrass be not improbable that kenneby might be made to swear that have signed two three four number of document on fourteenth of july although have before sworn that have only signed one mr chaffanbrass indeed might probably make say anything that pleased have kenneby be unsupported case must have be made safe so said mr solomon aram by leaving kenneby in hand of mr chaffanbrass then bridget bolster be supposed to be witness of altogether different class of character to induce to say exactly reverse of intended to say might doubt be within power of man mr aram thought that must be within power of mr chaffanbrass thought however that must a certainly be beyond power of mr furnival when great man lying on sofa mentioned name of mr felix graham mr aram merely smiled question with be must be safest course to make quite sure of kenneby by leaving with chaffanbrass to go for double stake by handing kenneby over to mr furnival leaving task of difficulty to great master when so much depends upon do detest etiquette precedence said aram with enthusiasm in such case mr furnival ought not to think of dear aram said mr chaffanbrass men always think of first if be to go out of usual course do conceive that gentleman on other side must fail to notice will be then be quite indifferent if memory of of two person be doubtful after twenty year may be so mr furnival will discover then on whole be disposed to think that 'd let take man just a please aram be if be satisfied also be not going to have client overthrown know said aram then will take dockwrath also of course know that will have much effect upon case will like to see dockwrath in hand will indeed doubt will be too many for have have have aram might well laugh for when have one shown able to withstand power of mr chaffanbrass say be sharp fellow said mr chaffanbrass well must be off when gentleman at west end get into parliament doe not do to keep waiting let one of fellow get cab then barrister attorney started from bucklersbury for general meeting of force to be held in old square lincoln inn have heard how came to pas felix graham have be induced to become one of legal phalanx be employed on behalf of lady mason be now day since have left noningsby day with have be very busy have never yet undertaken defence of person in criminal court have much to learn perhaps rather fancied that have then that affair of mary snow new lover be not found to arrange altogether easily when came to detail of dealing with different party one wanted from twice a much money a have expected chemist be very willing to have partner then partnership in business be according to view of matter peculiarly expensive luxury snow pere moreover came forward with claim rested on various argument graham found almost impossible to resist at first be immediately subsequent to interview between patron described in preceding chapter graham have be visited by very repulsive attorney who have talked loudly about cruel wrong of ill used client phasis of affair must have be by far preferable one attorney client probably disagreed snow wanted immediate money a immediate money be forthcoming through attorney threw repentant at graham foot took off with twenty shilling penitence want tear thwarted ambition of parental mind be endless poor felix hardly knew where to turn without seeing seemed probable that denizen of court of law in london must be told before long sad tale of mary snow injury then mr thomas wanted money more money than have right to want in accordance with term of mutual agreement have be very much put about said dreadfully put about have have to change servant three time there be knowing trouble mary snow have given have in great measure be forced to sacrifice school poor woman thought be telling truth while making false plaint did not mean to be dishonest be so easy to be dishonest without meaning when one be very poor mary snow made claim on lost lover claim for money for aught besides when parted from on day without kissing mary snow knew that be over not le did graham recognise claim very bonnet must wear when stood before altar with fitzallen must be paid for out of graham pocket that hobby of moulding young lady be perhaps of hobby most expensive to young gentleman can apply in day heard word from noningsby augustus staveley be up in town once twice saw other a may easily be imagined nothing be said between about madeline a augustus have once declared man doe not talk to friend about own sister then hearing nothing a indeed how must have heard anything graham endeavoured to assure that be over hope have ran high at moment when last interview with judge have taken place after to what did amount have never even asked madeline to love have be fool that have made use of opportunity chance have thrown in way have be told that might fairly aspire to hand of lady yet when have really loved girl whom have loved have be close to have not dared to speak to how must now expect that in absence must care for with little trouble around went to work on lady mason case at first felt thoroughly well inclined to give aid in power saw mr furnival on different occasion did much to charm that gentleman by enthusiasm in matter mr furnival must no longer be a enthusiastic a have be skill of lawyer must still give if necessary ardour of loving friend be waxing colder from day to day must not be better if such might be possible that whole affair must be given up to hand of chaffanbrass who must be energetic without belief of graham who be energetic because believed so must say to frequently then must think again of pale face acknowledge that be impossible must go on till end nevertheless if young man must believe must not be well that must bear brunt of battle that fighting of battle without belief be think sorriest task ever fall to lot of man a day grew nigh shadow of unbelief dim passing shade shade must pas then return then pas again flitted also across mind of felix graham theory have be still be that two witness kenneby bolster be suborned by dockwrath to swear falsely have commenced by looking at matter with full confidence in client innocence confidence have come from outer world from social conviction knowledge have of confidence of others then have be necessary for to reconcile story kenneby bolster be prepared to tell with strong confidence must only do so by believing that be false have be thus suborned what if be not false what if be judging wrongfully say that have ceased to believe in lady mason shadow of doubt must occasionally cross mind give to whole affair aspect to be very tragical have reached mr furnival chamber on day few minute before new ally a be seated there discussing matter be now so interesting to blurted out question nearly confounded elder barrister suppose there can really be no doubt a to innocence what be mr furnival to say mr chaffanbrass mr aram have asked no such question mr round have asked no such question when have discussed whole matter confidentially with be sort of question never put to professional men one felix graham must not have asked nevertheless must be answered eh said suppose may take for granted that lady mason be really innocent that be free from falsehood fraud in matter really innocent oh yes presume take for granted a matter of course mr furnival have doubt about have be concerned in matter from beginning therefore have hesitation in asking be exactly reason why must have hesitated at least so mr furnival thought who have doubt none in least said thus lie have be trying to avoid be at last told assurance thus given be very complete a far a word be concerned there be something in tone of mr furnival voice did not quite satisfy felix graham be not that thought that mr furnival have spoken falsely answer have not be made in manner to set own mind at rest why have not mr furnival answered with enthusiasm why have not on behalf of old friend shown something like indignation that such doubt must have be expressed word have be word of assurance considering subject tone have contained assurance thus shadow of doubt flitted backwards forward before graham mind then general meeting of four lawyer be held various arrangement necessary for coming contest be settled such impertinent question be asked then be there communication between of confidential nature mr chaffanbrass solomon aram might whisper together a might also mr furnival felix graham there must be no whispering when four be assembled programme of battle be settled then parted with understanding that be to meet again in court house at alston chapter lxiii evening before trial eve of trial have now come still there have be confidence between mother son word of kindness have be spoken with reference to terrible event be so near at hand lucius have in manner be courteous to mother have at same time be very stern have seemed to make allowance for sorrow never saying to one of soft word love to hear from around when be suffering why must suffer thus have chosen to lean upon must have borne on behalf trouble vexation a to being guilty a to being found guilty by twelve juryman in england such idea ever entered head have said that many people have begun to suspect such suspicion have reached ear what man unless must be dockwrath must whisper to son possibility of mother guilt dockwrath have done more than whisper word of such man must have avail with against mother character on day mr orme have be with lady mason for hour have used eloquence to induce mother even then to divulge secret to son mr orme have suggested that sir peregrine must tell have offered to tell have proposed that lady mason must write to lucius have be of avail lady mason have argued have argued with truth that be too late to tell now with view of obtaining from support during trial if be now told must not recover from first shock of blow in time to appear in court without showing on brow perturbation of spirit terrible grief must reveal secret to one when be over have whispered at last a mr orme continued to press upon absolute necessity that lucius must give up property when be over will do with mr orme be obliged to rest contented have not heart to remind lady mason how probable be that truth might be told out to world during next two three day that verdict of guilty might make further telling unnecessary indeed be not needed that must do so in respect lady mason be fully aware of nature of ground on stood mr orme have sat with whole afternoon only leaving time to be ready for sir peregrine dinner a left promised to be with early on following morning to go with down to court mr aram be also to come to farm for closed carriage have be ordered from inn for occasion wo let prevent be last word spoke a mr orme then left will not wish to do so said mr orme have already given permission never go back from word know have be said in allusion to sir peregrine when mr orme have first proposed to accompany lady mason to court to sit by side during whole trial have be much startled have be startled for time have be very unwilling to accede to step place now proposed to fill be one have intended to fill have intended to stand by innocent injured lady not perpetrator of midnight forgery have intended to support spotless being who must then be wife not woman who for year have lived on proceeds of fraud felony committed by edith have said know that be unwilling to oppose think that in feeling be carrying too far father answered not giving way at showing minded to be turned from purpose by anything might say think so think of misery how must endure by think of guilt edith will leave others to think of father guilt will not stain be not bound to remember what injury might have done to how might still have be ignorant of have not confessed for sake for sake father then sir peregrine gave way when argument be used to be forced to yield be true have not that woman be a generous a be guilty must now have be bound to share shame whole of affair taken together have nearly laid prostrate that have gone farthest towards effecting ruin be feeling that owed so much to lady mason a regarded outer world injury to must have be much more terrible have married men must then have declared that be over with a regard inner man doubt whether must not have borne that better be easier for to sustain injury than favour than favour from one whom judgment compelled to disown a friend have given way be understood at cleeve that mr orme be to remain by lady mason side during trial to general household there be nothing in be wonderful knew only of old friendship to question of guilt be still open question a others have begun to doubt so have one then presumed that sir peregrine mr orme have doubt that be assured of innocence be conviction of hamworth neighbourhood never go back from word know mr orme have said then kissed lady mason went way have never left without kiss have never greeted without warm pressure of hand since day on secret have be told in sir peregrine library must be impossible to describe how great have be worth of affection to lady mason may almost be said that have kept alive have said little about uttering few thanks not le have recognised value of what have be done for have even become more free herself in intercourse with mr orme more open in mode of speech have put more on equality with friend since there have ceased to be anything hidden between previously lady mason have felt have occasionally expressed feeling that be hardly fit to associate on equal term with mr orme now there be none of now a sat together for hour hour spoke argued lived together a though be equal nevertheless must have shown love by great deed there be nothing lady mason must not have done for mr orme be now left alone according to daily custom must remain there till servant told that mr lucius be waiting for in dining room in early part of story have endeavoured to describe how woman sat alone with deep sorrow in heart deep thought on mind when first learned what terrible thing be coming on idea however reader will have conceived of a sat there will have come to from skill of artist not from word of writer if drawing be now near let go back to lady mason be again sitting in same room pleasant room looking out through verandah on to sloping lawn in same chair one hand again rested open on arm of chair while other supported face a leaned upon elbow sorrow be still in heart deep thought in mind line of face be altered spirit expressed by be changed there be le of beauty le of charm le of softness in spite of that have gone through there be more of strength more of power to resist that world must do to her must be wrong to say that be in degree hypocrite man be more hypocrite because manner gait when be alone be different from assumes in company than be for wearing dressing gown in morning whereas put on black coat in evening lady mason in present crisis of life endeavoured to be true in dealing with mr orme nevertheless mr orme have not yet read character a now sat thinking of what morrow must bring upon thinking of that malice of man dockwrath have brought upon resolved that must still struggle on with bold front have be brought home to that son being for whom soul have be imperilled hope for world destroyed that must be told of mother guilt shame let be told then let leave while anguish feeling of shame be hot upon must be still free woman when trial be over must move away at once then let be told still must be well well for sake that mother must not be found guilty by law be still worth while to struggle world be very hard to bruising to very soul at turn allowing hope offering to drop of cool water in thirst still for there be future career that career perhaps need not be blotted by public notice of mother guilt must still fight against foe still show to court to world must then gaze at front on guilt must not seem to have laid hideous defacing hand there be much that be wonderful about woman while be with who regarded with kindness must be so soft womanly then when alone must be so stern hard may be said that felt little pity for though recognised extent of misery did not complain of even in inmost thought plaint be that son must be doomed to suffer so deeply for sin sometimes must utter to other mother word of wailing in that must not be soft to even in did not mean to complain of knew in heart of heart that have right to expect such softness knew that be better that must be a now be have stayed with from morn till evening speaking kind word to how must have failed to tell in sickness may irk because be not allowed to take cool drink must be grateful what man in sens must willingly swallow that by very life must be endangered be thus thought of son what love might have be to yes must still bear up a have borne up at other trial must dress with care go down into court with smooth brow men a looked at must not at once say behold face of guilty woman there be still chance in battle though odds be so tremendously against might be that there be little to must look forward even though verdict of jury must be in favour that regarded a removed from by great interval have promised that lucius must know after trial that must know so that property might be restored to rightful owner be fully resolved that promise must be kept nevertheless there be long interval if must battle through first danger if by skill of lawyer must avert public declaration of guilt might not chance of war still take further turn in favour thus though face be pale with suffering thin with care though have realised fact that nothing short of miracle must save still must hope for miracle absolute bodily labour be forced to endure be so hard upon must dress smooth brow for trial that dressing maintenance of smooth brow must impose upon amount of toil must almost overtask physical strength o reader have ever known what be to rouse go out to world on daily business when inner man have revolted against work when day of rest have seemed to to be worth year of life if must have rested now must have be worth many year of life worth life longed for rest to be able to lay aside terrible fatigue of being ever on watch from burden of necessity have never be free since crime have be first committed have never known true rest have not once trusted to sleep without feeling that first waking thought must be one of horror a remembrance of position came upon in word spoke in trifling action of life be necessary that must ask how word action might tell upon chance of escape have striven to be true honest true honest with exception of one deed that one deed have communicated poison to whole life truth honesty fair unblemished truth open handed fearless honesty have be impossible to before must be true

be not easy one water of jordan in be needful to wash be scalding hot cool neighbouring stream of life pleasant valley will by mean suffice since have be home at orley farm have be very scrupulous a to going down into parlour at breakfast at dinner so that might take meal with son have not a yet omitted on one occasion although sometimes task of sitting through dinner be very severe upon on present occasion last day remained to before trial perhaps last evening on must ever watch sun set from window thought that must spare tell mr lucius said to servant who came to summon must be obliged to if must sit down without tell be not ill must rather not go down to dinner before girl be on stair have changed mind why must now ask for mercy what did matter so gathered up from chair going forth

attendance of own son improper oh of course not did not mean that lucius do not like to have near asked a spoke rose up took hand a stood before gazed for moment into face while tear streamed down from eye then rising from chair threw on to bosom clasped in arm boy boy said oh if must be near away from away from have not intended thus to give way temptation have be too strong for when have seen mr orme peregrine together when have heard peregrine mother with word expressed in joyful tone affect to complain of inroad son made upon have envied that joy oh if must be so with also always thought word too have more than once be spoken now at last in last moment a might be of life at home have come to with kindly voice must not repress yearning lucius said dearest lucius own boy then tear from

outline perhaps too manly for age be mother loved well looked up at raising hand stroked cheek then kissed again again with warm clinging kiss clung to holding close to while sob have so long repressed came forth from with violence terrified then again looked up into face with one long wishful gaze after sank upon sofa hid face within hand have made struggle have be of avail must not tell tale with own voice mother said what doe mean can not understand such grief a for while be quite unable to answer flood gate be at length opened must not restrain torrent of sobbing understand how weak woman can be said at last in truth understood nothing of woman strength sat down by now then taking by hand when must leave to in way endeavoured to comfort comfort may say be out of question by degree again became tranquil will be to morrow a will have will not object to being with also did object must not say so must have much preferred to be only friend near to felt that must not deny solace of woman aid woman countenance oh said if wish must have found impossible to define even to reason for dislike to assistance coming from family of ormes feeling be there strong within bosom

into dark night walking up down on road between house outer gate endeavouring to understand why mother must be so despondent that must fear result of trial thought be certain must not bring to have such fear a to suspicion of guilt such idea have even for one moment cast shadow upon peace of mind chapter lxiv first journey to alston at time sir richard leatherham be solicitor general have be retained a leading counsel for prosecution be quite understood by men who did understand what be going on in world that trial have be in truth instituted by mr mason of groby with hope of recovering property have be left away from by father will whole matter have now be so much discussed that true bearing of be publicly known if on former trial lady mason have sworn falsely then there must be doubt that will codicil to will be untrue document property must in case revert to mr mason after such further legal exercitations on subject a lawyer might find necessary profitable a far a public be concerned a far a mason be concerned be known acknowledged that be struggle on part of groby park family to regain orley farm estate then question have become much more interesting than have be in day of old trial through allegation be now made of lady mason guilt have matter gone against in former trial child must have lost property must have be present issue must be very different must be much more tragical therefore of much deeper interest a alston be so near to london sir richard mr furnival mr chaffanbrass others be able to go up down by train arrangement be at ordinary assize great heartsore to hotel keeper owner of lodging house in alston on occasion town be quite full in spite of facility attorney did not feel safe to run up down in way did witness mr aram remained a did also mr mat round special accommodation have be provided for john kenneby bridget bolster mr mason of groby have lodging of own mr mason of groby have suggested to attorney in bedford row that service a

over again will not stay away said dockwrath secured lodging for about time be good deal with mr dockwrath almost regretted that have not followed that gentleman advice at commencement of trial placed management of whole concern in hand thus alston be quite alive on morning of trial door of court house be thronged long before be opened who be personally concerned in matter whose presence during ceremony must be necessary who have legal connection with matter in hand be of course not driven to tedious manner of obtaining place mr dockwrath for instance did not stand waiting at door did friend mr mason mr dockwrath be great man a far a day be concerned must command admittance from doorkeeper others about court for outer world for men woman who be not lucky enough to be lawyer witness juryman high sheriff there be mean of hearing seeing event of stirring day except what might be obtained by exercise of almost unlimited patience there have be much doubt a to what arrangement for attendance at court might be best for lady mason to make difficulty too a to who must decide a to arrangement mr aram have be down more than once have given hint that must be well that something must be settled have ended in settling with assistance of mr orme what must sir peregrine have said have known that on subject two have be leagued in council together can go from hence in carriage carriage

into hall have thought much of day even of little incident must occur be aware that identification must be necessary nobody must tell to unveil must let be thought that be afraid to face enemy so there sat during whole day bearing gaze of court have dressed with great care may be said of most woman who must be found in such situation that must either give special heed to dress on morning that must appear in garment of sorrow studiously unbecoming lachrymose that must attempt to outface world have appeared there in bright trapping fit for happier day lady mason have dressed after none of fashion never have clothes be better made worn with better grace be black from bonnet ribbon down to boot be put on without attempt at finery smartness a regard dress have never looked better than did now mr furnival when eye caught a turned head round towards judge be startled by grace of appearance face be very pale somewhat hard one on looking at must say that be countenance of woman overcome by sorrow by crime be perfect mistress of herself a looked round court not with defiant gaze with eye half raised look of modest yet conscious intelligence around hardly dared to think that must be guilty a thus looked gaze fell on one face that have not seen for year eye met be face of joseph mason of groby who sat opposite to a looked at own countenance did not quail for moment own countenance

material part of business how must graham be made to earn income what allowance must be made to till did so there be certain sum set apart for madeline fortune must by mean suffice for livelihood of married barrister in london graham doubt earned something a be be done by pen rather than by wig judge be inclined to think that pen must be abandoned before wig must be made profitable such be direction thought took regarding madeline lot in life with next week two with event did not signify much whereas coming year did signify great deal at time on sunday afternoon there still remained to madeline best part of month to think of before felix must reappear upon scene then must not think of by in silence father have desired to tell mother what have passed felt that great difficulty still

be coming down to alston special in lady mason case may a well come stay here lady staveley bid say that will be delighted elder brother will doubt go back to london night so that will not be expected to remain with yours always c what must be intention of judge in taking so strange step a judge have undertaken to see in three month having given faint idea that there then might be chance of hope now before one month be over be actually sending for to house inviting to stay there what must all bar world say when found that young barrister be living at judge house during assize must not be in man mouth that be suitor accepted by judge daughter by judge there must be nothing in to go against grain with if only fact be so that fact must be so must not venture to hope even on hint accepted judge invitation sent grateful thanks to lady staveley a to lady staveley delight be sure that judge must have romanced little for have clearly recognised lady staveley a enemy then prepared for chance of war on evening before trial arrived at noningsby just in time for dinner have be obliged to remain hour two at alston in conference with mr aram be later than have expected must be have be afraid to come early in day lest by doing so might have seemed to overstep margin of invitation when did arrive two lady be already dressing found judge in hall pretty fellow be said judge be dinner time already of course take hour to dress mr aram began felix oh yes mr aram will give fifteen minute not moment more so felix be hurried on up to bedroom old bedroom in have passed so many hour be so very uneasy a entered room conversation with augustus staveley returned upon memory have seen friend in london told that be going down to noningsby augustus have looked grave have said nothing about madeline augustus be not in father confidence in matter have nothing to do to look grave on very morning moreover cause have be given to for gravity of demeanour at door of room met mr baker hurried though be by judge strict injunction must not shake hand with old very worthy friend quite strong again said in answer to tender inquiry so be do declare will say mr graham for wholesomeness of flesh beat anything ever come nigh there be many must have be week week before must have be moved be good nursing mr baker well think did take care of among do remember pheasant mr graham remember must think so how improved occasion yes did improve fast enough sea kale mr graham law row have with john gardener about mr graham do remember how certain friend used to come ask after at door dear dear dear nearly caught about graham in present frame of mind must not well endure to discus remembrance on subject with mr baker so good humouredly pushed out of room saying that judge must be mad if delayed be true too mr graham wo do for to take up mr augustus trick in house yet will then left room what doe mean by 'yet felix said to a went through ceremony of dressing with haste in power be in drawing room almost within fifteen minute there found none judge wife daughter have at first expected to find augustus there have be told by mr baker that be to come down on following morning first greeting from lady staveley be something like that have already received up stair only made in le exuberant language be congratulated on speedy recovery made welcome by kind smile then shook hand with madeline a did so observed that judge be at trouble to turn away so that must not watch greeting did see into madeline face hardly ventured to look touched hand however said word also murmured something about injury now will go to dinner said judge give arm be not broken to lady staveley so meeting be over augustus will be in alston to morrow when court be opened said judge be to say if find possible to get up so soon to day have engagement in town truth however be that judge have chosen to be alone with felix after dinner dinner be very pleasant judge talked for whole party madeline hardly spoke at did lady staveley say much felix managed to put in few word occasionally a always becomes good listener to do brunt of battle lay with host one thing felix observed painfully that not word be spoken about lady mason orley farm when have be last there judge have spoken of openly before whole party expressing opinion that be woman much injured now neither did say anything did lady staveley must probably not have observed have not feeling crept upon during last fortnight that thorough conviction men have felt a to innocence be giving way while lady be there however did not allude to subject when have left room door have be closed behind judge began campaign began a far a be concerned ended in very few minute graham said be glad to see thank judge said of course know know what that amount to now idea be that acted a honest man when be last here be not rich man anything therefore think must have be well have endeavoured to gain daughter affection without speaking to to mother judge staveley always spoke of wife a though be absolute part of have discussed matter now be at liberty to address to madeline if please dear judge of course understand be not answering for oh of course not be look out must fight own battle there what be allowed to understand be that father mother will give consent to engagement if find that can bring to give hers if be minded to ask may do so of course will ask will have five thousand pound on marriage settled upon child a much more when die settled in same way now fill glass in own easy way turned subject round began to talk about late congress at birmingham felix felt that be not open to at present moment to say anything further about madeline though be disappointed at for must have wished to go on talking about evening perhaps be better for judge must have said nothing further to encourage must have gradually be taught to think that chance with madeline be little then le must have be fool reader will say not to have known madeline be now own probably then modest minded young men be fool at last contrived to bring conversation round from birmingham congress to affair of new client indeed contrived to do so in spite of judge who be not particularly anxious to speak on subject after that said did at birmingham be odd must so soon find joined with mr furnival not at odd of course must take up profession a others have taken up before very many young men dream of themis fit for utopia have slept somewhat longer than others dream have be more vivid now wake to find leagued with empson dudley of latter day law court fie graham fie allow to speak in tone of men whom know to be zealous advocate whom know to be dishonest opponent be such a make so many in day feel need of utopia a be in old day of history beg pardon for nicknaming certainly ought not to have done so in presence well if repent will be more charitable for future will not tell of have never yet even seen mr chaffanbrass in court said felix after pause more shame for never to have gone to court in practises barrister intending to succeed at common law bar can not have too wide experience in such matter then fear that be barrister not intending to succeed be very sorry to hear said judge then again conversation flagged for minute two have ever seen at country assize town before judge asked felix whom chaffanbrass remember have coming down in way be quite unusual take rather so must say old bailey be own ground why must think necessary in such case a to have recourse to such proceeding must be for to ask that seeing that be one of counsel do mean to say judge between be unwilling to give opinion on subject well press hard think may fairly say that be unwilling must sooner discus matter with after verdict than before come will go into drawing room there be not much in indeed if be properly looked at there be nothing in nevertheless graham a preceded judge out of dining room felt that heart misgave about lady mason when first matter have be spoken of at noningsby judge staveley have be fully convinced of lady mason innocence have felt reserve in expressing opinion have expressed opinion very openly why must now affect so much reticence seeing that question have be raised in presence of two alone be who have persuaded graham to undertake work now went back from what have done refused even to speak upon subject must be that think be guilty said graham to a lay down night in bed there have be something more for to do before bedtime came followed judge into drawing room in five minute perceived that host have taken up book with honest intention of reading reference be made to by wife showed at once that did not regard graham a company that conceived to be entitled to enjoy full luxury of home upon word know answered without taking eye off page then nobody spoke to word after short interval lady staveley went to sleep when felix graham have before be at noningsby must have rebelled against nature with force rather than have slept while be left to whisper what must to her darling now be authorised to whisper why must not lady staveley sleep if wished did sleep felix be left alone with love illustration drawing room at noningsby yet be not altogether alone must not say to word be now bound to say longed to say in order that might know whether next stage of life be to be light dark there sat judge closely intent doubt upon book wide awake there also sat lady staveley fast asleep certainly with wondrous power of hearing even in sleep yet how be to talk to love unless talked of love wished that judge must help to converse wished that one else be there wished at last that be away madeline sat perfectly tranquil stitching collar upon there be incumbent duty of doing anything beyond be in measure bound to talk have dared to do so also must have taken up book that knew to be impossible brother will be down to morrow said at last yes be to go direct to alston will be here in evening to dinner ah yes suppose will all be late to morrow papa always be late when assize be going on said madeline alston be not very far said felix only two mile answered during whole of long evening conversation between did not reach more interesting pitch than must think utter fool said felix to a sat staring at fire how well brother must have made most of such opportunity then went to bed by mean in good humour with on next morning again met at breakfast on occasion there be possible opportunity for private conversation judge be alive talked enough for whole party during twenty minute be allowed to before started for alston now must be off will say half past seven for dinner dear then also made journey to alston chapter lxvi showing how miss furnival treated lover be great thing for young lady to live in household in free correspondence by letter be permitted two for mamma four for amelia three for fanny one for papa when postman have left budget must be dealt out in way more must be said about except what may choose to say papa letter be about money of course interest nobody mamma contain character of cook invitation to dinner a interest everybody be public property fanny letter amelia must be private well bred mamma of present day scorn even to look at handwriting of address now in harley street thing be so managed that nobody did see handwriting of address of sophia letter till came into own hand be father mother did so that spooner mr ball examined closely be probable enough be well for now for did not wish to be known a yet that have accepted offer from lucius mason did wish to have privilege of receiving letter fancied that loved told over over again that did so compared within own mind to augustus staveley always gave preference to lucius liked augustus also must have accepted a well have be way of world in england for lady to have two accepted lover such be not way of world in england therefore have be under necessity of choosing one have taken better of two declared to herself very often nevertheless be absolutely necessary that other must be abandoned altogether must not be well at rate to wait till trial must be over then young men be in such hurry lucius like honest man have proposed to go at once to mr furnival when be accepted to sophia have objected peculiar position in father stand to mother at present moment said must make very difficult for to give answer now lucius did not quite understand reasoning yielded did not occur to for moment that mr miss furnival must doubt validity of title to orley farm property there be reason why must not write to will address here have asked oh yes said sophia letter be quite private have written very frequently have answered last letter before trial propose to publish together with sophia answer giving a opinion that gentleman production affords by mean good type of lover letter then circumstance be peculiar miss furnival answer be think much better orley farm own sophia only comfort may really say only comfort now be in writing to be odd that at age having begun world early a did must now find so much alone be not for must have friend can not describe to sadness of house wretched state in mother exists sometimes think that have be really guilty of monstrous crime people lay to charge must hardly have be more miserable understand can understand why father have surrounded with lawyer whom must not trust in case of moment to never speaks on subject make matter worse worse for of see at breakfast at dinner sometimes sit with for hour in evening even then have conversation end of be trust soon coming then hope that sun will again be bright in day seems a though there be cloud over whole earth wish with heart that must have be here with think that tone strength of mind must have enabled to bear up against trouble with more fortitude after be shadow of misfortune have come across if must allow so to think a be mr orme be with daily nothing be sure can be more kind can confess to though must do so to one else that willingly see intimacy kept up between mother cleeve why be there that strange proposition a to marriage why when be once made be abandoned know that mother have be not only guiltless guileless in matter a to be accused nevertheless affair will have be so managed that will be almost impossible for to remain in neighbourhood when be over think will sell place what be there to bind to bind to orley farm sometimes have thought must be happy here devoting to agriculture fiddlestick sophia exclaimed a read doing something to lessen dense ignorance of around for such work a man must be able to extend over larger surface than can influence dream of happiness now carry away from to other country to sunny south must be happy there friend of mine whom well knew in germany have villa on lake of como indeed sir will do such thing said sophia to herself there think might forget annoyance will not write again now till trial be over have made up mind will be in court during whole proceeding if mother will admit will remain there close to a son must do in emergency if will not have still will be there one will say that be afraid to see mother in position to fortune can bring have ever doubted innocence god bless own one yours l m taking letter a whole perhaps may say that there be not a much nonsense in a young gentleman generally put into love letter to young lady be inclined to think that must have be better love letter have there be more nonsense at rate there must have be le about more about lady must have omitted agriculture altogether be more sure of loved one taste before suggested sunny south como villa be true that be circumstanced a few lover be with reference to mother still think might have be le lachrymose sophia answer be sent after lapse of day two be a follows harley street dear lucius be not surprised that must feel somewhat low spirited at present moment will find have doubt that result of next week will cure mother will be again when trial be over will then wonder that must ever have have so depressing influence upon upon can not suppose that papa have done best a to adviser know how anxious be about say that be very clever in such matter pray give mother love can not think be lucky to have mr orme with what can be more respectable than connection at time with such people a to future residence make up mind to anything while spirit be thus depressed if like to leave orley farm why not let instead of selling a for if must be fated that lot be to go together be inclined to think must prefer to live in england in london papa position might probably be of service must like life be not active be too early in day to talk thus at present must not think cold hearted if say that what have a yet be between must not be regarded a absolute positive engagement on part hope that may become so heart be not cold be not ashamed to own esteem favourably marriage be very serious thing there be so much to be considered regard a free agent in great measure independent of parent on matter a still think well to make positive promise without consulting when trial be over will speak to father then will come up to london see mind give love to mother if have value in eye accept affectionate friend sophia furnival feel very confident that mr furnival be right in declining to inquire very closely into circumstance of daughter correspondence young lady who must write letter to lover a requires little looking after in point a to may require will if be so minded elude such a miss furnival be care on mother part must think have made better much care might have made worse a have be driven to such resource must have received letter under false name at baker shop round corner last letter be not written throughout without interruption be just declaring how on part hoped that present uncertain tenure of lover hand might at future time become certain when augustus staveley be announced sophia who be alone in drawing room rose from table gracefully slipped note under cover of desk courteously greeted visitor how be at dear noningsby asked illustration how be at noningsby dear noningsby be nearly deserted there be one there mother madeline who more must be wanting to make still dear unless be judge declare mr staveley be quite in love with father when left talk of honey falling from people mouth drop nothing le than champagne pineapple how very difficult of digestion conversation must be by mean if wine be good fruit ripe nothing can be more wholesome be everybody else gone let see mr graham be still there when left came away shortly afterwards a soon be a arm must allow what happy accident be for mr staveley happy breaking three of rib arm collar bone thought very unhappy ah be because character be so deficient in true chivalry call very happy accident give gentleman opportunity of spending six week under same roof with lady of love mr graham be man of spirit be by mean sure that did not break bone on purpose augustus for moment thought of denying imputation with regard to sister before have spoken have changed mind be already aware that friend have be again invited down to noningsby if father chose to encourage graham why must make difficulty have conceived general idea that felix graham be not guest to be welcomed into rich man family a son in law be poor crotchety a regard professional matter unsteady be matter for father to consider not for so held peace a touching graham contrived to change subject veering round towards point of compass have brought into harley street perhaps then miss furnival might answer purpose if be to get run over outside there must get one of pickford van dray from barclay perkins if might be thought serviceable must be of use in world mr staveley very charitable middle aged lady opposite miss mac cody must have into house in time when woke from first swoon must find in best bedroom with one on side of in mean time must send over morning at ten o'clock to inquire after in mamma name bers furnival compliment hope mr staveley will recover use of leg man must bring back word 'the doctor hope may miss left eye be gone for ever be not everybody that can tumble discreetly now fancy must only disfigure then must try what fortune can do for without brewer dray fortune have done quite enough for mr staveley advise to tempt further miss furnival have come to harley street to day on purpose to tempt to utmost there be hand mr staveley pray keep hand for while longer in own possession undoubtedly will do so unless dispose of morning when be at noningsby together ventured to tell felt for did mr staveley if feeling be anything beyond common remember telling then continued without choosing to notice word affected to believe be not in earnest in what said to must excuse if affect to believe same thing of still augustus staveley have come into harley street with positive resolve to throw heart hand fortune at foot of miss furnival fear that will not raise in estimation of reader by saying so then reader will judge unfairly will forget that have have much better opportunity of looking into character of miss furnival than have have will also forget that have have such opportunity of being influenced by personal charm think remarked before miss furnival well understood how best to fight own battle have shown from first anxious to regard a definite offer first word tending way augustus have spoken to must at once have become indifferent about matter a consequence of judicious conduct be not indifferent always want that ca get easily sophia have made difficult to be gotten therefore augustus fancied that wanted since have be in town have be frequently in harley street have be arguing with on matter what match must be more discreet better not only be very handsome be clever also not only be handsome clever moreover be heiress what more must friend want for what more must want for mother did in truth regard a nasty sly girl then mother did not know sophia in such matter mother be so ignorant miss furnival on thus repeating offer again chose to affect belief that be not in earnest be inclined to think that rather liked kind of thing there be excitement in game be one may be played without great danger to party if be played cautiously with skill a regard augustus at present moment have to say with regret that abandoned idea of caution that showed very little skill then said must beg to lay aside affectation be so very injurious to honour to hope of happiness honour mr staveley be quite safe be certain wish that happiness be equally so said at rate will let have answer sophia now stood up looking at with something really like love in eye miss furnival began to understand that if so chose prize be really within reach then be prize be not other thing better prize other thing be better prize if only that affair about orley farm be settled augustus staveley be good looking handsome fellow then there be that in manner gait of lucius mason better suited taste there be lady who prefer worcester ware to real china moreover order for worcester ware have already be given sophia let man be ever so light hearted there will come to moment of absolute almost terrible earnestness even to mr staveley have at rate done nothing to deserve scorn fie now to talk of scorn come here with soft word run easily from tongue feeling sure that will be proud in heart when hear whispered into ear now pretend to be angry because show that be elated do think probable must treat with scorn anything of sort that might say to seriously think be doing so have generally found treated with scorn when have be out on pursuit by heaven have right to speak to so in what way will put word to make sound seriously to do want to kneel at foot a grandfather used to do oh certainly not grandmother be very stupid in desiring that if put hand on heart will believe better not in least then through what formula will go go through formula mr staveley in such affair a very little a take depends on word be uttered when heart have spoken to heart even head to head very little other speaking be absolutely necessary heart have not spoken to yours well not with downright plain open language heart in earnest always know how to use suppose think like sophia love well enough to make wife to morrow yes to be tired of bargain on next day have ever occurred to that giving taking in marriage be very serious thing very serious thing think that on account must be avoided seems to that be always inclined to play at marriage be angry with for life of can never think be in earnest will be angry very angry if get from answer to what have ventured to say what now to day morning if insist upon that answer can only be of one sort if be driven to decide morning on question that have asked great a honour be coming from mr staveley be very great must decline be not able at rate at present moment to trust happiness altogether in hand when think of half written letter at moment miss furnival have within desk be not wonderful then without having said anything more be of note augustus staveley went way a walked up harley street hardly knew whether be to consider a bound to miss furnival did feel quite sure whether wished to be so bound be handsome clever heiress yet be not certain that possessed womanly charm be desirable in wife must not reflect that have never yet said soft word to chapter lxvii mr moulder back opinion a day of trial drew nigh perturbation of poor john kenneby mind became very great moulder have not intended to frighten have thought well to put up to what believed to be truth doubt must be badgered bullied a moulder said to wife afterwards be better that must know what be in store for consequence be that have be by mean possible kenneby must have run away on day before trial be by mean possible for dockwrath have hardly left alone for instant dockwrath at time have crept into sort of employment in case from matthew round have striven in vain to exclude mr round have declared once twice that if mr mason encouraged dockwrath in interfering round must throw matter up professional men can not very well throw up business round went on although dockwrath did interfere although mr mason did encourage on eve of trial went down to alston with kenneby bolster mr moulder at express instance of kenneby accompanied what can do ca stop fellow gab moulder have said kenneby pleaded hard that friend might be near in day of trouble moulder at last consented wish be mr smiley have said when talked matter over in great st helen 'd let barrister know what be what when came to knock about kenneby wished also with heart mr mason went down by same train travelled by first class dockwrath who be now holding head up must have gone with have not thought better to remain with kenneby might

square looking woman somewhat given to flesh now not very quick in movement nature of past life have given to certain amount of readiness absence of dread of fellow creature so terribly afflicted poor kenneby then also be naturally not stupid woman one inclined to be muddle headed perhaps must be too much to say that be generally intelligent what did understand understood thoroughly pretty well thank mr dockwrath sha' be sorry to have bit of something to tea bridget bolster perfectly understood that be to be well fed when thus brought out for work in country service to have everything that wanted to eat drink at place of public entertainment then to have bill paid for behind back be to bridget bolster summit of transitory human bliss will have something to tea said dockwrath what be to

judge be there on bench barrister attorney be collected prisoner be seated in presence trial be begun a be usual in case of much public moment when person of mark be put upon purgation offence be one have attracted notice considerable amount of time be spent in preliminary who be not bound by necessity under court laboured will pas over somewhat rapidly prisoner be arraigned on charge of perjury pleaded not guilty in voice though low be audible to court at moment hum of voice have stayed two small word spoken in clear silver tone reached ear of then be there assembled have surmised to be possible that must at last moment plead guilty such person have not known lady mason then by slow degree jury be sworn considerable number of juror having be set aside at instance of lady mason counsel mr aram have learned to what part of county man belonged upon instruction who came from neighbourhood of hamworth be passed over comparative lightness of offence divested commencement of trial of much of importance apparent dignity attach to most celebrated criminal case prisoner be not bidden to look upon juror juror to look upon prisoner a though battle for life death be to be fought between true bill of perjury have come down to court from grand jury court official must not bring on occasion to open case with solemnity deference to prisoner must have exhibited have be charged with murdering old husband be even same a though have be accused of forgery though forgery be not now capital crime be so within memory there be still certain grandeur in name perjury sound small petty be not therefore till trial have advanced stage two that assumed that importance afterwards never lost that must be so cut mr mason of groby to very soul even mr dockwrath have be unable to make understand that chance of regaining property be under present circumstance much greater than must have be have lady mason be arraigned for forgery must not believe that act of forgery might possibly not have be proved must have be first whipped through street for misdemeanour then hung for felony spirit must not have be more than sufficiently appeased case be opened by one mr steelyard junior counsel for prosecution work on occasion be hardly more than formal merely stated nature of accusation against lady mason issue jury be called upon to try then got up sir richard leatherham solicitor general at great length with wonderful perspicuity explained circumstance of case beginning with undoubted will left by sir joseph mason will independently of codicil coming down gradually to discovery of document in mr dockwrath office led to surmise that signature of two witness have be obtained not to codicil to will to deed of character in doing sir richard did not seem to lean very heavily upon lady mason did say much a to wrong suffered by mr mason of groby when alluded to mr dockwrath part in transaction paid compliment to hamworth attorney in referring to learned friend on other side protested conviction that defence of lady mason must be conducted not only with zeal in spirit of justice truth for gentleman opposite to be so conspicuous in profession be wormwood to joseph mason nevertheless though sir richard be so moderate a to own side so courteous to opposed to made very clear before sat down that if witness be prepared to swear that be instructed must swear must be utterly unworthy of credit fact learned friend opposite be a able to elicit a gentleman who have ever graced english bar else prisoner now on trial must have be guilty of crime of perjury now imputed to of in court now attending to proceeding none listened with greater care to statement made by sir richard than joseph mason lady mason felix graham to joseph mason appeared that counsel be betraying sir richard round be in boat together be determined to throw over yet once again have be possible must have stopped proceeding in spirit spoke to dockwrath to joseph mason must have seemed right that sir richard must begin by holding up lady mason to scorn indignation of twelve honest juryman before mr dockwrath whose intelligence be keener in such matter endeavoured to make patron understand that be wrong in did not succeed if let escape said mason think will be death of to lady mason appeared a though man who be now showing to crowd there assembled chief scene of past life have be present seen everything that have ever done told jury of who have be present in room when true deed have be signed described how old usbech have sat there incapable of action how affair of partnership have be brought to close how two witness have thereupon appended name to deed how witness have be deceived partially deceived a to own signature when called upon to give testimony at former trial told also that comparison of signature on codicil with signature be undoubtedly true must lead expert professional judge of writing to tell that one set of signature other must be forgery then went on to describe how pretended codicil must in truth have be executed speaking of solitary room in bad work have be done of midnight care terrible solicitude for secrecy then with apparent mercy attempted to mitigate iniquity of deed by telling jury that have not be done by lady with view to self aggrandisement have be brought about by lamentable infatuated mad idea that might in way do that justice to child child father have refused to do at instance also when told of spoke of rebekah son mr orme when heard did not dare to raise eye from table lucius mason when have listened to lifted clenched hand on high brought down with loud violence on raised desk in front of know merit of young man said sir richard looking at be told that be gentleman good industrious high spirited wish be not here wish with heart be not here then tear absolute true drop of briny moisture stood in eye of old experienced lawyer lucius when heard for moment covered face be for moment then looked up again turning eye slowly round entire court a did so grasping mother by arm will look in different sort of fashion by to morrow evening guess said dockwrath into neighbour ear during time change came over lady mason face when felt son hand upon arm muscle have moved involuntarily recovered at moment then went on enduring with absolute composure nevertheless seemed to a though man who stood before telling tale so calmly have read secret of very soul what chance must there be for when everything be thus known to word be spoken felix graham gave mind while mr chaffanbrass sat fidgeting reading dreaming caring nothing for that learned brother might say graham listened to fact be stated to surmise be propounded to absolute truth in affair be matter of great moment yet felt that dreaded to know truth must not be better for that must not know yet listened active mind intent on various point a be evolved must not restrain from forming opinion with ear listened a did so mr chaffanbrass amidst dreaming reading fidgeting kept attentive eye upon to be matter of course that lady mason must be guilty have not be guilty mr chaffanbrass must not have be required mr chaffanbrass well understood that defence of injured innocence be part of mission then at last sir richard leatherham brought to close long tale examination of witness be commenced by time be past two o'clock judge went out of court for few minute to refresh with glass of wine sandwich now young peregrine orme in spite of obstacle made way up to mother led also out of court took mother arm lady mason followed with son so made way into small outer room have first entered not word be said between on subject be filling mind of of lucius stood silent absorbed while peregrine offered refreshment to lady lady mason doing a be bid essayed to eat to drink what be to whether ate drank be hungered to maintain by demeanour idea in men mind that might still possibly be innocent be work therefore in order that two young men might still think so ate drank a be bidden on return to court mr steelyard got up to examine dockwrath who be put into box a first witness attorney produced certain document supposed to be of relevancy have found among father in law paper then described how have found that special document gave to understand bolster kenneby have be used a witness to certain signature on th of july have known circumstance of old trial hence suspicion have be aroused acting upon have gone immediately down to mr mason in yorkshire present trial be result of care intelligence be in effect purport of direct evidence then be handed over to tender mercy of other side on other side mr chaffanbrass rose to begin battle mr furnival have already be engaged in sundry of preliminary skirmish have be found necessary before fight have be commenced in earnest therefore turn have now come for mr chaffanbrass however have be arranged beforehand have be agreed that if possible dockwrath must be made to fall into clutch of old bailey barrister be pretty to see meek way in mr chaffanbrass rose to work how gently smiled how fidgeted about few of paper a though be not at first quite master of situation how arranged old wig in modest becoming manner bringing well forward over forehead voice also be low soft so low that be hardly heard through whole court person who have come far to listen to began to feel disappointed be pretty also to see how dockwrath armed for encounter how sharpened teeth a be felt point of own claw little device of mr chaffanbrass did not deceive knew what have to expect pluck be good a be pluck of terrier when mastiff prepares to attack let chaffanbrass do worst must all be over in hour so when mr chaffanbrass have done worst orley farm must still remain believe be tenant of lady mason at one time mr dockwrath asked barrister be turned out if will allow will tell how happened how be angered by usage received mr dockwrath be determined to make clean breast of rather go before tormentor in telling that there be to be told than lag behind a unwilling witness do said mr chaffanbrass will be very kind of when have learned one other little circumstance of same nature think will want to trouble more then mr dockwrath did tell how have lost two field how have thus become very angry how anger have induced at once to do have long thought of doing search namely among paper of old mr usbech with view of ascertaining what might be real truth a regarded that doubtful codicil found what searched for mr dockwrath did said dockwrath without very much delay apparently be two three day over work found exactly what wanted found what expected to find that although paper have be subjected to scrutiny of messrs round crook at time of other trial twenty year ago be sharper than mr chaffanbrass deal sharper so perceive said chaffanbrass now have pushed back wig little eye have begun to glare with ugly red light yes said will be long think before old friend round crook be a sharp a be mr dockwrath upon word agree with mr chaffanbrass yes round crook be baby to mr dockwrath now mr chaffanbrass began to pick at chin with finger a be accustomed to do when warmed to subject baby to have have good deal to do with must say in getting up case have have something to do with very much must have enjoyed society mr dockwrath what wrinkle must have learned from what pleasant oasis must have be in generally somewhat dull course of monotonous though profitable business quite envy round crook having alongside of in inner council chamber know nothing about sir dare say will remember well when 'd turned over father in law paper for three day found what looked for yes did have be tolerably sure that must find before began eh well have expected that something must turn up have doubt did something have turned up that gentleman sitting next to there who be joseph mason esquire of groby park said dockwrath so thought be be to have orley farm if lady mason son must lose in case must be heir exactly must be heir how pleasant must be to to find on such affectionate term with heir when come into inheritance who be to be tenant can tell that dockwrath here paused for moment not that hesitated a to telling whole truth have fully made up mind to do so to brazen matter out declaring that of course be to be considered worthy of reward there be that in manner eye of chaffanbrass stopped for moment enemy immediately took advantage of hesitation come sir said out with if get from will from somebody else have be very plain spoken hitherto let jury think that heart be failing at last there be reason why heart must fail said dockwrath in angry tone be there not must differ from there mr dockwrath heart of man placed in such position a that now hold must think fail never mind that who be to be tenant of orley farm when client have be deprived of be just so be turned out from two field when young mason came home from germany be immediately went to work discovered document did put up joseph mason to trial told opinion exactly if result be successful be to be put in possession of land will become mr mason tenant at orley farm yes will become mr mason tenant at orley farm upon word mr dockwrath have made work to day uncommonly easy for uncommonly easy know have anything else to ask then mr chaffanbrass a sat down looked up to jury with expression of countenance be in worth fee must be paid to for day work face spoke a plain a face must speak what face said be after gentleman of jury very little more can be necessary now see motif of opponent way in motif have be allowed to act who be altogether upon square in what be doing desire nothing more than that mr chaffanbrass said by look shrug gesture much more eloquently than must have done by use of word mr dockwrath a left box went back to seat in doing have to cross table in middle of court endeavoured to look move a though be right with knew that eye of court be on especially eye of judge jury knew also how men mind be unconsciously swayed by small appearance endeavoured therefore to seem indifferent in doing so swaggered be conscious that swaggered felt a gained seat that mr chaffanbrass have be too much for then one mr torrington from london be examined by sir richard leatherham proved apparently beyond doubt that certain deed produced be genuine that deed bore same date a codicil be now questioned have be executed at orley farm by old sir joseph bore signature of john kenneby bridget bolster a witness sir richard holding deed in hand explained to jury that did not at present stage of proceeding ask to take a proved that name be true signature of two person indicated must think not said mr furnival in loud voice asked to satisfy that document a now existing purported to bear two signature must be for to judge when evidence brought before must be complete whether deed be true document then deed be handed up into jury box twelve juryman examined statement made by mr torrington be very simple have become business to know circumstance of late partnership between mason martock circumstance explained then sir richard handed over to be cross examined be now graham turn to begin work a rose to do so mind misgave not syllable that torrington have said appeared to to be unworthy of belief man have not uttered word of truth of graham did not feel positively assured more than that man have clearly told be within to tell that be well that jury must hear in order that might thereby be assisted in coming to true decision have be hinted in hearing by chaffanbrass aram that man be probably in league with dockwrath aram have declared with sneer that be puzzle pated old fellow might be puzzle pated have already shown that be bashful unhappy in present position have shown also a graham thought that be anxious to tell truth moreover graham have listened with mind to cross examination of dockwrath be filled with disgust with disgust not so much at part played by attorney a at played by barrister a graham regarded matter have iniquity greed of dockwrath to do with have reason be shown why statement made by dockwrath be in unworthy of belief that statement be in own essence weak then character of man making might fairly affect credibility presuming statement to be wrong presuming that be corroborated by other evidence how must be affected by amount of villainy on part of dockwrath that chaffanbrass have done attempted be to prove that dockwrath have have own end to serve who have ever doubted not word have be said not spark of evidence elicited to show that man have used falsehood to further view of of mind of felix graham have be full now a rose to take own share of work wit be at work rather in opposition to lady mason than on behalf torrington be little old man graham have watched how hand have trembled when sir richard first addressed sir richard have be very kind a be natural to own witness old man have gradually regained courage now a turned face round to side where knew that might expect to find enemy tremor again came upon stick held in hand be heard a tapped gently against side of witness box graham a rose to work saw that mr chaffanbrass have fixed eye upon courage rose higher within a felt gaze of man whom so much disliked be within compass of heart to bully old man because one a chaffanbrass desired of by heaven no first asked mr torrington age having be told that be over seventy graham went on to assure that nothing must be avoided must be said to disturb comfort now mr torrington asked will tell whether be friend of mr dockwrath have have acquaintance with previous to affair of trial question repeated in various form always in mild voice without appearance of disbelief in answer be given to question torrington answered by plain negative have never seen dockwrath till attorney have come to on matter of partnership deed have never eaten drunk with have there ever be between conversation of confidential nature will do mr torrington said graham a sat down again turned round looked mr chaffanbrass full in face after nothing further of interest be done day few unimportant witness be examined on legal point then court be adjourned chapter lxix two judge felix graham a left alston court house on close of first day of trial be not in happy state of mind did not actually accuse of having omitted duty owed to client did accuse of having undertaken duty for felt to be manifestly unfit must not have be better a said to for poor lady to have have other possible advocate than then a passed out in company of mr furnival mr chaffanbrass latter looked at with scorn did not know how to return in heart must do so must word be spoken between on subject must be well able willing enough to defend have attempted to bandy look with mr chaffanbrass must have seemed even to that be proclaiming resolution to put in opposition to colleague felt a though be engaged to fight battle in truth justice nay heaven must be against how can man put heart to proof of assertion in truth of have belief that though guilty lady must be treated with utmost mercy compatible with law for so much have guilt stood forward a acknowledged must have pleaded with eloquence be in must still pity sympathise with fight for on such ground a be possible that believing to be false must stand up before crowd assembled in court use such intellect a god have given in making others think that false guilty one be true innocent that accuser be false guilty whom knew to be true innocent have be arranged that baron maltby must stay that night at brother judge therefore occupied noningsby carriage together graham be driven back in dog cart by augustus staveley well old boy said augustus did not soil conscience much by bullying that fellow did not said graham then be silent chaffanbrass made uncommonly ugly show of hamworth attorney said augustus after pause to graham at first made answer if be on jury continued other must not believe single word came from that fellow mouth unless be fully supported by other testimony will jury believe tell what staveley said graham will oblige greatly in matter if will not speak to of trial till be over beg pardon do that nothing can be more natural than that must discus together in bearing there be reason will explain to afterwards why must rather not do so all right said augustus will not say word for part will get through work a well a may then sat silent in gig till came to corner of noningsby wall be that other subject tabooed also said augustus what other subject that a to said something when be last here touching sister madeline graham felt that face be on fire did not know how to answer in be for to decide whether there must be silence between said at last certainly wish that there must be secret between said augustus then there will be none be intention to make offer to before leave noningsby can assure for satisfaction that hope run very high for satisfaction felix know why must suppose to be anxious that must fail a so spoke stopped horse at hall door there be time for further speech papa have be home quarter of hour said madeline meeting in hall yes have pull of by having carriage ready said brother have to wait for ostler say that if be not ready in ten minute will go to dinner without mamma be dressed a spoke turned round with smile to felix making feel that father be treating a though be one of family ten minute will be quite enough for said if governor only must sit down said augustus must be all right be just what wo do mad do send somebody to help to unpack then bustled away so that pair of judge might not be kept waiting for food felix graham hurried up stair three step at time a though future success at noningsby depended on being down in drawing room within period of minute stipulated by judge a dressed with utmost rapidity thinking perhaps not so much a must have done of appearance in eye of lady love endeavoured to come to resolve a to task be before how be to find opportunity of speaking mind to madeline if during short period of sojourn at noningsby left house morning directly after breakfast returned to in evening only just in time for dinner when entered drawing room judge be there a be also lady staveley madeline augustus alone be wanting ring bell graham judge said a felix took place on corner of rug augustus will be down about supper time then bell be rung dinner ordered papa ought to remember said madeline that got carriage first at alston heard wheel of gig said judge be just two minute after think augustus take longer than other young men said lady staveley look at graham there ca be supposed to have use of limb for broke dozen of month ago yet be ready brother maltby give arm to lady staveley graham if will take madeline will follow alone did not call miss staveley a felix specially remarked so remarking pressed little hand somewhat closer to side be first sign of love have ever given feared that mark of anger might follow there be return to pressure not slightest answer be made with sweet finger point there be anger be arm quite strong again asked a sat down a soon a judge short grace have be uttered fifteen minute to second said augustus bustling into room think that unfair advantage have be taken of what can juvenile barrister expect in presence of two judge then dinner went on very pleasant little dinner party be not word be said either then during evening on following morning on subject be engrossing so much of mind of of not word be spoken a to trial be now pending be name of lady mason mentioned be understood even by madeline that allusion must with propriety be made to in presence of judge before whom cause be now pending ground be considered too sacred for foot to tread upon be not that feeling be so general english judge english counsellor must almost be forced to subject in such case to close custody juryman be called upon to endure a rule good taste good feeling be a potent a lock wall do know mr graham said madeline in sort of whisper dinner table allows that mr baker say have cut since got well cut one of very best friend how can say anything so untrue if knew where lived 'd go pay visit after dinner think need do though have very snug little room of own be in on christmas day when have snapdragon when marion carried away dish remember be base enough to say have cut did see for moment yesterday then spoke to ah must have have long chat with expects to go back over old ground how be brought in helpless how doctor came to how took mess prepared for like good boy be afraid mr graham understand old woman young one be on tongue to say did not say when be young man said baron carrying on conversation have be general at table never have opportunity of breaking rib out hunting perhaps if have said augustus might have used with more effect than friend here have deprived age of one of brightest light bench of one of most splendid ornament hear hear hear said father augustus be coming out in new character said mother be heartily obliged to said baron a be saying before sort of thing never came in way if remember right father must have thought be mad have talked of going out hunting did hunt staveley when lady be gone four lawyer talked about law though kept quite clear of special trial be going on at alston judge staveley a know have be at birmingham congress not so brother baron baron maltby indeed thought little of birmingham doings be inclined to be little hard upon brother in have taken part in think that matter be one open to discussion said host well hope so said graham at rate have heard argument ought to make feel that mouth be closed argument on matter be worth nothing at said baron man with what be called logical turn of mind may prove anything disprove anything never convinces anybody on matter be near to man heart be convinced by tenour of own thought a go on living not by argument of logician even by eloquence of orator talker be apt to think that if listener can not answer be bound to give way non talker generally take very different view of subject doe go to show that question must not be ventilated asked felix mean to be uncivil said baron of word in language there be none dislike so much a word ventilation man given to ventilating subject be worse than man who have mission bore of sort however said graham will show from time to time be not easily put down one will have mission to reform court of law will do too only hope may not be in time said baron ca go quite so far a said other judge doubt have same feeling more le know pretty well what friend graham be driving at in heart agree with said graham if must carry men head with must do more good than heart said judge then a wine bottle be stationary subject be cut short went into drawing room graham have opportunity that evening of telling tale to madeline party be too large for such tale telling else not large enough then evening in drawing room be over before have seemed to begin while be yet hoping that there might be turn in favour lady staveley wished good night madeline of course did same a again pressed hand must not think how little have said to since have be in house yet seemed to a though little have made more intimate with than have ever found before have made attempt to separate from company by proposing to go call on mr baker in own quarter madeline have declared to be too late for such expedition explaining that when mr baker have patient on hand be accustomed to go early to bed in present instance however have be wrong for when felix reached door of own room mr baker be coming out of be just looking if everything be right said seems natural to to come look after know be quite a natural to to be looked after be though worst of gentleman when get well be that one have done with go away then there be more about always begrudge to see get well for reason when have man in power like to keep there be always way with woman know hope will see one of tying by leg altogether before long know anything about said felix sheepishly well if suppose nobody nevertheless did hear little bird say eh mr graham little bird be biggest liar in world be now well perhaps be how do think miss madeline be looking be just well for one short time after went away have be ill well not ill not so that came into hand be looking again now be be looking a always doe uncommonly well do remember how used to come say word to standing at door dear heart will be bound now care more for than do do said graham of course do then how angry ladyship be with a though be fault did do did mr graham lord love what be use of being angry lady ought to have remembered own young day for be just same thing with have own way so will miss madeline then with further inquiry a to fire towel sheet mr baker took off felix graham have felt repugnance to taking gossiping old woman openly into confidence yet have almost asked whether might in truth count upon madeline love such at rate have be tenour of gossiping nevertheless be by mean certified have judge assurance in allowing to be there have assurance given to by augustus in few word spoken to at door that evening ought to have known that have received sufficient assurance from madeline in truth knew nothing of kind there be men who be much too forward in believing that be regarded with favour there be others of whom may be said that be a much too backward world hears most of former talk of most doubt whether latter be not more numerous next morning of course there be hurry fuss at breakfast in order that might get off in time for court judge be to take seat at ten therefore be necessary that must sit down to breakfast time before nine achievement doe not seem to be one of great difficulty nevertheless left time for lovemaking for one instant felix be able to catch madeline alone in breakfast parlour miss staveley said will be possible must speak to alone evening for five minute speak to alone said repeating word a did so be conscious that whole face have become suffused with colour be too much to ask then if leave dining room soon after have done so mamma will be there know said then others came into room be able to make further stipulation for evening madeline when be left alone that morning be by mean satisfied with own behaviour accused herself of having be unnecessarily cold to knew permission have be accorded to knew also knew well what answer must be given to request in mind matter be now fixed have confessed to herself that loved must not now doubt of love to why then must have answered with coldness doubt hated missishness of young lady have resolved that when asked plain question must give plain answer be true that question have not be asked a yet why must have left in doubt a to kindly feeling will be for one day said to

still with veil up though who have be assembled there during day turned eye upon a passed out bore without quailing be not that returned gaze affected effrontery in conduct be able to endure without showing that suffered a did so carriage be there now said mr aram who have left court for minute think may get into quietly accordingly did making way through avenue of idler who still remained that might look upon lady who be accused of having forged husband will illustration lady mason leaving court will stay with to night whispered mr orme to son a passed through court do mean that will not

have never occurred to a possible that must have done thing with be charged have hated joseph mason for suspecting have hated dockwrath for presumed falsehood in pretending to suspect what be to think of question now after hearing clear dispassionate statement of circumstance by solicitor general hitherto have understood none of particular of case now nature of accusation have be made plain be evident to that at rate that far sighted lawyer believed in truth of own statement must be possible that lady mason have forged will that deed have be done by mother friend by woman who have so nearly become lady orme of cleeve idea be terrible to a rode home yet must not rid of if be so be also possible that grandfather suspected have that marriage be stopped by such suspicion a be have broken old man down robbed of spirit that mother must not have such suspicion seemed to to be made clear by fact that still treated lady mason a friend then why have be specially enjoined not to speak to grandfather a to detail of trial be impossible for to meet sir peregrine without speaking of trial when entered house did by back entrance from stable found grandfather standing at own room door have heard sound of horse be unable to restrain anxiety to learn well said sir peregrine what have happened be not over a yet will last say for three day come in peregrine shut door anxious rather that

little sir sir peregrine again sat down in arm chair a though work of conversation be too much for neither did dare to speak openly on subject yet there be so much that be anxious to know do think will escape be question longed to ask did not dare to utter then after while dined together peregrine determined to talk of other thing be in vain while servant be in room nothing be said meat be carved plate be handed round young orme ate dinner there be constraint upon be quite unable to dispel at last gave up sat in silence till be alone when door be closed be opposite to other over fire in way be custom when two only be there sir peregrine must restrain desire no longer must be that grandson who have heard have passed in court that day must have formed opinion of what be going on must have idea a to chance of battle be being fought sir peregrine must not have gone into court must have be impossible for to show there there have be heart day how have gone with woman whom few week ago have loved so well that have regarded a wife be mother very tired said again endeavouring to draw near subject did looked fagged while sitting in court be dreadful task for very dreadful nothing must have turned from said peregrine be right there nothing must have turned from thought to be duty to poor lady lady mason bore better say think bear very well considering what position be yes yes be very dreadful solicitor general when opened be very severe upon think wished to be severe made very strong against story a told be very strong against be know must be if be to believe that stated yes yes of course only stated what have be told by others must not see how jury took did not look at be thinking more of of lucius lucius be there yes sat next to sir richard said while be telling story that wished son be not there to hear upon word sir almost wished so too poor fellow poor fellow must have be better for to stay away yet have be mother mother perry must not have be mother must not have be so placed if be lady mason misfortune not fault ah well will not talk about there will be two day more say so said aram attorney god help may god help must be very dreadful for man for woman burden be insupportable then sat silent for while during peregrine be engrossed in thinking how must turn grandfather from conversation heard one express opinion asked sir peregrine after pause mean about lady mason peregrine began to perceive that mother be right that must have be well if possible to avoid word about trial do think that will will be acquitted of course people there be talking about yes sir be talking about really know a to opinion see chief witness have not be examined perry what do think sir well be altogether on side till heard sir richard leatherham then then did not know what to think suppose be all right one never can understand what lawyer be at when mr chaffanbrass got up to examine dockwrath seemed to be just a confident on side a other fellow have be on other side think will have more wine sir thank sir peregrine did not move sat in old accustomed way nursing one leg over knee of other thinking of manner in have fallen at foot confessed have married gone with proudly into court a must have done have then heard verdict of guilty given by jury nay have heard such proof of guilt a must have convinced must have killed felt a sat there safe over own fireside that safety be due to generosity have that other calamity fallen upon must not have survived head must have fallen low before eye of who have known since have known anything must never have be raised again in own spirit in inner life blow have come to be due to effort on behalf that have not be stricken in public when have discussed matter with mr orme have seemed in measure to forget have not at rate be thought rested with greatest weight upon mind then have considered how whose life have be stainless a driven snow must bear in presence of such deep guilt now now a sat alone thought only of lady mason let be ever so guilty guilt have be very terrible have behaved very nobly to from at least have right to sympathy what chance be there that must escape of absolute escape there be chance whatever even must jury acquit must declare guilt to world must declare to son by taking step for restoration of property a to sir peregrine felt doubt that joseph mason of groby must recover right to orley farm be to certainty how terrible must be path over must walk before deed of retribution must be done ah ah said a thought of speaking to a though be unconscious of grandson presence poor woman poor woman then peregrine felt sure that have be guilty be sure also that grandfather be aware of will come into other room sir said yes yes if like then one leg fell from other rose to do grandson bidding to now henceforward one room be much same a in mean time party bound for orley farm have reached that place to also came necessity of wearing through tedious evening on mind of lucius mason not even yet have shadow of suspicion fallen to in spite of mother be still pure yet be stern to manner be very harsh may be have such suspicion crossed mind must have be le stern manner more tender a be must understand nothing be going on almost felt that be kept in dark at mother instance why be that man respected by world such a sir richard leatherham must rise in court tell such tale a against mother that power of answering tale on mother behalf must be left to such man a mr chaffanbrass sir richard have told story plainly with terrible force whereas chaffanbrass have contented with brow beating lawyer with lowest quirk of cunning why have not one be in court able to use language of passionate truth ready to thrust lie down throat of who told tea supper have be prepared for sat down together nature of meal may be imagined lady mason have striven with terrible effort to support during day even yet did not give way be quite a necessary that must restrain before son a before others who have gazed at in court did sustain took knife fork in hand ate few morsel drank cup of tea remembering that there in house be still hostess made slight effort to welcome guest surely after such day of trouble will eat something said to friend to mr orme be marvellous that woman must even be alive let alone that must speak perform ordinary function of daily life now said lady mason said a soon a ceremony be over now a be so tired think will go up stair will light candle for lucius so candle be lit two lady went up stair second bed have be prepared in lady mason room into chamber went at once mr orme a soon a have entered turned round held out hand in order that might comfort lady mason by taking hers lady mason when have closed door stood for moment with face towards wall not knowing how to bear be for moment then slowly moving round with two hand clasped together sank on knee at mr orme foot hid face in skirt of mr orme dress friend friend said lady mason yes be friend indeed be dear lady mason endeavoured to think of word by might implore to rise compose how be can bear with one a be how be that hate for guilt doe not hate when be guilty know sometimes think that will hate here hereafter except lucius will hate how will bear that oh mr orme wish knew wish did will know now to night if will allow to tell must kill to bear look wish knew be away so that might never look at again too must forgive if knew forgive how can forgive a spoke rose again to foot old manner came upon do think what be have done for mother for only child after be possible that must forgive meant harm have ruined before world be a proud a boy must bear to think that whole life must be disgraced by mother crime have be so unfortunate must have forgiven be speaking of what be impossible must not have be so youth be different from mine god have be very good to not placed temptation in way temptation mean to great fault little fault require repentance a much a great one then repentance be easy at rate be possible oh lady mason be not possible for will not talk of now will not hear compare with one a be do know be thinking to day that mind must fail must be mad before be over how can bear how can bear rising from seat walked rapidly through room holding back hair from brow with hand illustration how can bear how be to bear load on back be too much for shoulder burden with have laden herself be too heavy to be borne power of endurance be very great strength in supporting extreme bitterness of intense sorrow be wonderful now be taxed beyond power how be to bear said again a still holding hair between finger drew hand back over head know have not tried be impossible said in wildness a mr orme endeavoured to teach only source from whence consolation might be have believe in thief on cross unless be that have prepared for day by year of contrition know shock added after while know that what say will be dreadful to innocence will always be shocked by guilt go go leave have gone so far now that be of use then threw on bed burst into convulsive passion of tear once again mr orme endeavoured to obtain permission from to undertake embassy to son have lady mason acceded be near acceding mr orme courage must probably have be greatly checked a be pressed a though task be one to be performed without difficulty mr orme be very anxious that lucius must not sit in court throughout trial felt that if did so shock shock be inevitable must fall upon there than must conceive nothing more terrible then also believed that if secret be once made known to lucius if be for time removed from mother side poor woman might be brought to calmer perception of true position strain must be lessened must no longer feel necessity of exerting so terrible control over feeling have acknowledged that must know sooner later pleaded mr orme be not time not now during trial have known before must keep away from court yes must never see again what will do when hears perhaps must be better that must go without seeing must not do that must be better if take to prison will never see again eye must kill do ever watch see pride that there be in eye have never yet known what disgrace mean now mother have brought to be in vain a far a night be concerned lady mason must give such permission mr orme did exact from kind of promise that lucius must be told on next evening if then appeared from what mr aram must say that result of trial be likely to be against lucius mason spent evening alone though have a yet heard none of truth mind be not at ease be happy at heart though have idea of mother guilt did conceive after trial must be impossible that must remain at orley farm mother intended marriage with sir peregrine then manner in engagement have be broken off course of trial celebrity enmity of dockwrath lastly own inability to place on term of friendship with people who be still mother nearest friend made feel that in event must be well for to change residence what must life do for there at orley farm after have passed have gone to liverpool bought guano now sack be lying in barn unopened have begun to drain ugly unfinished line of earth be lying across field have further interest in felt that must no longer go to work on ground a though be in truth master then a thought of future hope place of residence coming life there be one other beyond mother to whom mind reverted what must sophia wish that must do own sophia who have promised that heart must be with through trouble of trial before went to bed night wrote to sophia told what be trouble what hope will be over in two day more said then will come to will see trust day after letter reach nevertheless can not debar from satisfaction of writing be not happy for be dissatisfied with what be doing for mother be only when think of assurance of love can feel anything like content be not pleasant thing to sit by hear one mother charged with foulest fraud practised villain can conceive yet have have to bear have heard denial of charge in true honest language to day when solicitor general be heaping falsehood on name must hardly refrain from rushing at throat let have line of comfort from then will be with on friday that line of comfort never came did lucius on friday make intended visit miss furnival have determined day two before that must not write to lucius again till trial be over even then might be question whether correspondence with heir of noningsby must not be more to taste chapter lxxi showing how john kenneby bridget bolster bore in court on next morning be in place at ten o'clock crowd have be gathered outside door of court from much earlier hour a trial progressed interest in increased a people began to believe that lady mason have in truth forged will so did more regard in light of heroine have murdered husband after forging will men must have paid crown apiece to have touched garment guinea for privilege of shaking hand with lady mason have again taken seat with veil raised with mr orme on one side of son on other counsel be again ranged on seat behind mr furnival sitting nearest to judge mr aram again occupied intermediate bench so placing that must communicate with client with barrister be now established place great a be crowd found difficulty in reaching easy way be always made for chief performer in play be to be great day a regarded evidence be case depends altogether on evidence one young lawyer said to if counsel know how to handle witness must say be safe importance of handling be felt by one therefore be understood that real game must be played out on middle day have be very well for chaffanbrass to bully dockwrath make wretched attorney miserable for hour so must have little bearing on verdict there be two person there who be prepared to swear that on certain day have only signed one deed so much solicitor general have told nobody doubted that must be so question now be must mr furnival mr chaffanbrass succeed in making contradict when have so sworn must be made to say that have signed two deed that might have done so be again duty of mr furnival to come first upon stage be to say be to do so a soon a sir richard have performed very second rate part of eliciting evidence in chief poor john kenneby be to be first victim be placed in box before very soon after judge have taken seat why have not emigrated to australia escaped escaped mr smiley also be john kenneby reflection a slowly mounted two step up into place of torture near to same spot near also to dockwrath who have taken two witness under special charge sat bridget bolster have made very comfortable that morning with buttered toast sausage when at dockwrath instance kenneby have submitted to slight infusion of dutch courage bottle of brandy must not have sufficed for purpose bridget also have not refused generous glass not that want said meaning thereby to express opinion that must hold own even against great chaffanbrass without such extraneous aid now sat quite quiet with hand crossed on knee before eye immovably fixed on table stood in centre of court in position remained till turn came one may say that there be need for fear on account of bridget bolster then sir richard began what must be nature of kenneby direct evidence reader pretty well know sir richard took long time in extracting for be aware that must be necessary to give witness confidence before came to main question even to do be difficult for kenneby must speak in voice so low that nobody must hear on second occasion of judge enjoining to speak out nearly fainted be odd that never occurs to judge that witness who be naturally timid will be made more so by being scolded when hear judge thus use authority always wish have power of forcing to very uncongenial employment jumping in sack let say then when jumped poorly a certainly must must crack whip bid go higher higher more so bade more must limp world looking on must pity execrate be much same thing when witness be sternly told to speak louder john kenneby at last told plain story remembered day on have met old usbech bridget bolster lady mason in sir joseph chamber have then witnessed signature by sir joseph have only witnessed one on day of that be perfectly certain did not think that old usbech have signed deed in question on matter declined to swear positively remembered former trial have not then be able to swear positively whether usbech have have not signed deed a far a must remember be point to cross examination on occasion have chiefly be directed so much john kenneby did at last say in language be sufficiently plain then mr furnival arose reader be acquainted with state of mind on subject of trial enthusiasm on behalf of lady mason have be aroused by belief in innocence by old friendship by ancient adherence to cause by admiration for beauty have now greatly faded have faded much when found obliged to call in such fellow labourer a chaffanbrass aram have perished when learned from contact with to regard guilt a certain nevertheless now that be there old fire returned to have wished twenty time that have be able to shake matter from leave old client in hand of new adviser must be better for have said to on day on three day seeing that have not shaken matter off rose to work a though still loved a though mind be still intent on preserving ill gotten inheritance for son may almost be doubted whether at moment during three day did not again persuade that be injured woman aram a may be remembered have felt misgiving a to mr furnival power for such cross examination chaffanbrass have never doubted knew that mr furnival must do a much a in way difference being mr furnival must do something else besides now mr kenneby will ask few question said kenneby turned round to barrister spoke in mild low voice eye transfixed poor fellow at once though kenneby be told dozen time to look at jury speak to jury never be able to take gaze away from mr furnival face remember old trial said a spoke held in hand what be known to be account of transaction then there arose debate between sir richard in chaffanbrass graham mr steelyard took part a to whether kenneby might be examined a to former examination on point graham pleaded very volubly bringing up precedent without number striving to do duty to client on point with own conscience did not interfere at last be ruled by judge that examination might go on whereupon sir richard mr steelyard sat down a though be perfectly satisfied kenneby on being again asked said that did remember old trial be necessary know that jury must hear if look at speak to must stand better chance kenneby for moment allowed eye to travel up to jury box instantly fell again fixed on lawyer face do remember that trial yes sir remember whispered kenneby do remember asking then whether have be in habit of witnessing sir joseph mason signature did ask that sir be question put to do remember doing so dare say did sir did will now read answer will give to jury copy of proceeding of trial lord when have proved a of course intend to do then there be little battle between barrister a lady mason be now being tried for perjury alleged to have be committed at other trial be of course indispensable that proceeding of trial must be made known to jury said on occasion continued furnival that be sure have witnessed three signature of sir joseph summer that have probably witnessed three in july that be quite sure have witnessed three in one week in july that be nearly sure have witnessed three in one day that must not tell what day might have be that have be used a witness so often that really did not remember anything about can say whether be purport of evidence gave then if be down there said john kenneby then stopped be down here have read suppose be right said kenneby must trouble to speak out said judge can not hear be impossible that jury must do so judge word be not uncivil voice be harsh only perceptible consequence of remonstrance be to be seen in thick drop of perspiration standing on john kenneby brow be evidence gave on former trial may jury presume that then spoke truth to best of knowledge tried to speak truth sir tried to speak truth do mean to say that failed think failed when therefore told jury that be nearly sure that have witnessed three signature of sir joseph in one day be truth think ever did ever did what witness three paper in one day think ever did might have done to be sure then at trial about twelve month after man death be nearly sure have done so be so told jury then did sir then did what did witness paper think then now that be probable witnessed three signature on same day think that then what do think be so long ago sir that really know exactly be so long ago that can not depend on memory suppose ca sir just now told gentleman who examined on other side that be quite sure did not witness two deed on day named th of july now seeing that doubt own memory going back over so long time do wish to correct statement suppose do what correction do wish to make think did think did what think signed two really can not hear witness said judge must speak out louder said mr furnival speaking very loudly mean to do a well a can said kenneby believe do said furnival in so meaning must be very careful to state nothing a certainty of certainty of be not sure be certain that on day did not witness two deed think so yet be not certain twenty year ago when fact be so much nearer to remember remember whether be certain twelve month after occurrence think be certain now mean think signed two be then only matter of thinking only matter of thinking might have signed two certainly might have done so what mean to tell jury be that have remembrance of signing twice on special day although know that have acted a witness on behalf of sir joseph mason more than twice on same day yes be intended purport of evidence yes sir then mr furnival travelled off to other point of mr usbech presence alleged handwriting on matter kenneby have not made positive assertion though have expressed very strong opinion mr furnival be not satisfied with wished to show that kenneby have not on matter even strong opinion again reverted to evidence on former trial read various question with answer answer a given at time certainly did not when so taken express clear opinion on part of person who gave although impartial person on reading whole evidence must have found that very clear opinion be expressed when first asked kenneby have said that be nearly sure that mr usbech have not signed document very anxiety to be true have brought into trouble mr furnival on occasion have taken advantage of word nearly have at last succeeded in making say that be not sure at evidence by mean of torture thumbscrew suchlike have for many year past abandoned a barbarous have acknowledged that be of very nature useless in search after truth how long will be before will recognise that other kind of torture be equally opposed to truth civilization mr usbech be certainly in room on day continued mr furnival yes be there knew what be doing suppose yes suppose knew presume be who explained to nature of deed be to witness dare say did a be lawyer must be natural suppose must remember nature of special deed a explained to on day when bridget bolster be in room might have be will yes might did sign one two will for sir joseph think a to individual document mr usbech might have signed in presence for anything know to contrary might have done so now on oath kenneby be memory strong enough to enable to give jury information on subject upon may firmly rely in convicting unfortunate lady of terrible crime laid to charge then for moment kenneby glanced round fixed eye upon lady mason face think moment before answer deal with a must wish must deal with if be so situated can say that remember that usbech did not sign well sir think did might have done so oh yes might remember that did do so certainly not be about extent of what mean to say yes sir let understand said judge then perspiration became more visible on poor kenneby face do mean to say that have memory on matter that simply remember whether usbech did did not sign think signed why do think did not seeing that name be there did see do mean continued judge that did see that remember that saw remember that saw may have done so may have signed may have seen do so only remember yes lord then kenneby be allowed to go down a did so joseph mason who sat near to turned upon look black a thunder mr mason gave credit for timidity believed that have be bought over by other side dockwrath however knew better did not quite beat about own signature said knew along must depend chiefly upon bolster then bridget bolster be put into box be examined by mr steelyard have heard kenneby instructed to look up therefore fixed eye upon canopy over judge seat there fixed there kept till examination be over merely turning for moment on to mr chaffanbrass when gentleman became particularly severe in treatment of what said in answer to mr steelyard be very simple have never witnessed one signature in life that have done in sir joseph room nature of document have be explained to a said be young giddy then what went in at one ear went out at did remember mr usbech signing might have done so thought did not a to two signature purporting to be hers must not say be hers be not must swear positively that be not hers to adhered firmly mr steelyard handed over to mr chaffanbrass illustration bridget bolster in court then mr chaffanbrass rose from seat one knew that work be cut out for mr furnival have triumphed may be said that have demolished witness triumph have be very easy be now necessary to demolish bridget bolster opinion be general that if anybody must do mr chaffanbrass be man there be doggedness about bridget bolster induced many to doubt whether even chaffanbrass must be successful mr aram trusted greatly bar must have preferred to stake money on bridget chaffanbrass a rose pushed back small ugly wig from forehead thrusting rather on one side a did so then with chin thrown forward wicked ill meaning smile upon mouth looked at bridget for moment before spoke to glanced at instantly fixed eye back upon canopy then folded hand one on other upon rail before compressed lip waited patiently think say be chambermaid be first question chaffanbrass asked bridget bolster gave little start a heard sharp angry disagreeable voice yes be sir at palmer imperial hotel plymouth devonshire have be for nineteen year upper under upper under what do upper under mean when be under have above now a be upper why there be others under so explained position at hotel never took eye from canopy have begun being chambermaid when signed document did sign only one of well one of have begun being chambermaid then have be housemaid at orley farm be upper under there well believe be be cook be upper in house oh cook be upper why be called to sign name ca say be very decent woman can say name be martha mullens so far mr chaffanbrass have not done much be only preliminary skirmish a fencer play with foil before begin now bridget bolster if understand said have sworn that on th of july only signed one of document only signed once sir did say nothing about th of july because remember when signed one deed did not sign other then never do know offence for lady be being tried lady mason well ai sure be for doing something about will woman be not then a mr chaffanbrass raised voice spoke with savage earnestness bridget again started gave little leap up from floor soon settled back in old position one have dared to accuse of continued mr chaffanbrass looking over at lawyer on other side charge have brought forward against be that of perjury of having given false evidence twenty year ago in court of law now look here bridget bolster look at say did look at for moment then turned eye back to canopy a sure a be living woman will be placed there tried for same offence for perjury if tell falsehood respecting matter wo say nothing what be right said bridget have better not now look at two signature handed to two deed rather made one of servant of court hold for of signature be one did not sign ca say sir did write that further one with hand on ca say sir look at woman before answer bridget looked at then repeated same word ca say sir now look at other again looked down for moment did write ca say sir will swear that wrote did write one once prevaricate with woman be of signature there written by suppose that one be will swear that wrote one other will swear did write one once will swear wrote one of have before can read ca oh yes can read then look at again turned eye on for moment will swear that wrote of not if there be anywhere else said bridget at last anywhere else said chaffanbrass repeating word what do mean by if have got that anybody else have done wo say of three be mine did one did do more mr chaffanbrass continued at for long time with very indifferent success that affair of signature be indeed only point on evidence be worth anything then abandoned tried to make contradict about old usbech on subject must say nothing that usbech be present remembered well a to signing deed not signing must not pretend to say anything know be cram full of gout said remember nothing more may be explained that mr chaffanbrass have altogether altered intention very plan of campaign with reference to witness a soon a saw what be nature disposition discovered very early in affair that must not force to contradict reduce own evidence to nothing a furnival have done with man nothing must flurry woman force to utter word of did not know meaning more might persevere in such attempt more dogged steady must become therefore soon gave up have already given up when threatened to accuse of perjury resolved that a must not shake must shake confidence jury might place in must not make fool of therefore must make out to be rogue evidence must stand alone nearly alone in way might turn firmness to own purpose explain that dogged resolution to stick to one plain statement arose from having be specially instructed so to do with object of ruining client for more than hour persisted in asking question with object hinting that be on friendly term with dockwrath asking what pay have received for evidence making acknowledge that be being kept at free quarter on fat of land even produced from list of good thing have eaten that morning at breakfast at last succeeded in obtaining information a to that small indiscreet glass of spirit be then then only that poor bridget became discomposed beefsteak sausage pig fry though be taken three time day be not disgraceful in line of life little thimble of brandy taken after much pressing in openness of good fellowship went sorely against grain with when one have to be badgered like one want drop of something more than ordinary said at last be only word did say proved triumph on part of mr chaffanbrass nevertheless mr chaffanbrass be not dissatisfied triumph immediate triumph over poor maid servant must hardly have be object of man who have be triumphant in such matter for last thirty year must not be practicable to make jury doubt whether woman must be believed be triumph desired a for mr chaffanbrass knew well enough that have spoken nothing truth have so managed that truth might be made to look like falsehood at rate to have doubtful air if have done that have succeeded in occupation of life be indifferent to own triumph chapter lxxii mr furnival speech all a may be supposed disturbed felix graham not little perceived that of two witness have made great effort to speak truth honest painful effort to speak truth in way to go beyond gall have risen within while have listened to mr furnival witnessed success in destroying presence of mind of weak wretch who be endeavouring to do best in cause of justice again when mr chaffanbrass have seized hold of poor dram used wit in deducing from self condemnation from woman before when practised barrister have striven to show that be habitual drunkard dishonest unchaste evil in habit graham have felt almost tempted to get up take part doubt have evinced for chaffanbrass have understood what be going on in colleague mind have looked round at from time to time with air of scorn have be almost unendurable then have become duty of prosecutor to prove circumstance of former trial be of course essentially necessary seeing that offence for lady mason be now on defence be perjury alleged to have be committed at trial when have be done at considerable length by sir richard leatherham not without many interruption from mr furnival much assistance from mr steelyard fell upon felix graham to show by cross examination of crook attorney what have be nature effect of lady mason testimony a arose to do mr chaffanbrass whispered into ear if feel unequal to will take up wo have thrown over for etiquette yet for squeamishness to graham vouchsafed answer must not even reply by look got up did work at point conscience did not interfere with for question asked referred to fact have really occurred lady mason testimony at trial have be believed by everybody gentleman who have cross examined on part of joseph mason who be now dead have failed to shake evidence judge who tried case have declared to jury that be impossible to disbelieve evidence that judge be still living poor old bedridden man in course of latter trial statement be given in evidence there must be doubt at time lady mason testimony be taken a worthy of credit have sworn that have seen three witness sign codicil one have then thrown discredit on upshot of be that prosecuting side proved satisfactorily that such such thing have be sworn by lady mason felix graham on side of defence proved that when have so sworn word have be considered worthy of credence by judge by jury have hardly be doubted even by counsel opposed to really have be so felix graham used utmost ingenuity in making clear to court how high unassailed have be position client then held occupied court till nearly four o'clock then a case be over on part of prosecution question arose whether mr furnival must address jury on evening wait till following day if lordship will sit till seven o'clock said mr furnival think can undertake to finish what remark will have to make by time must not mind sitting till nine for pleasure of hearing mr furnival said judge who be very anxious to escape from alston on day one following thus be decided that mr furnival must commence speech have said that in spite of previous hesitation old fire have returned to when began work in court on behalf of client if have be so when work consisted in cross examination of witness be much more so with now when have to exhibit own power of forensic eloquence when man know that can speak with ease energy that will be listened to with attentive ear be impossible that must fail to be enthusiastic even though cause be bad one be so with now old fire came back upon before have done have almost brought again to believe lady mason to be that victim of persecution a did not hesitate to represent to jury gentleman of jury said never rose to plead client cause with more confidence than now feel in pleading that of friend lady mason twenty year ago be engaged in defending right in matter then succeeded little thought at time must be called on after so long interval to renew work little thought that pertinacity of opponent must hold out for such period compliment on firmness of character on equable temperament have enabled to sit through trial to look without dismay on unfortunate lady whom have considered to be duty to accuse of perjury did not think must live to fight battle again so be a have little doubt of victory then so have none now gentleman of jury must occupy of time of time of court in going through evidence have be adduced by learned friend against client almost feel that will be detaining unnecessarily so sure be that circumstance a have be already explained to must not justify in giving verdict against a mr furnival speech occupied fully three hour will not trouble reader with whole of began by describing former trial giving own recollection a to lady mason conduct on occasion in doing fully acknowledged on behalf that did give a evidence that special statement opponent now endeavoured to prove to have be false if be case said that codicil that pretended codicil be not executed by old sir joseph mason be not witnessed by usbech kenneby bridget bolster then in case lady mason have be guilty of perjury mr furnival a made acknowledgement studiously avoided face of lady mason a made assertion almost everybody in court except own counsel did look at joseph mason opposite dockwrath fixed gaze closely upon sir richard leatherham mr steelyard turned eye towards probably without meaning to do so judge looked over spectacle at even mr aram glanced round at surreptitiously lucius turned face upon mother almost with air of triumph bore without flinching bore without flinching though state of mind at moment must have be pitiable mr orme who held hand while knew that be so hand rested in hers be twitched a be convulsively culprit gave outward sign of guilt mr furnival then read much of evidence given at former trial especially showed how witness have then failed to prove that usbech have not be required to write name be quite true said that have be equally unable to prove that have done so that amounted to nothing onus probandi lay with accusing side there be signature be for to prove that be not that pretended to be lady mason have proved that be so because have then be held to be sufficient now after twenty year took mean of invalidating testimony from that went to evidence given at present trial beginning with malice interested motif of dockwrath against three of only be needful that must allege anything seeing that statement made by others be in way injurious to lady mason if statement made by three be not credible torrington for instance have proved that other deed what of if on fatal th of july sir joseph mason have executed two deed a to dockwrath that conduct have be interested malicious there must be doubt submitted to jury that have shown to be man unworthy of credit a to kenneby that poor weak creature a mr furnival in mercy called mr furnival must not charge conscience with saying that believed to have be guilty of falsehood on contrary conceived that kenneby have endeavoured to tell truth be one of men whose mind be so inconsequential that literally did not know truth from falsehood have not intended to lie when told jury that be not quite sure have never witnessed two signature by sir joseph mason on same day did lie when told again that have witnessed three have meant to declare truth be unfortunately man whose evidence must not be of much service in case of importance must be of service whatever in criminal charge tried a be done in instance more than twenty year after alleged commission of offence with regard to bridget bolster have hesitation whatever in telling jury that be woman unworthy of belief unworthy of credit jury must place in before must convict one on unaided testimony must have be clear to that have come into court drilled instructed to make one point blank statement to stick to have refused to give evidence a to own signature must not even look at own name a written by have contented with repeating over over again few word have be instructed so to say statement namely that have never put hand to more than one deed then addressed a concluded speech to part of subject be more closely personal to lady mason now gentleman of jury said before can dismiss from weary day work must ask to regard position of lady who have be thus accused amount of probability of guilt may assume from nature of life will call witness a to character for will not submit friend to annoyance of question gentleman opposite might feel duty to put to circumstance have occurred so much will tell so much doubt personally know though be not in evidence before circumstance have occurred must make cruel on part to place old friend sir peregrine orme in box story must tell to be one full of romance full also of truth affection though sir peregrine orme be not here there sits daughter by lady mason side there have sat through tedious trial giving comfort to woman that love there will sit till verdict will have made further presence here unnecessary lordship learned friend there will tell that can not take that a evidence of character will be justified in so telling on other hand defy not to take a such evidence let make what law will can not take precedence of human nature there too sits client son will remember at beginning of trial solicitor general expressed wish that be not here know whether then responded to wish believe may take for granted that do so now have woman dear to of be so placed through malice of enemy must have hesitated to sit by in hour of trial have doubted of innocence might have hesitated for who must endure to hear announced in crowded court like guilt of mother wife have doubt believe have living being in court unless be kinsman opposite whose life for last twenty year have be made wretched by wicked longing after patrimony of brother gentleman of jury there sits client with a loving friend on one side a ever woman have with only child on other during incident of trial nature of life have led during last twenty year since period of terrible crime with be charged have be proved before may fearlessly ask whether so fair life be compatible with idea of guilt so foul have known intimately during year not a lawyer a friend confess that audacity of man dockwrath in assailing character with such accusation strike almost with admiration what forgery for gentleman of jury be crime with be substantially charged look at a sits there that at age of twenty not much more who have so well performed duty of young life that must have forged will have traced one signature after in manner a to have deceived lawyer who be on track immediately after husband death for mark if be true with own hand must have done there be accomplice there look at be forger be woman to deceive sharp bloodhound of law must with young baby on bosom have wrested from such a a spoke pointed with finger with look of unutterable scorn to joseph mason who be sitting opposite to that fragment of old father property coveted so sorely where have learned such skilled artifice gentleman such ingenuity in crime a have never yet be proved in court of law even against who have spent life of wretchedness in acquiring such skill now be asked to believe that deed be done by young wife of whom that know be that conduct in other respect have be beyond praise gentleman might have defied to believe accusation have even be supported by testimony of high character even in such case must have felt that there be more behind than have be brought to knowledge now having seen a have of what nature be witness on whose testimony have be impeached be impossible that must believe story have lady mason be woman steeped in guilt from infancy have be noted for cunning fraudulent ingenuity have be known a expert forger must not have convicted on indictment having have before malice greed of dockwrath stupidity may almost call idiocy of kenneby dogged resolution to conceal truth evinced by woman bolster with strong evidence must not have believed charge against so excellent lady with such evidence a have have before must not have believed charge against previously convicted felon have be object of terrible persecution of dreadful punishment have be inflicted on poor lady for remember though can not pronounce guilty suffering have be terribly severe think what must have be for woman with habit such a hers to have looked forward for long long week to such martyrdom a think what must have suffered in being dragged here subjected to gaze of county a suspected felon think what must have be feeling when told not knowing how deep ingenuity might be practised against must counsel to call to aid unequalled talent of friend mr chaffanbrass unequalled no longer far surpassed whispered chaffanbrass in voice be audible through centre of court punishment have be terrible continued mr furnival after what have gone through may well be doubted whether can continue to reside at sweet spot have aroused feeling of avarice in bosom of kinsman have heard that sir joseph mason have promised eldest son that orley farm must form part of inheritance may be that old man did make such promise if so thought fit to break be not wonderful that man wealthy a be mr mason for fortune be large who have never wanted anything that money can buy man for whom father did so much that must be stirred up by disappointed avarice to carry in bosom for twenty year so bitter feeling of rancour against who be nearest to by blood tie of family gentleman have be fearful lesson be one will ever forget now will leave client case in hand a to verdict will give have apprehension know a well a do that have not be guilty of terrible crime that will so pronounce for moment doubt do hope that verdict will be accompanied by expression on part may show to world at large how great have be wickedness displayed in accusation yet a sat down knew that have be guilty to ear guilt have never be confessed yet knew that be so knowing that have be able to speak a though innocence be thing of course that witness have spoken truth also knew yet have be able to hold up to execration of around a though have committed worst of crime from foulest of motif more than stranger than worse than when legal world knew a legal world soon did know that have be so legal world found fault with mr furnival conceiving that have done duty by client in manner becoming english barrister english gentleman chapter lxxiii mr orme tell story be late when second day work be over when mr orme lady mason again found in hamworth carriage have sat in court from ten in morning till past seven with short interval of few minute in middle of day be weary to very soul when left lucius again led out mother a did so expressed to in strong language approval of mr furnival speech at last one have spoken out on mother behalf in tone must have be used from first have be very angry with mr furnival thinking that barrister have lost sight of mother honour that be playing with happiness now be inclined to forgive now at last truth have be spoken in eloquent word persecutor of mother have be addressed in language such a be fitting that must hear to last two hour have be two hour of triumph a passed through hall of court whispered in mother ear now at last a hoped trouble be at end whisper have be spoken a passed through hall mr orme went out leaning on arm of son on other side of be mr aram have remained in seat till have begun to move then followed mr orme be already half way across court when made way up to side very gently touched arm sir said looking round let be too sure said let be over confident may go for nothing with jury then lifted hat left go for nothing with jury hardly understood yet felt that must go for nothing if right be done mind be not argumentative yet perhaps be sense of true justice very acute when sir peregrine have once hinted that must be well that criminal must be pronounced guilty because in truth have be guilty mr orme by mean agreed with now having heard how wretched witness have be denounced knowing how true have be word have spoken knowing how false be assurance of innocence with mr furnival have be so fluent felt something of spirit have actuated sir peregrine have almost thought that justice demanded verdict against friend let be over confident mr aram have said in truth mr orme a have listened to mr furnival speech have become almost confident that lady mason must be acquitted have seemed to impossible that jury must pronounce to be guilty after speech state of mind a listened to have be very painful lady mason hand have rested in own during great portion of must have be natural that must give encouragement to companion by touch by slight pressure a warm word of praise fell from lawyer mouth how must do so knowing that praise be false be not possible to to show friendship by congratulating friend on success of lie lady mason also have doubt felt for after while hand have be withdrawn have listened in silence giving sign to other a to feeling on subject a sat together in carriage lucius did give vent to feeling can not understand why must not have be said before said in manner to have be a convincing a be to day suppose there be opportunity before trial said mr orme feeling that must say something feeling also how impossible be to speak on subject with truth in presence of lady mason son occasion must have be made said lucius be monstrous that mother must have be subjected to accusation for month that one till now must have spoken out to show how impossible be that must have be guilty ah lucius understand said mother hope never may said why did not jury get up in seat at once pronounce verdict when mr furnival speech be over why must wait there giving day of prolonged trouble knowing a must do what verdict will be to be incomprehensible seeing that good can in way come from so went on striving to urge companion to speak upon subject to did not admit of speech in presence be very painful to for in addressing mr orme almost demanded from expression of triumph at least have believed in innocence said at last have not be ashamed to show that did so lucius said mother be very weary speak to now let rest till be at home then closed eye there be silence till carriage drove up to door of orley farm house two lady

life of disgrace effort of own must wipe away then a threw on bed thought of sophia furnival must share disgrace with be possible that there might be solace there quite impossible must say who know

enjoying bottle of champagne between perhaps more thoroughly than must have done have judge mr staveley shared with felix have something of to think besides champagne something be of more consequence to even than trial in be engaged madeline have promised that must meet that evening rather have not so promised when asked to do so have not refused even while not refusing have reminded that mother must be there manner to have thought be cold though have not be ungracious upon whole must not make up mind to expect success then must have be fool reader learned in such matter will say reader learned in such matter be think right in respect be fool suppose must give governor benefit of company over wine said augustus a soon a dinner be over suppose ought to do so why not be there objection to tell truth said graham have appointment be very anxious to keep appointment where here at noningsby do mean in house yet can not say that be absolutely appointment be going to ask sister what fate

go to governor felix made way from small breakfast parlour in have dined across hall into drawing room there found lady staveley alone so trial be not over yet mr graham said there will be day of what will be verdict be possible that really forged will ah can not say know that be one of counsel lady staveley yes must have remembered be more discreet if be looking for madeline mr graham think that be in library oh thank in library then felix got out of drawing room into hall again not in most graceful manner might have gone direct from drawing room to library did not remember be very odd thought that lady staveley of whose dislike to have felt sure must have thus sent direct to daughter have become party a be to appointment between have not much time to think of before found in room there sure enough be madeline waiting to listen to story be seated when entered with back to a heard rose after pausing for moment stepped forward to meet augustus be very late to day said yes be kept there be good enough to wait for said wanted to speak to said hesitating little yet very little to speak to alone so mamma said have better come in here hope be not vexed must have told certainly not miss staveley because have secret from mamma do wish that anything must be secret hate secrecy miss staveley father know of intention on point madeline did not feel to be necessary to say anything of course father knew of intention have not received father sanction for listening to mr graham must not have be alone with in library might be that time must come in must explain to lover that time have not come yet so when spoke of father remained silent allowing eye to fall to ground stood before waiting to hear question miss staveley said be conscious of being very awkward much more so indeed than there be need for madeline be not aware that be awkward in eye be quite master of occasion seemed to have everything own way have already done be difficult in matter have done without awkwardness have already made master of heart be only necessary now that must enter in take possession ripe fruit have fallen a miss furnival have once chosen to express there be to pick up if only considered worth trouble to do so that manner of picking must not signify much a madeline thought that desired to take into garner preserve for life use be everything to method of word at present moment be not much be lord master be one man who have conquered taken possession of spirit a to being awkward there be not much in do say that be awkward spoke mind in honest plain term know must have done better miss staveley said in asking to see alone have made great venture be indeed risking that most value then paused a though expected that must speak still kept eye upon ground still stood silent before can not think must guess purpose said though acknowledge have have nothing can warrant in hoping for favourable answer there be hand if can take need not doubt that have heart with then held out to broad right hand madeline still stood silent before still fixed eye upon ground very slowly raised little hand allowed soft slight finger to rest upon open palm be a though thus affixed legal signature seal to deed of gift have not said word to not word of love word of assent such word be now necessary madeline own madeline said then taking unfair advantage of finger have given drew to breast folded in arm be nearly hour after when returned to drawing room do go in now said must not wait longer indeed must go will come in presently be already nearly eleven will not show again to night mamma will soon come up to know good night felix do go now will follow then after further little ceremony left when entered drawing room lady staveley be there judge with teacup beside augustus standing with back to fire felix walked up to circle taking chair sat down at moment said nothing did get wine after day toil master graham said judge indeed did sir have champagne champagne have then ought to have waited for guest for got none have long day of in court yes indeed sir be afraid not very satisfactory to graham made immediate answer must not refrain from thinking that day taken altogether have be satisfactory to then baker came into room going close up to lady staveley whispered something in ear oh ah yes said lady staveley must wish good night mr graham took hand pressing very warmly though wished good night then saw again before went to bed be family in home affair be very dear new son must not be welcomed into without much expression of affection well sir how have sped since dinner judge asked a soon a door be closed behind wife have proposed to daughter have accepted a said so rose from chair in have just now seated then boy hope will make good husband judge gave hand will try to do so can not feel however how little right have to ask seeing that be likely to be so poor man well well well will talk of time at present will only sing triumph so faithful in love so dauntless in war there never be knight like young lochinvar felix dear fellow congratulate with heart said augustus did not know be good a warrior ah be though said judge what do think of wound if hear be true have other battle on hand must not speak about till poor lady trial be over need hardly tell sir said graham with sheep like air man always carry on such occasion regard a most fortunate man in world quite unnecessary said judge on such occasion be taken a matter of course then conversation between for next ten minute be rather dull flat up stair same thing be going on in manner somewhat more animated between mother daughter for lady on such occasion can be more animated than men oh mamma must love madeline said yes dear of course will love now papa say that be very clever know papa like knew that from very first think be reason why suppose clever people be best be to say if be good be good well hope so indeed be sure be mr orme be very good young man too be good talking about now mamma that never must have come to pas very well dear be over now of course looked for be happiness know that mamma indeed be very happy be sure must not ever have liked one else since first knew lady staveley still thought very odd have nothing else to say a regarded pecuniary consideration of affair left altogether to husband feeling that in way must relieve from misgiving might otherwise make unhappy after know that ugliness signifies said to herself so made up mind that must be loving affectionate to sat up till heard footstep in passage in order that might speak to make welcome to privilege of son in law mr graham said opening door a passed by of course have told said felix oh yes have told have many secret in house be sure congratulate with heart think have got very best girl in world of course be mother declare if be to talk of for week must not say anything of good know how fortunate be yes be fortunate for there be nothing in world equal to loving wife who will do duty be sure will be good to will endeavour to be so man must be very bad indeed who must be bad to think that of be great thing mr graham madeline must have loved man of whom papa be so fond know what have done to judge be sure said remembering in innocence of heart that mr arbuthnot have be son in law rather after own choice that judge always declared that eldest daughter husband have seldom much to say for hope madeline mother will receive a kindly a madeline father said taking lady staveley hand pressing indeed will will love very dearly if will let girl husband be same to a son then put up

beautiful like must have have chance with not if 'd be weighted with money also now a for confess be not nearly so magnanimous a father for mad sake do hope will get rid of vagary income know be very commonplace sort of thing when man have family there be comfort attached to be at rate willing to work said graham somewhat moodily yes if may work exactly in own way men in world ca do that man a take must through life allow to be governed by united wisdom of others around can not take upon to judge a to step by own light if doe will be dead before have made up mind a to preliminary in way

regretted that have undertaken to bring together on morning thinking that might have be better to postpone interview till trial must be over have expected that lucius must have be softer in manner be too late for such thought will find dressed now mr mason said conjure a hope for mercy to be merciful to be mother though have injured by folly heart have be true to through go now remember harshness

together so stood till have closed door behind have taken few step on towards centre of room then rushed forward throwing on ground before clasped round knee with arm boy boy said then lay there bathing foot with tear oh mother what be that have told lady mason at moment spoke further word seemed a though heart must have burst with sob when for moment lifted up face to tear be streaming down cheek have not be for relief must not have borne suffering be heaped upon mother get up said let raise be dreadful that must lie there let lift still clung to knee grovelling on ground before lucius lucius said then sank away from a though strength of muscle must no longer allow to cling to sank away from lay along ground hiding face upon floor mother said taking gently by arm a knelt at side if

jacob have not striven with old man struggling that might do just thing without injustice till in anger have thrust from will not break promise for brat old man have said then did deed be a nothing now felt comfort now from bible story have given such encouragement before thing be finished now result of evil doing have come full home to be seeking pardon with broken heart while burning tear

if find guilty will be imprisoned then will go come back when release for future world will be very different from past need not be so for lucius wish to keep near now will be near where hide shame there will hide mine in world there be nothing left for there be world before if can repent of sin too said very sternly standing somewhat away from frowning while with gloomy eyebrow sad a be condition might have given solace must have taken by hand kissed peregrine orme must have done so augustus staveley must have be possible that must have found in position though lucius mason must not do so be not le just than may be not le loving in heart must devote for mother sake a absolutely a must to be given to be denied that cruse of heavenly balm with wound can be assuaged sore heart ever relieved of portion of sorrow of virtue with man can endow surely none other be so odious a justice can teach to look down upon mercy almost a vice will not ask to forgive said plaintively mother answered be to say that forgave word must be mockery have right either to condemn to forgive accept position a have be made for will endeavour to do duty must have be almost better for that must have upbraided for wickedness must then have fallen again prostrate before if not in body at least in spirit weakness must have stood for in place of strength now be necessary that must hear word bear look bear like heavy burden on back without absolutely sinking have be that necessity of bearing never absolutely sinking during year past have so tried tested strength of heart soul seeing that have not sunk may say that strength have be very wonderful then stood up came close to will give hand lucius yes mother there be hand will stand by through did not offer to kiss there be still pride in heart must not allow to ask for embrace now said be time that must prepare to go mr think better must not accompany lucius must not hear proclaim guilt in court must make little difference nevertheless will not go have known before must not have gone there be to testify belief in innocence nay conviction oh lucius spare well will speak of more will be here to night when come back if say that be guilty will take away if so will come to in morning if will let mother in case must leave house to morrow then again gave hand left without touching with lip when two lady appeared in court together without lucius mason there be much question among crowd a to cause of absence dockwrath joseph mason looked at in right light accepted a ground for renewed hope dare not face verdict said dockwrath yet when have left court on preceding evening after listening to mr furnival hope have not be very high dockwrath have not admitted with word that feared defeat when mason have gnashed teeth a walked up down room at alston striking table with clenched fist have declared fear by heaven will escape again dockwrath have not be able to give substantial comfort jury be not such fool a to take for gospel have said have not said with tone of assured conviction have always used till mr furnival speech have be made there must have be greater attestation to power displayed by mr furnival than mr mason countenance a left court on evening suppose will cost hundred of pound said to dockwrath that evening orley farm will pay for dockwrath have answered answer have shown confidence if think well of joseph mason be deserving of pity wanted only what be own that orley farm ought to be own have smallest doubt mr furnival have not in least shaken have made feel that others must be shaken if must only be left to judge thought mr mason to then began to consider whether british palladium of unanimous jury have not in more of evil than of good young peregrine orme again met mother at door of court at instance gave arm to lady mason mr aram be also there mr aram have great tact did not offer arm to mr orme contenting with making way for walking beside be glad that son have not come to day said not bringing head suspiciously close to hers still speaking so that none might hear have done good that must do a there be only judge charge to hear jury will not notice absence of course hope for best mr orme be doubtful a felix graham took place next to chaffanbrass old lawyer scowled at turning red old savage eye first on then from growling while so that whole court might notice legal portion of court did notice be much amused good morning mr chaffanbrass said graham quite aloud a took seat then chaffanbrass growled again considering light with have be lightened there be specie of honesty about mr chaffanbrass certainly deserved praise be always true to man whose money have taken gave to customer with power at command that assistance have professed to sell may give same praise to hired bravo who go through with truth courage task have undertaken knew assassin in ireland who professed that during twelve year of practice in tipperary have never failed when have once engaged for truth honesty to customer be great virtue must bracket that man mr chaffanbrass together then judge commenced charge a went on with repeated evidence be in way of moment pulling detail to piece dividing that bore upon subject from did not did with infinite talent with perspicuity beyond praise to thinking be remarkable that seemed to regard witness a dissecting surgeon may be supposed to regard subject on operates for advancement of science with exquisite care displayed what have said how special saying of one bore on special saying of never spoke of a though have be live men woman who be a much entitled to justice at hand a prosecutor in matter who be being prosecuted who indeed if anything be better entitled unless must show that be false suborned for unless be suborned false be there doing painful duty to public for be to receive pay from be to obtain benefit of whom else in court must so much be said judge there have ermine canopy large salary seat of honour lawyer have wig own loud voice place of precedence attorney have seat big table somewhat familiar respect of tipstaves jury though not much to be envied be addressed with respect flattery have honourable seat be invariably at least called gentleman why must there be seat of honour for witness to stand in box to be bawled after by police to be scowled at scolded by judge to be browbeaten accused falsely by barrister then to be condemned a perjurer by jury be fate of one person who during whole trial be perhaps entitled to greatest respect be certainly entitled to most public gratitude let witness have big arm chair canopy over man behind with red cloak to do honour keep fly off let be gently invited to come forward from inner room where can sit before fire then will be able to speak out making heard without scolding will perhaps be able to make fair fight with cock who can crow so loudly on own dunghill judge in case did work with admirable skill blowing aside froth of mr furnival eloquence upsetting sophistry false deduction of mr chaffanbrass case for jury a said hung altogether upon evidence of kenneby woman bolster a far a must see evidence of dockwrath have little to do with alleged malice greed on part of dockwrath must have nothing to do with jury might take a proved that lady mason at former trial have sworn that have be present when husband signed codicil have seen different signature affixed to might also take a proved that other deed deed purporting to close partnership between sir joseph mason mr martock have be executed on th of july that have be signed by sir joseph also by two surviving witness kenneby bolster question therefore for consideration of jury have narrowed to have two deed be executed by sir joseph mason bearing same date if have not be done if deed with reference to partnership be true deed then must other be false fraudulent if false fraudulent then must lady mason have sworn falsely be guilty of perjury with be now charged there might perhaps be one loophole to argument by escape be possible though deed bore date of th july there might have be error in be possible though doubt singular that date must have be inserted in partnership deed deed be executed afterwards then woman bolster told that have be called to act a witness once in life if believed in statement possibility of error a to date must be of little avail on behalf of lady mason for must not say that adequate ground have be shown for charging bolster with swearing falsely doubt have be obstinate in method of giving testimony that might have arisen from honest resolution on part not to allow to be shaken value of testimony must however be judged by jury a regarded kenneby must say that man have be very stupid one who have heard must accuse for moment of having intended to swear falsely jury might perhaps think that testimony of such man must not be taken a having much value with reference to circumstance happened more than twenty year since charge took over two hour substance of have be stated then jury retired to consider verdict judge barrister other jury proceeded to business of other le important trial lady mason mr orme sat for while in seat perhaps for space of twenty minute then a jury did not at once return into court retired to sitting room in have first be placed here mr aram accompanied here be of course met by peregrine orme lordship charge be very good very good indeed said mr aram be asked peregrine very much in favour continued attorney think then said mr orme looking up into face think that did not know how to go on with question yes do think will have verdict do indeed must not say so before lady mason if opinion be not very strong jury may disagree be not improbable can not anticipate that verdict will be against there be comfort in how be nature of comfort did not attorney in word spoke declare own conviction of client guilt even peregrine orme must not say out boldly that felt sure of acquittal because other verdict must be justly given then why be not mr furnival there taking friend by hand congratulating that trouble be so nearly over mr furnival at time did not come near have done so what must have said to sir richard leatherham left court together latter went at once back to london without waiting to hear verdict mr chaffanbrass also felix graham retired from scene of labour a did so few word be spoken between mr graham said ancient hero of old bailey be too great for kind of work take if be must keep out of for future be very much of same way of thinking mr chaffanbrass said other if man undertakes duty must do be opinion though confess be little old fashioned especially if take money for mr graham then old man glowered at with fierce eye nodded head went on what must graham say to answer must have be ready enough have there be time place in to give have answer ready be fit for crowded hall of court house so mr chaffanbrass went on way will now pas out of sight will say of that did duty well according to light there in little room sat lady mason mr orme till late in evening there with remained peregrine sort of refreshment be procured for of three day passed in court that perhaps be most oppressive there be employment for then suspense be terrible that suspense became worse worse a hour went on for be clear that at rate of jury be anxious to give verdict against say that there be eight four said mr aram at one of many visit made to there be saying how true may be eight four said peregrine eight to acquit four for guilty said aram if so be safe at rate till next assize be not fated that lady mason must be sent away from court in doubt at eight o'clock mr aram came to hot with haste told that jury have sent for judge judge have gone home to dinner must return to court at once when heard that jury have agreed must go into court again said mr orme lady mason must do so then of course will go with be ready now dear lady mason be unable to speak signified that

now suppose fact be like to see there said other be that reason said martha have be in place must not have put foot in house again till be assured that friend must be a welcome there a then perhaps idea of friendship may be called romantic though there be heart burning war in red lion square there be sweet peace in harley street mr furnival have learned that beyond doubt lady mason be unfortunate woman on whose behalf husband be using best energy a lawyer though rumour have begun to reach be very injurious to lady character did not on account feel animosity against have lady mason be guilty of sin in calendar except one mr furnival must find within heart to forgive sophia be now more interested about lady mason than be mother during day of trial be much more eager to learn news a became known have said nothing to mother about lucius have said anything a to augustus staveley miss furnival be lady who on such subject did not want assistance of mother counsel then early on morning followed trial heard verdict knew that lady mason be free be so glad said mr furnival be sure be papa doing will hope that be really innocent said sophia oh yes of course so suppose be be sure

early in day when world be yet beginning to have done one evil deed from time up to day of trial have be victim of one incessant struggle to appear before world a though deed have not be done to appear innocent of before world beyond thing innocent of before son for twenty year have striven with labour have be unendurable now have failed one knew for what be such have be life then thought of life might have be hers in earlier day have known what be to be poor have seen heard battle after money harden heart quench poetry of nature have not be altogether so with have thing gone differently with might afterwards have be said that have gone through fire unscathed beast have set foot upon when temptation came be too much for not for must have sinned have robbed that old man who have be to kind master when child be born to eye be blind must not see that wealth ill gotten for child must be a sure curse a wealth ill gotten for remembered rebekah with cunning of second rebekah filched world blessing for baby now thought of a picture of life might have be hers passed before mind eye be pleasant picture have not burnt into very soul a looked at how sweet have be that drawing room at cleeve a sat there in luxurious quiet with new friend how sweet have be that friendship with woman pure in thought graceful to eye delicate in way knew now a thought of to have be given power to appreciate such delight a how full of charm to must have be life in there have be so much of true innocent affection have load ever be absent from shoulder then thought of sir peregrine with pleasant ancient manner truth of heart told that must have be happy with love of even so old man a have burden be away from burden have never be away never must be away then thought once more of stern just son a bowed head kissed rod prayed that release might come to soon now will say farewell to a do so chief interest of tale will end may perhaps be thought to owe apology to reader in have asked sympathy for woman who have so sinned a to have placed beyond general sympathy of world at large if so tender apology perhaps feel must confess fault a have told story that sympathy have grown upon have learned to forgive to feel that too must have regarded a friend of future life will not venture to say anything lesson be truer than teach to believe that god doe temper wind to shorn lamb to how many have not seemed at one period of life that be over for to in affliction there be nothing left to die yet have lived to laugh again to feel that air be warm earth fair god in giving ever springing hope have given everything how many sun may seem to set on endless night yet rising again on morrow trick beam with new spangled ore flame in forehead of morning sky for lady mason let hope that day will come in also may once again trick beam in modest unassuming way that for morning may even yet be sweet with glad warmth for here in page must be sufficient to say last kindly farewell a to lucius

sure that be anxious only to serve under circumstance be driven into arm of third attorney learned from after delay cut to soul that must take further criminal proceeding against lady mason must be impossible to have even indicted for forgery seeing that two jury at interval of twenty year have virtually acquitted unless new evidence must be absolute positive in kind must be forthcoming there be new evidence of kind offer made to surrender property be evidence for jury might be in mind of world at large what be to do asked mason take good god provide said attorney accept offer half brother
