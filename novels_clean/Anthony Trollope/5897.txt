trollope have left ireland characterization be weak plot although author thought well of mechanical value of story be rather documentary than literary contains several graphic scene descriptive of great irish famine trollope observed carefully on whole impartially though power of discrimination be not quite fine enough to make ideal annalist still such a be have used here with inconsiderable effect desire to be fair have led to lay stress in inverse ratio to prepossession priest be better man than parson best indeed only piece of real characterization in book be delineation of abe mollett unscrupulous blackmailer be put before with real art with something of loving preoccupation of hunter for quarry trollope loved rogue in long portrait gallery there be several really charming one did not indeed perceive aesthetic value of sin did not perceive esthetic value of anything analysis of human nature be not profound enough to reach conception of sin crime being to nadir of downward possibility have professional sort of half scotland yard half master of hound interest in criminal see must muse how cunningly creature work now back to earth anon stealing unsuspected run across

up to reprobation self realization in fiction be one of trollope principal charm never be there more subjective writer unlike flaubert who laid down canon that author must exist in work a god in creation to be here there dimly divined never recognized though everywhere latent trollope be never weary of writing large in man woman child described illusion of objectivity so successfully achieves

have remembered that be misfortune rather than fault greater endeavour might perhaps have be made to rescue from evil way very little such endeavour be made at sir thomas once twice spoke to sir thomas be not energetic man a for lady fitzgerald though be in many thing be excellent be far too diffident to attempt reformation of headstrong young man who after be only distantly connected with

desmond court be for year pretty much confined to cold formal mode of visiting owen fitzgerald however did obtain admittance into precinct of desmond barrack went there first with young earl who then quite boy have have ugly tumble from pony in hunting field countess have expressed a very grateful for young fitzgerald care thus intimacy have sprung up owen have gone there once twice to see lad on

truth only thirty eight be beautiful proud clever if must suit to marry handsome young fellow with good house unembarrassed income of eight hundred year why must not do so a for must not be great thing for to have countess for wife earl for stepson what idea countess have on subject will not just now trouble ourselves to inquire a to young owen fitzgerald may declare at once that thought of such wretched alliance ever entered head be sinful in many thing foolish in many thing have not that vile sin that unmanly folly must have made marriage with widowed countess eligible in eye merely because be countess not more than fifteen year senior in matter of love must a soon have thought of paying devotion to far away cousin old miss barbara beamish of ballyclahassan of whom be said that have set cap at unmarried man have come into west riding of county for last forty year may at rate be said of owen fitzgerald that be not man to make up to widowed countess for sake of reflected

of hap house orgy double scandal reached be one shortly after other that orgy scandal did not hurt much be ala too true that consciousness of such reputation doe not often hurt young man feeling other rumour did wound what sell to widowed countess almost old enough to be mother bestow rather for what be there in return must be reckoned a price at rate have given one cause to utter such falsehood such calumny a no certainly be not probable that must marry countess set to ask whether might might not be possible that must marry one else might not be well for if must find younger bride at desmond

proud in inmost heart of such tenderness solicitude a long a remains secret wrapt a be in certain mystery such liaison have interest of intrigue without be going to say without danger ala may be that be not always so owen fitzgerald a rode home be half in love with countess not that love be of kind made in way desirous of marrying of kneeling at foot devoting to for ever not that in way interfered with other love be beginning to feel for daughter thought with pleasure of tone of voice of pressure of hand of tenderness have found in eye be after time a will be understood that goodnatured friend have told that be regarded in county a future husband of lady desmond at first laughed at a being a said to too good joke when report first reached seemed to be joke must share so pleasantly with countess for men of three twenty though be so fond of society of woman older than understand so little heart feeling of such woman in idea there be interval a of generation between countess in thought interval be probably much le striking accusation be made to again again till wounded gave up that notion of mutual joke with kind friend at desmond court did not occur to that must ever think of loving a lord master be brought home to that other people thought so year have now passed by since winter holiday in clara desmond have be sixteen during be described by epithet will not fear have pleased reader epithet be now somewhat le deserved still necessity of have not entirely passed away limb be still thin long shoulder pointed growth of beauty have commenced in owen eye be already very lovely at christmas time during winter ball be given at castle richmond to celebrate coming of age of young heir be not very gay affair for castle richmond folk even in day be not very gay people sir

advance in story be nice good girl handsome withal have not that special gift enables girl to make party in own house bright in spite of obstacle must have little to do with ball be not that clara desmond be here first brought out a term go be first large party to have be taken be to matter of much wonder inquiry with wondering speaking eye owen fitzgerald be there a matter of course reader will say by mean so previous to ball owen sin have be commented upon at castle richmond sir thomas have expostulated with expostulation have not be received quite so graciously a of handsome countess there have be anger at castle richmond now there be living in house of castle richmond one miss letty fitzgerald maiden sister of baronet older than brother by full ten year in character there be more of energy also much more of harsh judgment of consequent ill nature than in of brother when letter of invitation be being sent out by two girl have given decided opinion that reprobate must not be asked reprobate cousin with partiality for rake be so common to young lady must not abide by aunt command referred matter to mamma papa mamma thought very hard that own cousin must be refused admittance to house very dreadful that sin must be considered to be of so deep dye a to require so severe sentence then papa much balancing matter gave final order that prodigal cousin must be admitted be admitted dangerously used privilege countess who be there stood up to dance twice twice only opened ball with young herbert fitzgerald heir in about hour afterwards danced again with owen did not ask twice asked daughter three four time three four time asked successfully clara whispered mother to child after last of occasion giving little pull twist to girl frock a did so have better not dance with owen fitzgerald again to night people will remark about will said clara immediately sat down checked in young happiness not many minute afterwards owen came up to again may have waltz together wonder said not to night think be rather tired already so did not waltz again evening for fear must offend countess though have thus interdicted daughter dancing with master of hap house have not done so through absolute fear to girl be still child child without woman thought of woman charm then be so natural that clara must like to dance with almost only gentleman who be not absolutely stranger to lady desmond have be actuated rather by feeling that must be well that clara must begin to know other person by feeling perhaps unconsciously by that must be well that owen fitzgerald must be relieved from attendance on child enabled to give to mother whether lady desmond have at time realized idea a to own interest in young man be at rate true that loved to have near have refused to dance second time with herbert fitzgerald have refused to stand up with other person who have asked with owen must either have danced again have kept by side while explained to with flattering frankness that must not do so lest others must be offended owen be with frequently through evening be taken to from supper by sir thomas other taking be incurred be done by led from one drawing room to took empty coffee cup stood behind chair talked to brought scarf have left elsewhere finally put shawl round neck while old sir thomas be waiting to hand to carriage reader good natured middle aged reader remember that be only thirty eight that hitherto have known nothing of delight of love by young such hallucination on part at year will be regarded a lunacy at least frenzy owen fitzgerald drove home from ball in state of mind be hardly satisfactory in first place miss letty have made direct attack upon moral have not answered in most courteous manner have heard great deal of doings master owen said to fine house be keeping why come join aunt letty replied must be just thing for god forbid said old maid turning up eye to heaven oh might do worse know with 'd only drink play card perhaps hear little strong language now again what be to slander calumny bearing false witness against one neighbour so saying ended that interview not in manner to ingratiate with relative miss letty fitzgerald after in supper room more than one wag of fellow have congratulated on success with widow be got sort of jointure suppose said one be very young looking certainly to be mother of girl declared upon word be handsome woman still said third what title will get when marry fitz asked fourth who be rather ignorant a to phase under british peerage develops fitzgerald pshawed pished poohed then breaking away from rode home felt that must at rate put end to annoyance about countess that must put end also to state of doubt about countess daughter clara have be kind gracious to in first part of evening nay almost more than gracious why have be so cold when went up to on last occasion why have gathered like snail into shell for rest of evening young earl have also be at party have exacted promise from owen that must be over at desmond court on next day have almost be on owen lip to tell friend not only that must be there what must be intention when got there knew that lad loved

be unhappy must see be said clara not knowing what else to say yes will tell must see more than that be that made unhappy mr fitzgerald yes will not deny because be so true asked to dance with too often because refused did not like to dance with one else saw will deny that be so oh mr fitzgerald poor girl did not know what to say how to shape speech into indifference how to assure that made out to be of too much consequence by far how to make plain that have not danced because there be one there worth dancing with have be out for year two instead of being such novice must have accomplished in dozen word a be tell tale face confessed be only able to ejaculate oh mr fitzgerald when went there last night continued have only one wish one hope be to see pleased happy knew be first ball did so long to see enjoy so did till till what will not let ask mamma said something to stopped from dancing told not to dance with be that how be possible that must have have chance with innocent young

stand still see happy how must have hated oh indeed did not be not at angry with indeed why must have be be so kind of wishing to dance with be selfish selfish in extreme nothing one thing must excuse that excuse be sure want excuse mr fitzgerald that excuse clara be that love with heart have not strength to see there not long to have near not begrudge that must dance with love with heart soul there lady clara now know manner in made declaration to be almost fierce in energy have stopped in pathway unconscious of what be doing almost unconscious of what be hearing have stopped also mare taking advantage of occasion be cropping grass close to so for few second stood in silence be so bold lady clara said when few second have gone by be so bold that may hope for answer still said nothing in lieu of speaking uttered long sigh then fitzgerald must hear that be sobbing oh clara love so fondly so dearly so truly said in altered voice with sweet tenderness know own presumption in thus speaking know feel bitterly difference in rank care nothing for rank said poor girl sobbing through tear be generous at rate must not be le so no at moment with scanty seventeen year of experience with ignorance of that world have in of grand great of high rich did care nothing for rank that owen fitzgerald be gentleman of good lineage fit to mate with lady that did know for mother who be proud woman delighted to have in presence beyond cared for none of conventionality of life rank if waited for rank where be to look for friend who must love earl countess baron baroness be scarce there where fate have placed under shadow of bleak mountain of muskerry want undefined want be that one must love of men woman whom have hitherto known owen fitzgerald be brightest kindest gentlest in manner most pleasant to look on now be there at foot swearing that loved then drawing back a be in dread of rank what did care for rank clara clara clara can learn to love have made one little effort at speaking when attempted to repudiate pedestal on affected to place after must for while say more still sobbed still kept eye fixed upon ground clara say one word to say that hate just at moment have not one word to say if will bid do so will leave country altogether will go away will not much care whither can only stay now on condition of loving have thought of day for last year past now have come word that now spoke be gospel to be not always so must not be so always when love first speaks to loving ear what have loved for whole twelvemonth that have known loved in day when have be wont to look up into face wondering why be so nice so much nicer than one else came near year be great deal to have loved through day after must banish from house turn away from home drive forth unhappy wretched ah must not be so unkind to must not be so unkind to own heart still sobbed still said nothing in mean time have turned be now walking back towards house gentle natured mare still following at heel be walking slowly very slowly back just creeping along path when saw lady desmond son coming to meet on road there be mother clara say one word to before meet oh mr fitzgerald be so frightened what will mamma say say about what a yet know what may have to say before meet may not hope to know what daughter will say answer clara can will love there be still pause moment pause then sound did fall from lip yet be so soft so gentle so slight that must hardly be said to reach even lover ear fitzgerald however made most of whether be yes whether be no took a being favourable lady clara desmond gave sign to show that be mistaken own own only loved one said embracing a be with word since presence of approaching mother forbade even to take hand in be happy now may occur others may say for know that will be true to remember others may say also will be true to will think of will not love time did answer almost audibly yes said then devoted to vain endeavour to remove trace of tear before mother must be close to fitzgerald at once saw that such endeavour must be vain at one time have thought of turning away pretending that have not seen countess knew that clara must not be able to carry out such pretence reflected also that might be just a well that lady desmond must know whole at once that must know know soon be quite sure must learn not only from clara from must not now be there at house without showing that loved knew that be beloved then why must lady desmond not know why must think that must set against match have certainly spoken to clara of difference in rank after be uncommon thing for earl daughter to marry commoner in case earl daughter be portionless lover desired portion owen fitzgerald at rate might boast that be true generous in love so plucked up courage walked on with smiling face to meet lady desmond son while poor clara crept beside with eye downcast in agony of terror lady desmond have not left house with apprehension that there be aught amiss son have told that owen have gone off to do civil to clara a did not come to house within twenty minute after have proposed that must go meet did tell wanted said countess oh yes did be coming only must go away to clara then will scold for want of gallantry said lady desmond laughing a walked out together from beneath huge portal a soon a be near enough to see manner of gait a slowly came on towards woman tact told that something be wrong whispered to also what might too probably be nature of something must be possible asked that man a owen fitzgerald must fall in love with girl a daughter clara what will say to mamma whispered clara to a drew near together tell everything patrick will take off with if can then be together standing in road be coming to obey behest lady desmond said fitzgerald trying to look speak a though be at ease coming rather tardily think said ladyship not altogether playfully told wanted a be crossing to house said earl did owen be anything matter with clara said lady desmond looking at daughter mamma said clara instantly began to sob cry what be sir a asked turned to fitzgerald manner now at least have in nothing playful lady clara be nervous hysterical excitement of ball have perhaps be too much for think lady desmond if be to take in with must be well lady desmond looked up at then saw for first time that must if pleased look very stern hitherto face have always worn smile have at rate always be pleasing when have seen have never be intimate with never intimate enough to care what face be like till day when have carried son up from hall door to room then countenance have be anxiety for darling afterwards have be sweetness for darling friend from day to present one lady desmond have ever given sweetest smile fitzgerald be not man to be cowed by woman look met hers by full front face in return did not allow eye for moment to fall before hers yet did not look at haughtily with defiance with aspect showed that be ashamed of nothing that have done whether have done anything that ought to be ashamed of clara said countess in voice fell with awful severity on poor girl ear have better return to house with yes mamma will wait on to morrow lady desmond said fitzgerald in tone seemed to countess to be in present state of affair almost impertinent man have certainly be misbehaving yet there be not about slightest symptom of shame yes said countess be will write note to if be necessary good morning good bye lady desmond said owen a took off hat with left hand put out right to shake hand with a be customary with lady desmond be at first inclined to refuse courtesy either thought better of such intention else have not courage to maintain for at parting did give hand good bye lady clara also shook hand with need hardly be said that there be lover pressure in grasp good bye said clara through tear in saddest soberest tone be going away happy light hearted with nothing to trouble have to encounter fearful task of telling own crime have to depart with mother mother who though never absolutely unkind have so rarely be tender with then brother desmond said fitzgerald walk a far a lodge with like good fellow have something want to say to mother thought for moment that must call son back then bethought that also might a well be without so young earl showing plainly by eye that knew that much be matter went back with fitzgerald towards lodge what be have done now said earl boy have sort of idea that offence committed be with reference to sister tone be hardly a gracious a be usual with want of kindliness at present moment grated on owen ear resolved at once to tell whole story out then leave to earl to take in dudgeon in brotherly friendship a might please desmond said can not guess what have passed between sister be not good at guessing answered brusquely have told that loved must have for wife have asked to love in return there be open manliness about almost disarmed earl anger have felt strong attachment to fitzgerald be very unwilling to give up friendship nevertheless have idea that be presumption on part of mr fitzgerald of hap house to look up to sister between owen earl coronet never weighed feather must not have abandoned boy heart to man fellowship more thoroughly have that man be earl a well a must not get over feeling that fitzgerald worldly position be beneath of sister that marriage on sister part must be mesalliance doubting therefore in sort dismayed in sort also angry did not at once give reply well desmond what have to say to be head of family young a be be right must tell tell of course ought to tell see what youngness have to do with did say well said little man must never boast that lady have favoured did not reject paused moment then added after honesty truth be best have reason to think that love poor young lord felt that have double duty hardly knew how to perform owed duty to sister be paramount to others then owed duty also to friend who have be so kind to did not know how to turn round upon tell that be not fit to marry sister what do say to desmond hardly know what to say must be very bad match for know be capital fellow best fellow going there be nobody about anywhere that like so much in thinking of sister must put out of question yes be just like for friend better than one else clara ought ought ought ought to look higher must say yes be just what mean want to offend know desmond boy like better for be fine fellow thoroughly respect let talk sensibly about though sister rank be high oh want to talk about rank be bosh care about hap house be small place clara must be doing well what be more be quite sure countess will not hear of wo approve then ca say will well be honest of be very glad have told at once clara will tell mother at rate there will be secret good bye old fellow good bye said earl then shook hand rode off towards hap house lord desmond pondered over matter time standing alone near lodge then walked slowly back towards mansion have said that rank be bosh in so saying have at moment spoken out generously feeling of heart that feeling regarded rather than sister if properly analyzed must merely have signified that though proud enough of own rank did not require that friend must be of same standing a regarded sister certainly must not be well pleased to see marry small squire with small income chapter iv countess countess a walked back with daughter towards house have to bethink for minute two a to how must act what must say knew felt that knew what have occurred if daughter manner have not told downcast eye repressed sob mingled look of shame fear if have not read truth from must have learned from tone of fitzgerald voice look of triumph sat upon countenance then wondered that must be so seeing that have still regarded clara a being in thing child a thought further wondered at own fatuity in have allowed to be so grossly deceived clara said what be oh mamma have better come on to house dear speak to there in mean time collect thought remember clara that have honour of great family to maintain poor clara what have great family done for how have be taught to maintain honour knew that be earl daughter that people called lady clara whereas other young lady be only called miss so so have not be taught to separate from ordinary throng of young lady by other distinction great family have done nothing special for placed before for example grandly noble deed at old house at desmond court company be scarce money be scarce servant be scarce have be confided to care of very ordinary governess if there be about anything be great good be intrinsically own by mean due to intrinsic advantage derived from grand family why must not give what be so entirely own to one whom loved to one by whom so pleased to be loved then entered house clara followed mother to countess own small up stair sitting room daughter did not ordinarily share room with mother when entered seldom did so with pleasurable emotion at present moment have hardly strength to close door after now clara what be said countess sitting down in accustomed chair mamma can one blame in so far equivocated clara know very well what mean what have there be between mr fitzgerald guilt stricken wretch sat silent for while sustaining scrutiny of mother gaze then falling from chair on to knee hid face in mother lap exclaiming oh mamma mamma look at like lady desmond heart be somewhat softened by appeal must have thought that be cruel woman unnatural mother have not be lot to make absolute dearest heartiest friend of daughter a mother do friend between whom there must be nay must be secret must not become young again in sharing romance of daughter love in enjoying gaiety of daughter ball in planning dress amusement triumph with child mother can do think be mother who enjoy most fully delight of maternity be not case with lady desmond yet loved child must have made reasonable sacrifice for what regarded a child welfare dear said in softened tone must tell have occurred do not know that be duty to ask yours to tell can not be right that there must be secret understanding between mr fitzgerald know that clara do not yes mamma said clara remembering that lover have bade tell mother everything well love clara story be very simple did not in fact want telling be merely old well worn tale so common through world have laughed on lass with bonny black eye be ready to go to mountain to hear love tale one may say that occurrence so very common must not want much telling mamma say well dear say oh mamma must not help clara certainly must not help what might say to must not refuse to listen to lady in such case when be on term of intimacy with gentleman a be with mr fitzgerald be bound to listen to to give answer must not help what might say clara question now be what answer did give to what said clara who be still kneeling looked up piteously into mother face sighed bitterly said nothing told that loved suppose yes mamma suppose gave answer eh dear answer to be long sigh clara must tell be absolutely necessary must know whether have given hope if so how much of course whole thing must be stopped at once young a be can not think that marriage with mr owen fitzgerald must be proper match for to make of course whole thing must cease at once at once here there be piteous sigh before take step must know what have said to surely have not told that have feeling for warmer than ordinary regard lady desmond knew what be doing very well be perfectly sure that daughter have pledged troth to owen fitzgerald indeed if made mistake in matter be in thinking that clara have given more absolute assurance of love than have in truth be extracted from calculated calculated wisely that surest way of talking daughter out of hope be to express a unable to believe that child of hers must own to love for one so much beneath to speak of such marriage a thing absolutely impossible method of acting in manner have effect desired poor girl be utterly frightened began to fear that have disgraced though knew that dearly loved man of whom mother spoke so slightingly have given promise clara not promise mamma not promise what then have professed regard for upon clara be again silent then suppose must believe that have professed regard for that have promised to love mamma have not promised anything when asked did did refuse will be observed that lady desmond never once asked daughter what be feeling never occurred to to inquire even within own heart a to what might be most conducive to child happiness meant to do duty by clara therefore resolved at once to put stop to whole affair now desisted from interrogatory sitting silent for while looked out into extent of flat ground before house poor clara while sat silent also awaiting doom clara said mother at last must of course be made to cease be very young very young indeed therefore blame fault be with with entirely mamma say be have behaved very badly have betrayed trust be placed in when be admitted here so intimately a patrick friend be sure have not intended to betray trust said clara through sob conviction be beginning to come upon that must be forced to give up lover must not bring to hear so much evil spoken of have not behaved like gentleman continued countess looking very stern visit here must of course be altogether discontinued be sorry on brother account for patrick be very fond of not so fond a be thought clara to herself did not dare to speak thought out loud be quite sure that brother young a be will not continue to associate with friend who have thought so slightly of sister honour of course will let mr fitzgerald know that can come here more want from be promise that will on account see again hold correspondence with be wanted clara timid a be hesitated before must give promise so totally at variance with pledge felt that have given hardly hour since to fitzgerald knew acknowledged to herself that have given pledge although have given in silence how then be to give other pledge to mother mean to say that hesitate said lady desmond looking a though be thunderstruck at existence of such hesitation wish to suppose that intend to persevere in such insanity clara must have from distinct promise what might be dreadful alternative countess did not at minute say perhaps thought that countenance might be more effective than speech in thinking so be probably right must be remembered that clara desmond be a yet only seventeen that be young even for age must be remembered also that knew nothing of world way of own privilege a creature with soul heart of own of what might be true extent of mother right over have not in enough of matured thought to teach to say that must make promise must bind for ever that for present in present state must obey mother order thus promise be exacted given if find deceiving clara said countess will never forgive hitherto lady desmond may probably have played part well well considering object played very badly in showing that thought possible that daughter must play false be now clara turn to be proud indignant mamma said holding head high looking at mother boldly through tear have never deceived yet very well dear will take step to prevent intruding on further there may be end of matter now have doubt that have endeavoured to use influence with patrick will tell brother not to speak of matter further so saying dismissed daughter shortly afterwards earl came in there be conference between mother though be agreed on subject though be decided that must not do for clara to throw away on county cork squire with eight hundred year cadet in family man likely to rise to nothing still earl must not hear abused patrick must not come here more said countess well suppose not will be very dull know that wish clara have made such as then boy went away talked kindly over matter to poor sister countess have task still before must make known family resolution to owen fitzgerald when child have left one after other sat at window for hour looking at nothing turning over own thought in mind hitherto have expressed a being very angry with daughter lover so angry that have said that be faithless traitor gentleman have called dissipated spendthrift have threatened future wife if ever must have one with kind of misery must fall to woman lot now began to think of perhaps more kindly have be very angry with more so because have such cause to be angry with with own lack of judgment own ignorance of man character own folly with reference to daughter have never asked whether loved fitzgerald have never done so till now now knew that sharpest blow have received that day be assurance that be indifferent to herself have never thought too old to be on equality with on equality in point of age a men woman feel when learn to love other therefore have not occurred to that must regard daughter a other than child to lady desmond clara be child how then must be more to yet now be too plain that have looked on clara a woman in what light then must have thought of woman mother so with saddened heart subdued anger continued to gaze through window till without be dusk dark there can be to woman remembrance of age so strong a of seeing daughter go forth to world married woman if doe not tell mother that time of own youth have passed away nothing will ever bring tale home have not quite come to with lady desmond clara be not going forth to world a married woman here be one now who have judged a fit to be so taken one be very man of others in whose estimation lady desmond must have wished to drop few of year encumbered be not however weak woman so performed task have candle brought to sitting down wrote note to owen fitzgerald saying that must call at hap house at hour named on following day have written three four letter before have made up mind exactly a to one must send at first have desired to come to there at desmond court then thought of danger there might be of clara seeing of danger also of own feeling towards when must be there with in own house in accustomed way tried to say by letter that behoved to say so that there need be meeting in failed one letter be stern arrogant next be soft hearted so that might teach to think that love for clara might yet be successful at last resolved to go to hap house accordingly wrote letter despatched fitzgerald be of course aware of subject of threatened visit when determined to make proposal to clara matter did not seem to to be one in chance of success be desperate if thought must induce girl to love other smaller difficulty might be made to vanish from path have now induced girl to own that did love not le did begin to see that difficulty be far from vanishing lady desmond must never have taken upon to make journey to hap house have not sentence of absolute banishment from desmond court be passed against mr fitzgerald began a soon a found alone with will understand what have induced to seek here after imprudence with lady clara desmond must not of course ask to come to desmond court may have be presumptuous lady desmond think have be imprudent love daughter dearly told so immediately afterwards told same to brother doubt have told same to yes have mr fitzgerald clara a be well aware be child absolutely child much more so than be usual with girl of age knowledge of must think have protected from advance absolutely deny such knowledge more than think that be greatly mistaken a to character mistaken sir a to own daughter yes lady desmond think be think on matter mr fitzgerald need not trouble for expression of thought need argue that subject further must of course be aware that idea of such marriage a must be laid aside on what ground lady desmond now appeared to countess to be rather impudent on part of young squire reason why owen fitzgerald of hap house must not marry daughter of earl of desmond seemed to to be so conspicuous conclusive that must hardly be necessary to enumerate such a be might not be pleasant to announce in hearing though owen fitzgerald be so evidently unfit suitor for earl daughter might still be possible that must be acceptable to earl widow ah if might be possible to teach two lesson at same time on what ground mr fitzgerald said repeating question surely need hardly tell did not son say same thing to yesterday a walked with down avenue yes told candidly that looked higher for sister liked for candour be reason must agree with be much more important that sister must do so if think that can be happy in such home a can give know why why must object think then might give to blacksmith if be mad enough to wish thank for compliment lady desmond have driven to sir believe be considered in world said be in country that one great difference be between gentleman lady who be not gentleman lady lady doe not degrade if marry gentleman even though gentleman rank be le high than own be not question of degradation of prudence of ordinary caution a mother be bound to use a regard daughter oh mr fitzgerald now altered tone a spoke to have be so pleased to know so happy to have there why have destroyed by one half hour folly folly a call lady desmond have be premeditated for last twelve month for twelve month said taken absolutely by surprise in surprise believing yes for twelve month ever since began to know daughter have loved say that daughter be child also thought so time last year in last winter holiday thought so then though loved a child kept to myself now be woman so thinking have spoken to a one have told that loved a now tell that come what may must continue to do so have made believe be indifferent to absence perhaps distance might have taught to forget such think be not case must forget now never lady desmond nonsense sir child doe not know own mind that think of lover a doe of new toy whose first appearance in world be only made other night at cousin house ought to feel ashamed of such passion mr fitzgerald be very far from being ashamed of lady desmond at rate let tell daughter have promised most solemnly that will see again have correspondence with know of that word be sacred can excuse on account of youth young a be already see own folly in having allowed so to address for mr fitzgerald under circumstance can make excuse for be yours do think sort of house to young girl must be brought a bride be life be companion of kind must most profit be sorry that drive to remind of thing face became very dark brow stern a sin be thus cast into teeth from what know of lady desmond said a spoke assumed dignity of demeanour made more inclined to love than ever have be before do think must be man to introduce young wife to such companion a to whom allude do not know be not sure in own heart that marriage with daughter must instantly put end to that may be own thought be not likely to be unfavourable to for patrick sake mean may be own thought will not subject daughter to risk mr fitzgerald must allow to say that income be altogether insufficient for want own have fortune want none with will not argue matter with did not come to argue to tell with a little offence a may be possible that marriage be absolutely impossible daughter have already abandoned thought of thought then must be wonderfully under own control much more so than mine be lord desmond may be sure will not hear of lord desmond can not at present be le of child than sister know that mr fitzgerald at rate lady desmond will not put happiness a far a be concerned in sister happiness at disposal when told that loved did not speak a seem to think from impulse of moment spoke because loved a love will of course try to win nothing can absolve from engagement to marriage with person countess have once twice made small effort to come to term of peace with rather to truce under there might still be friendship between accompanied however by positive condition that clara must be omitted from participation in must have be willing to say let be forgotten only for time to come clara can not meet other fitzgerald must by mean agree to such term countess be obliged to leave house having in effect only thrown down gauntlet of battle having in vain attempted to extend over olive branch of peace helped however into little pony carriage at parting gave hand just touched then taking off hat bowed courteously to a drove from door chapter v fitzgerald of castle richmond what idea of carrying out plan may have be prevalent in fitzgerald mind when be so defiant of countess may be difficult to say probably have idea felt at spur of moment that must be weak to yield consequence be that when lady desmond left hap house be obliged to consider a being at feud with family young lord did see once again during holiday even entertained at hap house earl pride must not give way inch much a like owen can not do anything oppose must be bad match for sister so 'd feel if be in place then lord desmond went back to eton after none of met for many month during time life went on in very triste manner at desmond court lady desmond felt that have done duty by daughter tenderness to clara be not increased by fact that foolish attachment have driven fitzgerald from place a for clara not only kept word rigidly resolved to keep twice returned unopened without word of notice letter owen have caused to be conveyed to hand be not that have ceased to love have high idea of truth honour must not break word perhaps be sustained in misery by remembrance that heroine be always miserable then orgy at hap house became hotter faster hitherto there have perhaps be more smoke than fire more calumny than sin fitzgerald when have intimated that presence of young wife must save from have not boasted falsely now that friend have turned back upon that be banished from desmond court twitted with iniquity at castle richmond threw off restraint endeavoured to enjoy in own way so orgy became fast furious of course reached ear of poor clara desmond during summer holiday lord desmond be not at home owen fitzgerald be also away have gone abroad perhaps with conviction that must be well that desmonds must not meet remained abroad till hunting season again commenced then winter came again lord desmond used to meet in field there must exchange courtesy to certain degree show that be intimate world knew that old friendship be over

potato upon potato only now at once potato failed greater part of eight million human being be left without food destruction of potato be work of god be natural to attribute suffering at once overwhelmed unfortunate country to god anger to wrath for misdeed of country have be guilty for believe in such exhibition of god anger when war come pestilence famine when people of land be worse than decimated living hardly able to bury dead can not coincide with who must deprecate god wrath by prayer believe that god stalk darkly along cloud laying thousand low with arrow of death thousand most ignorant because men who be not ignorant have displeased if in wisdom did do so can think that men prayer must hinder that wisdom have seen to be good right though believe in exhibition of god anger do believe in exhibition of mercy when men by folly by shortness of vision have brought upon penalty seem to be overwhelming to end can be seen must be overwhelming be aid coming to own then god raise hand not in anger in mercy by wisdom doe for that for own wisdom have be insufficient on christian basis can understand justice acknowledge propriety of asking lord to abate wrath in detail to alter settled purpose if be wise must change wisdom if be merciful must limit mercy there come upon strange disease bid to stay hand disease when have passed by have taught lesson of cleanliness master le stern must have made acceptable famine strike again beg that hand may be stayed beg a greek be said to beg when thought that anger of phoebus be hot against because priest have be dishonoured so beg thinking that god anger be hot also against lo famine pass by land have be brought to dust by man folly be once more prosperous happy if be ever so in world history be so in ireland at time of be speaking country especially in south west have be brought to terrible pas not a so many said do say by idolatry of popery by sedition of demagogue even mainly by idleness of people idolatry of popery to way of thinking be bad though not so bad in ireland a in most other papist country have visited sedition also be bad in ireland in late year have not be deep seated a may have be noted at ballingarry other place where endeavour be made to bring sedition to proof a for idleness of ireland people be inclined to think will work under same compulsion same persuasion produce work in other country fault have be lowness of education consequent want of principle among middle class fault have be found a strongly marked among protestant a have be among roman catholic young men be brought up to hing property be regarded a having duty attached to men became rapacious determined to extract uttermost farthing out of land within power let consequence to people on land be what might used to hear much of absentee be not absence of absentee did damage presence of left behind on soil scourge of ireland be existence of class who looked to be gentleman living on property who must have earned bread by work of brain failing that by sweat of brow there be men to be found in shoal through country speaking of property boasting of place who owned property have place when matter came to be properly sifted most englishman have heard of profit rent in ireland term be so common that man can not have heard of may of course designate very becoming sort of income man may for instance take plot of land for one hundred pound year improve build on till be fairly worth one thousand pound year thus enjoy profit rent of nine hundred pound nothing can be better fairer in ireland management be very different men there held tract of ground very often at full value paying for such proportion of rent a farmer must afford to pay in england live irish tenant must by mean consent to be farmer be needful to that must be gentleman that son must be taught to live amuse a son of gentleman barring such small trifle a education did live in way to enable to do so underlet land in small patch at amount of rent to collect took whole labour of tenant whole produce of small patch over above quantity of potato absolutely necessary to keep tenant body soul together thus state of thing be engendered in ireland discouraged labour discouraged improvement in farming discouraged produce from land except potato crop maintained one class of men in what considered to be gentility of idleness class people of country in abjectness of poverty be with thorough rejoicing almost with triumph declare that idle genteel class have be cut up root branch have be driven forth out of holding into wide world have be punished with penalty of extermination poor cotter suffered sorely under famine under pestilence followed famine a class have risen from bed of suffering better man be thriving a labourer in own country in newer for better land to have emigrated even in ireland can now get eight nine shilling week easier with more constancy than must get four fifteen year since other man have gone place be left happily vacant there be infinite number of smaller bearing in question of famine of agricultural distress in ireland may be regarded must be regarded by who wish to understand manner in poor law be first rejected then accepted then if one may say so swallowed whole by people way in emigration have affected difference in system of labour there from that here in former day be so strong that agricultural labourer living on wage buying food with be person hardly to be found thing must be regarded by one who must understand matter seeing that book of mine be novel have perhaps already written more on dry subject than many will read such having be state of country such wretchedness merciful god sent remedy might avail to arrest deprecated wrath will soon be known acknowledged acknowledged a be acknowledged that new city rise up in splendour from ash into old city have be consumed by fire if beneficent agency did not from time to time disencumber crowded place must ever be living in narrow alley with stinking gutter supply of water at minimum very frightful be flame a rush through chamber of poor very frightful be course of violent remedy brought ireland out of misfortune who saw course watched victim will not readily forget what saw slowly gradually with voice be for long time discredited news spread through country that food of people be gone that own crop be rotten useless cotter quickly knew realized idea that must work for wage if must get else go to poorhouse that crop of parish district be gone became evident to priest parson squire realized idea that must fall on other parish other district for support be long before fact made known that there be food in parish in district when be understood men certainly did put shoulder to wheel with great effort much abuse at time be thrown upon government who took upon management of relief of poor in south west be taken most severely to task be in country travelling always through during whole period have to say a did say at time with voice be not very audible that in opinion measure of government be prompt wise beneficent have to say also that effort of who managed poor be a rule unremitting honest impartial successful feeding of four million starving people with food to be brought from foreign land be not easy job government must bring food by striving to do so might

very old very valued servant have originally be brought up a child by mr wainwright in dorsetshire parsonage have since remained firm to fortune of young lady whose maid have become on first marriage a mistress have be promoted so have jones at first have be kitty to world now be mr jones to world at large jones to sir thomas mistress of late year to herbert known by manner of affectionate sobriquet to young lady sometimes must call johnny sometimes duchess doubtless mr jones thoroughly understood other by whole establishment mr jones be held in great respect by younger portion in extreme awe breakfast tea have in little sitting room by solitude of be too tremendous for to endure at dinner time at meal sat at head of table in servant hall though never troubled to carve anything except pudding pie for have great partiality of be supposed to be most undoubted severe judge known of anywhere in part of country be supposed by brother sister servant to be very croesus for wealth wondrous tale be told of money have put by a be certainly honest supposed to be very generous to certain poor relation in dorsetshire of story be probably mythic be known however a fact that two castle richmond butler one out door steward three neighbouring farmer one wickedly ambitious coachman have endeavoured to tempt to matrimony in vain did want none of told mistress what be more must have none of therefore remained mr jones with brevet rank seemed from what lady fitzgerald said that mr jones manner have be somewhat mysterious about man mollett have endeavoured to reassure comfort mistress saying that nothing must come of a nothing have come of other tenby visit giving a counsel that lady must allow whole matter to pas by without further notice at same time lady fitzgerald have remarked that manner have be very serious when first said that have seen man before jones lady fitzgerald have said to very earnestly if know more about man than be telling be bound to speak out let know everything who lady what must know only do look to like same man so thought right to say to ladyship lady fitzgerald have seen that there be nothing more to be gained by cross questioning so have allowed matter to drop be by mean satisfied that servant whom so trusted did not know more than have told then mr jones have be with in dreadful dorsetshire day undefined fear began to creep over very soul god bless child said lady fitzgerald a son got up to leave then embraced with more warmth even than be wont that can do at present be to be gentle with not to encourage people around to talk of illness on next morning lady fitzgerald did not come down to breakfast sent love to clara begged guest to excuse on account of headache sir thomas rarely came in to breakfast therefore absence be not remarkable daughter however went up to see a did also sister declared that be very much better be sudden attack suppose said clara yes very sudden have have same before said herbert at affect intellect bodily power depression be suppose name that doctor must call then at last became noticeable by that lady clara did not use left arm oh clara said emmeline see now that be hurt how selfish have be oh dear oh dear emmeline mary immediately surrounded examining arm almost carrying to sofa think will be much said clara be only little stiff oh herbert what will do do look here inside of arm be quite black herbert gently touching hand did examine arm declared opinion that have received dreadfully violent blow emmeline proposed to send for doctor to pronounce whether be broken mary said that did think be broken that be sure patient ought not to be moved day probably for week aunt letty in mean time prescribed cold water bandage with great authority bounced out of room to fetch necessary linen basin of water be nothing at continued clara indeed will go home to day indeed will might be very bad for arm that must be moved said herbert staying here will not be least trouble to will be so happy to have will not mary of course will so will mamma be so sorry to be here now said clara when know be in such trouble about sir thomas a for going will go a soon a ever can make convenient to send indeed will so matter be discussed between aunt letty in mean time binding up bruised arm with cold water appliance lady clara be quite firm about going therefore at about twelve be sent must say taken for emmeline insisted on going with in carriage herbert must have gone also felt that ought not to leave castle richmond day on account of father must certainly ride over said learn how arm be next morning about clady know said clara will go on to clady also did send man there yesterday to see about flue be flue be wrong know oh thank be so much obliged to said clara then carriage drove off herbert returned into morning sitting room with sister mary will tell what be master herbert said mary well what be be going to fall in love with young ladyship be be that know about who be going to fall in love with pray oh young lordship perhaps only ought to be about ten year older so that be afraid must do clara be just age for really seems a though be all prepared ready to hand girl always do think that thing be ready prepared so saying herbert walked off with great manly dignity to retreat among own book paper there to meditate whether thing be in truth prepared for certainly be fact that house did seem very blank to now that clara be gone that looked forward with impatience to visit be so necessary that must make on following day to clady house at castle richmond be very silent quiet day when emmeline came back sister remained together nothing have be said to about mollett visit have other idea than that lowness of spirit on father part to have gradually become accustomed have become worse more dangerous to health than ever aunt letty talked much about to herbert to lady fitzgerald to jones to brother be quite certain that have penetrated to depth of whole matter nasty city property said have come with grandmother have always given family more trouble than be worth indeed grandmother have be very troublesome woman altogether wonder for though be protestant herself have have papist relation in lancashire distinctly remembered to have heard that there be flaw in title of property knew that be very hard to get of tenant to pay rent that have always heard be quite sure that man be person laying claim to threatening to prosecute claim at law be thousand pity that brother must allow trifle a for after be trifle to fret spirit worry in way be wretched state of health be once again such annoyance a must pas by like wind must be acknowledged aunt letty memory in respect be not exactly correct for a happened sir thomas held little property in city of london by a firm tenure a law custom of country must give seeing that income thence arising came from ground rent near river on property stood worth hundred of thousand be not very probable that tenant must be in arrear what said have effect upon herbert be not quite sure whether might not be cause of father grief if story did not have much effect upon lady fitzgerald at rate did a well a other to exercise ingenuity affection of aunt letty sir thomas passed whole of day in own room during great portion of day wife sister son be with endeavoured not to leave alone with own thought feeling conscious that something preyed upon mind though ignorant a to what that something might be be quite aware of nature of thought perfectly conscious of judgment have formed respecting knew that be subjecting in eye not only of own family of around to suspicion must be injurious to yet must not shake off feeling depressed at last did resolve to make attempt at doing so for time in evening be altogether alone then strove to force mind to work upon matter occupied to arrange idea bring into state in must make resolution for hour have sat not thinking upon subject for thought be exertion requires combination of idea result in deducing of conclusion from premise such effort a have hitherto made endeavouring to think while allowed matter of grief to lie ever before mind eye have said to over over again that behoved to make great effort to shake off incubus depressed yet such effort have hitherto be even attempted now at last arose shook promised to that must be man might be that misfortune under groaned be heavy let one sorrow be what may there be always better worse way of meeting let what trouble may fall on man shoulder man may always bear manfully be not trouble when so borne half cured be flinching from pain make pain so painful truth came home to a sat there that day thinking what must do endeavouring to think in what way might best turn there be be especially grievous to that have friend whom might consult in matter be sorrow cause of must not explain to own family in other trouble have sought assistance looked for counsel there there only have have one best steadiest dearest truest counsellor now have come to pas that thing be so placed that in great trouble must not go to now friend be so necessary to felt that be not fit to judge how must act in terrible emergency that be absolutely necessary for that must allow to be guided by one else to whom must appeal be cold man said to a one name did occur to very cold almost unfeeling be honest just then again sat thought yes be honest just what must want better than honesty justice then shuddering a resolved did resolve that must send for honest just man must send for perhaps better still go to at rate must tell whole truth of grief then act a cold just man must bid need not do yet not quite yet so at least said to falsely if man decide with fixed decision that tooth must come out leg be cut off let come out leg be cut off on earliest possible opportunity be flinching from such pain be so grievously painful be something to have brought mind to bear with fixed purpose upon thing to have resolved upon what must do though still lacked strength to put resolution immediately to proof then later in evening son came sat with be able in sort to declare that worst of evil day have passed from will breakfast with to morrow said a spoke faint smile passed across face oh hope will said herbert will be so delighted father exert too soon will do good think be sure will if fatigue be not too much truth be herbert have allowed feeling to grow upon till have become weak under know ought to make exertion to throw off be possible may succeed herbert muttered few hopeful word found very difficult to know what ought to say that father have secret be quite sure be hard to talk to man about secret without knowing what that secret be have allowed to fall into weak state continued sir thomas speaking slowly while by proper exertion might have avoided have be very ill father said herbert yes have be ill very ill certainly know that doctor must have helped father herbert ask question inquire at rate not at present will endeavour now at least will endeavour to do duty urge by question appear to notice if be infirm father if must comfort ah if must never mind will endeavour to shake off depression herbert comfort mother let think much of if can be helped how can be helped tell there be matter trouble mind be about property father yes certainly be about property in one sense then heed will none of heed who have so good right to say so a bless darling boy herbert such thing must be heeded more le know may tell mother perhaps may comfort have made up mind to go to london to see prendergast will explain whole of thing to a bid so will act be thought to be satisfactory to certain extent by mother son must have be better pleased have opened heart to told everything that be clear must not bring to do mr prendergast have heard be good man in present state be better that must seek counsel of man than allow sorrow to feed upon alone chapter x rector of drumbarrow wife herbert fitzgerald in speaking of rev aeneas townsend to lady clara desmond have said that in opinion reverend gentleman be good man bad clergyman there be not few in county cork who must have said just reverse declared to be bad man good clergyman there be others indeed who knew well who must have declared to be perfect in respect others again who thought in respect to be very bad amidst great diversity of opinion will venture on none of own will attempt to describe in ireland stanch protestantism consists too much in hatred of papistry in rather than in hatred of error against protestant be supposed to protest hence cross must presume be emblem of salvation to creates feeling of dismay often of disgust instead of love reverence very name of saint savour in irish protestant ear of idolatry although irish protestant on sunday profess to believe in communion of such be feeling rather than opinion of most protestant of irish protestant be intelligible that must have be produced by close vicinity of roman catholic worship in mind of men who be energetic excitable not always discreet argumentative one of such be mr townsend few men carried protestant fervour further than did cross be to what red cloth be supposed to be to bull so averse be to intercession of saint that always regarded a wolf in sheep clothing certain english clergyman who have written to letter dated from feast of st michael angel on account herbert fitzgerald took upon to say that regarded a bad clergyman whereas most of protestant neighbour looked upon enthusiasm a chief excellence admiration for induced friend to overlook what must have acknowledged to be defect in character though have good living at least what laity in speaking of clerical income be generally inclined to call good living will say amounting in value to four hundred pound year be always in debt be more inexcusable a have child have small private mean nobody knew why be in debt in word nobody must certainly be included have personal expense of own wife though be very queer woman a lady clara have said must hardly be called extravagant woman there be nothing large splendid about way of living at glebe anybody who came there be willing to feed a long a chose to stay good many in way did feed never invited guest a for giving regular fixed dinner party a parish rector do in england such idea ever crossed brain of mr mr townsend that be charitable world admitted admirer professed that hence arose difficulty charity be of most indiscreet kind money rarely have to give therefore must give promise to pay while credit with butcher baker be good must give meat bread functionary have by time learned that though mr townsend might not be able to pay such bill friend must do so sooner later if duly pressed therefore larder at drumbarrow glebe be name of parish be never long empty then again be never long full mr mr townsend be content to bestow charity without other object than of relieving material want by alms many infidel mr townsend argued have be made believer by miracle of loaf fish therefore be permissible for to make use of same mean for drawing over proselyte to true church if must find hungry papist convert into well fed protestant by one same process must be doing double good argued must by possibility be doing evil such being character of mr townsend will not be thought surprising that must have warm admirer hot detractor who be inclined to be among latter be not slow to add up certain little disagreeable eccentricity among list of fault a young fitzgerald have done in matter of dirty surplice mr townsend be most uncompromising foe for many year have be rev bernard m'carthy parish priest for same parish of drumbarrow father bernard a be called by own flock father barney a protestant in derision be delighted to name be much more man of world than protestant colleague did not do half so many absurd thing a did mr townsend professed to laugh at what called protestant madness of rector also have be eager may also say malicious antagonist what called souping system of protestant clergyman stank in nostril that system by a stated most ignorant of men be to be induced to leave faith by hope of soup other food be a firmly convinced of inward heart destroying iniquity of parson a parson be of of priest so two men have learned to hate other yet of be bad men wish to be understood that sort of feeling always prevailed in irish parish between priest parson even before day of famine have met priest at parson table have known more than one parish in protestant roman catholic clergyman lived together on amicable term feeling a above represented be common be by mean held a proof that party be quarrelsome malicious be part of religious conviction who dare to interfere with religious conviction of clergyman on day one after on castle richmond lady have be thrown from car on frosty road mr townsend father bernard be brought together in amicable way in way be intended to be amicable for first time in life relief committee for district in lived be one same be of course well that must act on when matter be first arranged father bernard took bull by horn went there mr townsend hearing did not do so now that have become evident that much work for long time must have to be performed at committee be clear that mr townsend a protestant clergyman must not remain away without neglecting duty so after many mental struggle question of conscience parson agreed to meet priest point have be very deeply discussed between rector wife have given a opinion that priest m'carthy be pitch pitch in blackest turpitude a such must not be touched without defilement have not protestant clergyman of ireland in body at rate who be worth anything who must with truth be called protestant clergyman have not refused to enter door of national school because must not do so without sharing ministration there with papist priest with priest of altar of baal a mr townsend called must now yield when after assistance needed be only for body not for soul may be seen from that lady mind be not in nature logical extreme absurdity of argument though did not ultimately have desired effect by mean came home to understanding of husband thought that there be great deal in what said almost felt that be yielding to instigation from evil one public opinion be too strong for public opinion innate kindness of own heart felt that at very moment ought to labour specially for body of poor people a at other time must labour specially for soul so yielded well said wife to a got off car at own door after meeting what have done one might have imagined from tone of voice manner that expected at least hoped to hear that priest have be absolutely exterminated made away with in good fight mr townsend made immediate answer proceeded to divest of rusty outside coat to rub up stiff grizzled bristly uncombed hair with hand a be wont when be not quite satisfied with state of thing suppose be there said mr townsend oh yes be there be never away take when there be talking to be done now mr townsend dearly loved to hear talk man be louder against sin of other orator then began to ask how many minute wanted to dinner time mr townsend knew way must not have ghost of chance of getting from true substantial account of what have really passed if persevered in direct question to effect so pretended to drop matter went fetched lord slipper putting on of constituted evening toilet then after little hurrying inquiry in kitchen promised dinner in fifteen minute be herbert fitzgerald there oh yes be always there be nice young fellow very fine young fellow what think understands irish roman catholic understands more than than than slipper said having in vain cudgelled brain for better comparison know what aunt letty say about doubt be quite right know mr townsend by did not mean to insinuate that herbert be at afflicted in way attempt to designate when say that one of friend be not right at same time touch head with forefinger have intended to convey impression that young man religious idea be not exactly of stanch true blue description admired well have just come from oxford know said mr townsend at present moment oxford be most dangerous place to young man can be sent sir thomas must send there though remember telling aunt over over again how must be mr townsend a spoke shook head sorrowfully mean to say know that be absolutely bitten oh know understand when come to cross candlestick next step to glory of mary be very easy one must sooner send young man to rome than to oxford at one might be shocked disgusted at other be cajoled cheated ruined then mr townsend threw back in chair threw eye up towards ceiling there be hypocrisy pretence in expression of feeling did in heart of heart believe that there be college club of papist at oxford emissary of pope of jesuit in moment of sterner thought latter be enemy most feared whereas when be simply pervaded by usual chronic hatred of irish roman catholic hierarchy be wont to inveigh most against pope college maintained be fearfully successful in drawing away soul of young english student indeed at oxford man have chance against devil thing be better at cambridge though even there there be great danger look at z must name two pervert to church of rome of whom have learned that be cambridge men thank god trinity college still stood firm idea be that if there be left real protestant truth in church of england that church must look to feed lamb by hand of shepherd chosen from seminary from seminary only be dinner nearly ready said mr townsend whose idea be not so exclusively protestant a be of wife have have morsel since breakfast then wife who be peculiarly anxious to keep in good humour that might come out about father barney made little visit to kitchen at last dinner be served weather be very cold rector wife considered more cosy to use only parlour not to migrate into cold air of second room indeed during winter month drawing room of drumbarrow glebe be only used for visitor for visitor who be not intimate enough in house to be placed upon worn chair threadbare carpet of dining parlour very cold be that drawing room found to be by visitor parlour be warm enough warm cosy though perhaps at time little close of evening there must pervade smell of whisky punch not altogether acceptable to unaccustomed nostril not that rector of drumbarrow be by mean intemperate man single tumbler of whisky toddy repeated only on sunday other rare occasion must by mean equal in point of drinking ordinary port of ordinary english clergyman whisky punch doe leave behind savour of intrinsic virtue delightful doubt to who have imbibed grosser element not equally acceptable to others who may have be le fortunate during dinner there be conversation about herbert fitzgerald committee father barney old gardener who waited at table with garden clothes on whom neighbour with respectful deference called mr townsend butler be roman catholic a indeed be servant at glebe a be necessarily native servant in part of country though mr mr townsend put great trust in servant jerry a to ordinary duty of gardening driving butlering must not knowingly trust with word of habitual conversation about thing around idea be that word so heard be carried to priest that priest kept book in word so uttered be written down if be so through parish priest must in truth have have something to do for private secretary for in spite of precaution be taken jerry jerry brother doubt did hear much of what be said repetition to priest however must take leave to doubt after dinner when hot water whisky be on table when two old arm chair be drawn cozily up on rug with old footstool before when faithful wife have mixed that glass of punch jug rather for after old fashion be brewed in such receptacle when to inspire increased confidence have put into small extra modicum of eloquent spirit then mouth of rector be opened mr townsend be made happy so father barney have met at last said rather cheerily a hot fume of toddy regaled nostril how did behave now well be decent enough be a far a absolute behaviour went ca have silk purse from off sow ear know indeed goodness know there be plenty of sow ear about now aeneas dear do tell how be just from beginning be there before said husband catch weasel asleep said wife did catch asleep at rate continued be there before when went into little room where hold meeting be at berryhill be yes at widow casey to see woman bowing scraping curtsying to father barney own mother brother daughter be best thing in world be just to do honour before quality know exactly when went in there be nobody there reverence master herbert a thick a possible suppose dear dear be dreadful did put sugar enough in aeneas well know perhaps may give small lump at rate did forget whisky be sure be taste too strong after such work a have have to day so young fitzgerald father barney yes there be with head together be something about mill be saying oh be perfectly dreadful herbert stopped introduced at once to father barney what regular introduction like indeed did do altogether badly said something about being glad to see two gentleman together gentleman indeed who be so anxious to do best must in parish whose influence be so great something to effect then shook hand did shake hand oh yes if went there at be necessary must do be very glad be not that be think must shake hand with father barney there be knowing what can do dear till try h m said mr townsend meaning to signify thereby that be still strong in strength of own impossibility then there be little general conversation about potato for one came in for quarter of hour so priest said that be a badly off in limerick clare a be here now believe that when asked how knew quoted 'freeman 'freeman indeed just like wonder be 'nation ' in mr townsend estimation parish priest be much to blame because did not draw public information from newspaper specially addicted to support of protestant cause then somers came in took chair be very much afraid at one time father barney be going to seat there must possibly have stood have made up mind what to do must have walked about room looked on whole affair a altogether irregular a though there be chairman somers be of course proper man who else came there be o'leary from boherbue be papist oh yes there be majority of there be greilly man who have got that large take of land over beyond banteer then barney coadjutor came in what that wretched looking man from gortnaclough yes be curate of parish know did shake hand with too indeed did never saw fellow look so ashamed of in life well there be much shame about generally there be much about by by never heard man talk such trash in life till somers put down oh be put down be glad of to do father barney justice did tell to hold tongue fool began to make regular set speech father barney suppose did choose that anybody must do did enough for two certainly never heard man so fond of own voice what want be to rule just own way of course doe be just what wo let do what other reason can there be for going there so matter be discussed what absolute step be taken by committee how agreed to buy so much meal of such merchant at price with such fund how be to be resold never given away on pretext how mr somers have explained that giving away mean be killing goose laid golden egg when young priest in attitude for oratory declared that poor have money with to make purchase how in few week time must be able to grind own flour at herbert fitzgerald mill be also told telling did not give so much gratification to mr townsend a sly hit against two priest then while be still in middle of when punch jug have given way to teapot rector be beginning to bethink that nap in arm chair must be very refreshing jerry came into room to announce richard have come over from castle richmond with note for riverence so richard be shown in now richard might very well have sent in note by jerry after contained only information with reference to list of old woman herbert fitzgerald have promised to send over to glebe richard knew that minister must wish to chat with richard have indisposition for little conversation hope yer riverences be quite well then said richard a tendered note making double bow so a to include pretty well thank said mr townsend how be family well then be rightly considhering masther just what war know ma'be be afraid not be afraid not said rector will not take glass of spirit richard yer riverence know never doe that said richard with somewhat of conscious look of high morality for be rigid teetotaller do mean to say that stick to always said mr townsend who firmly believed that good must come out of nazareth that even abstinence from whisky must be bad if accompanied by anything in shape of roman catholic ceremony do mean to say ma'be never touched dhrop of anything sthronger than wather barring tay since time got pledge from blessed apostle richard boldly crossed in presence of knew well whom meant by blessed apostle be father mathew temperance be very good thing however may come by said mr townsend who meant to imply by richard temperance have be come by in worst way possible be thrue for sir said richard never knew pledge kept only blessed apostle by meant to imply that sanctity inherent in mr townsend sacerdotal proceeding must be of such efficacy then mr townsend read note ah yes said tell mr herbert that be very much obliged to there will be other answer necessary very well yer riverence will be sure to give mr message richard made sign a though be going tell richard said mr townsend be sir thomas better for have be really very uneasy about indeed be dail betther morning lord be praised be kind of fit be richard asked parson sort of fit of illness of kind be thinking said richard who have mind to speak of family secret out of door might be called upon to tell priest at rate be not called on to tell anything to parson be very sudden time be richard asked lady immediately after strange man be shown into room eh be sure ma'be ca say think be have'porth worse than ordinar till after gentleman went away did hear that did business with gentleman just a usual like then fell into

have be one too many for parson wife jerry said richard a walked out into yard together to get castle richmond pony doe often thry to make prothestant of now prothestants be d said jerry who by mean shared in richard good gift a to temper well must say that at laist not of of like of be used to said jerry then richard not waiting to do further battle on behalf of protestant friend trotted out of yard chapter xi second love on day after clara departure herbert did a matter of course make promised visit at desmond court be on day that sir thomas have be driving about in pony carriage with lady fitzgerald a richard have reported herbert have be with father in morning then having seen mother well packed up in shawl cloak have mounted horse ridden off may be kept time said a have promised to go on to clady see after soup kitchen must wonder if herbert became attached to clara desmond said mother to sir thomas soon after have begun excursion do think so said baronet tone be certainly not exactly that of approbation well yes certainly do think probable be sure admires think very likely to come to more must there be objection be very young said sir thomas in herbert position will not young marriage be best thing for have fortune not shilling if doe marry young quite young know might be prudent that wife must have something of own 'd live here said lady fitzgerald who knew that of men husband be usually most free from mercenary feeling over anxiety a to increased wealth either for for child think must be such comfort to herbert see be so fond of county business so little anxious for what young men generally consider pleasure there be nothing more said about at moment for question in measure touched upon money matter consideration a to property from of lady fitzgerald at present wished to keep husband mind free towards end of drive again referred to be nice girl be very nice think a far a have seen be pretty certainly very pretty more than pretty much more will be beautiful be such mere child think that anything will come of immediately not quite immediately oh certainly not quite immediately think herbert be not calculated to be very sudden in such feeling in expression of do think event very probable before winter be over in mean time herbert spent whole day over at desmond court at clady found countess delighted to see lady clara went on with to clady be past five quite dark before reached castle richmond so that barely got home in time to dress for dinner dinner party that evening be more pleasant than usual sir thomas not only dined with came into drawing room after dinner to certain extent joined in conversation lady fitzgerald must see that be done by great effort be not remarked by aunt letty others who be delighted to have with to see once more interested about interest now building of mill have be settled final order be to be given by herbert at spot on following morning can go with to berryhill suppose ca said mary will be in great hurry said herbert who clearly did not wish to be encumbered by sister on special expedition why be to be in such hurry to morrow asked aunt letty well will be hurried have promised to go to clady again must be back here early must get horse why herbert be becoming hercules of energy said father smiling will have enough to do if look to soup kitchen on desmond property a well a own made sort of promise about particular affair at clady must carry out said herbert will pay devoir to fair lady clara on way home of course said mary more than probable replied stay so late again that will hardly be here in time for dinner continued mary to little sally brother vouchsafed answer emmeline said nothing lady clara be specially friend be too anxious to secure sister in law to make joke upon subject on occasion nothing more be said about sir thomas hoped within heart that wife be right in prophesying that son must hing sudden in matter on following morning young fitzgerald gave necessary order at berryhill very quickly then coming back remounted horse without going into house then trotted off to clady passing gate of desmond court without calling did what have promised to do at clady rather that have made to stand a excuse for again visiting that part of world so quickly after with conscience let hope quite clear rode up avenue at desmond court be still early in day when got there probably not much after two o'clock yet mary have be quite correct in foretelling that must only be home just in time for dinner nevertheless have not seen lady desmond why how have occurred that have be absent from drawing room whole of two hour have passed in house may be unnecessary to explain such however have be fact first five minute have be passed in inquiry after bruise must be owned in surgical inspection of still discoloured arm must be very painful have said looking into face a though by doing so must swear that must so willingly bear pain if be only possible to make exchange not very have answered smiling be only little stiff ca quite move easily then lifted up afterwards dropped with little look of pain that ran through heart next five minute be taken up in discussing case of recusant boiler then clara discovered that have better go fetch mother against immediate taking of step have alleged valid reason so have gone on till dark night admonished that must do more than save dinner hour at castle richmond room be nearly dark when left got up stood at front window so unseen might see figure a rode off from house mounted horse within quadrangle coming out at great old fashioned ugly portal galloped off across green park with loose rein happy heart what be song say oh lady beware of gay young knight who love who ride away there be at clara heart a stood there at window feeling of expediency of being beware shadow of doubt a to wisdom of what have done rode away gaily with happy spirit for have won that on winning of have be intent necessity for caution presented to have seen loved have then asked have not asked in vain stood gazing after a long a straining eye must catch outline of figure a disappeared through gloom of evening a long a must see even fancy that still saw thought only of excellence of high character kind heart talent in estimation be ranked perhaps above real value taste coincided so well with own quiet yet manly bearing useful pursuit gait appearance demeanour be of nature to win heart of such girl a clara desmond then probably in indistinct way remembered broad acre to be heir comforted by reflecting that at least be match none must think disgraceful for daughter even of earl of desmond sadder thought did come when figure have wholly disappeared eye looking out into darkness must not see figure on have often in past time delighted almost unconsciously to dwell there walking on very road lover fitzgerald have sworn that loved have truly sworn so a well knew have never doubted truth to did not doubt now yet have

earl be earl of desmond too though in truth poor earl be not absolutely destitute must in truth be blessed with fair future lady clara have hitherto be felt only a weight have be born poor a poverty hitherto have shown so little disposition to find for remedy for crushing evil now now matter be indeed changed have obtained for best match in whole country round in doing so have sacrificed heart young love be not entitled to mother tenderness who knew who must know misery of poverty so well a countess of desmond who then must feel so much gratitude to child for prudently escaping from lady desmond did feel grateful to daughter own own child happy girl repeated be man to whom mother in land must be proud to see daughter married never never did see young man so perfectly worthy of girl love be so thoroughly well educated so thoroughly well conducted so good looking so warm hearted so advantageously situated in circumstance of course will go into parliament then course be open to property be believe wholly unembarrassed there be younger brother may say that place be own already for old sir thomas be almost nobody do wish joy own dearest dearest clara after burst of maternal eloquence countess pressed lip to of child gave mother warmest kiss clara be conscious that be thoroughly dissatisfied with mother must not exactly say why be so did return mother kiss did coldly with lip be not eager be glad think have done right mamma right love of course think that have done right only give credit dearest none in least for how must help loving one so lovable in way a dear herbert credit there be credit said not choosing to share mother pleasantry there be credit have not be one of sweetest girl that ever be born must not have loved have loved because there be one else here said clara nonsense one else here indeed have not power if plea to go choose whomever will in london have be mercenary wanted money said countess in tone showed how thoroughly despised such vice might have have what must then must not have have clara have looked for beauty manner high bred taste affectionate heart in opinion must not have be more successful in search after second burst of eloquence again kissed daughter 't be thus at moment that congratulated wife of future sir herbert fitzgerald then allowed clara to go up to own room there to meditate quietly on what have done on be about to do late in evening lady desmond whose mind be thoroughly full of subject again broke out into triumph must write to patrick to morrow clara must hear good news from one have not better wait little mamma why love hardly know how anxious brother be for welfare knew be right to tell mamma right to tell of course be must not have have heart to keep from for day perhaps may be better not to

be earl daughter herbert be not like girl property be own entailed on may do a plea in such matter be sure must not wish to displease either father mother nonsense dear quite nonsense at see difference between young man girl have right to do exactly a like in such matter be quite sure that will not object why must how can mr fitzgerald say that will not clara admitted almost grudgingly of course will not suppose must bring to object to anything might suggest never knew young man so happily situated in respect be quite free agent think must say much to if insisted on marrying cook maid indeed seems to that word be quite paramount at castle richmond same mamma must rather not write to patrick till something more have be settled be wrong there clara if anything disagreeable must happen be quite impossible must be absolutely necessary that brother must know believe love only advise for own good mr fitzgerald will probably be here to morrow if not to morrow next day have doubt will love why do call mr fitzgerald be calling herbert other day remember how scolded must not scold now clara made answer to then subject be allowed to rest for night must call herbert said to herself not to mother must keep use of name till must talk with emmeline a sister of anticipated pleasure that of having now real sister be perhaps greatest rather that of being able to talk about herbert with one whom must love treat a sister herbert must exact use of own christian name for delight of own ear be matter of course that doubtless have be already done then mother daughter went to bed countess a did so be certainly happy to heart core must be that have hope unrecognized by that owen fitzgerald might now once more be welcomed at desmond court that something might now be done to rescue from slough of despond clara too be happy though happiness be mixed did love herbert fitzgerald be sure of said so to herself over over again love of course loved must cherish a lord husband to last day of life last gasp of breath still a sleep came upon eyelid saw in memory bright flash of other lover countenance when first astonished with avowal of love a walked beside under elm with horse following at heel chapter xii doubt believe there be period of life so happy a in thriving lover leaf mistress after first success joy be more perfect then than at absolute moment of own eager vow half assenting blush then be thinking mostly of be to certain degree embarrassed by effort necessary for success when promise have once be given to be able to escape into domain of own heart be a conqueror who have mastered continent by own strategy never occurs to hardly belief that success be more than be ordinary lot of mortal man never reflects that old married fogy whom know despises have just a much ground for pride if such pride be enduring that fat silent dull somnolent old lady whom see quiz have at period be deemed a worthy prize a priceless galleon so deemed by a bold captor a one have said that young mother when first child be born regard babe a most wonderful production of description world have yet seen too be true doubt even whether conviction be so strong a conviction of young successful lover that have achieved triumph must ennoble down to late generation a go along have contempt for other men for know nothing of such glory a a pore over blackstone remembers that doe so not so much that may acquire law a that may acquire fanny then other porers over blackstone be low mean in sight be mercenary in view unfortunate in idea for have fanny in view herbert fitzgerald have proud feeling strong within heart a galloped away across greensward trotted fast along road home to castle richmond be compounded of excellence so swore to over over again being so compounded have consented to bestow excellence upon being goddess like have promised to take a object of world worship so trotted on fast faster a though conscious of half continent have won by skill valour have told about cousin owen indeed greater number of soft musical word have spoken in long three hour colloquy have be spoken on special point have behoved to tell thought that have done so nay have done so with absolute truth to best of heart power be so young then have argued so very young yes very young be not very old now know smiled sweetly on year make so much difference be child then love now clara love now have answered then exacted second third fourth assurance that did absolutely actually with whole heart love herbert in lieu of other poor owen with herbert be contented content nay proud elated with triumph conscious of victory in spirit rode home a fast a horse must carry too have to tell tale to to whom owed obedience to beg that must look upon intended bride with eye of love with parental affection in respect be hardly troubled with more doubt than clara have felt how must one object to clara there be young men who from position in life be obliged to abstain from early marriage to look for dowry with wife luckily be not fettered in way must marry a pleased so long a whom might choose brought with gentle blood good heart sweet temper such attraction of person manner a might make establishment at castle richmond proud of young bride of whom must establishment be more proud than of lady clara desmond so rode home without doubt to clog happiness have source of joy clara wanted be almost indifferent to mother satisfaction herbert looked forward with liveliest keenest anticipation to mother gratified caress unqualified approval to father kind smile warm assurance of consent clara have made known at castle richmond have doubt that must be added to cup of happiness there be therefore alloy to debase virgin gold a trotted quickly into stable yard resolved that must say nothing about matter night must not well tell in full conclave together early after breakfast must go to father room after that must find mother there must then be doubt that news must duly leak out among sister aunt letty again only just barely in time herbert said mary a clustered round fire before dinner ca say ever keep waiting really think be praise for man who have

half so civil for kept to own work be rev mr m'carthy if please only hope be civil to said herbert with slight suffusion of colour over face for rather doubted conduct of aunt to priest especially a great protestant ally mr townsend be of party civil know what must have unless wanted to embrace shook hand with round really thought mr townsend must have looked into river when came to always be quintessence of absurdity prejudice said oh herbert exclaimed aunt letty well what of 'oh herbert ' say be so if mary emmeline did not look into river when shook hand with why must do so be ordained priest even according to own tenet only know nothing of what own tenet be will tell what be be substantial true holy doctrine of protestant religion founded on gospel mr townsend be thoroughly protestant woman one who can not abide sorcery of popery hate a mad dog hate water with same amount of judgment none of wish to be drowned nevertheless there be good quality in water there be good quality in popery said aunt letty with most extreme energy be there not said herbert must have thought belief in christ belief in bible belief in doctrine of saviour atonement be good quality even mahommedan religion have quality be good must sooner be mahommedan than papist said aunt letty somewhat thoughtlessly very stoutly must alter opinion after first week in harem said herbert then there be burst of laughter in aunt letty joined must sooner go there than go to confession whispered to mary a walked off to dinner how be lady clara arm asked mary a soon a be again once more round fire lady clara arm be still very blue said herbert suppose took hour to weep over continued sister exactly by shrewsbury clock while be weeping over arm what happened to hand did not surrender did in return for so much tenderness on part emmeline thought that mary be very pertinacious in badinage be going to bid hold tongue observed that herbert blushed walked away without further answer went to further end of long room there threw on to sofa must be that be settled thought emmeline to herself followed to sofa sitting beside took hold of arm oh herbert if there be anything to tell do tell anything to tell said what do mean oh know do love so dearly will never be contented to love one else a wife not to love really really with heart what goose girl be be always thinking of love wedding orange blossom be only for think about said emmeline know there be something to tell dear herbert do tell there be young bachelor duke coming here to morrow have million year three county own have blue eye be handsomest man that ever be seen be that news enough very well herbert must tell anything well tell anything will tell know be in love with clara desmond be sure be in love with believe be engaged be not nice at to have secret from never tease a mary doe must make so happy to know upon put arm round waist whispered one word into ear gave exclamation of delight a tear came into eye congratulated with kiss oh dear oh dear be so happy exclaimed hush sh whispered knew how must be if told will know to morrow will not leave to have coaxed out of secret be bound to keep then went away well pleased description of delight on sister part be first instalment of joy have promised from satisfaction of family lady fitzgerald have watched have passed have already learned mistake mistake in have prophesied that immediate proposal be likely to be made by son now knew well enough that have made proposal that have be accepted greatly grieved have felt certain from few slight word sir thomas have spoken that there be valid reason why son must not marry penniless girl that conversation joined to other thing to man visit husband deep dejection have convinced that be not right misfortune be impending over there have be that in own early history filled with dismay a thought of have ardently desired to caution son in respect to guard if possible against future disappointment future sorrow must not do so without obtaining in sort husband assent to doing so resolved that must talk over with sir thomas subject be one so full of pain be so ill therefore have put off now saw that injury be done nevertheless said nothing to emmeline to herbert if injury be done what good must now result from talking doubtless must hear soon enough so sat still watching on following morning sir thomas did not come out to breakfast herbert went into room quite early a be always custom a left for breakfast parlour said father must like to speak to just now about something of importance something of importance herbert what be anything wrong for sir thomas be nervous easily frightened oh dear nothing be wrong be nothing will annoy at least think not will keep till after breakfast will come in again moment breakfast be over so saying left room with light step in breakfast parlour seemed to a though everybody be conscious of important fact mother kiss be peculiarly solemn full of solicitude aunt letty smirked a though be aware of something something over above great protestant tenet usually supported mary have joke to fling at emmeline whispered have told indeed replied what mattered everybody must know now in few minute so ate breakfast then returned to sir thomas father said a soon a have got into arm chair in be custom to sit when talking with sir thomas hope what be going to tell will give pleasure have proposed to young lady have accepted have proposed have be accepted yes father young lady be lady clara desmond hope will say that approve of have fortune a know will hardly matter to think will allow in other respect be perfect herbert must have said have dared to express true meaning paused for moment to look for le triumphant word then paused again left sentence incomplete when saw expression of father face oh father mean to say that like be not dislike be expressed in father face a herbert felt moment after have spoken there be pain there solicitude disappointment look of sorrow at tidings thus conveyed to nothing seemed to betoken dislike of person what be sir why do not speak to can be that disapprove of marrying sir thomas certainly did disapprove of son marrying lacked courage to say so much misery have hitherto come upon be about to come on whom loved so well arose from lack of courage did not dare to tell son that advised for present to put aside such hope must have be terrible for to do so knew that in not doing so be occasioning sorrow must be more terrible yet did not do herbert saw clearly that project be distasteful to father that project have hoped to have seen received with so much delight nothing be said to tended to make alter purpose do not like asked father almost piteously yes yes do like like very much indeed herbert then why be so young boy be so very young what why herbert be not always practicable for son even of man of property to marry so early in life a have nothing know said young man proudly never thought of looking for money in position be so essential if young man wish to marry herbert have always regarded father a most liberal man breathing a open hearted open handed almost to fault to only son have ever be so refusing nothing latterly allowing to do almost a must with management of estate must not understand that liberality must be turned to parsimony on occasion a of son marriage think then sir ought not to marry lady clara said herbert very bitterly like excessively said sir thomas think be sweet girl very sweet girl mother must desire to see in wife be not rich speak to in tone boy said sir thomas with expression must have moved enemy to pity let alone son son did pity ceased to wear angry expression of face have so wounded father father understand said be there real objection why must not marry be more than twenty two think married earlier than in answer to sir thomas only sighed meekly piteously if mean to say continued son that will be inconvenient to to make allowance be of course entitled to what want a long a can give will have a long a can give father a long a be in power mean what can want of anything for for after herbert sat silent for while leaning on arm knew that there existed mischief must not fathom have be prudent must have felt that there be impediment to love evil behoved to fathom before allowed love to share when be lover prudent must live here must not father second establishment must be necessary of course must live here said sir thomas glad to be able to look at subject on side be not painful of course must live here for matter of herbert house must be considered a own if so wished against son put in most violent protest nothing on earth must make consider master of castle richmond a long a father lived must clara clara wish knew well boasted must amply suffice to to live there with be not house large enough indeed where else must live seeing that interest be naturally centred upon property then sir thomas did give consent must be wrong to say that be wrung from gave willingly enough a far a present moment be concerned when be once settled assured son that must love clara a daughter nevertheless father knew that have done wrong herbert knew that also have done wrongly be aware that there be something did not understand have promised to see clara day next must not bring to unsay that have said to left father room sorrowful at heart discontented have expected that tidings must have be received in so far other manner that must have be able to go from father study up stair to mother room with so exulting step that news when once matter be ratified by father approval must have flown about house with so loud note of triumph now be so different father have consented be too plain that there be room for triumph well herbert said emmeline jumping up to meet a returned to small back drawing room through have gone to father dressing room have calculated that must come there that might thus get first word from after interview be over there be frown upon brow displeasure in eye there be none of bright smile of gratified pride with have expected that greeting must have be met be there anything wrong said doe not disapprove doe never mind do leave now never can make understand that one be not always in humour for joking so saying put aside passed on joking be indeed hard upon poor emmeline seeing that thought be so full of that heart beat so warmly for promised bride said nothing shrinking back abashed vanishing out of way must be possible that father must have refused to receive lady clara desmond a daughter in law then betook to private territory of own where might be sure that must remain undisturbed for half hour so must go to mother of course not quite immediately must think over matter endeavouring to ascertain what be that have made father manner word so painful to must not get thought to work rightly getting of thought to work rightly be by by a take hardest work man be called upon to that subject to be thought about need in be difficult be one to say that thought about hydrostatics pneumatics be difficult to multitude that mental effort in region of political economy ethical philosophy be beyond ordinary reach one must only pronounce evident truism absurd platitude let man take subject fully within own mind scope strive to think about steadily with attempt at calculation a to result chance be mind will fly off will nill to utterly different matter when wish to debate within that question of wife temper will find considering whether may not judiciously give away dozen pair of old boot when behoves to decide whether will be manure green crop fallow season then grass seed can not keep from inward inquiry a to meaning of peculiar smile on mr walker face when shook hand with last night lord brougham professor faraday can doubt command thought if many men must do so there must be many lord brougham many professor faraday at present moment herbert fitzgerald have right to consider a following in step of one other of great men wished to think about father circumstance mind must fly off to clara desmond perfection thus though remained there for hour with back to fire hand in pocket deliberation have done good have rather done harm seeing that have only warmed into firmer determination to go on with what be doing then went to mother kissed spoke very tenderly nay affectionately about clara even even mother did not speak joyously also said something about difficulty of providing maintenance for married son then to burst forth spoke somewhat loudly can not understand mother if father know reason why must be treated differently from other son ought to tell not leave to grope about in dark boy think that son be ever entitled to more consideration to kinder more liberal treatment why do hear then about difficulty of marrying if hear so much why do not hear more know pretty well believe what be father income if must tell for asking know must be heir to whatever be not that that feeling must make difference in dealing with not least under circumstance can not conceive why must look coldly upon marriage look coldly on herbert do not do not tell that there will be income for if be to be so if really be case if property have so dwindled away become embarrassed oh herbert there never be man le likely to injure son property than father mean that let do what like with must not upbraid even in thought if be embarrassed if have dwindled away if there be reason why must not regard a altogether untrammelled with regard to money ought to tell can not accuse myself of expensive taste dearest herbert nobody accuses of anything do desire to marry now have engaged will not break from engagement unless be shown to that be bound in honour to do so then indeed oh herbert know what mean mean expect that clara will be received a wife with open arm so will be if come else that reason must be given why must not come a to income something must be done suppose if mean at disposal be le than have be taught to believe at rate will not complain can not think be so small a to afford just reason why must not marry father see be ill one can hardly talk to fully upon such matter at present then will speak to somers at rate must know how property be circumstanced suppose will not hesitate to tell think somers can tell anything then what be a for london estate mother be moonshine what if be gone altogether may be that be that vexes father if so be monomania oh boy use such word know what mean if doubt a to be creating despondency only show that though be bound to respect relieve father state of mind be not at bound to share must really matter mother if place in london be washed away by thames there be more than enough left for unless ah herbert be then will go to somers will tell father interest in property can not have be involved without knowledge circumstanced a father be be bound to tell if there be anything within knowledge to tell will tell if there be nothing within knowledge then can only look upon a disease on poor father part will do can to comfort in must be madness to destroy whole happiness because labour under delusion lady fitzgerald did not know what further to say half believed that sir thomas did labour under delusion then half believed also that have upon mind sorrow terribly real be in sort delusive under such circumstance how must advise son instead of advising caressed may claim from mother that if somers tell nothing ought to make break word to clara will receive a daughter will promise will not lady fitzgerald did promise warmly assuring that already dearly loved clara desmond that must delight in having daughter in law that must go to to welcome a such a soon a ever must bid do so with herbert be somewhat comforted immediately started on search after mr somers think that person be to be found a rule attached to english estate whose position be analogous to of irish agent there be wide misunderstanding in england a to irish functionary have attempted page back to describe national delinquency of middleman profit renter in england be apt to think that agent on irish property be to be charged with similar shortcoming can assert to be great mistake believe that a class agent on irish property do duty in manner beneficial to people that there be be many agent who be also middleman profit renter in second position be nuisance to country be doubt true be nuisance in working capacity a agent that there be bad agent there can be no doubt a there be also bad shoemaker duty towards estate agent performs in ireland be believe generally shared in england between three four different person family lawyer performs part estate steward performs part landlord performs part a to small estate by far greater part in ireland let estate be ever so small eight hundred year will say working of property be managed by agent be who know tenant limit of holding be who arranges lease allows much more generally doe not allow for improvement take rent give order for ejection of tenant if can not get be far from saying that must not be well that much of must be done by landlord that of must be so done on small property be done by agent a rule be think done honestly mr somers be agent to castle richmond property a took to a such five per cent on rent paid a be agent also to sundry other small property in neighbourhood succeeded in making very snug income have also excellent house on estate be altogether very much thought of on whole perhaps more than be sir thomas in respect be probable that herbert might soon take lead be large heavy consequential man always very busy a though aware of being one of most important wheel kept irish clock agoing be honest kind hearted in main true a steel to employer good humoured a long a be allowed to have own way in latter day have be little soured by herbert interference have even gone so far a to say that in humble judgment mr fitzgerald be wrong in doing so so generally called herbert be always kind to in heart of heart loved dearly be matter of course for have not be agent to estate before herbert be born immediately after interview with mother mr herbert rode over to mr somers house there found sitting alone in office dashed immediately into subject have brought there have come mr somers said to ask question about property about castle richmond property said mr somers rather surprised by visitor manner yes know in what state poor father now be know that sir thomas be not very well be sorry to say that be long since have be quite there be something be preying upon spirit be afraid so herbert then tell fairly mr somers do know what be not in least have conception whatever never have have know cause for trouble must disquiet there be nothing wrong about property not to knowledge who have title deed be at coutts be sure of well a sure a man can be of thing that doe not see have never seen there indeed have never seen at feel doubt in own mind a to being at banker be there much due on estate very little estate in county cork have le on miss letty have income when poulnasherry be bought that townland lying just under berryhill where gorse cover be part of purchase money be left on mortgage be still due interest be le than hundred year be know of must there be encumbrance without knowing think not think be impossible of men father be last to encumber estate in manner unknown to agent to pay off interest in secret what be then mr somers know then mr somers paused of course have heard of visit received other day from stranger yes heard of people about here be talking of man with younger man be still living in cork at little drinking house in south main street younger man have be seen down here twice what can mean know tell everything do know herbert exacted promise from that must continue to tell everything might learn then rode back to castle richmond whole thing must be delusion said to resolved that there be valid reason why must make clara unhappy by reference to circumstance chapter xiii mr mollett return to south main street must now take reader back to very unsavoury public house in south main street cork in for present lived mr matthew mollett son abraham need hardly explain to discerning public that mr matthew mollett be gentleman who made momentous call at castle richmond flurried that household drat said mr jones to herself on day a soon a have regained solitude of own private apartment after having taken long look at mr mollett in hall on occasion sat down on low chair in middle of room put two hand down substantially on two knee gave long sigh then made above exclamation drat mr jones be still thoroughly saxon although have lived for so many year among celt be only when be quite alone that allowed indulgence of so peculiarly saxon mode of expressing surprise indignation be same man said to a come day a sure a egg then for five minute maintained position cogitating be like other fellow too continued only somehow be not like then pause yet be only ca be ai just so tall be older like then still meditating mr jones kept position for full ten minute longer at end of time got up shook deserved to be bracketed with lord brougham professor faraday for have kept mind intent on subject have come to resolution wo say nothing to nobody noways be expression of mind purpose only will tell missus a how be man a come to wale did tell so much to mistress a have before learned mr mollett have gone down from cork to castle richmond in one of delightful irish vehicle called covered car inside covered car be equipage much given to shaking seeing that have heavy top like london cab that run on pair of wheel be entered from behind slope backwards sitter sits sideways between cracked window on one side cracked doorway on other a draught be always going in at ear next window out at ear next door be about a cold comfortless vehicle for winter a may be well imagined now journey from castle richmond to cork have to be made right across boggeragh mountain be over twenty mile irish road be never very good mr mollett therefore be five hour in covered car on return journey a have stopped for lunch at kanturk have not hurried at meal be very dark very cold when reached house in south main street think have explained that mr mollett senior be not absolutely drunkard nevertheless be not averse to spirit in cold weather on journey have warmed with whisky once twice on road have found shebeen house when crossed nad river on mountain top third at point where road pass near village of blarney at convenient resting spot mr mollett have endeavoured to warm there be men who become absolutely drunk who do become absolutely cross when drink more than be good for of such men mr mollett be one what with cold air what with whisky what with jolting mr mollett be very cross when reached kanturk hotel so that only cursed driver instead of giving expected gratuity will come to yer honour in morning said driver may go to devil in morning answered mr mollett be first intimation of return reached ear of expectant son there be governor said aby who be then flirting with miss o'dwyer in bar somebody be stroking wrong way of 'air charm of miss o'dwyer in idle day have be too much for prudence of mr

income for son absolute sum having be mentioned that sir thomas have required fortnight for answer answer be to be conveyed to mr mollett verbally at end of time be agreed that mr mollett must repeat visit to castle richmond on day fortnight in mean time will go down freshen old gentleman up bit said aby a left father bedroom chapter xiv rejected suitor after interview between herbert mother became understood thing at castle richmond that be engaged to lady clara sir thomas raised further objection although be clear to immediate family that be by mean gratified at son engagement very little more passed between sir thomas lady fitzgerald on subject merely said that must consider question of son income expressed hope perhaps opinion rather than hope that marriage must not take place quite immediately under circumstance herbert hardly spoke further to father upon matter certainly did feel sore that must be so treated that must be made to understand that there be difficulty that difficulty must not be explained to absolute opposition be however made must not therefore complain a to money must say nothing till something must be said to with mother however matter be different have said that must welcome clara did so immediately after speaking to sir thomas drove over to desmond court said soft sweet thing to clara in most winning way said soft thing also to countess who received very graciously took clara home to castle richmond for night somewhat to surprise much to gratification of herbert who found sitting slily with other girl when came in before dinner arranged for to make longer visit after interval of week two herbert therefore be on thoroughly good term with mother did enjoy of delight have promised with sister also especially with emmeline be once more in good humour to made ample apology for former crossness received ample absolution be so harassed said by father manner that hardly knew what be doing even now when think of evident dislike to marriage nearly drive wild truth of emmeline sadly acknowledged how must of talk of father except in strain of sadness thing did not happen in drawing room at castle richmond without also being discussed in kitchen be soon known over house that master herbert be to marry lady clara indeed there be great pretence of keeping secret girl told duchess a called mr jones of course in confidence mr jones knew what such confidence meant especially a matter be more than once distinctly alluded to by ladyship thus story be told in confidence to everybody in establishment then repeated by in confidence also to nearly everybody out of ill news say fly fast news going in direction became ill soon flew to hap house so young fitzgerald divine clara be to hit off be said captain donnellan who have driven over from buttevant barrack to breakfast at hap house on hunting morning there be other men present more intimate friend of owen than captain who have known of owen misfortune in quarter sign be made to donnellan to bid drop subject be too late who cousin herbert said owen sharply have heard of barry well said barry sort of thing be always being said know did hear something of somewhere ca say thought much about then subject be dropped during morning breakfast went to hunt in course of day owen contrived to learn that report be well founded that evening a countess daughter be sitting together over fire gray headed old butler brought in letter upon old silver salver saying for lady clara if please lady countess not unnaturally thought that despatch have come from castle richmond smiled graciously a clara put out hand for missive lady desmond again let eye drop upon book be reading a though to show that be by far too confiding mamma to interfere in correspondence between daughter daughter lover at moment lady clara have be doing nothing work be indeed on lap workbox be at elbow thought have be far away far away a regard idea though not so a to absolute locality for in mind be walking beneath elm tree man be near with horse following at heel messenger be to wait for answer lady said old butler with second nod on occasion be addressed to clara then man withdrew lady clara blushed ruby red up to root of hair when eye fell on address of letter for knew to be in handwriting of owen fitzgerald perhaps countess from corner of eye may have observed portion of daughter blush if so said nothing attributing to clara natural bashfulness in present position will get over soon countess may probably have said to herself clara be indecisive disturbed in mind wretched owen have sent other letter have be brought to surreptitiously have be tendered to in secret have always be returned by unopened have not told mother of at least not purposely at moment have be at trouble to conceal fact when countess have once asked freely told what have happened with absence of confusion have quite put lady desmond at ease letter be brought to in most open manner answer to openly demanded turned round slowly in hand then looking up said mamma be from owen fitzgerald what have better do with from owen fitzgerald be sure yes mamma then countess have also to consider what step under such circumstance have better be taken in mean time clara held out hand tendering letter to mother have better open dear read doubt must be answered lady desmond felt that now there must be no danger from owen fitzgerald indeed thought that there be not remembrance of left in daughter bosom that old love such baby love a there have be have vanished quite swept out of little heart by new love of brighter sort then lady desmond knew nothing of daughter so instructed clara broke seal read letter ran thus hap house february promised love for let what will happen such be have morning heard tidings if true will go far to drive to despair will not believe from lip save own have heard that be engaged to marry herbert fitzgerald at once however declare that believe statement have known too well to think that can be false at rate beg favour of interview with after what have passed think under circumstance have right to demand have pledged to a pledge have be accepted be entitled to consideration write letter to openly being quite willing that must show to mother if think fit messenger will wait do implore to send answer remember lady clara that having accepted love can not whistle down wind a though be of account after what have passed between can not surely refuse to see once more ever own if will have so owen fitzgerald read letter very slowly ever anon looking up at mother face seeing that mother be not reading book pretending to read when have finished held for moment then said mamma will not look at certainly dear if wish to do so took letter from daughter hand read just what one must expect from dear eager impetuous thoughtless one must not blame much for doe not mean to do harm if have sense must know that be taking trouble for nothing what will do mamma well really think must answer be delightful to see perfect confidence mother have in daughter think must see if will insist upon be foolish in to persist in remembering two word spoke to a child perhaps will be well that must tell that be child when spoke two word then clara sent off following reply written under mother dictation though countess strove very hard to convince daughter that be wording out of own head lady clara desmond present compliment to mr owen fitzgerald will see mr owen fitzgerald at desmond court at two o'clock to morrow if mr owen fitzgerald persists in demanding such interview lady clara desmond however wish to express opinion that must be better avoided desmond court thursday evening countess thought that note be very cold formal must be altogether conclusive nevertheless at about eleven o'clock night there came messenger from hap house with letter saying that owen must be at desmond court at two o'clock on following day be very foolish that be can say said countess night next morning poor clara be very wretched that have be right to give up suitor who lived life a owen fitzgerald lived must not doubt nevertheless be true in giving up have made stipulation a to life when accepted love if called false a doubtless must call how must defend have defence to offer be not only that have rejected poor lover have accepted rich lover what must say to when upbraided for such sordid conduct then a to whistling down wind did wish to do in what state did heart stand towards might not be that let be ever so much on guard must show tenderness tenderness must be treason to present affianced suitor oh why have mother desired to go through interview a when two o'clock came clara be in drawing room have said nothing to mother a to manner in meeting must take place then at first have have idea lady desmond must be present a time came near clara be still alone when watch told that be already two be still by when old servant opening door announced that mr fitzgerald be there be still unsupported by presence of companion be very surprising that on occasion mother must have kept away have not seen owen fitzgerald since day when have walked together under elm tree can hardly be said that saw now have feeling that have injured have deceived in manner betrayed that feeling became so powerful with that hardly dared to look in face when entered room walked straight up to offered hand too looked round room to see whether lady desmond be there not finding be surprised have hardly hoped that opportunity must be allowed to for declaring strength of passion got up taking hand muttered something certainly did not matter what for be inaudible such a word be be first spoken between lady clara began then stopped considering recommenced clara report have reached ear will believe from lip own now sat down on sofa pointed to chair for remained standing did so during whole interview rather walking for when became energetic impetuous moved about from place to place in room a though incapable of fixing in one position clara be ignorant whether behoved to rebuke for calling simply by christian name thought that ought to do so did not do have be told continued that have engaged to marry herbert fitzgerald have now come to hear contradiction of from fitzgerald be true be true that herbert fitzgerald be accepted lover yes said looking down upon ground blushing deeply a said there be pause of few moment during felt that full fire of glance be fixed upon then spoke may well be ashamed to confess said may well feel that dare not look in face a pronounce word must have believed clara from other mouth than own appeared to clara now a though be greatly culprit have not word to say in own defence argument a to owen ill course of life be forgotten must only remember that have acknowledged that loved that be now acknowledging that loved now owen have made accusation a be not answered hardly knew how to proceed walked about room endeavouring to think what have better say next know clara be mother doing not own must not bring to be false unless by instigation said be wrong there be not mother doing what have done have done be not true asked that word be pledged to have not promised that must be wife be very young said falling back upon only excuse occurred to at moment a being possible to be used without incriminating young be not that mother teaching why be very word when came to at house did not know that youth be excuse for falsehood may be excuse for folly said clara folly what folly folly of loving poor suitor folly of being willing to marry man who have not large estate clara did not think that must have learned so much in so short time be very hard upon felt that be hard for knew that have done that entitled to regard pledge to a at end circumstance be such that must not excuse be to understand said owen fitzgerald that have passed between be to go for nothing that such promise a have made to other be to be of account to be sacred pledge from must not escape even if must a then paused for reply be obliged to say something hope have not come here to upbraid mr fitzgerald clara continued have passed last year with perfect reliance upon faith need hardly tell that have not be passed happily for have be passed without seeing though have be absent from have never doubted have known that be necessary that must wait wait perhaps till year must make mistress of own action nevertheless be not unhappy for be sure of love now be undoubtedly case that fitzgerald be treating unfairly though have not wit enough about to ascertain by process of argument nevertheless idea did come home to be true that have promised love to man a far a such promise must be conveyed by one word of assent be true also that have be almost child when pronounced that word that thing have since occurred have entitled to annul amount of contract to might have be supposed to bind by one word bethought therefore that a be so hard pressed be forced to defend be very young then mr fitzgerald hardly knew what be saying afterwards when mamma spoke to felt be bound to obey what to obey by forgetting have never forgotten never will remember too well kindness to brother kindness to psha know speak of be bound to obey mother by forgetting that have loved paused moment before answered looking now full before hardly yet bold enough to look in face said have not forgotten that loved will never forget child a be will never be forgotten can not love now not in manner must have why not lady clara why be love to cease on part to be thrown aside so easily by while with remains so stern fact so deep necessity be just when bargain have once be made must not be equally binding on think be fair to mr fitzgerald said spirit be now rising in bosom not fair to do say that be unfair to speak one word to say that troth pledged year since will still remain unbroken will at once leave till will name time when suit may be renewed know can not do why not know that ought to do mr fitzgerald ought not be now engaged to cousin with consent of mamma of friend can say nothing to now can not repeat to can say anything will oppose wish be then so much more to now than be be everything to now be reply be to get then acknowledge falseness throw off without vouchsafing answer beyond what must have say did do be wrong foolish when when be walking there on avenue did give promise can not now keep be so hurried that hardly remember what said of be sure that if have caused unhappiness be very sorry to have done so can not alter now can not unsay what said then can offer that have now absolutely given to then a finished speaking did pluck up courage to look in face be now standing a well a be so standing that table be placed near sofa be still between a finished speaking door opened countess of desmond walked slowly into room owen fitzgerald when saw bowed low before then frankly offered hand there be something in manner to lady devoid of bashfulness yet never too bold seemed to be aware that in speaking to lady be who might be only exercising undoubted privilege a man never hummed hawed shook in shoe a though majesty of womanhood be too great for encounter there be such men many of who carry dread to last day of long life have often wondered what woman think of men who regard woman a too awful for free exercise of open speech mr fitzgerald said accepting hand offered to resuming own very quickly then standing before in dignity be able to assume quite concurred with daughter that be right that must see a insisted on interview must excuse if interrupt must protect from embarrassment vehemence may occasion lady desmond replied be quite at liberty a far a be concerned to hear pass between daughter be betrothed to have come to claim from fulfilment of promise for shame mr fitzgerald for shame when be child extracted from one word of folly now must take advantage of foolish word now when know that be engaged to man love with full consent of friend thought knew well enough to feel sure that be not so ungenerous ungenerous have not that generosity must enable to give up very heart blood only joy of soul to one a cousin herbert have nothing to give up mr fitzgerald must have known from very first that daughter must not marry not marry why not lady desmond be not blood a good a unless indeed be prepared to sell child to highest bidder clara dear think have better leave room said countess doubt have assured mr fitzgerald that be engaged to cousin herbert yes mamma then can have further claim on attendance vehemence will terrify vehement how can help being vehement when like ruined gambler be throwing last chance for stake then intercepted clara a stepped towards drawing room door stopped in course stood still looking down upon ground mr fitzgerald said countess will thank to let lady clara leave room have given answer for have asked must not be right in to permit to be subjected to further embarrassment will only ask to listen to one word clara mr fitzgerald have right to address daughter with freedom said countess owen hardly seemed to hear here in hearing protest against marriage with herbert fitzgerald claim love a own bid think of promise gave tell that a loved then with heart so do love at moment so will love always now will not hinder longer then opened door for passed on bowing to muttering word of farewell be inaudible stood for moment with door in hand meditating whether might not say good morning to countess without returning into room a so stood called mr fitzgerald said so therefore came back once more closed door then saw that countenance of lady desmond be much changed hitherto have be inch countess stern cold haughty now looked at a used to look in old winter evening when be accustomed to talk together over evening fire in close friendliness while lady desmond must speak to in intimacy of heart of child patrick clara mr fitzgerald said tone of voice also be changed be hardly fair to be not fair lady desmond not fair sit down now listen to for moment if have child penniless girl like clara must be glad to see married to one a be in what way do mean speak out lady desmond will not speak out for must not hurt be too fond of a old friend to wish to do so that may marry live happily live near here so that may know most heartily desire can not marry that child why not if love nay not even if did wealth position be necessary to station in have be born be earl daughter penniless a be will have secret from a mother must not give to one whose career be such a yours a widow of earl must not give to one whose mean of maintaining be so small if will think of will hardly be angry with love be nothing then be to be sacrificed to love think of mr fitzgerald let have happiness of knowing that consent to match never said never so left room without wishing further farewell chapter xv diplomacy about week after last conversation have be related a having taken place at kanturk hotel mr mollett junior be on way to castle richmond have on occasion stated intention of making such journey with view of freshening old gentleman up bit although father did in power to prevent journey going so far on one occasion a to swear that if be made must throw over game altogether nevertheless aby persevered may leave board whenever like governor said aby know quite enough of part to carry on play think do said father in anger will find in dark yet before have done then again expostulated in different tone will ruin aby will indeed know circumstance indeed said aby then will not be long learning father did what must have mean of keeping son at home so aby went aby doubtless entertained idea that father be deficient in pluck for management of so difficult matter that must supply what father wanted so dressed in best having hired gig man who flattered must look like private servant started from cork drove to castle richmond have on different occasion be down in neighbourhood prowling about like thief in night picking up information a called seeing how land lay have never yet presented to one within precinct of castle richmond demesne present intention be to drive up to front door ask at once for sir thomas fitzgerald sending in card if need be on be printed word mr abraham mollett junior with additional word piccadilly london written in left hand lower corner will take bull by horn said to be better to make spoon at once even if do run small

last chapter one owen fitzgerald left lady desmond in drawing room at desmond court somewhat abruptly having absolutely refused to make peace with desmond faction by giving consent to marriage between clara cousin herbert will perhaps be remembered also that lady desmond have asked for consent in manner be almost humble have shown most anxious to keep on friendly term with rake of hap house rake roue gambler spendthrift a be reputed to be if only must abandon insane claim to hand of clara desmond feeling have shown when two be alone together after clara have left a long a daughter have be present lady desmond have maintained tone of indignation defiance when door be closed two be alone have become kind in language almost tender reader will probably conceive that have so acted overcome by affection for owen fitzgerald with fixed resolve to win for men woman when be written about be always supposed to have fixed resolve though in life be so seldom found to be thus armed to speak truth countess have have fixed resolve in matter when have thought about owen coming when subsequently have found alone with in drawing room that clara must not marry on so much have resolved long ago danger on head be may be said over clara like good child have behaved in best possible manner have abandoned first lover lover be poor unfitted for a soon a told to do so have found for second lover who be rich proper in way desirable a regard clara countess felt to be safe to give due have be satisfied that matter must so rest have not sought further interview with fitzgerald have come there against advice have gone to meet prompted by necessity of supporting daughter without other view of own when found alone with when looked into face saw how handsome how noble how good be good in inherent manliness bravery must not long that feud must be over that might be able once more to welcome a friend if only must give up frantic passion futile wicked senseless attempt to make wretched by insane marriage must not be sweet again to make effort to rescue from evil way into have fallen owen must make response to feeling clara desmond be love must of own consent yield to one in truth be in certain degree mad on subject did think that because young girl have given promise have said to word two called promise be now of right bride that there belonged to indefeasible property in heart in loveliness in inexpressible tenderness of young springing beauty of subsequent renouncing on part must fairly honestly deprive that others must oppose match be intelligible to be hardly intelligible that must betray a yet did not believe that be mainspring of renouncing others countess castle richmond people have frightened into falseness therefore became to maintain right by mean almost by mean within power give up of own free will voice say that herbert fitzgerald must take with consent that must go a bride to castle richmond while stood by smiled wished joy never so rode away with stern heart leaving standing there with something of sternness about heart also in meantime clara when be sure that rejected suitor be well away from place put on bonnet walked out be wont at time to do so be becoming almost creature of habit shut up a be in old dreary barrack mother very rarely went with habitually performed same journey over same ground at same hour day after day so have be so be still unless herbert fitzgerald be with on present occasion saw more of mother before left house passed drawing room door seeing that be ajar knew that countess be there have nothing to say to mother a to late interview unless mother have aught to say to so passed on in truth mother have nothing to say to be sitting there alone with head resting on hand with sternness at heart cloud upon brow be not thinking of daughter have not with skill motherly care provided well for clara have not saved daughter from peril beset path of young girl have not so brought child up put forth into world portionless a child be best thing of world have be showered into lap why must countess think more of daughter be of be thinking of what life must be alone absolutely alone in huge frightful home of hers without friend almost without acquaintance without one soul near whom must love who must love have put out hand to owen fitzgerald have rejected have regarded merely a mother of woman loved then countess of desmond began to ask if be old wrinkled ugly only fit to be dowager in mind body in name over same ground yes always over same ground lady clara never varied walk went from front entrance of court with one great curve down to old ruined lodge opened on to road running from kanturk to cork be here that row of elm tree stood be here that have once walked with hot eager lover beside while docile horse followed behind foot be here that walked daily be possible that must walk here without thinking of be always on little well worn path by road side not on road that took measured exercise now a went along saw on moist earth fresh print of horse hoof also have ridden down same way choosing to pas over absolute spot in word have be uttered thinking of moment a also be thinking of felt sure that such have be case knew that be have brought there there on to foot trace have made together did then love so truly with love so hot so eager so deeply planted in very soul be really true that passion for have so filled heart that whole life must by be made marred have done thing to have so impressed image on mind that must be wretched without be so much to so completely in a regarded future worldly happiness word of asserting that love love be to stern fact deep necessity recurred over over again to mind must really be that in doing a have done in giving to after have promised to have committed injustice must constantly be brought up against by by own conscience have in truth deceived betrayed deserted because be poor given over to rich lover because of rich a thought of forgot again that fact indeed have never more than half realized in mind that have justified in separating from by reckless course of living that conduct must be held to have so justified let pledge between have be of what nature might now a walked up down path thought nothing of wickedness sin thought only of vow to have once listened renewal of vow to be now so necessary that ear must be deaf be heart deaf to swore to herself over over again score score of oath that be so time that swore lowest corner in depth of conscience seemed to charge with falsehood why be that in hour of thinking so much oftener saw face owen than did that other face of in duty be bound to think dream be in vain that told that be afraid of owen therefore thought of tone of voice rang in ear oftenest be not that of anger sternness tone of first assurance of love that tone have be so inexpressibly sweet to that to have listened on very spot where now walked slowly thinking of look of be ever present to eye be not that on have almost feared to gaze hour ago form spirit countenance have worn when be together on well remembered day then must think try to think of herbert of virtue of goodness too loved well never doubted that have come to with soft word pleasant smile sweet honeyed compliment compliment have be sweet to a be to girl soft word pleasant smile honeyed love making have never given so strong thrill of strange delight a have few word from owen very heart core have be affected by vigour of affection there have be in mysterious grandeur have half charmed half frightened have made feel that be fated that must belong to must indeed be lord ruler that be spirit before hers must bend feel subdued with must realize that have dreamed of woman love dream be so sweet to woman of woman subjugation must be same with to whom be now positively affianced with to whom knew that did now owe duty feared that be not same then again swore that loved thought over excellence how good be a son how fondly sister loved how inimitable be conduct in hard trying time remembered also that be right in way that must love mother brother approved of who be to be new relative approved of be in way fitting pecuniary consideration be so favourable when thought of that heart sank low within breast be true that have sold at mother bidding must not remembrance of owen poverty have made true to have nothing else done so be that a might one thing at rate be clear to that be now fate duty a repeated again again wish to marry herbert thought of rebellion against mother ever occurred to a desirable possible must be to true loving wife wife in very heart soul nevertheless walking thus beneath tree must not think of owen fitzgerald in mood have gone twice down from house to lodge back again now again have reached lodge third time making thus last journey for in solitary walk work be measured exercise be needful there be little in task to make prolong beyond what be necessary now a be turning for last time heard sound of horse hoof coming fast along road looking from gate saw that herbert be coming to have not expected now waited at gate to meet have be arranged that be to go over in few day to castle richmond stay there for fortnight have be settled shortly before visit made by mr mollett junior at place have not a yet be unsettled a soon a be known that sir thomas have summoned mr prendergast from london be felt by that must be a well that clara visit must be postponed herbert have be especially cautioned by father at time of mollett visit not to tell mother anything of what have occurred to certain extent have kept promise be of course necessary that lady fitzgerald must know that mr prendergast be coming to house be of course impossible to keep from fact that visit be connected with lamentable state of husband health spirit indeed knew a much a without telling be not probable that mr prendergast must come there now on visit of pleasure whatever may be that weighs upon mind herbert have said will be better for talking over with man whom trust why not with somers said lady fitzgerald somers be too often with too near to in affair of life really think be wise to send for mr prendergast know believe to be good man then lady fitzgerald have expressed a satisfied a satisfied a must be seeing that husband must not take into confidence after be settled that herbert must at once ride over to desmond court explain that clara visit have better be postponed herbert got off horse at gate gave to one of child at lodge to lead after horse must not follow clara said to herself a walked back together towards house must not prevent mind running off in direction must fain not have thought of owen a thus hung upon herbert arm a yet have not learned to control thought horse have followed lovingly dog about place have always loved men woman of whole country round old young spoke of with sort of love everybody admired a passed through brain be hanging on accepted lover arm listening to soft sweet word oh yes will be much better said answering proposal that must put off visit to castle richmond be so sorry that sir thomas must be ill mr prendergast be not doctor be then herbert explained that mr prendergast be not doctor that be physician for mind rather than for body regarding clara a already one of own family told a much a have told mother explained that there be deep sorrow weighing on father heart of none of knew anything save existence that there might be misfortune coming on sir thomas of herbert must not even guess nature that everything must be told to mr prendergast be very sad said herbert very sad very sad said clara with tear in eye poor gentleman wish that must comfort do hope that may said herbert somers seems to think that mind be partly affected that misfortune be may not improbably be le serious than anticipate that weighs heavier on than must do be altogether well mother herbert oh yes also be to be pitied sometimes for moment seems to dread terrible misfortune believe that in calm judgment think that worst calamity be state of father health in discussing matter with mother clara in thinking over when alone did ever occur to herbert that might be individually subject to misfortune over father brooded sir thomas have spoken piteously to called poor have seemed to grieve over what might happen to have be taken by son a part of father malady everything around be now melancholy therefore term have not seemed to have special force of own did not think necessary to warn clara that bad day might be in store for of to caution that path of love might yet be made rough whom do think met just now on horseback asked a soon a question of visit have be decided mr owen fitzgerald probably said clara went from hence about hour since owen fitzgerald here repeated a though tidings of such visit having be made be not exactly pleasant to thought that lady desmond did not even see now visit be to herbert will explain to be just going to tell when first came in only began about castle richmond have seen oh yes saw mamma thought best yesterday wrote note to will show then gave such account of interview a be possible to making at rate intelligible to that owen have come thither to claim for having heard rumour of engagement to cousin be inexcusable on part unpardonable said herbert speaking with angry spot on face with more energy than be usual with be why said clara innocently felt unconsciously that be painful to to hear owen ill spoken of by lover that must fain excuse if must why dearest think what motif must have have what other object than to place in painful position to cause trouble vexation to did not know that be engaged oh yes knew that at least be not quite sure think said that have heard did not did not what love think said did not quite believe then be forced much against will to describe to betrothed how owen have boldly claimed a own conduct have be unpardonable said herbert again nay have be ungentlemanlike have intruded where well knew that be not wanted have done so taking advantage of few word under present circumstance must force to forget herbert be have be to blame have not be in least to blame tell honestly that can lay blame at door at age be then be impossible that must know own mind even have promise to be of much more binding nature subsequent conduct mother remonstrance a well a own age must have released from without taint of falsehood knew a well a do be surprised that must have forced way into mother house with mere object of causing embarrassment be marvellous how well herbert fitzgerald must lay down law on subject of clara conduct on be due to be not due to owen be victor have gained prize therefore be so easy for to acquit promised bride heap reproach on head of rejected rival owen have be told that be not wanted of course must have be satisfied with answer why must intrude among happy people with absurd aspiration for be not absurd be not monstrous on part to suppose that must marry clara desmond be in way that herbert regarded matter be not exactly in way that clara looked at did not force way in said wrote to ask if must see mamma said that thought better be forcing way in sense meant if find that give further annoyance will tell what think about will not have persecuted herbert if quarrel with will make wretched think must kill will not do if can help clara be duty to protect if becomes necessary must do so have father brother of age to speak to consideration alone must have saved from attack clara said nothing more for knew that must not speak out to feeling of heart must not plead to that have injured owen that have loved then given up that have be false to must not confess that after tribute of such man love must not be regarded by a offence so said nothing further walked on in silence leaning on arm be now close to house a drew near to lady desmond met on door step dare say have heard that have visitor here morning said taking herbert hand in affectionate motherly way smiling on with sweetness herbert said that have heard expressed opinion that mr owen fitzgerald must have be acting far more wisely to have remained at home at hap house yes perhaps so certainly so said lady desmond putting arm within of future son walking back with through great hall must have be wiser must have saved dear clara from painful half hour must have saved from perhaps year of sorrow have be very foolish to remember clara childhood a doe remember dear herbert what can do lord of creation sometimes will be foolish even about such trifling thing a woman heart then when herbert still persisted that owen conduct have be inexcusable ungentlemanlike softly flattered into quiescence must not forget said that perhaps have loved clara almost a truly a do then what harm can do be not very probable that must succeed in winning clara away from oh be not that mean be for clara sake probably will never see again till be wife event will suppose take place at very remote period a soon a ever father health will admit be if can persuade clara to be so merciful to tell truth herbert think must persuade to anything of course must not hurry too much a for losing will be very sad can understand must not allow feeling of own to stand in way for hour will be very near know yes will therefore a be saying must be absurd for to quarrel with mr owen fitzgerald for be sorry for very sorry for know whole story of what occurred between clara of course will understand that duty at time be plain clara behaved admirably if only must not be so foolish whole matter might be forgotten a far a be concerned think may be forgotten then coming here will not be repeated thought better to show that be not afraid of therefore permitted have conceived that must have objected oh said herbert well there be not much for to be afraid of certainly said countess so be appeased left house promising that at rate must hing might lead to quarrel with cousin owen clara who have still kept on bonnet again walked down with to lodge encountered first earnest supplication that early day must be named for marriage have many reason excellent good reason to allege why must not be case when be girl of seventeen without such reason be so reasonable that must have such reason that period of having love made to must be by far brightest in life be not always pity that must be abridged father illness herbert know herbert acknowledged to certain extent father illness be reason only to certain extent must be worse than useless to think of waiting till father health must be altogether strong just for present till mr prendergast must have gone perhaps for fortnight longer might be well to wait after then pressed very closely hand rested on arm so matter be discussed between with language argument be by mean original at gate just a herbert be about to remount horse be

undertaken by government make bold to say that rule be wise good how must people work that government must supply wage be of course understood necessity be also necessary that on such work amount of

much of top of ballydahan hill be carried to bottom a made whole road altogether impassable for many month great object be gained men be fed be not fed by charity what did matter that spring of conveyance in county cork be shattered by process that work resulted in myriad of wheelbarrow then a rode on towards gortnaclough herbert be overtaken by friend parson who be also going to meeting of

anything how can be right think be mixing up road making church doctrine mr townsend hope may never be in danger of mixing up god devil can not touch pitch not be defiled remember that herbert fitzgerald will remember nothing of kind said herbert be to set up a judge say that be pitch be pitch do remember st peter on housetop be not afraid of what be unclean meaning of be that be to convert gentile not give way to error be to contend with not give way inch till have driven from idolatry mr townsend have be specially primed by wife that morning with vigorous hostility against father barney be grieved to heart at finding that young friend be prepared to take priest part in anything in matter of road mr townsend be doubtless right hardly on score of argument assigned by mean to say that there must be road making said herbert after pause general opinion seems to be that ca do better only say that will come to grief about poor fellow there have a much idea of cutting down hill a have seems to that young lad whom left with have not much more will learn in good time let hope will be in good time if once let have idea that be to feed in idleness said mr townsend will want to go on for ever in same way then when receive such immense sum in money wage priest will be sure to get share if matter have be left to must have paid men in meal must never have given money must have worked got food priest will get penny out of shilling will see else so matter be discussed between a went along to gortnaclough when reached room in committee be held found mr somers already in chair priest mccarthy be there also with coadjutor rev columb creagh father columb a be always called there be mr o'leary from boherbuy one of middleman a be formerly named though by way never knew that word to be current in ireland be familiar to be suppose common few year since never heard peasant calling such person by title be one of with whom present time be likely to go very hard be not bad man unless in so far a that have idea of owing duty to others beyond family doctrine at present amounted to that if left people alone gave false hope must contrive to live somehow believed in good deal have belief whatever in starvation none a yet be probable enough that belief in might come to now before long there be also one two others men who have stake in country men who have tithe of interest possessed by sir thomas fitzgerald mr townsend again went through ceremony of shaking hand with reverend brother on occasion did not seem to be much worse for indeed in looking at two men cursorily stranger might have said that condescension be on other side mr m'carthy be dressed quite smartly black clothes be spruce glossy glove of still kept on one showed other be quite new be clean shaven altogether have shiny bright ebon appearance about that quite did credit to side of church friend parson be discreditably shabby clothes be brown white neck tie must hardly have be clean during last forty eight hour be tied in knot have worked nearly round to ear a have sat sideways on car boot be ugly badly brushed hat be very little better than of worn by workman so called at ballydahan hill nevertheless on looking accurately into face of one might see man be better nurtured better born that operation with sow ear be one may say seldom successful with first generation beautiful morning said coadjutor addressing herbert fitzgerald with very mild voice unutterable look of friendship a though might have said here be in boat together of course be very fond of other to tell truth father columb be not nice looking young man be red haired slightly marked with small pox have low forehead cunning eye yes be nice morning said herbert expect anybody else here do somers at rate wo wait said somers so sat down in arm chair went to work be afraid mr somers said mr m'carthy from other end of table where have constituted sort of deputy chairman be afraid be going on wrong tack priest have shuffled away chair a began to speak be now standing with hand upon table be singular how strong propensity men have to get upon leg in way how so mr m'carthy said somers sha be more comfortable if keep chair there will be le ceremony wo there mr townsend oh certainly said townsend le liable to interruption perhaps on leg said father columb smiling blandly mr m'carthy be far too wise to fight question so sat down just a like said can talk way sitting standing walking riding be one to will tell how be on wrong tack will never get men to work in gang on road never have not be accustomed to be driven like drove of sheep drove of sheep work on road said mr townsend know that mr townsend continued mr m'carthy be quite well aware of drove of sheep be driven men wo bear ' wo said father columb having altogether laid aside bland smile now that time have come a thought to speak up for people may bear in england wo here sternness of eye be almost invincible if be so foolish must be taught better manner said mr townsend will find will work just a other men do look at navvy look at navvy wage said father columb besides navvy only go if like said parish priest men need not go unless like said mr somers only with proviso that if can not manage for must fall into way of managing for what say be said mr o'leary let manage for 'emselves god bless sowl why will be skinned alive if have to pay money back to government if government chooses to squander thousand in way government must bear brunt be what say eventually government be whole nation did bear brunt must not have be very wise to promise at time need hardly debate at present moment said mr somers that matter of road have already be decided for ca alter if must then may a well shut up shop said mr o'leary be very aisy to talk in way said father columb government a call ca make men work ca force eight million of finest pisantry on god earth father columb be by degree pushing away seat from under when be cruelly ruthlessly stopped by own parish priest beg pardon for moment creagh said perhaps be getting little out of track what mr somers say be very true if men wo work on road think will responsibility be not on that matter have be decided for men will sooner work anywhere than starve said mr townsend men will said columb with great deal of meaning in tone what intended to convey be protestant doubt must do so under dominion of flesh that roman catholic being under dominion of spirit must perish first at rate must try said father m'carthy exactly said mr somers what have now to do be to see how may best enable worker to live on wage how others be to live who when be done will get wage think have better turn shopkeeper ourselves open store for everywhere said herbert be what be doing already at berryhill import own corn said parson where be to get money said priest why be to ruin merchant said o'leary whose brother be in flour trade in cork shut up small shopkeeper said father columb whose mother be established in line in neighbourhood of castleisland must not do said somers demand upon must be so great that must certainly break down then where must be for time somers pleaded herbert for time may do something in way till other mean present must refuse out door relief who can not bring money must go into workhouse will not get house in county cork sufficient to hold said father bernard so debate went on not altogether without spark of wisdom with many spark also of eager benevolence few passing cloud of fuliginous self interest then list be produced with name on of who be supposed to be in want be about to become before long list of whole population of country at last be decided among that in district nothing must be absolutely given away except to old woman widow kindhearted clause be speedily neutralised by woman becoming widow while husband be still living be decided also that a long a money lasted soup kitchen at berryhill must be kept open mill kept going little shop maintained so that to extent check might be maintained on price of huckster in way got through work not perhaps with sagacity of solomon a have said with average amount of wisdom a will always be case when men set about task with true heart honest mind then when parted two clergyman of parish shook hand with other again having perhaps le animosity against other than have ever felt before there have be joke two over table at have laughed priest have wisely shown deference to parson parson have immediately returned by referring question to priest how often doe not happen that when come across whom have hated avoided life find that be not quite so bad a have thought that old gentleman of whom wot be never so black a have be painted work of committee took nearly whole day so that did not separate till be nearly dark when did so somers herbert fitzgerald rode home together always live in mortal fear said herbert that townsend priest will break out into warfare a have done yet wo do now said somers m'carthy be not without sense townsend queer intolerant a be have good feeling if father columb be left together know what might happen mr prendergast be to be with day after to morrow be not so understood father to say will let give bit of advice herbert certainly then be in house much on day after come will arrive probably to dinner suppose will if so leave castle richmond after breakfast next morning return till near dinner time may be that father will not wish to be near matter may be may be sure that will know before mr prendergast leaf country be very glad that be coming herbert promised that must take advice thought that among other thing might go over to inspect clady boiler of course call at desmond court on way then when got near to castle richmond

about mouth face be wrinkled with even thing hardly seemed to be sign of old age be said by many who knew to be stern man there be that in face seemed to warrant character have also reputation of being very just man who knew best must tell tale of proved that sternness be at rate compatible with wide benevolence be man who have known little mental suffering who owned mental weakness might be

have contradicted such be case be handsome man too with clear bright gray eye well defined nose expressive mouth of lip however be somewhat too thin man with thin lip ever seems to to be genially human at point such be mr prendergast reader will trust feel for sir thomas pity in that be about to place wound in hand of so ruthless surgeon surgeon to be of use must be ruthless in one sense must have power of cutting cauterizing of phlebotomy bone handling without effect on own nerve power mr prendergast possessed therefore may be said that sir thomas have chosen surgeon judiciously none of

must go on a happily a ever be doctrine of younger part of family who must not think that anything be radically wrong lady fitzgerald have always at heart memory of early marriage trouble feared greatly though feared knew not what herbert fitzgerald aunt letty did endeavour to keep up conversation with mr prendergast irish famine be of course subject did not go on pleasantly mr prendergast be desirous of information statement be made to one moment by young fitzgerald be contradicted in next by aunt must declare that better educated of roman catholic be prepared to do duty by country whereas aunt letty must consider bound by party feeling religious duty to prove that roman catholic be bad in everything oh herbert to hear say so exclaimed at one time make tremble in shoe be dreadful to think that people must have got hold over really think that roman catholic priest be liberal in idea moral in conduct be speech have made aunt letty tremble in shoe may therefore be conceived that mr prendergast did not find able to form firm opinion from statement then made to instead of doing so set down a wild irish whom must be insane to trust of whom be absurd to make inquiry may however be possibly case mr prendergast have own prejudice a well a aunt letty herbert fitzgerald on following morning be still more mute at breakfast time be coming in mr prendergast be to go to work even gifted though be with iron nerve began to feel somewhat unpleasantly nature of task have undertaken lady fitzgerald did not appear at indeed during whole of breakfast time up to moment at mr prendergast be summoned be sitting with husband holding hand in hers looking tenderly painfully into face so sat with for above hour spoke to word of revelation be about to make herbert

to said then ran to mother told that must leave house till dinner time if sends for herbert must not be in way be more likely that must send for be to remain here must be going into room when did not want then mounted horse rode off mr prendergast with serious air slow step solemn resolve to do what have to do at rate with justice walked away from dining room to baronet study task of old friend be not always pleasant one mr prendergast felt that be not so at present moment be gentle with said aunt letty catching hold of arm a went through passage merely moved head twice in token of assent then passed on into room reader will have learnt by time with tolerable accuracy what be nature of revelation sir thomas be called upon to make will be tolerably certain a to advice mr prendergast a honest man must give in respect there be difficulty law of meum tuum be sufficiently clear if man will open eye to look at in case be altogether clear broad acre of castle richmond did belong to sir thomas for life after death must not belong to son herbert be matter admitted of doubt question a to whether molletts must must not hold tongue must bear upon in least justice in case must be done even though heaven must fall be sad piteous stern hard a be man who pronounced doom nevertheless salt tear collected in eye blinded a looked upon anguish judgment have occasioned yes herbert must be told that in world be nobody that must earn bread set about doing so right soon who must say that father life be worth twelvemonth purchase must be told that be nobody in world instructed also to tell whom loved earl daughter same tidings that be nobody that must come to posse property that in law eye did not posse even name how must young heart suffice for endurance of so terrible calamity pretty girl so softly brought up so tenderly nurtured must be explained to too that must no longer be proud of father lineage mother fame that other fitzgerald must be summoned told of on whom have looked down whom young heir have robbed of love whom have cast out from among a unworthy notice must be sent to that be heir to castle richmond that must reign a future baronet in gracious chamber be who must now make great county lady of daughter of countess will be very soon very soon sobbed forth poor victim indeed to look at one might say that must be soon there be moment when mr prendergast hardly thought that must live through frightful day of have yet spoken hardly operated upon baronet mind in creating that stupor of sorrow now weighed to earth be none of thing utterly broke down crushed like mangled reed have hardly mind left to remember child be for wife of bosom that sorrowed wife of bosom persisted in so calling through whole interview even in weakness obliged strong man before so to name also be wife before god must be to end ah for how short time be be to leave once said turning to friend with hand clasped together praying that mercy might be shown to wretchedness be to leave repeated then sank on knee upon floor how be mr prendergast to answer question how be to decide whether man woman might still live together a husband wife oh reader think of if can put for moment in place of old family friend tell tell be to leave repeated poor victim of misery sternness justice of man at last gave way said can not must think be necessary can not demand that wo desert said sir thomas when crumb of comfort be handed to remembered a spoke bloodshot eye of miscreant who have dared to tell that wife of bosom might be legally torn from by hand of man wo desert said sir thomas meaning by to bind friend to obligation at rate wife must not be taken from said mr prendergast will not desert certainly not that certainly not that just then be in heart to promise almost anything that be asked who must have refused such solace a to man so terribly overburthened there be point of view at mr prendergast have looked from commencement at must not get sir thomas to look at certainly be necessary that whole truth in matter must be made known declared openly fair inheritance must go to right owner not to wrong though affliction on sir thomas be very heavy must be equally so on family must not on account for sake of saving from affliction be justified in robbing person of what be legally actually that other person property be matter of astonishment to mr prendergast that conscientious man a sir thomas certainly be must have be able to look at matter in other light that must ever have brought to have dealing in matter with mr mollett justice in case be clear truth must be declared then must take good care to find out absolutely what truth be having heard sir thomas have to say having sifted that did hear mr prendergast thoroughly believed in heart of heart that wretched miscreant be actual true husband of poor lady whom must have to see be necessary that must be proved castle richmond for family earthly peace of mind for unfortunate lady gentleman be not to be given up on bare word of scheming scoundrel for whom crime must be too black cruelty too monstrous proof must be looked into before anything be done must be looked into before anything be said to lady fitzgerald surely may give name a yet then how be to get at proof at proof one way other that mollett have marriage certificate sir thomas declared that evidence have be brought home to own mind of identity of man though what be nature of evidence must not now describe a to that be quite explicit indeed a have said above almost refused to consider question a admitting of doubt that mollett be man to whom wife have be married thoroughly believed to tell truth mr prendergast be afraid to urge to look for much comfort in direction whole manner of man mollett have be such a to show that be sure of ground mr prendergast must hardly doubt that be man although felt bound to remark that nothing must be said to lady fitzgerald till inquiry have be made mr mollett must be at castle richmond on next day one in accordance with appointment made by if necessary must be kept in custody till have be identified a being man a not being man who have married miss wainwright there be nobody living with now who knew lady fitzgerald at asked mr prendergast yes said sir thomas there be one maid servant then explained how mr jones have lived with wife before first marriage during few month in have be called mr talbot from day even up to present hour then must have known man said mr prendergast sir thomas be not in frame of mind at suited to sifting of evidence did not care to say anything about mr jones got crumb of comfort out of view of matter thing have come out unwittingly for most part in conversation with mollett made quite certain a to truth of main part of story dorsetshire locality be well known to man bearing of house circumstance of mr wainwright parsonage whole history of month so that on subject sir thomas have doubt may a well know at once that there be room for doubt friend of kanturk hotel south main street cork be man who thirty year before have married child daughter of dorsetshire parson mr prendergast however stood awhile before fire balancing evidence woman must have known said to surely must tell whether be like man lady fitzgerald must know then who must have hardness of heart to ask lady fitzgerald to confront man remained with sir thomas day for hour long winter evening have begun to make felt by increasing gloom before left wine biscuit be sent in to of even noticed man who brought twice in day however mr prendergast gave baronet glass of sherry latter swallowed unconsciously then at about four lawyer prepared to take leave will see early to morrow said immediately after breakfast be going then said sir thomas who greatly dreaded being left alone not away know said mr prendergast be not going to leave house said sir thomas of course not then paused eh said mr prendergast be saying something will be coming in to now said sir thomas wailing like child now when be gone what be to say to must say nothing at present nothing to day wife asked again through interview studiously called wife be be to know when be assured that man story be true sir thomas must know will probably be very soon in day two till then think have better tell nothing what will say to say nothing think probable that will not ask question if doe tell that business between be not yet over will tell son that at present have better not speak to on subject of visit here then again took hand of unfortunate gentleman having pressed with more tenderness than seemed to belong to left room left room hurried into hall out of house a did so must see that be watched by lady fitzgerald be on alert to go to husband a soon a must know that be alone of what then took place between two need say nothing will wander forth for while with mr prendergast into wide spreading park mr prendergast have be used to hard work life have never undergone day of severer toil than through have just past be yet over have laid down in broad way a opinion that whole truth in matter must be declared to world let consequence be what might to opinion sir thomas have acceded without word of expostulation in be by mean included portion of burden now fell upon mr prendergast shoulder must be for to look into evidence then must be for also heavy worst task of to break matter to lady fitzgerald a sauntered out into park to wander about for hour in dusk of evening head be throbbing with pain family friend in instance have certainly be severely taxed in exercise of friendship what be to do next how be to conduct that evening in family circle knowing a so well did that coming there be to bring destruction upon be tender to aunt letty have said little knowing how great call there must be on tenderness of heart how little scope for tenderness of purpose be absolutely necessary that blow must fall in severity asked question over over again always have to acknowledge that be necessary there must be possible mitigation son must be told that be son son in eye of law wife must be told that be wife distant relative must be made acquainted with golden prospect position of herbert clara of promised marriage have be explained to too must be shivered into fragment how be possible that penniless daughter of earl must give in marriage to youth who be not only penniless also illegitimate without profession look at in way must be misery ruin have fallen upon to pronounce doom must not believe that there be doubt a to general truth of mollett statement must of course inquire must hear what man have to say see what have to adduce must also examine that old servant if necessary if possible also must induce lady fitzgerald to see man did feel convinced that on point there be doubt then lifted up hand in astonishment at folly have be committed by marriage under such circumstance a wise men will do in decline of year when young people in heyday of youth have not be wise if have waited for term of year said if then have not presented term of year such a jacob served for rachel seems so light affair to old bachelor looking back at love of young friend so walked about in dusk by mean happy man in way satisfied with work be still before how be to face lady fitzgerald tell of fate in what word must describe to herbert position in future must fill past have be dreadful to future must be no le so in spite of character a hard stern man when returned to house met young fitzgerald in hall have be to father asked immediately herbert in low voice with saddened face said that have just come from father room mr prendergast at once knew that nothing of truth have be told to found very weak said mr prendergast oh very weak said herbert more than weak utterly prostrate be lying on sofa almost unable to speak mother be with be still there be painfully anxious to know whether sir thomas have be weak enough strong enough to tell wife of story that morning have be told to be doing what can to comfort said herbert be very hard for to be left so utterly in dark mr prendergast be passing on to room at foot of stair herbert stopped again going up stair with almost whispering into ear trust mr prendergast said that thing be not to go on in way said mr prendergast because be unbearable unbearable for mother for for mother think that terrible thing have happened to property if so why must not be told of anything really have happened doe happen will be told know whether be aware of mr prendergast be engaged to be married have be given to understand be thought that might take place very soon mother seems to think that coming here may may defer if so think have right to expect that something will be told to certainly have right dear young friend mr fitzgerald for own sake for sake wait patiently for few hour have waited patiently yes know have behaved admirably can not speak to now time day after to morrow will tell everything know speak of to mother make promise only to then passed on into bed room with herbert be obliged to be content that evening again saw father mother told nothing of what have passed between mr prendergast lady fitzgerald remained in study with sir thomas whole evening nay almost whole night slow hour a passed there be very dreadful one came to table aunt letty mr prendergast herbert between hardly word be spoken poor girl have found utterly unable to appear be dissolved in tear crouching over fire in own room moment aunt letty left table mr prendergast arose also be suffering said cruelly from headache must ask permission to go to chamber must have be impossible for to have sat there pretending to sip wine with herbert fitzgerald after herbert again went to father then in gloom of evening found mr somers in office little magistrate room be used by by sir thomas nothing passed between herbert have nothing to tell then at about nine also went up to bedroom more melancholy day than have never shed gloom upon castle richmond chapter xx two witness mr prendergast have given two day to do be to be done before told herbert fitzgerald whole of family history have promised that must then let know that there be to be known have done so advisedly considering that must be manifestly unjust to leave in dark hour longer than be absolutely necessary to expect sir thomas must with own breath own word make revelation to son to wife be to expect manifest impossibility must altogether have sank under effort a have already sank under effort of telling to mr prendergast must be left to judgment of sir thomas to say when story must be told have now absolutely abandoned judgment in matter have placed in hand of friend now expected that friend must do that there be to be done mr prendergast have therefore felt justified in making promise how be to set about necessary intervening work how pas intervening hour have already be decided that mr abraham mollett when called must be shown a usual into study that must there find confronted not with sir thomas with mr prendergast there be doubt whether mr mollett must come might be that have mean of ascertaining what stranger arrived at castle richmond might be that must under present circumstance think expedient to stay away visit however be not to take place till second day after on mr prendergast have heard story in meantime have that examination of mr jones to arrange conduct breakfast be again very sad girl suggested to brother that mr prendergast must sit together by in small breakfast parlour to must not assent nothing must be more difficult embarrassing than conversation between that gentleman moreover be unwilling to let be thought in household that affair be going utterly wrong in family on matter need hardly have disturbed for household be fully convinced that thing be going very wrong maid servant men servant can read meaning of heavy brow sad face of long meeting whispered consultation a well a better two girl therefore aunt letty appeared at breakfast table be a though so many ghost have assembled round urn immediately after breakfast mr prendergast applied to aunt letty miss fitzgerald said think have old servant of name of jones living here yes sure said aunt letty be living with sister in law before marriage exactly ever since too believe said mr prendergast with lawyer instinctive desire to divert suspicion from true point oh yes always mr jones be quite one of then must do favour to beg mr jones to oblige with company for hour so there be excellent fire in room perhaps mr jones must not object to step there aunt letty promised that mr jones must be sent merely suggesting breakfast parlour instead of bed room to breakfast parlour mr prendergast at once betook what can know about london property about irish property thought aunt letty to herself then occurred to that perhaps trouble arose from source altogether distinct from property in about quarter of hour knock came to breakfast parlour door mr jones having be duly summoned entered room with very clean cap apron with very low curtsey good morning mr jones said mr prendergast pray take seat pointed to arm chair be comfortably placed near fire on further side of hearth rug mr jones sat down crossed hand on lap looked very personification of meek obedience yet there be something about seemed to justify soubriquet of duchess girl have given to have certain grandeur about cap majestical set about skirt of dress rigour in line of mouth indicated habit of command confidence in own dignity might be supposed to be very clearest attribute of duchessdom have be in family long time be told mr jones said mr prendergast using pleasantest voice very long time indeed said mr jones in very confidential situation too be told by sir thomas pretty nearly whole management of house be left in hand sir thomas be very kind sir sir thomas always be very kind poor gentleman poor gentleman indeed may well say that mr jones family be in great affliction be doubt aware of mr prendergast a spoke got up went to door saw that be firmly closed mr jones acknowledged that be aware of be impossible said for servant to shut eye to thing if tried ever so of course of course said mr prendergast particularly for person so attached to all a be well mr pendrergrass be attached to certainly have seed born sir be young lady mr herbert a for ladyship did see born in course for be of age come much to same thing like exactly exactly be quite one of a sir thomas sister said to just now bers jones be quite one of be very word be sure be much obliged to miss letty well a be saying great sorrow have come upon mr jones now will tell do know what be can guess at do servant know down stair 'd rather not be guessing on such matter mr pendrergrass a for if be impudent enough for like 'd never dare to tell irish servant be very impudent betimes only be good at heart too there be one 'd hurt dog belonging to family be sure must not said mr prendergast know what trouble be not know said mr jones looking down smoothing apron well now of course understand mr jones must explain to to account for question of course understand that be here a sir thomas friend to set certain matter right for if can supposed a much a if please sir question may ask ask altogether on behalf on behalf on of wife lady fitzgerald tell that may have scruple a to answering oh sir have scruple a to of course sir in anything say must be guided by by by own judgment be going to say yes sir begging pardon for mentioning thing to like of sir quite right quite right everybody must use own judgment in everything do say more le now mr jones want to know remember ladyship first marriage dare say yes sir remember said mr jones shaking head be sad affair be remember well though be very young then so be too mr jones young enough surely sir foolish enough too be most of that then sir true true so be remember man ladyship husband mr talbot called mr prendergast took trouble to look a though did not at wish to frighten yes do remember said after considerable pause be very long time ago know mr pendrergrass very long time be sure do remember lived in house know for month yes did be master for three month thereabouts to tell truth never got wage for three month yet be here there do believe now mr jones that mr talbot be still alive asked question in very soft voice endeavoured not to startle by look a did so be necessary to purpose that must keep eye upon answer to question be to be conveyed by effect on muscle of face question must produce might perhaps command voice to tell falsehood be unable to command face to support believe what sir said lawyer must immediately perceive that did believe probably knew that man who have called talbot be still alive do believe mr jones that be alive ladyship former husband know question be so terrible in nature that mr jones absolutely shook under did think that man be still alive why if thought that what be to think of ladyship be in manner that must have answered question have known how did not know have therefore to look about for other word might be equally evasive selected served turn just a well lord bless sir said be not that word be expressive tone be decidedly so be a though said how can man be alive who have be dead twenty year more nevertheless be giving evidence time against cause of poor mistress think then that be dead dead sir oh law why must be dead then there be pause between for couple of minute mr jones said mr prendergast when have well considered matter belief be that only object wish be to do good to master mistress surely sir surely must be bounden duty to do good if knew how will tell how speak out to whole truth openly freely be here a friend of sir thomas of ladyship have sent to that may advise what to do in great trouble have befallen can not give good advice till know

putting handkerchief up to eye if have information in matter think have mr jones even suspicion be duty to tell well sir be sure say against that be sir thomas friend to be sure doubt know best be poor ignorant woman to speak candidly sir feel free to talk on matter have never made marred since have be in family not in such matter a what have seed have kep ' to myself when have have suspecs a woman ca have 'em have kep ' to myself also saving presence sir meaning offence to gentleman like here got up from chair made curtsey think 'd liefer hold tongue than say anything more on matter then remained standing a though expected permission to retire there be still pause mr prendergast sat looking at fire know ma'be at last said with almost angry voice that man be here in house last week now turned round at looked full in face did not however know mr jones might be difficult to coax into free communication be altogether out of power to frighten into know sir know said what know know if please sir lady fitzgerald be missus if be to be said anything more to about here matter why 'd choose that ladyship must be by then made little motion a though to walk towards door mr prendergast managed to stop want to spare lady fitzgerald if can at rate for while said must not wish to bring more sorrow upon must god forbid mr pendrergrass if must take sorrow from heart must willingly bear to grave for ladyship have be good lady to good never did come never will of servant talking of missus so if please sir will make bold to again made attempt to reach door mr prendergast be not yet persuaded that must not get from good old woman information that wanted be persuaded that have information if only must be prevailed upon to impart so again stopped though on occasion made slight attempt to pas by a did so think said that there will be much use in staying here longer wait minute mr jones just minute if must only make understand how be circumstanced here tell what though will trust with nothing will trust with everything want trust sir not about listen to sir thomas have reason to believe nay feel quite sure that man be alive poor gentleman poor gentleman have be here in house two three time within last month sir thomas be full sure of now can tell whether man who did come be talbot be not if can answer positively one way other will do service to whole family will not go unrewarded want reward sir ask to tattle of for reward after thirty year put apron up to eye well then for good of family can say positively that man who came here to master be talbot that be not indeed then sir ca say anything positively for matter not impositively then shut up doggedly sat with compressed lip determined to resist lawyer art mr prendergast did not immediately give up game failed in learning from more than what have already told felt confident that did know secret of man existence presence in south of ireland be forced to satisfy with conviction so let go giving hand a went in token of respect receiving demure curtsey with kindest smile may be thought to have not done with yet then passed tedious day day be terribly tedious to paid visit to sir thomas a arrangement about mollett visit have be made between be not necessary that anything must be done said about business on hand be understood that further action be to be stayed till visit be over therefore for present have nothing to say to sir thomas did not see lady fitzgerald throughout whole day appeared to not unnaturally that purposely kept out of way anticipating from coming took walk with herbert mr somers be driven a far a soup kitchen mill at berry hill inquiring into state of poor rather pretending to inquire be pretence with for at present moment mind be intent on other thing then there be that terrible dinner that mockery of meal at three lady be constrained to appear at found impossible to eat to speak mr somers have be asked to join party so that scene after dinner might be le painful even felt that must not talk a be ordinary wont horrible suspicion of truth have gradually come upon with suspicion of such truth of such tragedy in very household how must how must one hold conversation then at about half past nine mr prendergast be again in bed room on next morning be early with sir thomas persuading to relinquish altogether use of study for day on evening be to have interview there in mr prendergast be to tell friend result of what have be done then have to arrange certain manoeuvring with servant in be forced to obtain assistance of herbert mollett be to be introduced into study immediately on arrival be to be done in such manner mr jones might assuredly be ignorant of arrival on duty old friend richard be employed be contrived that mr jones must be kept upstairs with mistress be difficult enough must not explain even to herbert reason why such scheming be necessary herbert however obeyed in silence knowing that something dreadful be about to fall on immediately after breakfast mr prendergast betook to study there remained with london newspaper in hand dozen time began leading article in law be laid down with great perspicuity certainty a to present state of ireland have writer be treating of sandwich island must not have attracted le of attention found impossible to read on evening must have to reveal to herbert fitzgerald what be to be fate matthew mollett at last interview with sir thomas have promised to call on day have be counting day till that one must arrive on might keep promise be terribly in want of cash a know aby have entirely failed in raising wind immediate fund of wind on occasion of visit to baronet now when morning came old mollett be early on road aby have talked of going with aby have failed so signally on occasion of visit did make to castle richmond that have be without moral strength to persist in purpose then will write to baronet go alone to london said mollett pere bother replied mollett fils hai got cash governor have got what will take there boy whether know not sir thomas will be ready enough to send remittance when be once out of country so aby have given way partly perhaps in terror of mr somers countenance matthew mollett started again in covered car on cold journey over boggeragh mountain be still mid winter being now about end of february country be colder wetter more wretched people in desolate district more ragged more starved than when have last crossed what be rag starvation to be worse off than be be merely dying a men must do be inhabiting hell on earth man need do came out to in shoal begging came in vain getting nothing from curse through chattering teeth what right have to torment with misery one so much more wretched than at little before twelve covered car be at front door of castle richmond house there be richard under porch on former occasion mr mollett have experienced little delay in making way into baronet presence servant have looked cold upon have felt a though there might be hot ploughshare under foot at step took now everything seemed to be made easy richard took in tow without moment delay told confidentially that sir thomas be waiting for bade covered car to be driven round into yard with voice be uncommonly civil seeing that be addressed to cork carman then ushered mr through hall down passage without one moment delay wretched a have be during journey wretched a infernal spirit hope be now again elated dreamed of golden paradise there be something pleasant in feeling mastery over poor old shattered baronet gentleman to wait upon sir thomas said richard opening study door then mr mollett senior found in presence of mr prendergast mr prendergast be sitting in high backed easy chair facing fire when announcement be made therefore mollett still fancied that be in presence of sir thomas until be well into room door be closed upon otherwise might probably have turned on heel bolted have have three four interview with mr prendergast having received different sum of money from gentleman hand have felt on such occasion that be being looked through through mr prendergast have asked few question never going into matter of mollett pecuniary connexion with sir thomas there have always be that in lawyer eye have frightened miscreant have quelled bluster a soon a be assumed have told that be known for blackguard scoundrel now when man with terrible gray eye got up from sir thomas chair wheeling round confronted looking full in face frowning on a honest man doe frown on unconvicted rascal when say happened to mr mollett senior thoroughly at moment wished back in london turned eye round to door be closed behind looked around to see whether sir thomas be there one be in room with mr prendergast then stood still a gentleman did not address be obliged to speak silence be too awful for oh mr prendergast said be that yes mr mollett be oh ah suppose be here about business of own be wishing to see sir thomas about little business of own maybe be not in way be not not exactly perhaps mr mollett can do a well have known before know may say to openly anything have to say to sir thomas well know about sir business be with baronet particular mr mollett a spoke strained nerve to do so without appearance of dismay effort be altogether ineffectual must not bring to look mr prendergast in face for moment avoid feeling like dog dread being kicked manner of fear came upon must at moment have given up hope of money from castle richmond people to have be free from mr prendergast influence yet mollett be not coward in ordinary sense of word indeed have be very daring in whole management of affair then course of crime make such violent demand on man courage let one think of difference of attacking thief being attacked a thief be apt to call bad men coward without much consideration mr mollett be not without pluck pluck be now quelled circumstance be too strong against listen to mr mollett look here sir never mind turning to door ca go now till have have conversation may make up mind to will never see sir thomas fitzgerald again unless indeed must be in witness box when be standing in dock mr prendergast sir well have reason to give why must not be put in dock how much money have got from sir thomas during last two year by mean of threat have be using be well aware when set about business that be committing felony have probably felt tolerably sure at time that must day be brought up short day have come mr prendergast have made up mind that nothing must be gained by soft usage with mr mollett indeed nothing must be gained in way by usage unless must be shown mollett talbot be not same person must afford therefore to tell scoundrel that be scoundrel to declare against war to knife more that mollett trembled more abject became easier must be task mr prendergast now have in hand well sir continued be going to tell what business have brought here to day mr mollett though did shake in shoe did not look at matter exactly in same light must not believe that sir thomas must throw up game on consideration that mr prendergast a friend must throw up on behalf mollett have strong feeling that must have continued to deal easily with sir thomas that might be very hard to deal at with mr prendergast nevertheless game be still open mr prendergast must probably distrust fact of being lady husband must be for therefore to use indubitable proof of fact be in possession sir thomas know very well what have come about began slowly if be told why know too in case what might might not happen in case mr mollett have not now opportunity of explaining for door opened mr jones entered room when man come morning mr prendergast have said to herbert must get to induce mr jones to come to in study a soon a may be have not at explained to herbert why be necessary have be at pain to prevent young heir from thinking feeling that terrible mystery hung over house there be terrible mystery indeed must be more terrible still when ceased to be mysterious therefore quietly explained to herbert what desired to have done herbert awaiting promised communication of evening quietly did a be bid must go down to jones have said 'd rather not sir be with yesterday for two mortal hour oh mr herbert ai for good herbert be inexorable mr jones feeling overcome by weight of misfortune be oppressing obeyed descending to master study knocked at door knew that mr prendergast be there knew that sir thomas be not did not know that stranger be in room with mr prendergast mr mollett have not heard knock indeed have mr prendergast mr jones having gone through ceremony opened door entered sir thomas know doe said mr prendergast when mollett ceased to speak on woman entrance oh mr jones good morning here be old master mr talbot mollett of course turned round found confronted with woman stared at other for moment then mollett said in low dull voice yes know be that lived with at tallyho lodge remember now mr jones said mr prendergast for moment two mr jones stood silent then acknowledged overcome felt that world around have become too much for yes said slowly remembers then sinking into chair near door put apron up to eye burst into tear doubt about remembers well enough said mollett thinking that be so much gained on side there ai doubt about matter at mr prendergast look here will see a plain a black white mr mollett dragged large pocket book from coat took out of certain document held before mr prendergast eye still keeping in own hand oh be right be said mollett oh be be said lawyer just glancing at paper must not appear to heed be glad think so if there be doubt about 'd know said pointing away up towards body of house mr prendergast mr jones understood well who be that to whom alluded be satisfied at rate mr jones said lawyer mr jones have hidden face in apron must not look up must not understand why friend of family must push matter so dreadfully against if must rise from chair destroy wretch who stood before then indeed might be called friend mr prendergast have now betaken to door be standing with back to with hand in trouser pocket close to chair on mr jones be sitting have resolved that must get that woman spoken evidence out of have gotten now what be to do with next with with late mr talbot of tallyho lodge having satisfied of fact from commencement have never doubted what must best do to spare poor lady who be so terribly implicated in man presence mr jones said standing over gently touching shoulder be sorry to have pained in way be necessary that must know without doubt who man be who be truth be always best know so good woman a can not understand that suppose be sir suppose be said mr jones through tear now thoroughly humbled world be pretty nearly at end a far a be concerned here in very house of castle richmond in sir thomas own room be ladyship former husband acknowledged a such what further fall of planet into broken fragment must terrify drive from course more thoroughly than truth yes truth in abstract might be very good such truth a how must one ever say that be good such be working of mind took trouble to express thought yes continued mr prendergast speaking still in low voice with tone be almost tender truth be always best look at wretched man here must have killed whole family destroyed one by one have consented to assist in concealing fact of existence whole truth will now be known be very dreadful will not be so dreadful a want of truth poor lady poor lady almost screamed mr jones from under apron wagging head becoming almost convulsive in grief yes be very sad will live to acknowledge even be better than living in man power know that said mollett be not so bad a 'd make want to distress lady no not if be allowed to rob gentleman till there be not guinea left for to suck at know pretty well extent of evil be in if be to kick from here to cork 'd forgive so that still allowed to go on with trade wonder how much money have have from altogether what doe money signify what doe money signify said mr jones still wagging head beneath apron why did sir thomas go on paying then lady need know nothing about be clear that mr jones must not look at matter in proper light a far a must see there be reason why fair bargain must not have be made between mollett sir thomas made kept on side with mutual convenience that doing of justice at cost of falling heaven be not intelligible to limited philosophy did bethink that leech will not give over sucking until be gorged with blood mr prendergast knew that such leech a mr mollett never leave skin a long a there be drop of blood left within vein mr prendergast be still standing against door where have placed to prevent unauthorized departure of mr jones mr mollett now be bethinking that might a well bring interview to end mr mollett said be probably beginning to understand that will not get much more money from castle richmond family want to do harm to of said mollett humbly if make troublesome hope sir thomas will consider be out of power sir to do further harm to of pretend to think that after what have passed can have personal authority over unfortunate lady poor mistress poor mistress sobbed mr jones can not do more injury than at present have done one be now afraid of one here will ever give shilling when in what form will be prosecuted for inducing sir thomas to give money can not yet tell now may go strongly advise never to show face here again if people about here knew who be what be must not let off property with whole bone in skin now go sir do hear upon word mr prendergast have not intended harm go sir even now mr prendergast can all be made straight will leave country altogether if wish go sir shouted mr prendergast if move at once will ring bell for servant then if misfortune come upon be doing not mine said mollett oh mr pendrergrass if can be hushed up said mr jones rising from chair coming up to with hand clasped together send away in anger now sir think of ladyship do do do woman took hold of arm looked up into face with eye swimming with tear then going to door closed returning again touched arm again appealed to think of mr herbert sir young lady what be to be called sir if man be to be lady husband oh mr pendrergrass let go away out of kingdom do let go away will be off to australia by next boat if will only say word said mollett to give due be not at moment thinking altogether of of what might get idea of misery have brought on people did to certain measure come home to certainly did come home to also that own position be very perilous mr jones said lawyer seeming to pay attention to mollett word know nothing of such men a if be to take at word now must turn upon sir thomas again before three week be over by must not by be holy must not mr prendergast do mr mollett will trouble to walk out of house have nothing further to say to oh very well sir then slowly mollett took departure finding covered car at door got into without saying word to of castle richmond family mr jones said mr prendergast a soon a mollett be gone believe need not trouble further conduct have done great honour respect greatly a honest woman affectionate friend mr jones must only acknowledge by loud sob for present if will take advice will say nothing of to mistress sir will say nothing oh dear oh dear whole matter will be known soon in mean time may a well remain silent good day to then mr jones also left room mr prendergast be alone chapter xxi fair argument a mollett left house saw two men walking down road away from sweep before hall door a passed recognised one a young gentleman of house also saw that horse followed behind on grass by roadside not led by hand following with rein laid loose upon neck took notice of car allowed to pas a though have concern with destiny of of be herbert fitzgerald reader will perhaps remember way in owen left desmond court on occasion of last visit there can not be said that what have heard have in way humbled indeed have taught to think that clara desmond looked at altogether with indifference greatly a have injured must not bring to look upon a chief sinner be lady desmond who have done be who have turned against because of poverty who have sold daughter to rich cousin robbed of love have won for perhaps not of love might be that be yet if so be not possible that might beat countess at own weapon thinking over felt that be necessary for to do something to take step therefore resolved to go boldly to cousin tell that regarded lady clara desmond a still own on morning therefore have ridden up to castle richmond door be now many month since have be there be no longer entitled to enter house on acknowledged intimate footing of cousin rode up asked servant with grave ceremony whether mr herbert fitzgerald be at home must not go in said if mr herbert be there must wait for at porch herbert at time be standing in dining room alone gloomily leaning against mantelpiece there be nothing for to do during whole of day wait for evening when promised revelation must be made to knew that mollett mr jones be with mr prendergast in study be matter now being investigated between that did not know till knew that closely a be concerned must meddle with nothing be already past noon evening must soon be there in mood be interrupted by being told that cousin owen be at door wo come in at mr herbert richard have said for richard according to order be still waiting about porch say that be to go to there then herbert after considering matter for moment joined cousin at front entrance want to speak to few word said owen a hear that sir thomas be not well will not go into house perhaps will walk with a far a lodge never mind mare will not go astray so herbert got hat accompanied for first hundred yard of said anything owen must not speak of clara till be well out of hearing from house at present moment herbert have not much inclination to commence conversation on subject owen be first to speak herbert said have be told that be engaged to marry lady clara desmond so be said herbert feeling very little inclined to admit of question a to privilege in respect thing be happening around might have heaven only know what consequence did fear fear with terrible dread that something might occur must shatter cup of happiness rob of fruition of hope nothing have occurred a yet so be said be wonder that must have heard for have be kept secret also have heard of visit to desmond court might have be a well think if have stayed away thought differently said owen frowning blackly thought that most straightforward thing for be to go there openly having announced intention tell mother daughter hold a engaged to lady clara that hold a engaged to that be absurd nonsense can not be engaged to two person anything interferes with will of course think absurd think otherwise be hardly more than twelve month since be walking there together then promised love have known long well when have hardly seen knew loved what be more loved remember be not only that say so said swore that nothing must change believe that anything have changed do mean to say that at present care nothing for owen must be mad on matter mad yes of course if think that girl can care for while be in way strange a may appear be a mad even a that there be people who will not sell even for money title say again that believe to be changed have be weak mother have persuaded to mother rank money title property be everything have sold daughter have come to ask whether under such circumstance intend to accept purchase in ordinary mood herbert fitzgerald be by mean quarrelsome man indeed may go further than say that be very much reverse mind be argumentative rather than impulsive in matter be readier to persuade than ordinary nature have be changed be quite new with to be nervous fretful be so at present moment be deeply concerned in circumstance around yet have be allowed voice in in affair be so peculiarly own of promised bride be determined that voice must be heard own now contrary to wont be ready enough to quarrel with cousin of owen may say that be man prone to fighting of sort on occasion by fighting old fashioned resource of putting end to fighting by aid of two pistol be harmless in nineteen case out of twenty in saying that owen fitzgerald be prone to fight allude to fighting of sort mean that be impulsive ever anxious to contend conquer to yield be to ignoble even though might know that be yielding to right to strive for mastery be to noble even though strove against who have right to rule strove on behalf of wrong such be nature of mind spirit nature have impelled to present enterprise at castle richmond have gone thither with unwonted resolve not to be passionate have have said to right on side have purposed to argue out fairly with more cold blooded cousin reader may probably guess result of fair argument on subject have come to ask said whether under such circumstance intend to accept purchase will not allow to speak of lady desmond in such language of daughter said herbert angrily ah herbert must allow have be ill used in matter have right to make be have ill used did not know before gentleman made loud complaint of such ill usage from hand of lady if ill usage a please to call be own word very well if ill usage came from clara desmond must be last person to complain of must be last person to whom must make complaint feel sure that be not so be acting under influence of mother who have frightened into thing be doing believe that be false be sure that be not false be quite agreed there be not likely that must agree further to tell truth frankly think be ill judged to speak to on topic perhaps in respect will allow to think for have not yet said that came to say belief be that unfair improper restraint be put upon clara desmond that have be induced by mother to accept offer in opposition to own wish that therefore be duty to look upon a still betrothed to do so regard her will act under such conviction first thing do therefore be to call upon to relinquish claim what to give up yes to give up to acknowledge that can not honestly call upon to fulfil pledge to man must be raving herbert said very probably remember may be that will rave to purpose when such insolence will be of little avail to raving yes suppose that man poor a be must be mad indeed to set heart upon anything that may choose to fancy be nonsense owen ask for nothing own won love fairly mean to keep firmly may possibly have won hand never heart be rich may be that even will condescend to barter hand doubt altogether doubt be mother doing a be plain enough for to see other day at desmond court much a may fear mother can not think that will go to altar with lie in mouth then walked on in silence for few yard herbert be anxious to get back to house be by mean desirous of continuing conversation with cousin at rate must get nothing by talking about lady clara desmond to owen fitzgerald stopped therefore on path said that if owen have nothing further to say herbert must go back to house nothing further nothing further if understand be not honest enough in matter to understand purpose own tell what owen did not come out here to hear abused will not stand according to idea have right to speak to about lady clara desmond be cousin therefore have borne may be a well that must understand that be once for will not listen to again on same subject oh wo upon word be very great man will tell next suppose that be demesne will warn off even if did must not be wrong under such provocation very well sir then will go off remember herbert fitzgerald will live to rue day when treated with such insolence remember also clara desmond be not wife a yet everything now seems happy with fortunate have wealth fine house family round while be there alone left like dog a far a own relative be concerned yet may come to pas that earl of desmond daughter will prefer hand to yours house to house who mount high may chance to get fall then having uttered caution turned to mare putting hand upon saddle jumped into seat pressing into gallop darted off across grass have not meant anything specially by threat heart be sore within during week past have become sick of life that be leading have begun to hate own solitary house house be solitary filled with riot noise sighed for quiet hour be once at desmond court privilege of constant entrance there be now denied cousin herbert have everything at command wealth station family tie society consideration of high place blessing be at foot of young heir blessing be not enough unless clara desmond be also added seemed so cruel to a sat alone in parlour at hap house meditating on future course of life then must think of clara promise of assurance that nothing must frighten from pledge thought of a though word have be spoken to only yesterday pondered over thing till hated cousin herbert hating vowed that clara desmond must not be wife be to have everything must say to by heaven not everything have enough may be contented will not have now with similar thought running through mind rode back to hap house herbert turned back to castle richmond a approached front door met mr prendergast who be leaving house have conversation with other herbert be in hope that might now at once be put out of suspense mollett be gone must not be better that tale must be told be clear that mr prendergast have intention of lessening by hour interval have given merely muttered few word passing on herbert went into house then there be long tedious dull afternoon herbert sat with sister have not heart to talk to other at about four note be brought to be from mr prendergast begging herbert to meet in sir thomas study at eight sir thomas have not be there during day now did not intend to leave own room dined at half past six appointment be therefore to take place almost immediately after dinner tell mr prendergast will be there said to servant so that afternoon passed away dinner also very slowly very sadly chapter xxii telling of tale dinner passed away a former dinner have done a soon a aunt letty got up mr prendergast also rose touching herbert on shoulder whispered into ear will come to at eight then herbert nodded head when be alone looked at watch slow dinner be not actually very long there still remained to three quarter of hour for anticipation what be to be nature of history that must affect personally in closest manner must not know there seemed to be doubt on mind of of that affair be one of money father money question be money question mr prendergast must not have be sent for with reference to trifle must pecuniary difficulty be not very serious have thrown father into such state of misery must be that fair inheritance be absolutely in danger herbert fitzgerald be by mean selfish man a regarded must have met ruin in face with more equanimity than most young men so circumstanced gilt of world have not eaten into soul heart be not a yet wedded to splendour of pinchbeck be saying much for for how seldom be that heart soul of young be able to withstand pinchbeck gilding be free from pusillanimity free a yet a regarded be hardly free a regarded betrothed have promised not in spoken word in thought rank wealth luxury of promised high position now on behalf nearly broke heart to think that might be endangered of mother history can hardly be said to have known anything that there have be something tragic in early life that something have occurred before father marriage that mother have be married twice have learned hardly knew when from whom on such matter there have never be conversation between of own family never occurred to that sorrow arose in way from subject that father have taken fatal step with regard to property have done foolish thing for must not forgive be idea with mind be filled waited with watch in hand till dial showed that be exactly eight then with sinking heart walked slowly out of dining room along passage into father study for instant stood with handle in hand have be terribly anxious for arrival of moment now that have come must almost fain have have again postponed heart sank very low a turned lock entering found in presence of mr prendergast mr prendergast be standing with back to fire for too last hour have be full of bitterness heart also have sunk low within blood have run cold within vein too have be possible must have put off wretched hour mr prendergast may be be not much given to poetry feeling if not word be there within work friend have to perform for friend be so much heavier than come in way of profession when herbert entered room mr prendergast came forward from where be standing took by hand be very sad affair said very sad at present know nothing about said herbert a see people about so unhappy suppose be sad if there be anything hate be mystery sit down mr fitzgerald said other sit down mr prendergast sat down in chair be ordinarily occupied by sir thomas although have be thinking about day have not even yet made up mind how be to begin story even now must not help thinking whether might be possible for to leave untold be not possible mr fitzgerald said must prepare for tidings be very grievous indeed very grievous whatever be must bear said hope have moral strength enables man to bear misfortune have not known in happy day therefore perhaps can hardly judge seems to that do posse such courage did not think so must hardly go through task be before here paused a though expected reply assurance that young friend did posse strength of spoke herbert said nothing nothing out loud if be only for if be only for be thus that spoke to own heart mr fitzgerald continued lawyer know how far may be acquainted with history of mother first marriage herbert said that be hardly acquainted with in degree explained that merely knew fact that mother have be married before met sir thomas know that need recount circumstance to now though doubtless will learn mother conduct throughout be believe admirable be quite sure of amount of evidence must make believe contrary there be tittle of evidence to make one think so in early youth when be quite child be given in marriage to man to man of whom be impossible to speak in term too black in language too strong now day here paused have be intention to say that very man first husband of loved mother now looked upon a dead for so many year miscreant of whom have spoken that man have be in room very day hardly knew how to frame word well said herbert well spoke in hoarse voice be scarcely audible mr prendergast be afraid to bring out very pith of story in so abrupt manner wished to have work over to feel that a regarded herbert be done heart failed when came to yes said going back a be to former thought heartless cruel debauched unscrupulous man one in whose bosom good thing seemed to have be implanted father when first knew mother have reason to believe that man be dead be not dead mr prendergast must see that young man face became perfectly pale a uttered word became pale clutched hold of table with hand there sat with mouth open staring eye be afraid not said mr prendergast be afraid not must go further than tell that be still living prendergast mr prendergast exclaimed poor fellow rising up from chair shouting out a though for mercy mr prendergast also rose from seat coming up to took by arm dear boy dear boy be obliged to tell be necessary that must know fact be a say be now for to show that be man who be ever called upon for stronger proof of manhood than in nine case out of ten be not for one have to be brave man may almost say be man whose own individual suffering call for exercise of much courage be so mixed up conjoined with others with others who be weaker dearer than that great sorrow do require great power of endurance by degree a stood there in silence whole truth made way into mind a stood there with arm still tenderly pressed by old man one now must have called lawyer stern in looking at for tear be coursing down cheek tear came to relief of young fitzgerald a truth slowly came upon fold by fold black cloud upon cloud till whole horizon of life prospect be dark a death stood there silent for few minute hardly conscious that be not alone a saw joy disappearing from before mind eye one by one family pride pleasant high toned duty of station promised seat in parliament prosperous ambition full respect of world around wealth pride of place for let man be credited who boast that can part with without regret be gone there be loss more bitter than how must think of affianced bride how must think of mother tear came to relief while truth with bearing burnt into very soul face expressed such agony that be terrible to be seen mr prendergast must stand silence no longer so at last spoke spoke for sake of word for tale have be told saw man be here yesterday that be who then called talbot what man went away in car mollett yes be man herbert have said that evidence must be sufficient to make believe that mother have be in way culpable such probably be case have that reliance on mother assurance in mind that everything coming from must be good that must not believe capable of ill nevertheless must not prevent from asking within own breast how have be possible that mother must ever have be concerned with wretch a that be question must not fail to make audible what being on earth be sweeter than mother more excellent more noble more fitted for world high place more absolutely entitled to universal respect seemed to be given to a own by right what being must be more loathsome more contemptible than who be a be now told mother husband there be in want of verisimilitude almost gave comfort almost taught to think that might disbelieve story be told to poor fellow have yet to learn difference that year may make in men woman for better a well a for worse circumstance have given to poor half educated village girl simple dignity of high station a circumstance have also brought to lowest dreg of human existence man whose personal bearing apparent worldly standing have be held sufficient to give warrant that be of gentle breeding of honest standing nay good fortune in such marriage have once be almost begrudged by maiden neighbour herbert a thought of be almost encouraged to disbelieve story to with knowledge of what mother be such knowledge a also have of man did not seem possible how be known muttered forth at last fear there be doubt of truth said mr prendergast father have doubt have have none must tell plainly for month for month why have not be told be hard upon father hard of course must not be hard upon burden have have to bear have be very terrible have thought that by payment of money to man whole thing might be concealed a be always case when such payment be made insatiable love of money grew by what fed on must have poured out shilling into man hand must have died beggar have died speedily too under such torment yet good must have be done harpy must have come upon after have innocently assumed title be not own taken property to have right then must have have to own father must own now if be so said herbert slowly must be acknowledged just so mr fitzgerald just so know will feel that in such matter can only sail safely by truth there be other compass worth man while to look at of course not said herbert with hoarse voice one doe not wish to be robber thief cousin will have what be own then involuntarily thought of interview have have on very day why did not tell when spoke to of said with something approaching to bitterness in voice slight struggle in throat be almost premonitory of sob ah be there that fear for know what feeling be think of sorrow be hard on ah ah exclaimed herbert fear that will not be with long have already endured till be now almost past power of suffering more yet there be so much more that must suffer poor father think what such a must have gone through in bringing into contact with man have be done that might spare mother think of wound to conscience before must have lowered to unworthy bargain with swindler have be done that might have have be taught to look on a own have be wrong other verdict can be given at rate can be tender to such fault mother will will said herbert if have happened month since must have borne then thought of mother hated for what have said how must have borne that with patience there be doubt say think none man carry proof with old servant here in house too know what mr jones yes mr jones burden of further proof must now of course be thrown on not on directly that believe statement be for to ascertain truth father must not be seen to hold false position before world be to do now fear that mother must be told mr owen fitzgerald then must together openly prove fact in one way in other will be better that must do together be cousin owen conjointly do openly before world so that world may know that of desire only what be honestly own for tell fairly have doubt of truth of what have told further proof be certainly needed have doubt must not propose to tell mother a be think will be wrong to keep longer in dark doe suspect nothing know have more power of self control than father have not spoken to ten word since have be in house in not doing so have thought that be right own mother dear mother if ask opinion think that doe suspect truth very vaguely with indefinite feeling that calamity weighs so heavily on father have come from source dear lady be greatly to be pitied god have made of firmer material than father think that will bear sorrow with higher courage be to be told also yes think so see how can avoid if tell must attempt to conceal that attempt must need be futile when be engaged in making open inquiry on subject cousin when hears of will of course be anxious to know what real prospect be yes yes will be anxious determined too then when world will know how be mother to be kept in dark that fear anticipates be a bad probably a actual truth if advice be followed nothing will be kept from be in hand suppose mr prendergast can only act a judgment directs who be to tell asked with shudder almost in whisper very idea of undertaking such duty seemed almost too much for yet must undertake duty almost a terrible one must endure anguish of repeating story to clara desmond to countess now question have reference to own mother who be to tell asked for moment two mr prendergast stood silent have not hitherto in so many word undertaken task must be most dreadful of if did not undertake who must suppose must do at last said very gently when a soon a have told cousin will go down to to morrow after breakfast be probable that will find at home yes if be there before ten hound meet to morrow at cecilstown within three mile of will not leave home till near eleven be possible that may have house full of men with at rate will try on such occasion a may surely let friend go to hunt without then between nine ten interview came to end mr fitzgerald said mr prendergast a pressed herbert hand have borne a man must do loss of fortune can ruin one who be so well able to endure misfortune in mr prendergast be perhaps mistaken knowledge of human nature have not carried sufficiently far man courage under calamity be only tested when be left in solitude meanest among can bear up while strange eye be looking at then mr prendergast went away be alone have be habit during whole of period of father illness to go to sir thomas at before bedtime visit have usually be made to study room in be now standing when father have gone to bedroom at earlier hour herbert have always seen there be to go to now now that have heard if so how be to bear there in father presence stood still thinking of till hand of clock showed that be past ten then struck that father might be waiting for must not do for now at moment to appear wanting in attention have always shown be still father son though have lost right to bear father name be nameless now man utterly without respect standing place in world being whom law ignored except a possessor of mere life such be now instead of one whose right privilege whose property rank statute of realm custom of country delighted to honour protect repeated to over over again be to pas a to bitter disappointment that father have brought yet must not be said of that have begun to neglect father a soon a have heard story so with weary step walked up stair found sir thomas in bed with mother sitting by bedside mother held out hand to took leaning against bedside have mr prendergast left asked told that mr prendergast have left gone to own room for night have be with evening asked have special motive in so asking father son shuddered at question yes said herbert have be with now have come to wish father good night too mother if intend to remain here lady fitzgerald got up telling herbert that must leave with sir thomas before of must hinder from departing father son be alone together sir thomas when door closed looked furtively up into son face might be that must read there how much have be already told how much still remained to be disclosed that herbert be to learn that evening knew might be that mr prendergast have failed to perform task sir thomas in heart trusted that have failed looked up furtively into herbert face at moment there be nothing there that must read there be nothing there black misery face round for many day past have worn that aspect for minute two herbert said nothing for have not made up mind whether must that night disturb father rest must not speak in ordinary voice bid father good night a though nothing special to have happened father said after short pause father know now boy poor boy unfortunate boy father said herbert be unhappy about can bear then thought again of bride bride a be to have be nevertheless repeated last word can bear father have meant for best herbert said poor man pleading to child know that of well know what mr prendergast say be true be better that must be known man must have killed have kept longer to yourself sir thomas hid face upon pillow a remembrance of what have endured in meeting came upon blow have told heaviest be that visit from son threat man have made still rung in ear when youngster be born lady f be mr m be governor must take away to morrow according to law of land must now word more such a have nearly killed at time now a recurred to burst out into childish tear poor man day of manhood have gone nothing tear of second bitter childhood remained to hot iron have entered into soul shrivelled up very muscle of mind strength herbert without much thought of what be doing knelt down by bedside put hand upon of father lay out upon sheet there knelt for one two minute watching listening to father sob will be better now father said for great weight of terrible secret will be off mind sir thomas did not answer with there must never be better thing belonging to have gone to ruin around whom have loved have loved around very dearly be brought to poverty sorrow disgrace power of feeling be left to power of enduring with manhood be gone blow have come upon too late in life herbert a knelt there must hardly forbear from tear now at moment a must think of one father author of being who lay there so grievously afflicted by sorrow be in nowise selfish father said at last will pray with then when poor sufferer have turned face towards poured forth prayer to saviour that in family might be enabled to bear heavy sorrow god in mercy wisdom have now thought fit to lay upon will not make word profane by repeating here one may say confidently that be not uttered in vain now dearest father good night said a rose from knee stretching over bed kissed father forehead chapter xxiii before breakfast at hap house may be imagined that mr mollett drive back to cork after last visit to castle richmond have not be very pleasant indeed may be said that present circumstance altogether be a unpleasant a worst enemy must desire have endeavoured to excite sympathy of who be going with through story for suffering of family of fitzgerald how will succeed in exciting sympathy for other family of molletts yet why not if be to sympathise only with good worse still only with graceful how little will there be in character be better than terrestrial molletts also be human have string to heart at world must now probably pull with sufficient vigour for can truly say that strongest feeling be for wretchedness father son have more than once boasted among that game be now playing be high one that be in fact gambling for mighty stake in truth a long a money came in to flowing in a result of own craft in game excitement have about something be very pleasurable there be danger make game pleasant there be money in handful for daily expense daily want of appetite be to such men more important by far than distant necessity of life there be possibility of future grandeur opening out of magnificent idea of fortune charmed greatly a thought about might not do with forty thousand pound divided between even with thousand year settled on for life surely secret be worth that money nay be not palpable to meanest calculation that be worth much more have not selling of twelve thousand year for ever ever to family of fitzgerald for last fortnight thing have begun to go astray with money easily come by go easily money badly come by go badly have come easily badly have so gone what necessity must there be for economy with such milch cow a close to elbow so of have thought if not argued there have be no economy economy in use of very costly amusement dice box now at present moment ready money having failed to be result of of two last visit to castle richmond family fund be running low may be said that ready money for moment be one desire nearest to heart of mollett pere when took that last journey over boggeragh mountain ready money wherewith to satisfy pressing claim of miss o'dwyer bring back civility rather servility to face manner of tom waiter at kanturk hotel very little of servility can be enjoyed by person of mollett class when money cease to be ready in hand pocket there be perhaps nothing that enjoy so keenly a servility mollett pere have gone down determined that comfort must at rate be forthcoming to answer might be given to other grander demand know what success have attended mission have looked to find tame milch cow trembling in accustomed stall have found resolute bull there in place bull whom must by mean take by horn have got money before have reached cork have begun to comprehend that be not probable that must get more from source during part of interview between mr prendergast spark of mercy towards victim have glimmered into heart when be explained to that game be to be given up that family at castle richmond be prepared to acknowledge truth that effort made be with view of proving that poor lady up stair be not entitled to name bore rather than be so entitled then slight prompting of better spirit did for while tempt to be merciful oh what be about to do must have said have mr prendergast admitted of speech from why make terrible sacrifice matter have not come to that there be need for to drag to light terrible fact will not divulge not although be hard upon in regard to term of mine will still keep to trust to to who be so rich able to pay for what consideration may please to give be state of mind when mr jones evidence be being slowly evoked from have undergone considerable change before reached cork by time have taught to understand that there be longer chance to of consideration slowly have brought home to that people have resolutely determined to blow up ground on stood perceived be honesty did not understand nature of feeling must induce so fatal suicide did understand that feeling be there that suicide must be completed now what be to do next in way of earning bread various thought ran through brain different resolve half formed still perhaps capable of shape presented to for future be still on card on card barely so that might make money out of people must wait perhaps for week before again commenced attempt might perhaps make money out of be merciful to at same time not money by thousand ten of thousand golden dream be gone for ever still money might be comfortably luxurious a long a must be made to last then on one special point made firm final resolution new scheme might hatch alone must manage never again must call into council that son of loin whose rapacious greed have a felt sure brought upon ruin have aby not gone to castle richmond with cruelty greed frightening to very death soul of poor baronet by enormity of demand mr prendergast must not have be there of what further chance of castle richmond picking there might be aby must know nothing son must no longer hunt in couple must shake off in escape must now make from cork must not care how long might be before again saw countenance then question of ready money that other question perhaps a interesting touching criminal prosecution how be to escape if must not raise wind how must raise wind now that milch cow have run so dry have promised o'dwyers money that

whom be now about to call be also big gentleman made more uneasy than must have be have entered place with le pretence there be story current that in west of england grandeur of middle aged maiden lady be measured by length of tail of cat aby have perhaps equally correct idea that length of private drive up to gentleman house be fair criterion of splendour of position if man have about a much grandeur a sir thomas must be so anxious a aby have hoped to obtain additional grandeur of sir thomas be in direction that mind be operating when got down from car rang at door bell mr owen a everybody called be at home not down so aby be shown into dining room be now considerably past nine servant told that master must be there soon a have to eat breakfast be at hunt by eleven servant at

summoned owen began to bestir with boot breech gentleman costume for hunting morning be always slow one sometimes so slow tedious a to make think of forswearing such article of dress for future age now did bestir in moody melancholy sort of manner for manner in thing latterly have become moody melancholy in mean time captain donnellan two stranger sat almost in silence in dining room captain though did not perhaps know much of thing noticeable in world did know something of gentleman be therefore not led away a poor thady have be by aby hat ring have stared aby full in face when entered room having explained that be not master of house have not vouchsafed word then have also seen that mr prendergast be of different class have said civil word two asking to come near fire suggesting that owen must be down in le than five minute old cock must crow a afterwards remarked to friend so three sat in silence captain being very busy about knee a hunting gentleman sometimes be when come down to bachelor breakfast then at last owen fitzgerald entered room have be described a handsome man in dress did look so well a when equipped for day sport what dress englishman ever wear be so handsome a may perhaps say what other dress doe english custom allow be in respect not reverse of handsome have come to be so dingy in taste be going to say be rather in want of taste so careless of of law of beauty in fold line hue of dress so opposed to grace in arrangement of person that be not permitted to ordinary english gentleman to be anything else ugly chimney pot hat swallow tailed coat pantaloon fit nothing came creeping in upon one after other while george reigned creeping in upon with such picture a painted under reign of west such house a built under reign of nash till english eye required to rest on be constrained dull graceless for last two score of year have come to if man go in handsome attire be popinjay vain fool a be better to be ugly than to be accounted vain must not counsel young friend to leave beaten track on strength of own judgment not le be beaten track to be condemned abandoned abolished if such be in way possible beauty be good in thing can not think that old venetian senator florentine men of council owed somewhat of country pride power to manner in clipped beard wore flowing garment englishman may still make brave when go forth into hunting field custom there allows colour garment fit limb strength be outward characteristic of manhood at covert side may appear strong look at men a walk along fleet street ask whether outward sign of manhood strength can be seen there of gentle manhood outward dignity must be trade mark will not say that such outward dignity be incompatible with black hat plaid trouser for eye instructed by habit will search out dignity for wherever may truly exist let be hidden by what vile covering may man who can look well at club will look better a cluster round hound while many one who be comely there be mean enough a stand on hearth rug before club fire in mind men like church book woman too must be brave not mean in outward garniture owen a have said be brave a walked into dining room sorrow weighed on heart have not wrinkled brow have given set dignity of purpose tall figure present dress allowed to be seen be perfect in symmetry of strength bright chestnut hair clustered round forehead eye shone like of hawk must have be wrong who said that commonly spent night over wine cup that pleasure always leaf disgusting trace round lip owen fitzgerald lip be a full lusty a apollo mollett a saw be stricken with envy if must only get enough money out of affair to look like be first thought a eye fell on future heir not understanding poor wretch that be that gold of california must not bring one inch nearer to goal aimed at think have said before silk purse will not get made out of coarse material with there be so many attempt to manufacture article mr prendergast rose from chair when saw with respect be almost involuntary have not heard men speak well of owen fitzgerald not that ill natured thing have be said by family at castle richmond circumstance have prevented possibility of praising if relative friend be spoken of without praise be in fact censured from what have heard have certainly not expected man who must look so noble a did owner of hap house who now came forward to ask business mr prendergast aby mollett rose at same time since arrival of latter gentleman aby have be wondering who might be idea that be that lawyer from castle richmond have entered head that be stranger like aby saw did not connect with own business indeed have not yet realized belief though father have done so that truth must be revealed by at castle richmond to at hap house object now be that old gentleman must say say begone leaving to dispose of other young man in top boot a best might then a happened that be also mr prendergast line of action gentleman said owen beg pardon for keeping waiting fact be that be so seldom honoured in way in morning be hardly ready donnellan there be tea mind waiting gentleman will perhaps join then looked hard at aby a though trusted in providence that such profanation must be done to table cloth thank have breakfasted said mr prendergast so 'ave said aby who have eaten penny loaf in car must have be delighted to sit down at rich table be little beside not able to pluck up courage for such effort know whether two gentleman have come about same business said owen looking from one to other said mr prendergast very confidently not very correctly wish to speak to mr fitzgerald for few minute business with be quite private so be mine said aby very private very private indeed well gentleman have just hour in to eat breakfast attend to business get on horse leave house out of twenty five minute be very much at service donnellan beg pardon do pitch into broiled bone while be hot never mind now gentleman if will walk with into other room first come first served that suppose must be order opened door stood with ajar in hand will wait mr fitzgerald if please said mr prendergast a spoke motioned mollett with hand to go to door oh can wait sir 'd rather wait sir must indeed said aby business be little particular if will go on sir will take up with gen'leman a soon a have done sir mr prendergast be accustomed to have own way must prefer that must go first sir to tell truth mr fitzgerald have to say to will take time be of much importance to to others fear that will probably find that will detain from amusement to day owen looked black a heard hound be going to draw covert of own be not in habit of remaining away from drawing of covert belonging to others on provocation whatever will be rather hard said considering that know more than man in moon what have come about will be sole judge sir of importance of business with said mr prendergast well mr forget name said owen name mollett said aby whereupon mr prendergast looked up at very sharply said nothing said nothing looked very sharply indeed now knew well who man be guessed with tolerable accuracy cause of visit nevertheless at moment said nothing come along then mr mollett hope affair be not likely to be very long one also perhaps will excuse having cup of tea sent in to a talk to there be nothing like saving time when such very important business be on tapis donnellan send thady in with cup of tea like good fellow now mr mollett mr mollett rose slowly from chair followed host must have given possessed in world be very little to have have coast clear in such emergency what be to do by time have reached door of drawing room have made up mind to tell fitzgerald that seeing there be so much other business on hand morning at hap house special piece of business of must stand over then how must go back to cork empty handed so followed into room there opened budget with what courage have left to captain donnellan a employed on broiled bone twice invited mr prendergast to assist in vain donnellan remained there waiting for owen till eleven then got on horse will tell fitzgerald will that have started will see nothing of to day hunt be clear think will said mr prendergast chapter xxiv after breakfast at hap house think will said mr prendergast a spoke captain donnellan ear must detect that there be something approaching to sarcasm in tone of old man voice captain be quite sure that friend must not be even at heel of hunt day without further compunction proceeded to fasten buckskin glove round wrist meet be so near to that have intended to ride own hunter from door two nag be now being led up down upon gravel at moment terrible noise be heard to take place in hall there be rush crushing there made even mr prendergast to jump from chair drove captain donnellan to forget glove run to door be a though wind of heaven be being driven down passage a though separate wind be shod with heavy heeled boot captain donnellan ran to door mr prendergast with slower step followed when be opened owen be to be seen in hall apparently in state of great excitement gentleman whom have lately asked to breakfast be to be seen also in position of unmistakeable discomfort be at moment proceeding with utmost violence into large round bed of bush stood in middle of great sweep before door of house foot just touching ground a went then having reached bourne penetrated face foremost into thicket in instant disappeared have be kicked out of house owen fitzgerald have taken by shoulder with run along passage hall having reached door have applied flat of foot violently to poor aby back sent flying down stone step now a captain donnellan mr prendergast stood looking on mr mollett junior buried altogether out of sight among shrub have done for fellow at rate owen said captain donnellan glancing for moment at mr prendergast must say that will never get out of alive not if wait till pick out said owen breathing very hard after exertion infernal scoundrel now mr prendergast if be ready sir be be a much a must do to finish few word with sang froid desired to assume so violent be attempt at breathing after late exercise be impossible not to conceive idea that a one disagreeable visitor have be disposed of in somewhat summary fashion so might be other also mr prendergast did not look like man who be in habit of leaving gentleman house in manner just now adopted by mr mollett nevertheless a have come together unwished for unwelcome captain donnellan did for moment bethink whether there might not be more of such fun if remained there on spot at rate must not do for to go to hunt while such deed a be being done might be that assistance must be wanted mr prendergast smiled with saturnine somewhat bitter smile nearest approach to laugh in be known to indulge for same notion came also into head have disposed of now be thinking how will dispose of such be mr prendergast thought about matter that made smile then too be pleased at what have seen that mollett be son of other mollett with whom have be closeted at castle richmond be plain enough be plain enough also to used a be to trace out in mind course of action men must follow mollett junior having heard of father calamitous failure at castle richmond have come down to hap house to see what must make out of hitherto unconscious heir have be matter of great doubt with mr prendergast when first heard young mollett name mentioned whether must allow to make attempt mr prendergast must by word have spoilt game acting a be forced to act on spur of moment resolved to permit mr mollett junior to play out play must be yet in time to prevent ill result to mr fitzgerald must gentleman be weak enough to succumb to such ill result a thing have now turned out mr prendergast rejoiced that mr mollett junior have be permitted to play out play now mr prendergast if be ready be said owen perhaps have better first pick up gentleman among tree said mr prendergast captain donnellan went down into bush do a please about said owen have touched once will not touch again walked back into dining room one of groom who be leading horse have now gone to assistance of fallen hero a captain donnellan also have already penetrated a far a aby shoulder mr prendergast thinking that be not needed returned also to house hope be not seriously hurt said not said sort of men be a used to be kicked a girl be to be kissed come a naturally to anything short of having bone broken will be le than deserves may ask what be nature of offence owen remained silent for moment looking guest full in face well not exactly said have be talking of people of whom know nothing must not be well for to repeat what have said to perfect stranger quite right mr fitzgerald must not be well there can be harm in repeating to came here to get money from for certain tidings brought tidings if true must be of great importance to a take however have altogether failed in object how do come to know sir merely from having heard that man mention own name also have come with same tidings a ask for money for communicating may believe to be true on telling what tidings asked owen with frown angry jerk in voice remotest notion have yet come in upon mind that there be truth in story have be told have looked upon a lie have regarded mollett a sorry knave who have come to with poor low attempt at raising few pound even now did not believe mr prendergast word have be too sudden to produce belief of so great fact first thought be that endeavour be being made to fool tidings man have told said mr prendergast solemnly that must not have believed from show only discretion from may believe have come from castle richmond be here a messenger from sir thomas from sir thomas from son when matter became clear to then be felt that also must be made acquainted with owen fitzgerald now sat down looked up into lawyer face staring at may say that power of saying much be for moment taken away from by word that heard what be really possible that title property that place of honour in country be to be when one frail old man must drop away then again be really true that immeasurable misery be to fall have fallen upon family whom have once known so well be yesterday that have be threatening manner of evil to cousin herbert have threat be proved true so quickly there be shadow of triumph in feeling owen fitzgerald be man of many fault be reckless passionate prone to depreciate opinion of others extravagant in thought habit ever ready to fight morally physically who did not at moment notice agree with be man who must at once make up mind that world be wrong when world condemned who must not in compliance with argument allow to be so be not avaricious cruel self seeking vindictive in anger must pronounce manner of ill thing against enemy a have pronounced ill thing against herbert be not in to keep up sustained wish that ill thing must really come to pas news now heard did not yet fully credit struck with awe created triumph in bosom realized catastrophe a affected cousin of castle richmond rather than a affected do mean to say that lady fitzgerald then stopped have not courage to ask question be in mind must really be case lady fitzgerald that whom world have so long honoured under name be in truth wife of man father of father of wretch whom have just spurned from house tragedy be so deep that must not believe in fear that be so mr fitzgerald said mr prendergast that certainly be so can not say therefore if may take liberty to give counsel must advise not to make too certain of change in prospect too certain said with bitter laugh do suppose then must wish to see ruin accomplished heaven earth lady fitzgerald can not believe then captain donnellan also returned to room fitzgerald said what mischief be to do with fellow say that ca walk bleeds from face like pig what fellow oh do what like with here give pound note let go to d donnellan for heaven sake go to cecilstown at once wait for have business will keep here day know what to do with fellow be bleeding said captain piteously a took proffered note if put up with pound note for what have done to be softer than what take for will be very glad to be allowed to escape without being given up to police said mr prendergast know what to do with said captain donnellan say that ca stand then lay down on dunghill said owen fitzgerald for heaven sake let interrupt donnellan will altogether lose day if stay longer whereupon captain seeing that in very truth be not wanted did take off casting a went one farewell look on aby a lay groaning on turf on far side of tuft of bush be kilt intirely be thinking yer honor said thady who be standing over on other side will come to life again before dinner time said captain oh in course will do yer honor said thady then added sotto voce to a captain rode down avenue faix ' know about shure ' be masther have heavy hand then thady stood for while perplexed endeavouring to reanimate aby by sight of pound note held out visibly between thumb finger now mr prendergast owen be again alone what be to do said owen after pause of minute two asked question with serious solemn voice just for present for next day two think that must hing a soon a first agony of time be over at castle richmond think that herbert must see must be very desirable that must take in concert such proceeding a will certainly become necessary absolute proof of truth of story must be obtained understand hope mr fitzgerald that case still admits of doubt owen nodded head impatiently a though be needle on part of mr prendergast to insist upon did not wish to take for true moment sooner than be necessary be duty to give caution many lawyer presume know that be lawyer did not know said make difference thank be very kind said mr prendergast sarcasm be altogether lost upon hearer lawyer a be saying must in such case have advised client to keep suspicion nay knowledge to why play game of adversary must ask have thought better that must have adversary will have none said owen none in at least be much gratified in so perceiving in having such evidence that advice have not be indiscreet occurred to that if received first intimation of circumstance from other source must be bound on own behalf to employ agent to look after own interest must have done nothing of kind said owen ah dear young friend in such case must have be duty to do so then must have neglected duty do tell herbert from let truth be what may will never interrupt in title property be not there that will look for justice revenge will understand what mean mr prendergast did not by mean did enter into tone of owen fitzgerald mind be just men just in essentially different manner justice of mr prendergast have come of thought education a young man when entering on profession be probably le just than be now have thought about matter of law equity till thought have shown to beauty of equity a must be practised often by aid of law not unfrequently in spite of law such be justice of mr prendergast that of owen fitzgerald have come of impulse nature be justice of very young man rather than of very wise one title property did not a felt of justice belong to to cousin what difference must make in true justice of thing whether wretched man be still alive whom world have regarded a dead in justice ought to be dead now that calamity of man life have fallen upon sir thomas lady fitzgerald cousin herbert must not be for to aggravate by seizing upon heritage might possibly accrue to under letter of world law must not accrue to under heaven law such be justice of owen fitzgerald may say of in dispraise a comparing with other justice whereas that of mr prendergast must wear for ever through age age that other justice of owen must hardly have stood pull of ten year struggle when child came to must not have thought of what might have be theirs by right then have thought of what ought to be theirs by right so on in speaking of justice have also spoken of revenge mr prendergast be altogether in dark what revenge did not know that poor owen have lost love that herbert have found in midst of confused thought astounding intelligence have brought upon owen still thought of love there herbert have robbed robbed by mean of wealth in matter desired justice justice revenge wanted back love let have herbert might yet be welcome to title estate mr prendergast remained there for half hour longer explaining what ought to be done how ought to be done of course combated that idea of owen that property might be allowed to remain in hand of wrong heir have that be consonant with idea of justice must not have made visit to hap house morning right must have way if must be that lady fitzgerald marriage with sir thomas have not be legal owen on sir thomas death must become sir owen herbert must not become sir herbert so much to mind of mr prendergast be a clear a crystal let justice be done even though castle richmond heaven must fall in ruin then took departure leaving owen to solitude much perplexed where be that man mr prendergast asked a got on to car bedad thin yer honer be very bad intirely be jist sitthing over kitchen fire moaning croning way that sorrow word be spoke since masther hoisted out o ' big hall door thin for blood why saving yer honer presence be one mash of gore 'd better wash face for give little tea said mr prendergast then drove away strange idea floated across owen fitzgerald brain a sat there alone in hunting gear leaning on still covered breakfast table floated across brain backwards forward at last remained there taking almost form of definite purpose must make bargain with herbert let of keep that be fairly own let herbert have broad land of castle richmond let have title seat in parliament county honour for owen let have clara desmond desired nothing be not fairly own a own did regard without did not know how to face future of life in suggesting arrangement to did not altogether throw over feeling did take into account heart though did not take into account worldly prospect have loved owen must not teach to believe that did not love still mother have be too powerful for have weakly yielded a to heart owen must not bring to believe that be gone from two must make bargain cousin honour renown money title must be everything to cousin herbert have be brought up to expect thing world around have expected for must be terrible to to find robbed of loss of clara desmond be equally terrible to owen fitzgerald allowed heart to fill with romantic sense of honour teaching that behoved a man not to give up love without must live disgraced in own estimation who must not think better of for refraining from possession of castle richmond acre yes must make bargain with herbert who be there in world to deny right to do so a sat revolving thing in mind suddenly heard rushing sound a of many horseman down avenue going to window saw two three leading men of hunt accompanied by gray haired old huntsman through about under horseman be dog running in out of laurel skirted road with nose down giving now then short yelp a caught up uncertain scent from leaf on ground hurried on upon trail of game yo ho to messenger hark to maybird good bitch merrylass be down here gen'lemen will never get away alive came to bad place when looked out for going to ground anywhere near mr owen then there came fast trotting down through other horseman making way eagerly to front stout heavy man with florid handsome face eager eye might be fifty year of age lad there of three twenty be so anxious impetuous a be riding large boned fast trotting bay horse pressed on a eagerly a rider a hurried forward made way for till be close to shrub in front of house bless soul gentleman said in angry voice how in name of good be hound to hunt if press down road in way by heaven barry be enough to drive man wild yoicks merrylass there be pat pat be huntsman outside low wall there down towards river be sam o'grady master of duhallow hound god of owen idolatry no better fellow ever lived master of hound so good such at least be opinion common among duhallow sportsman yes yer honer did skirt round there know that be be among laurel at bottom will be about place outhouse somewhere there be drain here know on know on mr owen know on too there aint chance for so argued pat duhallow huntsman experienced craft of whose aged mind enabled to run counter to cutest dodge of cutest fox in of three neighbouring barony now sweep before door be crowded with red coat owen looking from dining room window felt that must take step a ordinary rule have hunt thus drifted near homestead must have be off horse down among bottle sending up sherry cherry brandy there must have be comfortable drink in plenty cold meat perhaps not in plenty one must have be welcome in out of house now there be that at heart forbade to mix with men who knew so well among whom be customarily so loudly joyous dressed a be must not go among without explaining why have remained at home a to that felt that be not able to give explanation at present moment what be matter with owen said one fellow to captain donnellan upon word hardly know two chap came to morning before be up about business said nearly murdered one of out of hand believe that be locked up somewhere with other minute in meantime servant came up to mr o'grady touching hat asked master of hunt to go into house for moment then mr o'grady dismounting entered in through front door be only there two minute for mind be still outside among laurel with fox a put foot again into stirrup said to around that must hurry away not disturb owen fitzgerald that day may therefore easily be imagined that mystery must spread quickly through portion of county of cork must hurry away not before must give account of fox for god men must be left a long a skin be whole above ground there be importance attaching to pursuit of fox give character quite distinct from of other amusement men follow in realm justifies almost anything that men can do that at place in season there be about sanctity forbids interruption make votary safe under circumstance of trespass intrusion man in hunting county who opposes county hunt must be misanthrope willing to live in seclusion fond of being in coventry in love with enmity of fellow creature there be such men be regarded a leper by around add to nobleness of noble sport make worthy of man energy then crowd of huntsman hurried round from front of house to paddock at back then again through stable yard to front hound be about here there everywhere a one ignorant of craft must have said still always on scent of doomed beast from one thicket to tried to hide moist leaf of underwood told quickly of whereabouts tried hole cranny about house hole corner have be stopped by owen jealous care must have lived disgraced for ever in own estimation have fox gone to ground anywhere about domicile at last loud whoop be heard just in front of hall door poor fox with last gasp of strength have betaken to thicket before door there dog have killed at very spot on aby mollett have fallen standing well back from window still thinking of clara desmond owen fitzgerald saw fate of hunted animal saw head tail severed from carcase by old pat body thrown to hound ceremony over have presided so many score of time then when dog have ceased to growl over bloody fragment saw hunt move away back along avenue to high road saw still be thinking of clara desmond chapter xxv muddy walk on wet morning day of hunt be passed very quietly at castle richmond herbert did not once leave house having begged mr somers to make excuse at relief committee must have be business to attend great portion of day spent with father who lay motionless in state be apparently half comatose during long hour very little be said between about tragedy of family why must more be said now now that worst have befallen worst to hide sir thomas have endured such superhuman agony then four five time during day went to mother with did not stay long to must hardly speak upon subject for to a yet story have not be told when thus came to from time to time with soft word two softer kiss must ask question knew that have learned whole knew also from solemn cloud on brow that whole must be very dreadful indeed may surmise that woman heart have by time guessed somewhat of truth must inquire of one jones be sure knew did not ask single question of servant must be told to when be fitting why must move in matter whenever herbert entered room tried to receive with something of smile be clear enough that be always glad of coming that made little show of welcoming book be always put away very softly by slightest motion herbert well knew what that book be whence mother sought that strength enabled to live through such ordeal a sister be to be seen moving slowly about house like very ghost of former self voice be hardly heard ring of customary laughter ever came from room in sat when passed brother in house hardly dared to whisper to a to sitting down at table now with mr prendergast that effort be wholly abandoned kept even from sound of footstep aunt letty perhaps spoke more than others what must speak to purpose herbert once said a caught close by door of library almost pulled into room herbert charge to tell what be can tell nothing dear aunt nothing nothing a yet herbert tell be about sister for very many year past aunt letty have always called lady fitzgerald sister can tell nothing nothing to day then to morrow know must let mr prendergast manage matter a will have taken nothing on aunt letty nothing then tell what herbert will kill will kill a be killing father darling mother tell that be killing fast human nature can not bear for must endure anything if be trusted sitting down in one of high backed library chair burst into flood of tear sight a regarded aunt letty herbert have never seen before what if died thought herbert to in bitterness of moment there be that in store for of be worse than death what business have aunt letty to talk of misery of course be wretched a be how must appreciate burden be on back what be clara desmond to shortly after noon mr prendergast be back at house slunk up to room one saw anything of at half past six came down herbert constrained to sit at table while dinner be served so day passed away one more day only mr prendergast be to stay at castle richmond then if a expected certain letter must reach on morning be to start for london late on following day may well be imagined that be not desirous of prolonging visit early on following morning herbert started for long solitary walk on day mr prendergast be to tell everything to mother be determined between that son must not be in house during telling in evening when came home be to see so started on walk resolving other thing also in mind before went must reach desmond court before returned home that day let two lady there know fate be before then after might let know what be to be fate on head must not hurry so started on walk resolving to go round by gortnaclough on way to desmond court then to return home from place road must be more than twenty long irish mile felt that hard work must be of service be instinct rather than thought taught that must be good for to put strain on muscle of body thus relieve muscle of mind if limb must become thoroughly tired thoroughly tired so that might wish to rest then might hope that for moment might cease to think of sorrow encompassed so started on walk taking with thick cudgel own thought went away across demesne down into road led away by gortnaclough boherbue towards castleisland wild of county kerry a went men about place refrained from speaking to for knew that bad news have come to big house looked at with lowered eye with tenderness in heart for loved very name of fitzgerald love poor irishman feel for gentleman whom regard a master masther though have probably never received from in money wage for day work in intercourse have be man who have paid money not man who received love nevertheless feel if have be occasionally looked on with smiling face accosted with kindly word be astonishing to englishman will not say that feeling be altogether good love must come of love where personal love exists on one side not even personal regard on other there must be mixture of servility unbounded respect for human grandeur can not be altogether good for human greatness if greatness be properly sifted may be so got down into road went forth upon journey at rapid pace mud be deep upon way went through thickest without thought of have not be out long before there came on cold light drizzling rain such rain a gradually surely make way into innermost rag of man clothing running up inside of waterproof coat penetrating by perseverance very fold of necktie such cold drizzling rain be commonest phase of hard weather during irish winter who be out about get used to treat tenderly be euphemistical a to weather calling hazy soft never allowing to carry bad language on subject beyond word dull yet at time one breathes rain again exhales become a be water spirit assuming aqueous fishlike nature into one inner fibre must be acknowledged that man doe sometimes get wet in ireland then wetting there brings cold in head husky voice need for multitudinous pocket

sorrow seemed to to be so much heavier so passed on running gauntlet through a best might shaking off from a attempted to cling round step nothing be so powerful in making man selfish a misfortune then went on to gortnaclough have not chosen walk to place with fixed object except perhaps that enabled to return home round by desmond court be one of place at relief committee sat fortnight there be soup kitchen here however have not be so successful a one at berryhill be place of residence selected by father barney coadjutor in spite of when herbert found in wretched dirty straggling damp street of village did not know what to do where to betake that eye in gortnaclough must be upon be matter of course must hardly turn round on heel retrace step through village a must have to do in going to desmond court without showing pretext for coming there so walked into little shop be attached to soup kitchen there found rev mr columb creagh giving order to little girl behind counter herbert fitzgerald be customarily very civil to roman catholic priest around somewhat more so indeed than seemed good to very excellent lady mr townsend aunt letty always went against grain with to be civil to rev columb creagh on special day must have gone against grain with to be civil to anybody coadjutor knew character be delighted to have opportunity of talking to when must do so without being snubbed by mr somers chairman by own parish priest mr creagh have rejoiced much at idea of forming one at same council board with county magistrate protestant parson fruition of promised delight have never quite reached lip have be like sancho panza in government have sat down to grand table day after day have never yet be allowed to enjoy rich dish of own oratory whenever have proposed to help mr somers father barney have stopped mouth now probably might be able to say word two though glory must not be equal to of making speech at committee still must be something to be seen talking on equal term on affair of state to young heir of castle richmond mr fitzgerald well declare how be sir took off hat bowed got hold of herbert hand shaking ruthlessly altogether made very disagreeable herbert though mind be not really intent on subject asked question of girl a to amount of meal have be sold desired to see little passbook that kept at shop be doing pretty well mr fitzgerald said coadjutor pretty well always keep eye on for fear thing must go wrong know think will do said herbert hope not be always good to be on safe side know to tell truth think be altogether on right tack about shop be very hard on poor woman now fact be though relief committee at gortnaclough be attended by magistrate priest parson shop there be herbert fitzgerald own affair have be stocked with father money flour be sold without profit at risk rent of house wage of woman who kept came out of own pocket money under circumstance did not see cause why mr creagh must interfere at present moment be not well inclined to put up with such interference do best can mr creagh said interrupting priest good will be done at time a by unnecessary difficulty certainly not still do think mr creagh be girding up loin for eloquence when be again interrupted be rather in hurry to day said herbert therefore if please wo make change now never mind book to day sally good day mr creagh so saying left shop walked rapidly back out of village poor coadjutor be left alone at shop door anathematizing in heart pride of protestant have be told that mr fitzgerald be different from others that be man fond of priest addicted to ould religion so hearing have resolved to make most of such excellent disposition be forced to confess to that be alike mr somers must not have be more imperious mr townsend more insolent then through still drizzling rain herbert walked on to desmond court by time that reached desolate looking lodge at demesne gate be nearly wet through be besmeared with mud up to knee have thought nothing of a walked along mind have be intent on scene be before in what word be to break news to clara desmond mother with what word must receive tidings former question have by mean answered to own satisfaction when muddy wet passed up to house through desolate gate be lady desmond at home asked of butler ladyship be at home said gray haired old man with blandest smile so be lady clara have already learned to look on heir of castle richmond a coming saviour of impoverished desmond family chapter xxvi comfortless mr herbert yer honor be wet through through surely said butler a soon a fitzgerald be well inside hall herbert muttered something about being only damp that did not signify did signify very much in butler estimation whose being wet through must signify more for be not mr herbert to be baronet to have spending of twelve thousand year must not be future husband of lady clara not signify indeed ' shure mr herbert have walked to desmond court blessed morning tare age well there be knowing what young gentleman wo do will see get pair of trouser of lord ready for in two minute faix be nearly a big a now mr herbert herbert must hardly speak to gave assent whatever a to proposition for borrowing earl clothes will go in a be said old man looking into face saw that there be something wrong shure ai going to sthrike off now said irish caleb balderstone to also a well a others about desmond court have feared greatly that lady clara must throw away upon poor lover be now past noon fitzgerald pressed forward into room in lady clara usually sat be same in have received visit here of morning be usually to be found alone on occasion when opened door found that mother be with since day on clara have disposed of so excellently mother have spent more of time with daughter looking at clara now through herbert fitzgerald eye countess have began to confess to herself that child did posse beauty charm got up to greet future son in law with sweet smile that charming quiet welcome with woman so well know how to make house pleasant to man be welcome to clara not rising turning head round looking at greeted also came forward took hand be not till have held clara for minute in own that saw that be more than ordinarily serious hope sir thomas be not worse said lady desmond with voice of feigned interest be so common after if anything must happen to poor old weak gentleman might not be a well father have not be very well last two day said be so sorry said clara mother herbert herbert how wet be must have walked said countess herbert in few dull word said that have walked have thought that walk must be good for have not expected that must be so wet then lady desmond looking carefully into face saw that in truth be very serious so much so that knew that have come there on account of seriousness still sorrow did not in degree go to heart be grieving doubtless for father mother house at castle richmond be probably sad because sickness fear of death be there nay perhaps death now hanging over loved head what be to have have own sorrow enough of perhaps to account for being selfish so with solemn face with nothing amiss about heart again asked for tidings from castle richmond do tell said clara getting up be afraid sir thomas be very ill old baronet have be kind to did regard to be sorrow to think that there must be sorrow at castle richmond yes be ill said herbert have have gentleman from london with for last few day friend of father name be mr prendergast be doctor asked countess no not doctor said herbert be lawyer be very hard for to begin story perhaps more so in that be wet through covered with mud now felt cold clammy began to have idea that must not be seated there in room in such guise clara too have instinctively learned from face tone general bearing that something truly be matter at other time when have be there since day on have be accepted have be completely master of perhaps have almost be deemed fault in that have have none of timidity hesitation of lover have seemed to feel doubt that with fortune position at back need feel scruple in accepting a own fair hand for have asked now nothing must be more different from than manner be now lady desmond be now surprised though probably not a yet frightened why must lawyer have come from london to visit sir thomas at period of such illness why must herbert have walked over to desmond court to tell of illness there must be something in lawyer coming be intended to bear in way on daughter marriage herbert said be quite wet will not put on of patrick thing thank said will not stay long will soon have said what have got to say do herbert said clara can not bear to see so uncomfortable then will not be in such hurry to go back ill a father be said can not stay long have thought duty to come over tell tell have happened at castle richmond now countess be frightened there be that in herbert tone of voice form of countenance be enough to frighten woman what have happened at castle richmond what must have happened there to make necessary presence of lawyer at same time thus to sadden future son in law clara also be frightened though knew not why manner be so different from be usual be so cold serious awe struck that must not be unhappy what be said countess herbert then sat for few minute silent thinking how best must tell story have be morning resolving to tell have in nowise a yet fixed upon method be so terribly tragic so frightful in extent of reality that hardly knew how must be possible for to get through task hope that misfortune have come upon of family said lady desmond now beginning to think that there might be misfortune must affect own daughter more nearly than illness of baronet of wife oh hope not said clara getting up clasping hand what be herbert why speak coming round to took hold of arm dearest clara said looking at with more tenderness than have ever be usual with think that have better leave must tell better to mother alone do clara love go dearest will call by by clara moved away very slowly towards door then turned round if be anything make unhappy herbert said must know before leave yes yes mother will be told certainly yes yes will be told said countess now go darling thus dismissed clara did go betook to own chamber have owen have sorrow to tell must have told to herself of be quite sure now herbert for heaven sake what be said countess pale with terror be fully certain now that something be to be spoken must be calculated to interfere with daughter prospect know story herbert have to tell need not therefore again be present at telling of sitting there wet through in lady desmond drawing room did contrive to utter whole of from beginning to end making clearly to be understood that be no longer fitzgerald of castle richmond nameless pennyless outcast without hope of portion position doomed from henceforth to earn bread in sweat of brow if only must be fortunate enough to find mean of earning did lady desmond once interrupt in story sat perfectly still listening to almost with unmoved face be too wise to let know what instant working of mind might be before have made own fixed resolve have conceived truth much before have completed telling of generally use three time number of word be necessary for purpose have in hand have used six time number must not have interrupted be good in to give time to determine in what tone with what word must speak when speaking on part must become absolutely necessary now concluded by saying at time be standing up on rug know lady desmond will perhaps be best that clara must learn from have said not word of giving up pretension to lady clara hand then have in way hinted that match must in opinion be regarded a unbroken have not spoken of sorrow at bringing down poverty on wife surely must have so spoken have thought engagement be still valid then have not pointed out that engagement must necessarily be broken a in lady desmond opinion certainly must have done yes said in cold low meaningless voice in voice told nothing by tone lady clara have better hear from in title gave daughter herbert instantly read doom however remained silent be for countess now to speak be possible may not be true said speaking almost in whisper looking not into face by at fire be possible so barely possible that did not think right to keep matter from longer must have be very wrong very wicked may say said countess be only two day since knew anything of said vindicating be of course bound to let know immediately said harshly have let know immediately lady desmond then be again silent for while mr prendergast think there be doubt asked none said herbert very decidedly have told cousin owen did so yesterday by time poor mother know also then there be period of silence during whole time lady desmond have uttered no one word of condolence not syllable of commiseration for suffering have come upon herbert family be beginning to hate for harshness tenor of countenance have become hard received word a judge might have taken merely wanting evidence before pronounced verdict evidence be beginning to think sufficient there must be no doubt a to verdict after what have heard match between herbert fitzgerald daughter must be out of question be very dreadful said thinking only of own child absolutely shivering at danger have be incurred be very dreadful said herbert shivering also be almost incredible to that great sorrow must be received in such way by one who have professed to be so dear friend to what do propose to do mr fitzgerald said countess what do propose said repeating word hitherto have have time heart to propose anything such misfortune a have told doe not break upon man without disturbing for while power of resolving have thought so much of mother of clara since mr prendergast told that then slight gurgling struggle fell upon throat hindered from speaking did not quite sob out determined that must not do so if must be so harsh strong must be harsh strong also again lady desmond sat silent still thinking how have better speak act after be not so cruel so bad a herbert fitzgerald thought what have fitzgerald done for that must sorrow for sorrow have lived there in old ugly barrack long desolate full of dreary wretchedness poverty lady fitzgerald in prosperity have never come to to soften hardness of life have come over to ireland countess countess have be proud enough at first in little glory too proud doubt proud enough afterwards in loneliness poverty there have lived alone whether fault have be own owed little to kindness of one for one have done aught to relieve bitterness then weak puny child have grown up in same shade be now lovely woman gifted with high birth that special priceless beauty high blood so often give there be prize now within wall of old barrack something to be won something for man must strive mother smile that son might win now lady fitzgerald have come to have never complained of said to herself bargain between clara desmond herbert fitzgerald have be good for of let be made settled a bargain young herbert fitzgerald have money position daughter have beauty high blood let be bargain in there be nothing to make love that rich prosperous family at castle richmond there be whose nature be to love new found friend at few hour warning countess of desmond be not one of bargain have be made daughter must have be able to perform part of be still able to give have stipulated to give herbert fitzgerald be now bankrupt must give nothing must not have be madness to suppose that bargain must still hold good one person one only have come to at desmond court whose coming have be solace to weariness of among whom have lived in cold desolateness for so many year one only have got near heart there have be one irish voice that have cared to hear owner of voice have loved child instead of loving have borne that wretchedness too if not well at least bravely true have separated that lover from daughter circumstance of have made right for a mother to do so what mother circumstanced a have be must have given girl to owen fitzgerald so have banished from house only voice sounded sweetly in ear again have be alone then perhaps thought have come to when herbert fitzgerald be frequent about place rich thriving wooer owen might come again to desmond court when clara have gone to castle richmond year be stealing over ah yes knew that full well youth pride of day have given up for countess ship now wore so gloomily given up for piece of gold have turned to stone slate dirt within grasp year ala be fast stealing over nevertheless have something to give woman beauty be not faded have heart be a yet virgin have hitherto loved other man might not that suffice to cover few year seeing that in return wanted nothing love so have thought lingering over hope while herbert be there at wooing may be imagined with what feeling at heart have seen listened to frantic attempt made by owen to get back childish love that too have borne bravely if not well have not angered that child be loved by only man have ever loved have stroked daughter hair that day kissed cheek bade be happy with better richer lover have not be right in have be angry even with owen must forgive because loved might there not even yet be chance for when clara must in very truth have gone to castle richmond now how be to think about now thinking of thing how be possible that must have heart left to feel for misery of lady fitzgerald with misery must not lady fitzgerald still be more fortunate than let come what might lady fitzgerald have have life of prosperity love must not think of lady fitzgerald of herbert must only think of owen fitzgerald of daughter of owen be now heir to castle richmond must a far a must learn soon become actual possessor who have be cast forth from desmond court a too poor contemptible in world eye to be daughter suitor must become rich inheritor of broad acre old coveted family honour owen still loved daughter loved not a herbert did with quiet gentleman like day attachment with old true passionate love of have read in book dreamed before have sold to be countess owen did so love daughter be very sure then a to daughter that did not still love new heir in heart of heart of that mother be by mean sure that child have chosen better part in choosing money title have not doubted that having so chosen clara must be happy of also did not doubt clara be young must say heart in few month must follow hand now how be to decide sitting there with herbert fitzgerald before gloomy a death cold shivering muddy telling of own disaster with more courage than whipped dog a looked at declared to herself twenty time in second that have not about tithe of manhood of cousin owen woman love bold front voice will never own master to have be beaten in world fight have owen came there with story must have claimed right boldly to lady hand in spite of that world have done to let have said lady desmond to herself struggle within bosom be made over wonder that herbert looking into face for pity must find that be harsh cruel have be sacrificing have completed sacrifice owen fitzgerald heir to castle richmond sir owen a must soon be must have daughter two at rate must be happy must live there at desmond court lonely a have ever lived while be passing through mind hardly thought of herbert sorrow that must be given up abandoned left to make what best fight must by a to how be possible that a mother must have doubt yet be pity thousand pity fitzgerald with domestic virtue industry thorough respectability must so exactly have suited clara taste mode of life have only continued to be heir of castle richmond must not enter upon world together with nearly same fair chance of happiness who must prophecy to what owen might be led with passionate impulse strong will unbridled temper love of pleasure that be noble hearted affectionate brave tender in inmost spirit lady desmond be very sure be quality must make daughter happy when clara must come to know future lord a clara mother knew must clara love worship a mother did mother believed that clara have not in bosom heart enough for love then a have said before mother did not know daughter say that will break to clara said herbert having during silence turned over of thought also in mind if so may a well leave now can imagine be anxious to get back to mother yes will be better must tell be very sad very sad very sad indeed yes be hard load for man to bear answered speaking very very slowly for think can bear if if what asked countess if clara can bear now be necessary that lady desmond must speak out did not mean to be unnecessarily harsh did mean to be decided a spoke face became stern ill favoured that clara will be terribly distressed said terribly terribly distressed repeating word with great emphasis of be quite sure be very young will hope in time get over then too think be one whose feeling young a be have never conquered judgment therefore do believe that with god mercy will be able to bear mr fitzgerald well of course feel with be sure that with excellent judgment be thing of course that everything must be over between lady clara then came to full stop a though have be said must be considered necessary herbert did not answer at once stood there shivering shaking in misery be overcome by chill of wet garment though struggled to throw off dead feeling of utter cold struck to heart be quite unable to master must hardly forgive that on occasion must have be so conquered by own outer feeling now must not help be weak with hunger too though did not know for have hardly eaten food day be nearly exhausted with unaccustomed amount of hard exercise have taken be moreover thoroughly wet through heavy laden with mud of road be wonder that lady desmond have said to herself that looked like whipped dog must be a lady clara will decide said at last barely uttering word through chattering teeth must be a say said countess firmly whether by decision by yours if necessary by mine if feeling be a take to be of man of honour will not leave to to what now that have world to struggle with must seek to drag down into struggle union be to be for better worse must have given better yes have there be union must have bravely borne part in sharing worst who ought to be so thankful a that truth have broken upon before have clogged with wife of high birth without fortune alone man educated a be with talent may face world without fearing anything how must make way now if daughter be wife when think of mr fitzgerald will cease to wish for never have given heart to daughter can not take back gift have accepted can not return what must have do lady desmond asked with anger almost passion in voice wait a must wait said herbert will be duty a believe will also be wish yes wear out young heart here in solitude for next ten year then learn when beauty youth be gone mr fitzgerald will not allow to contemplate prospect either for for under lamentable circumstance have now told be imperative that match must be broken off ask own mother hear what will say if be man will not throw upon poor child hard task of declaring that must be so by calamity be unable to perform contract with be for to announce that contract be therefore over herbert in present state be unable to argue with lady desmond have in brain mind heart soul at least so said to afterwards having perhaps loose idea of different function of four different property thorough conviction that a clara have sworn to other that for life must live together love other misfortune to of must justify other in breaking that oath must even justify in breaking though be one on whom misfortune have fallen doubt have first loved clara for beauty must have ceased to love have cast from if by god will beauty have perished gone from must not have held closer to heart told with strong comforting vow that love have now gone deeper than that be already of same bone of same flesh of same family hearthstone knew in knew that must have be proud so to do so to feel that must have cast from with utter indignation who must have counselled to do to feel differently why must clara heart be different from say be strong conviction nevertheless heart might be different might look on engagement of theirs with altogether other thought other idea if so voice must never reproach not voice however heart might do so such might be case with did not think therefore must not pronounce that decision clara mother expected from when have told of suppose may be allowed to see said avoiding direct proposition lady desmond have made to allowed to see said lady desmond now also in turn speaking very slowly can not answer question a yet not quite immediately must say if will leave matter in hand will write to if not to morrow then next day must sooner that must write can not promise know how far good sense strength may support under affliction that will suffer terribly on account a well a on own may be quite sure then again there be pause of moment at rate will write to then said will tell expect to see will in matter will be will if think that misery will be greater in being engaged to poor man than than in relinquishing love will hear word from to overpersuade lady desmond will say nothing that will authorize to think that be given up by have in way learned from what own feeling be now will say good bye to good bye said countess thinking that might be a well that interview must be ended mr fitzgerald be very wet fear that be very cold have better take something before go countess a be have carriage in must send home horse even on must ride nothing thank lady desmond said so without offering courtesy of hand walked out of room be very angry with a tried to make blood run quicker in vein by hurrying down avenue into road at quickest pace so angry with for while in indignation almost forgot father mother own family tragedy that must have wished to save daughter from such marriage might have be natural that must have treated so coldly so harshly without one spark of love pity who to have be so loyal during courtship of daughter be almost incredible to be not story one must have melted heart of stranger at men must weep have seen tear in eye of dry time worn world used london lawyer a full depth of calamity have forced upon heart yes mr prendergast have not be able to repress tear when told tale lady desmond have shed no tear when tale have be told to soft woman message have be sent to afflicted mother on whom have pleased god to allow so heavy hand to fall word of tenderness have be uttered for sinking father there have be no feeling for household be to have be so nearly linked with own looking round with greedy eye for wealth for daughter lady desmond have found match suited now that match no longer suited greed must throw from without struggle to feeling suitor be now poor family of suitor be now neither grand powerful then too felt angry with clara though knew that a yet at rate have cause in spite of what have said felt must imagine to that also must be cold untrue let go said to love be worth nothing nothing if doe not believe to be of more worth than everything beside if doe not love now in misery if must not choose now for husband love have never be worthy name love have faith in doe not value above worldly thing be nothing if be not

must be untrue such have be burden of doubting midnight thought will not be given up continued quoting letter of course not tell what herbert must not dare to talk of giving up money title may be tossed to fro not heart how beautifully speaks of dear mamma now tear began to run down young lady cheek oh do wish must be with darling darling darling clara unhappy yes be sure lady desmond will give peace never mind will be true through said so from first then fell to cry embracing brother declaring that nothing now must make altogether unhappy emmeline must not think that will take at word be very generous of nonsense herbert then there be torrent of eloquence in answering herbert found that argument be of very little efficacy now must go back to desmond court see under what overwhelming difficulty poor clara wrote affectionate letter in first place must be pointed out how very wrong herbert have be in going to desmond court on foot through mud rain man can hardly bear nobly unless outer aspect be in degree noble may be very sad having to admit that tailor doe in great part make man such fear be undoubtedly fact must chancellor look dignified on woolsack if have have accident with wig allowed robe to be torn soiled doe not piety of bishop reside in lawn sleeve meekness in anti virile apron have herbert understood world must have have out best pair of horse standing in castle richmond stable when going to desmond court on errand must have brushed hair anointed must have clothed in rich spanish cloak must have seen that hat be brushed boot spotless then with due solemnity with head erect must have told tale out boldly countess must still have wished to be rid of hearing that be pauper must have lacked courage to turn from house a have done seeing how wobegone be wretched how mean to look at low in outward presence have be able to assume mastery have kept throughout interview having done opinion of prowess naturally became low felt that must have be unable to press cause against for time after have departed sat alone in room in have received expected minute clara must come down to still wishing however that might be left for while alone clara did not come be able to pursue thought how very terrible be tragedy have fallen out in close neighbourhood be first thought came to now that herbert have left how terrible overwhelming fatal what calamity must fall upon woman so calamitous a have now overtaken that poor lady at castle richmond must live support such burden must bear eye of people when knew light in must be now regarded to lose at one blow name pride of place woman rank high respect must be possible that must still live on be thus that lady desmond thought have one told that degraded mother must very day come down from room sit watchful by sleeping son in order that might comfort encourage when awoke must not have found in heart to believe marvel then lady desmond knew one solace in sorrow have one comfort in sad reflection be countess of desmond be to lady fitzgerald have be vouchsafed other solace other comfort then on one point countess made fixed a fate by thinking re thinking upon till doubt remained upon mind match between clara herbert must be broken off let cost be what might point on there be more room for doubt more pain in coming to conclusion that other match with more fortunate cousin must be encouraged carried out for herself if hope be small while owen be needy of poor account what hope must there be now that must be rich great moreover owen loved clara not clara hand must once more be vacant ready for winning for only chance have be in clara coming marriage in knew that there must be difficulty be sure enough that clara must at first feel imprudent generosity of youth offer to join poverty to herbert poverty be matter of course lady desmond must have done at clara age so at least to herself said also to daughter little time little patience little care must set in proper light herbert must go away must gradually be forgotten owen must again come forth from beneath cloud with renewed splendour then be not probable that in very heart of heart owen be man whom clara have ever loved thus having realized to herself fact herbert have told prepared to make known to daughter got up from chair intending at first to seek then changing purpose rang bell sent for be astonished to find how violently be affected not so much by circumstance a by duty have fallen to of telling to child put one hand upon other felt that be in tremor be conscious that blood be running quick round heart clara came down going to customary seat waited till mother must speak to mr fitzgerald have brought very dreadful news lady desmond said after minute pause oh mamma said clara have expected bad tidings having thought of manner of misery while have be up stair alone there be that in mother voice seemed to be worse than worst of anticipation dreadful indeed child be duty to tell to must caution before do so to place guard upon feeling that have to say must necessarily alter future prospect unfortunately make marrying herbert fitzgerald quite impossible mamma exclaimed with loud voice jumping from chair not marry why what can have done be wish to break off lady desmond have calculated that must best effect object by at once impressing daughter with idea under circumstance be about to be narrated marriage must not only be imprudent altogether impracticable out of question clara must be made to understand at once that circumstance gave option that affair be of such nature a to make thing manifest to everybody that must not now marry herbert fitzgerald must not be left to think whether must whether must not exercise own generosity therefore not without discretion countess announced at once to conclusion at must be necessary to arrive clara be not girl to adopt conclusion on other judgment than own to be led in such matter by feeling of other person sit down dear will explain dearest clara grieved a must be to grieve be bound to tell again that must be a say for sake must be so especially perhaps for when have told story will understand that must be so tell then mother said for lady desmond have again paused wo sit down dearest well yes doe not matter clara at mother bidding sat down then story be told to be difficult tale for mother to tell to so young child to child whom have regarded a being so very young there be various little point of law thought that be obliged to explain how be necessary that castle richmond property must go to heir at law how be impossible that herbert must be that heir at law seeing that have not be born in lawful wedlock thing lady desmond attempted to explain be about to attempt such explanation desisted on finding that daughter understood a well a did then have to make also intelligible to clara that owen must be called on when sir thomas must die to fill position enjoy wealth accruing to heir of castle richmond when owen fitzgerald name be mentioned slight blush came upon clara cheek be very slight nevertheless mother saw took advantage of to say word in owen favour poor owen said will not be first to triumph in change of fortune be sure will not said clara be much too generous for then countess began to hope that task might not be so very difficult ignorant woman have be able to read one page in daughter heart must have known that task be impossible after that story be told out to end without further interruption then clara hiding face within hand on head of sofa uttered one long piteous moan be very dreadful said countess oh lady fitzgerald dear lady fitzgerald sobbed forth clara yes indeed poor lady fitzgerald fate be so dreadful that know not how to think of mamma a spoke clara pushed back from forehead hair with hand showing a did so form of forehead firmness of purpose be written there legible to eye must read mamma be wrong about not marrying herbert fitzgerald why must not marry not now a perhaps might have done for at future time when may think able to support wife mamma will not break engagement certainly not be said in tone of voice so very decided that lady desmond have to acknowledge to herself that there must be difficulty in task still did not doubt that must have way if not by concession on part of daughter then by concession on part of herbert fitzgerald can understand generosity of feeling dear said at age must probably have felt same therefore ask to take step towards breaking engagement offer must come from mr fitzgerald have doubt that will come a man of honour will know that can not now offer to marry will also know a man of sense that must be ruin for to think of of such marriage under present circumstance why mamma why must be ruin to why dear do think that wife with titled name can be of advantage to young man who have not only got bread to earn even to look out for way in may earn if there be nothing to hurt titled name difficulty will be easily conquered dearest clara know what mean must be aware that girl of rank brought up a have be can not be fitting wife for man who will now have to struggle with world at turn clara a be said to a prepared to answer blushed deeply for felt obliged to speak on matter have never yet be subject of speech between mother mamma said can not agree with there may have what world call rank nevertheless have be poor have not be brought up with costly habit why must not live with husband a a a poorly a have lived with mother be not rich dear mamma why must be lady desmond did not answer daughter at once be not silent because answer failed answer must have be ready enough have dared to speak out yes be true have be poor mother did by imprudence bring down upon head on yours absolute unrelenting pitiless poverty because did so have never known one happy hour have spent day in bitter remorse in regretting want of thing have be more terrible to want a be customary attribute of people of rank have be driven to hate around who have be rich because have be poor have be utterly friendless because have be poor have be able to do none of sweet soft lovely thing by doing other woman win smile of world because have be poor poverty rank together have made wretched have left without employment without society without love now must tell that because have be poor must choose to be poor also must have be thus that must have answered have be accustomed to speak out thought have ever be accustomed to conceal be thinking quite a much of a of at last said engagement to must be fraught with much misery to must be ruinous think be not necessary clara that must do anything will wait of course see what herbert may say herbert wait moment love will be very much surprised if find that mr fitzgerald will tell that match must be abandoned will make difference mamma difference dear can not marry against will mean to say that must wish to bind to engagement if thought must be to disadvantage yes will bind to clara will make know that be not for disadvantage will make understand that friend companion who love a love a one else will ever love now for love because be so high fortuned when came to because be now so low fortuned that wife a will be can not be burden to will cling to whether throw off word from might have broken engagement before thousand word can not do now lady desmond stared at daughter for clara in excitement be walking up down room countess have certainly not expected be beginning to think that subject for present might a well be left alone clara have not done a yet mamma said will not do anything without telling can not leave herbert in misery to think have sympathy with will write to not before writes to clara must not wish to be indelicate know little about delicacy what people call delicacy will not be ungenerous unkind mamma brought two together be not so did not do so fearing that might might still care for herbert cousin did half wishing to obey half attracted by goodness did learn to love herbert fitzgerald did learn to forget learned to cease to love cousin did rejoiced at now what did must remain done dearest clara will not be for good will be for good mamma must not desert now for that world must give for mother brother must do without leave must not have given right to regard a own now can not take that right back again even at wish must write to at once mamma tell clara at rate must not do that at least must forbid mother can not forbid now daughter said after walking twice length of room in silence if be not allowed to send letter will leave house go to be very dreadful lady desmond be astounded at manner in daughter carried voice with spoke form of face be altered very step with trod be unlike usual gait what must lady desmond do be not prepared to confine daughter a prisoner must publicly forbid people about place to go upon message did not expect that must have be so undutiful said hope be not so clara answered now first duty be to did not sanction loving other people can not call back heart pledge will at rate wait till to morrow clara be dark now said clara despondingly looking out through window upon falling night suppose can not send to night will show what write dearest mamma if wrote for eye must not be same a if wrote only for very gloomy sombre silent be countess of desmond night nothing further be said about fitzgerald between daughter before went to bed then lady desmond did speak few futile word clara said have better think over what have be saying in bed to night will be more collected to morrow morning will think of of course said clara thinking can make difference then just touching mother forehead with lip went off slowly to room what sort of letter wrote when got there have already seen have seen also that took effective step to have letter carried to castle richmond at hour sufficiently early in morning there be danger that countess must stop message for letter have be read twenty time by emmeline mary have be carried by herbert to mother room before lady desmond have left bed set heart on too warmly said herbert mother to be not excellent said herbert be because speaks of in way must not wish to bring into misery because of excellence mother be still man said be too much for suffering woman one fault of whose life have brought son to pas throwing arm round neck wept upon shoulder there be other messenger went came day between desmond court castle richmond clara mother saw nothing of other early in morning did not breakfast together be there word said between on subject of fitzgerald lady desmond early in morning early for be sent note also to castle richmond be addressed to aunt letty miss letitia fitzgerald went to say that lady desmond be very anxious to see miss letty under present circumstance of family a described to lady desmond by mr herbert fitzgerald felt that must not ask to see mother be thus that overcame difficulty presented to a to proper title now to be given to lady fitzgerald perhaps miss letty must be good enough to see if called at such such hour aunt letty much perplexed have nothing for to say that must see countess must now be looked on a closely connected with family at rate until match be broken off therefore aunt letty have alternative so precisely at hour named countess aunt letty be seated together in little breakfast room of mention have before be made two woman be ever closeted together who be more unlike other except that have one common strong love for family rank in aunt letty must be acknowledged that passion be not unwholesome malevolent in course of action delighted in being fitzgerald in knowing that branch of fitzgerald have be considerable people ever since norman ancestor have come over to ireland with strongbow then have useful idea considerable people must do considerable deal of good family pride operated more inwardly than outwardly inwardly a regarded own family not outwardly a regarded world brother nephew sister in law niece be thought among highest commoner in ireland be gentlefolk of first water walked openly before world accordingly proving claim to gentle blood by gentle deed honest conduct perhaps did think too much of fitzgerald of castle richmond sin be one of recording angel must have made much in entry that be stupid old woman prejudiced in highest degree horribly ignorant of world beyond own very narrow circle even of think that recording angel must under circumstance have made great deal now how be family pride affected by horrible catastrophe have be made known to herbert heir whom a heir have almost idolized be nobody sister in law whom have learned to love with whole of big heart be sister in law brother be one who in lieu of adding glory to family must always be regarded a most unfortunate of fitzgerald baronet with human nature be stronger than family pride loved not better more tenderly than ever two lady be closeted together for about two hour then when door be opened aunt letty might have be seen with bonnet much on one side poor old eye cheek red with weeping countess too held handkerchief to eye a got back into pony carriage saw one else there aunt letty from mood when returned to desmond court might be surmised that from aunt letty have learned little to comfort will be beggar said to herself beggar when door of own room have closed upon there be few people in world who held such beggary in le esteem than did countess of desmond may almost be said that hated on account of own poverty chapter xxix ill news fly fast dull cold wretched week passed over head at castle richmond during did nothing realize truth of position then came letter from mr prendergast addressed to herbert in stated that such inquiry a have hitherto made left doubt on mind that man named mollett who have lately made repeated visit at castle richmond be who have formerly taken house in dorsetshire under name of talbot in packet mr prendergast sent copy of document of verbal evidence have managed to obtain with actual detail of be not necessary must trouble who be following in story in letter mr prendergast also recommended that intercourse must be have with owen fitzgerald be expedient said that party concerned must recognise owen position a heir presumptive to title estate a said have found mr fitzgerald of hap house to be forbearing generous high spirited thought that intercourse might be conducted without enmity ill blood then suggested that mr somers must see owen fitzgerald herbert explained to father gently without complaint seemed now a though sir thomas have ceased to interest in matter such battle a have be in power to make have made to save son heritage wife name happiness even at expense of own conscience that battle have gone altogether against now there be nothing left for to turn face to wall die absolute ruin through fault have come upon belonged to ruin must now be known to world at large be beyond power to face world again in that glory be gone from house of son of son mother glory be gone from own house made attempt to leave bed though strongly recommended so to do by own family doctor then physician came down from dublin who must only feel whatever might say how impossible be to administer to mind diseased mind of poor man be diseased past curing in world there be nothing left for to die herbert of course answered clara letter did not go over to see during week indeed for little time afterwards answered at considerable length professing ready willingness to give back to clara troth even recommending with very strong logic unanswerable argument of worldly sense to regard union a unwise even impossible nevertheless there protruded through sense rhetoric evidence of love of desire for love returned be much more unanswerable than argument much stronger than logic clara read letter not a must have advised to read certainly in manner best pleased heart answered again declaring that that said be avail might be false to if must if through fickleness of heart purpose chose to abandon must never complain never at least aloud must not be false to be inclination such a to make likely that must be fickle even though affection might be tried by delay of year love with have be too serious to be thrown aside be rather strong language on part of young lady be thought by other young lady at castle richmond to show very essence of becoming young ladyhood pronounced clara to be perfect in feeling in judgment herbert must not find in heart to contradict of doings writing resolve clara dutifully told mother poor lady desmond be at wit end in matter must scold daughter have other power of doing anything clara have so taken bit between teeth that be no longer possible to check with usual rein in day young lady be seldom deprived by force of paper pen ink absolute incarceration of such offender must be still more unusual countess must have taken daughter away to london series of ball to south of italy to family castle in north of scotland poor lady desmond have not power of other countess now that be put to trial found that have power even over own daughter mamma be own doing clara must say countess must feel that alluded not only to daughter engagement with disinherited also to non engagement with heir under circumstance lady desmond sent for son earl be still at eton be now grown to be almost man man a forward eton boy be at sixteen tall lathy handsome with soft incipient whisker bold brow blushing cheek with boy love for frolic still strong within touch of man pride to check in difficulty lady desmond sent for young earl who have now not be home since previous midsummer hoping that young manhood might have effect in saving sister from disgrace of marriage must make so totally bankrupt in wealth rank mr somers did go once to hap house at herbert instigation very little came of visit have always disliked owen regarding a unthrift close connexion with whom must only bring contamination on fitzgerald property owen have returned feeling tenfold pride have be wounded by what have considered to be agent insolence have stigmatised mr somers to friend a self seeking mercenary prig very little therefore came of visit mr somers to give due have attempted to do best being anxious for herbert sake to conciliate owen perhaps having why not eye to future agency owen be hard cold uncommunicative very unlike what have before be to mr prendergast then mr prendergast have never offended pride may tell cousin herbert said with little special emphasis on word cousin that will be glad to see a soon a feel able to meet will be for good of that must have conversation together will tell mr somers will be happy to go to to see here perhaps going to castle richmond during present illness of sir thomas may be inconvenient be that mr somers must get from in very short time whole story became known to everybody round neighbourhood what must have be good of keeping secret there be secret kept a secret because can not well be discussed openly may be allowed to leak out with so much advantage day must come apparently at distant time when world must know fate of fitzgerald family when sir owen must walk into hall of castle richmond undoubted owner of mansion demesne why then keep secret herbert openly declared wish to mr somers that there must be secret in matter there be disgrace said thinking of mother nothing to be ashamed of let world say what will

will see else so matter be discussed in servant hall at great house perhaps greatest surprise greatest curiosity greatest consternation be felt at parsonage rumour reached mr townsend at one of relief committee mr townsend from mouth of one of servant during absence on same day when mr townsend returned to parsonage met other with blank face oh aeneas said before must get greatcoat from off shoulder have heard news what news about castle richmond yes about castle richmond then knew that have heard glimmering of lady fitzgerald early history have be known to of a have be known almost to in country in late year history have be so much forgotten that men have ceased to talk of calamity therefore came with weight of new misfortune aeneas who told of asked a sat together over fire in dingy dirty parlour well strange to say heard first from father barney oh mercy be about country in way herbert know have not be at one of committee for last ten day mr somers for last week past have be a silent a death so much so that horrid creature father columb must have made regular set speech other day at gortnaclough if have put down dear dear dear said mr townsend be talking to father barney about to day about mr somers be yes yes yes then said ' suppose know what have happened at castle richmond how on earth have learned asked mr townsend jealous that roman catholic priest must have heard such completely protestant news before protestant parson wife oh learn everything from servant suppose of course mean creature said mr townsend forgetting probably own little conversation with own man of work that morning go on aeneas have happened ' said castle richmond 'oh have heard ' said be obliged to own have not though saw that gave kind of triumph 'why said havery bad news have reached indeed worst of news then told about lady fitzgerald to give due must say that be very sorry very sorry 'the poor young fellow said 'the poor young fellow saw that turned away face to hide tear crocodile tear said mr townsend be not said reverend lord father barney be not so bad a once thought hope be not going over too aeneas consort almost cried a such horrid thought entered head in idea feeling short of absolute enmity to servant of church of rome be abandonment of portion of protestant basis of church of england small end of wedge must call when people around must suggest that heart of roman catholic priest might possibly not be altogether black devilish well hope not dear said mr townsend with slight touch of sarcasm in voice a be saying father barney told then that mr prendergast oh have known of being there from day of coming mr prendergast seems knew whole affair from beginning to end how did know aeneas that ca tell be friend of sir thomas before marriage know have told that be of use attempting to keep secret be over at hap house with owen fitzgerald before went have owen fitzgerald be told yes have be told told that be to be next heir so father barney say mr townsend wished in heart that news must have reached through purer source coming though did from father barney tallied too completely with what have heard to leave on mind doubt of truth then began to think of lady fitzgerald condition of herbert of of condition of till by degree mind passed away from father barney iniquity be very dreadful said in low voice very dreadful very dreadful hardly know how to think of fear that sir thomas will not live many month to give even benefit of life interest when dy will be gone everything then tear stood in eye also in also after while be very easy for clergyman in pulpit to preach eloquently upon vileness of worldly wealth futility of worldly station where will ever find one who when time of proof will come will give proof that feel what preaches mr townsend be customarily loud eager upon subject yet be now shedding tear because young friend herbert be deprived of inheritance chapter xxx pallida mors mr somers returning from hap house gave be message to herbert fitzgerald at same time told that did not think good must come of such meeting went over there said because must not willingly omit anything that mr prendergast have suggested did not expect good to come of know what have always thought of owen fitzgerald mr prendergast said that behaved so well did not know prendergast be cowed for moment by what have heard that be natural enough do a like however only have over to castle richmond owen however did not trust solely to mr somers on following day wrote to herbert suggesting that have better meet begging that place time of meeting might be named again suggested hap house declared that must be at home on day at hour that cousin might name only a added sooner better herbert wrote back by same messenger saying that must be with early on following morning on following morning drove up to door of hap house while owen be still sitting with coffee pot knife fork before captain donnellan whom saw there on occasion of first morning visit be now gone owen fitzgerald be alone in home captain have be accustomed guest spending perhaps time there during hunting season since mr prendergast have be at hap house have be made to understand that master must fain be alone since day owen have never hunted be noticed in old haunt have be seen talking to old friend have remained at home sitting over fire thinking wandering up down own avenue standing about stable idly almost unconscious of grooming of horse once once only have be mounted then a dusk of evening be coming on have trotted over quickly to desmond court a though have in hand purport of great moment if so changed mind when came to gate for walked on slowly for three four hundred yard beyond then turning horse head slowly made way back past gate then trotted quickly home to hap house in moment of life must make mar for life 't be so that felt how must make how avoid marring be question now strove to answer when herbert entered room rose from chair walked quickly up to visitor with extended hand look of welcome in face manner be very different from that with have turned parted from cousin not many day since in demesne at castle richmond then have intended absolutely to defy herbert fitzgerald there be spirit of defiance now either in hand face in tone of voice be very glad have come said hope understood must have gone to only that thought might be better for of to be here herbert said something to effect that have be quite willing to come over to hap house be not at moment so self possessed a other hardly knew how to begin subject be to be discussed between of course know that mr prendergast be here said owen oh yes said herbert mr somers also tell fairly herbert that when mr somers came be not willing to say much to have to be said must be said between not to third party must not open heart yet speak thought to mr somers in answer to herbert again said that owen need have scruple in speaking to be plain sailing too plain fear said there be doubt whatever now a to truth of what mr prendergast have told then having said so much herbert waited for owen to speak herbert have little nothing to say castle richmond with title acre be not to be be to be property of man with whom be now sitting when be actually positively understood between there be nothing further to be said nothing a far a herbert knew that other sorrow of that other deeper sorrow affected mother name station a to that did not find called on to speak to owen fitzgerald be necessary that must say anything a to great consolation consolation have reached from clara desmond be true herbert asked owen at last that uncle be so very ill in time of kindly intercourse owen have always called sir thomas uncle though latterly have ceased to do so be very ill very ill indeed said herbert be subject in owen have certainly right to feel interested seeing that own investiture must follow immediately on death of sir thomas herbert almost felt that question might a well have be spared have be asked however almost solely with view of gaining few moment herbert said at last standing up from chair a made effort to begin speech know how far will believe when tell that news have caused great sorrow grieve for father mother for from very bottom of heart be very kind of said herbert blow have fallen a for believe that can bear care so very much about property do now owen spoke rather louder with own look of strong impulse about mouth forehead do care so much about property be welcome to be so still have never coveted from covet will be yours now without coveting replied herbert then there be pause during herbert sat still while owen stood leaning with back against mantelpiece herbert said after have thus remained silent for two three minute have made up mind on matter will tell truly what do desire what desire inheritance do desire that clara desmond will be wife owen said other also getting up did not expect when came here that must have spoken to about be that might speak about asked to come here listen to when say that want clara desmond to be wife mean to say that want that only may be true that be will be legally heir to father estate herbert will relinquish that because feel to be own will relinquish in way may separate from most thoroughly in return do separate from who be own before have ever known thus did make proposition a to have be making up mind since morning on mr prendergast have come to herbert for while be struck dumb with amazement not so much at quixotic generosity of proposal a at singular mind of man in thinking that plan must be carried out herbert best quality be doubt sturdy common sense be shocked by suggestion presumed that legality ordinary bond of life must be upset by such agreement between two young men knew that owen fitzgerald must not give away title to estate of fourteen thousand year in off hand way that one must accept gift be possible to be given estate title must belong to owen must not possibly belong to one else merely at word fancy then again how must love of girl like clara desmond be bandied to fro at will of suitor suitor that have once accepted owen love herbert knew since in soberer mood with maturer judgment have accepted how must give up to how must that other take possession of if so abandoned bargain be one quite impossible to be carried out yet owen in proposing have fully intended to be a good a word be impossible said herbert in low voice why impossible may not do what like with be own be not impossible will have nothing to do with property of yours in fact be not own will not take will not rob of have be born to expect in return for owen talk of must abandon girl whom loved for wealth property can not love a love will talk to on matter openly a have never yet talked to one since first saw clara desmond only wish of life have be might have for wife have longed for a child longs if know what mean by when saw that be old enough to understand what love meant told what be in heart accepted love swore to that must be mine let brother say what must a sure a be standing there living man loved with truth loved herbert have never loved aught nothing else man woman wealth title ask be may have be own owen herbert touched cousin arm well why do not speak have spoken plainly enough be not easy to speak plainly on subject must not if must avoid say word must hurt feeling never mind feeling speak out let have truth in god name feeling have never be much considered yet in matter in other seems to said herbert that giving of lady clara hand can not depend on will on mine mean mother by mean mother now must be last to favour mean if love a hope believe nay be sure did love shouted owen even if so now say anything of even if so surely must not have marry if doe not love still must not wish to be wife if heart belongs to have be given at mother bidding however given be now own can not be returned look here owen will show last two letter if will allow not in pride hope that may truly know what be wish took from breast where have be ever since received two letter clara have written to owen read twice over before spoke first one then other indescribable look of pain fell on brow a did so be so tenderly worded so sweet so generous must have given world to have have letter addressed by to even did not convince heart have never changed must not believe that there have be change in hers might have known said a gave back that must be too noble to abandon in distress a long a be rich might have have chance of getting back despite machination of mother now that think be poor then stopped hid face between hand in what have last said there be undoubtedly something of truth clara love for herbert have never be passionate till passion have be created by misfortune in thought of owen there have be much of regret though have resolved to withdraw love have not wholly ceased to love judgment have bade to break word to have obeyed judgment have admitted to herself that mother be right in telling that must not join own bankrupt fortune to fortune of one who be poor spendthrift thus have plucked from heart picture of man have loved endeavoured so to pluck love for however have unwittingly lingered there then herbert have come with suit suitor fitted for in way have not loved a have loved owen have never felt that must worship tremble at tone of voice watch glance of eye gaze into face a though be half divine acknowledged worth valued knew that behoved to choose suitor a husband now that dream be gone where must choose better than here thus herbert have be accepted have be accepted dream be not wholly gone owen be in adversity ill spoken of by around shunned by own relative living darkly away from be soft in life for reason clara must not wholly forget dream have in sort unconsciously clung to old love till to whom have plighted new troth be in adversity then be changed then love for herbert did become passion then a owen have become rich felt that must think of without remorse be quite right in perceiving that chance be gone now that herbert have ceased to be rich owen said herbert voice be full of tenderness for at moment felt that did love pity cousin must of bear weight fortune have thrown on may be that be of to be envied have lost that men generally value have lost on earth be valuable to be not lost not lost a yet a long a name be clara desmond be a open for to win a be for herbert think of before make enemy see what offer not a bargain mind give up title to father property will sign paper that lawyer may bring to may serve to give back inheritance a for must scorn to take belongs in justice to will not have property come what may will not have will give up to either a to enemy a to friend sincerely hope that may be friend what say be impossible be not impossible hereby pledge will not take acre of father land pledge also will always be enemy if clara desmond becomes wife mean what say have set heart on one thing on one thing only if be ruined in be ruined indeed herbert remained silent for have nothing further that knew how to plead felt a other men must feel that of must keep that fate have given fate have decreed that owen must be heir to castle richmond decree thus gone forth must stand valid fate have also decreed that owen must be rejected by clara desmond other decree a herbert thought must be held a valid also have further inclination to argue upon subject cousin be becoming hot angry herbert be beginning to wish that be on way home that might be once more at father bedside in mother room comforting being comforted well said owen after while in deep toned voice what do say to offer have nothing further to say must take own course a for have lost everything one thing be not likely that will throw away from so help heaven in need will let that thing be filched from have offered kindness brotherly love wealth friendship must do for man give way in will be to comrade brother must be man owen be to give up be man yes be pride on part love have never loved a have loved have not sat apart long month month thinking of a have done from time be child marked a own a god will help when die be have coveted in world have coveted with such longing of heart can not bring to live without will then again be silent may be a well that must part now said herbert at last know that can gain anything by further talking on subject well know that best have one further question to ask what be owen still think of marrying clara desmond certainly of course think of when presume be not so chicken hearted a to be afraid of speaking out openly what intend to do can not say when have hoped that must have be very soon will of course delay may be year first last be only pleasant word owen have heard if there be to be delay of year might not chance still be a good a herbert then delay be to be consequence of cousin ruined prospect accomplishment of ruin owen have pledged to prevent be by own deed to enable enemy to take very step be so firmly resolved to prevent will give promise said that will not marry for next three year make that promise will make same herbert felt that there must be possibility of now marrying within time named nevertheless must not bring to make such promise a must make bargain about clara desmond about clara must in way admit doubt a to own right have owen asked to promise that must not marry during next week must have given such pledge said can not promise that be now only seventeen doe not matter will make such promise because on subject have right to ask for when will consent to run risk of happiness in coming to then will marry owen be now walking up down room with rapid step have not courage to fight fairly said wish to fight at ah must fight will see prey taken out of jaw not struggle for by heaven must fight tell fairly that fight will be a hard a can make have offered that one living man be seldom able to offer to money land wealth station thing throw away from because feel that must be yours ask only in return love of young girl ask that because feel that must be mine if have gone from believe have be filched stolen by thief in night did love if girl ever loved man be separated from bore patiently because trusted be young weak mother be strong crafty have accepted at mother instance be base enough to keep from father inheritance mother must no more give her to now than must to then be true if know to be true a do know will be mean dastard coward will be fitzgerald if keep from that have right to claim a own not fight ay must fight can not live here in country if clara desmond become wife mark word if take place can not live here alongside of other house paused for moment after then added can go now if will for have said out say herbert did go almost without uttering word of adieu what must say in answer to such threat a that cousin be in way unreasonable a unreasonable in generosity a be in claim felt convinced unreasonable man though be one whom one must fain conquer by argument be possible be very man on whom argument have avail madman be mad because be mad herbert have great deal be very sensible to allege in favour of view what use of alleging anything of sense to mind a of owen fitzgerald so went way without further speech when be gone owen for time went on walking room then sank again into chair abominably irrational a method of arranging family difficulty will doubt seem to who may read of to have appeared not only easy happy mode of bringing back contentment to everybody be quite serious in intention of giving up position a heir to castle richmond mr prendergast have explained to that property be entailed a far a farther have done doubtless with view not then expressed to friendly arrangement by small portion of property might be saved restored to child of sir thomas owen have looked at quite in light have in justice no right to inquire into circumstance of old cousin marriage union be marriage in eye of god must be held a such by must take advantage of so terrible accident must take advantage so said to over over again yet a said resolved that must take advantage must not touch estate surely if abstained from touching must be generous enough to leave to solace of love have scruple in allotting to clara poorer husband instead of richer be poorer now than when have accepted looking at in light have not right to claim that must abide by first acceptance must one be found to justify theory that girl may throw over poor lover because rich lover come in way owen have own idea of right wrong idea be not without basis of strong rugged justice nothing must be more antagonistic to than doctrine a then still believed in heart that be dearer to clara than other richer suitor heard of from time to time who have spoken to have spoken of a pining for love of in there have be much of flattery of servant something of subservience of about who wished to stand well in grace have believed be not conceited man even vain man did not think more clever than cousin a for personal appearance be matter to thought never descended have about self dependence assurance in own manhood forbade to doubt love of one who have told that loved did not believe in herbert love cousin be a thought of calibre too cold for love that clara be valued by owen did not doubt valued for beauty for rank for grace peerless manner what have such value a to do with love must herbert sacrifice everything for clara desmond must bid pelion fall on os must drink up esil must owen do more must do more than laertes have ever dreamed must give up for now for ever title to rich land made fitzgerald of castle richmond men of greatest mark in county thus fanned into fury a thought of cousin want of generosity herbert must be heir because be heir must be favoured lover there might yet be time opportunity at rate clara must not marry without knowing be whole truth herbert be ungenerous clara still might be just if not then a have said before must fight out battle to end a with enemy herbert when got on to horse to ride home be forced to acknowledge to that good whatever have come from visit to hap house word have be spoken might have be much better left unspoken angry man will often cling to anger because anger have be spoken will do evil because have threatened evil be ashamed to be better than word there be comfort to be derived from lavish promise made by owen with regard to property to herbert mind be mere moonshine very graceful on part of maker meaning nothing one must have castle richmond who owned legally owen fitzgerald must become sir owen must a matter of course be sir owen of castle richmond there be comfort on score then on that other score there be so much discomfort of giving up bride herbert never for moment thought did think with increasing annoyance of angry threat have be pronounced against when rode into stable yard a be wont found richard waiting for be not customary a in latter day richard though always drove car a sort of subsidiary coachman to young lady to whom car be supposed to belong in fee did not act a general groom have be promoted beyond be sort of hanger on about house half indoor servant half out doing very much what liked giving advice to everybody from cook downwards thanked god that knew place must often say nobody else knew nevertheless everybody liked even poor housemaid whom snubbed be anything matter asked herbert looking at man sorrow laden face 'deed ' there be mr herbert sir thomas be father be not dead exclaimed herbert oh mr herbert be not so bad a be very failing very failing lady be with now herbert ran into house at bottom of chief stair met one of sister who have heard step of horse oh herbert be so glad have come said eye cheek be red with tear hand a brother took be cold numbed what be mary be worse oh so much worse mamma emmeline be there have asked for three four time always say that be dying have better go up say that be here what doe mother think of have never left therefore can not tell know from face that think that be dying will go up herbert so went herbert following softly on toe stood in corridor outside bedroom door waiting till arrival must have be announced be minute then sister returning to door summoned to enter room have be nearly darkened a there be curtain to bed herbert must see mother face a knelt on stool at bedside father be turned away from lay with hand inside wife emmeline be sitting on foot of bed with face between hand striving to stifle sob here be herbert now dearest said lady fitzgerald with low soft voice almost whisper yet clear enough to cause effort in hearing knew that must not be long herbert obeying signal of mother eye passed round to other side of bed father said be not so well to day poor boy poor ruined boy said dying man hardly articulating word a dropped wife hand took that of son herbert found that be wet clammy cold almost powerless in feeble grasp dearest father be wrong if let that trouble all will never trouble be not well that man must earn own bread be not lot of good men still old man murmured with broken voice poor boy poor boy hope aspiration of eldest son be a breath of nostril to englishman who have be born to land fortune what have not poor man endured in order that son might be sir herbert fitzgerald of castle richmond be longer possible from moment that have be brought home to father have felt that for there be nothing left to die poor boy muttered tell that have forgiven then knelt round bed prayed with afterwards tried to comfort telling how good have be to wife whispered in ear that if there have be fault fault be hers that conscience told that such fault have be forgiven while said motioned child away from strove to make understand human misery must never kill soul must never utterly depress spirit dearest love said still whispering to in low sweet voice so dear to utterly inaudible beyond if must cease to accuse so bitterly might yet be better remain with to comfort slender half knit man whose arm be without muscle whose back be without pith will strive in vain to lift weight brawny vigour of toss from ground almost without effort be with mind spirit a with body only that muscle of body can be measured not so of spirit lady fitzgerald be made of other stuff than sir thomas to have cost effort with effort have be done surely be to a impossible a labour of hercules poor boy poor ruined boy still muttered a strove to comfort have sent for mr townsend emmeline whispered to brother a stood together in bow of window do really think be so bad a be sure that mamma doe believe have sort of fit before came at rate did not speak for two hour be not finucane here finucane be mallow doctor yes have left before papa became so much worse mamma have sent for also know that boot to dally longer in dying chamber be axiom of old that stage curtain must be drawn before inexorable one enters in upon final work doctor finucane did come coming be in vain sir thomas have known that be in vain so also have patient wife there be that mind diseased towards cure of doctor finucane must make possible approach mr townsend came also let hope not in vain though cure fain must have perfected can hardly be effected in such moment a let hope that have be already effected only cry sin can lay to charge of dying man be that of have spoken have endeavoured by pensioning falsehood fraud to preserve for wife name for son that son inheritance even over deep a be recording angel may have dropped cleansing tear of pity night poor man died fitzgerald who sat in chamber of castle richmond be no longer owner of mansion there be speech of sir herbert among servant a there must have be have tidings not have reached dr finucane have remained in house even in speaking of son have shown that knew story be stranger there now a knew intruder a must soon be considered in house of cousin owen rather not cousin in be above by right of blood have right to claim a relation may be said that at moment must not have be thought of who say so know little a imagine of true effect of sorrow wife child ever grieved more heartily for father grief be blacker more gloomy in knew that be outcast in world during long night a herbert sister sat up cowering round fire told of have be said at hap house can not be a say mary have asked that herbert must give up wife said emmeline that other thing dream of said herbert be impossible house that be now in belongs to sir owen fitzgerald chapter xxxi first month now will beg reader to suppose month to have passed by since sir thomas fitzgerald died be busy month in ireland may probably be said that so large sum of money have never be circulated in country in one month since money have be known there yet may also be said that so frightful mortality have never occurred there from want of money brings be well understood by men now that customary food of country have disappeared there be longer difference of opinion between rich poor between protestant roman catholic a to that man dared now to say that poor if left to must feed to allege that suffering of country arose from machination of money making speculator famine be established fact men knew that be god doing men knew though few must recognize a yet with how much mercy god hand be stretched out over country may not perhaps be truer to say that in such matter there be such thing a mercy special mercy other mercy than fatherly forbearing seeing perfect goodness by creator be ever adapting world to want of creature rectifying evil arising from fault folly sed quo musa tendis such discourse of god a be not to be fitly handled in such small measure at rate there be famine undoubted now by one death who in visiting castle richmond may be said to have knocked at tower of king be busy enough also among cabin of poor now great fault of who be most affected be becoming one must not have be at first sight expected one must think that starving men must become violent taking food by open theft feeling perhaps not without truth that agony of want robbed such robbery of sin such be by mean case only remember one instance in baker shop be attacked in instance work be done by who be undergoing real suffering at clonmel in tipperary bread be one morning stripped away from baker shop at time in place there be nothing approaching to famine fault of people be apathy be feeling of multitude that world be good in be passing away from exertion be useless hope hopeless ah honour said man to there will never be bit sup again in county cork life of world be fairly gone be very hard to repress feeling energy of man depends so much on outward circumstance encumber be so hard to work when work seems hopeless so hard to trust where basis of faith be so far removed from sight when large tract of land went out of cultivation be not natural to think that agriculture be receding from country leaving green hill once more to be brown barren a hill once green have become in other country when men be falling in highway woman must sit with babe in arm listless till death must come to be not natural to think that death be making huge success that inexorable one be now inexorable indeed there be greatly trusting heart must withstand weight of terrible pressure thinking mind saw that good must come out of great evil such heart such mind be not to be looked for among suffering poor be not perhaps often found even among who be not poor suffering be very hard to be thus trusting thoughtful while everything around be full

herbert must of course pay outward attention to want relief of people must make offer of assistance for nothing belonged to must aid in council of committee for one must have defined position of speaker during month nothing be defined about castle richmond lady fitzgerald be still always called by title people of country including tradesman of neighbouring town addressed owner of hap house a sir owen gradually name be working into common use though have taken no step to make legally entitled to wear one spoke of sir herbert story be so generally known that none be so ignorant a to suppose to be father heir servant about place still called mr herbert order to effect having be specially given peasant of country with tact grace with anxiety to abstain from giving pain always accompanies unless when angered carefully called by name knew that be not sir herbert must not believe what perchance might be so yet on future day so took off old hat to passed silently in sorrow if spoke to addressed honour simply omitting mention of christian name poor irishman be generally so fond of using mister blake sound cold unkindly in ear be masther honour if possible misther thady if there be handle be used with avidity pat be happy man when can address landlord a sir patrick now ould masther son must be called by name men knew not what be to be though knew well that be not that ought to be there be who attempted to worship owen a rising sun for such of a have never worshipped before game be rather hopeless in day be not much seen neither hunting entertaining company when seen be rough enough with who made deep attempt to ingratiate with coming mightiness during month went over to london having be specially invited so to do by mr prendergast very little came of visit there except that be certified to that be beyond doubt baronet there will be unnecessary delay sir owen said mr prendergast in putting into full possession of right in answer to have replied that be not anxious to be put in possession of right a far a active doing of own be concerned title might lie in abeyance that regarding property must make known wish to mr prendergast very quickly after return to ireland intimated at same time that there must be ground for disturbing lady fitzgerald a have intention under circumstance of living at castle richmond have not better tell lady fitzgerald said mr prendergast catching at idea that friend widow reader will allow so to call might be allowed to live undisturbed at family mansion if not for life at rate for few year if young man be so generous why must not be so must not want big house at rate till be married must be better that must say so said owen have particular reason for not wishing to go there allow to say dear young friend hope may call so for greatly admire way in have taken tidings must venture to advise to drop remembrance of unpleasantness may have existed must now feel to be closest friend of family so must if then owen stopped short though mr prendergast gave plenty of time to finish sentence be minded to do so in present position continued lawyer influence will be very great ca explain said owen think influence will be great at what be more want influence of sort wish lady fitzgerald to understand that be at perfect liberty to stay where be a far a be concerned not a favour from mind for think that must take favour from hand dear sir therefore have better write to about remaining there mr prendergast did write to rather to herbert in doing so thought right to say that permission to live at castle richmond must be regarded a kindness granted by relative be kindness under circumstance mother may think accept without compunction at rate for time to come till will have suited without hurrying choice nevertheless must be regarded a generous offer on part do hope dear herbert that will be fast friend mr prendergast did not in least comprehend working of owen mind herbert who knew more of than one else did not understand altogether owen have idea of granting favour to relative who a thought have never granted to what owen wanted what told that wanted be justice be duty a just man to abstain from taking hold of acre be prepared to do duty be equally herbert duty a just man to abstain from taking hold of clara desmond be resolved that must never be herbert friend if herbert did not perform that duty then though felt bound to give up acre though did regard a imperative duty nevertheless felt also that something be due to for readiness to perform duty that reward must be conceded to what reward be to be rather what wished to be know herbert have utterly refused to engage in such negotiation owen nevertheless must not cease to think that something might yet be done who be so generous a clara must not clara speak out if knew how much old lover be prepared to do for newer lover dozen time owen made up mind to explain whole thing to mr prendergast when found in presence of lawyer must not talk about love young men be so apt to think that senior in age can not understand romance acknowledge force of passion here be wrong for there must be a much romance after forty a before take be not checked by fear of ridicule so owen stayed week in london seeing mr prendergast day then returned to hap house in mean time life went on at very sad pace at desmond court there be concord between two lady residing there mother be silent gloomy sometimes bitter seldom saying word about herbert fitzgerald prospect saying that word with great fixity of purpose when be spoken one said must attribute to poverty misery of child that marriage must not take place from house with consent clara for most part be silent also in answer to such word a above must say nothing when a did happen once twice be forced to speak declared openly enough that earthly consideration must induce to give up engagement then young earl came home brought away from school in order that authority might have effect on sister to speak truth be unwilling enough to interfere must have declined to come at must have dared to do so eton be now more pleasant to than desmond court indeed have little of pleasantness to offer to lad such a be now be sixteen manly for age question in dispute at desmond court offered little attraction even to manly boy of sixteen in former question a to owen have said word two knowing that owen must not be looked upon a fitting husband for sister now knew not how to counsel again a to herbert seeing that be other day that have written long letter congratulating on connection towards end of month however did arrive making glad mother heart a looked at strong limb handsome open face clara too threw so warmly into arm that did feel glad that have come to oh patrick be so sweet to have here said before mother have have time to speak to dearest clara patrick must not be cruel to look here patrick be only brother so love must not offend turn against for world be head of family too nothing must be done that like if so much depends on must think well before decide on anything opened young eye looked intently into face for there be earnestness in word that almost frightened must think well of before speak patrick remember must be honest honourable whether be poor remember about owen fitzgerald how gave way then because must do so without dishonour now clara understand a yet can not not a yet will let mamma tell story ask be that will think of honour before say word can favour then promised that must do so mother when on following morning told history found reserved silent look at position said mother pleading cause before son be illegitimate yes mother know that dear know what must say one can pity mr fitzgerald position more than do must not on account have sister ruined be romance on part what doe say be quite willing to give up match have told so said a much to aunt whom have seen three time on subject do mean that wish to give up at least know if doe can not express such wish because clara be so headstrong patrick in heart believe that care for have doubted for time wanted to marry so did be excellent match in certain way did like then know there be that great danger about poor owen be great danger then now be so determined about because think must be ungenerous to go back from word in way will ruin very man wish to serve of course can not break off match if persists in what want to perceive be that utterly penniless a be will have to begin world with clog round neck because be so obstinate what must possibly be worse for than titled wife without penny in way countess pleaded side of question before son be quite true that have be three time to castle richmond have thrice driven aunt letty into state bordering on distraction if must only get castle richmond people to take up a ought to do be thus argued with herself with aunt letty also endeavouring to persuade that two young people must undoubtedly ruin other unless who be really wise prudent who understood world such a aunt letty for instance must interfere to prevent aunt letty on whole did agree with though greatly disliked miss fitzgerald have strongly planted within bosom prudent old world notion that young gentlefolk must not love other unless have plenty of money that if unfortunately such did love other be better that must suffer pang of hopeless love than marry trust to god wit for bread cheese to opinion of aunt letty a well a to others entertained by lady with much pertinacity can not subscribe a adherent lady desmond have wit enough to discover aunt letty did agree with in main on account be eager in seeking assistance lady fitzgerald of course must not be seen there be one else at castle richmond who must be supposed to have weight with herbert therefore lady desmond be very eloquent with aunt letty talking much of future misery of two young people till old lady have promised to use best effort in enlisting lady fitzgerald on same side can not wonder miss fitzgerald must wish to put end to cruel position in poor girl be placed know how much girl suffers from kind of thing aunt letty did dislike lady desmond

becoming used to position family discussion be held among a to what must do where must live in future mr prendergast have written seeing that owen have persisted in refusing to make offer personally saying that there be hurry for removal sir owen said having considered deeply whether must call by title having resolved that must be best to do so at once sir owen be inclined to behave very generously lady fitzgerald must have house demesne at rate for twelve month by time personal property left by sir thomas must be realized there must be enough mr prendergast said for three lady to

over in mind in mind of who loved beginning with revenue of archbishop of armagh be aunt letty idea ending with seat at government desk be own mr prendergast have counselled law not own lower branch of profession barrister full blown wig adding in letter to lady fitzgerald that if herbert must come to london settle in chamber mr prendergast must see that life be made agreeable to mr somers gave other advice in day assistant poor law commissioner be being appointed in ireland almost by score mr somers declared that herbert have only to signify wish for position must get interest have taken in welfare of poor around be well known a own story be well known also there must be doubt that government must be willing to assist one so circumstanced who when assisted must make so useful such be advice of mr somers might have be right for herbert lady fitzgerald felt that must be well for to move out of neighbourhood out of ireland altogether if such must be possible aunt letty be strong for church young man who have distinguished at university so signally a nephew have done taking degree at very first attempt that in so high class of honour a fourth must not fail to succeed in church might not perhaps succeed a to armagh that admitted there be thirty other bishopric to be have must be odd if with talent did not get one of think what must be if be to return to own country a bishop of cork cloyne ross a to amalgamation of see however aunt letty have own idea be slightly tainted with venom of puseyism aunt letty said to herself nothing must dispel with so much certainty a theological study necessary for ordination then aunt letty talked over by hour together with mr townsend lady be agreed that herbert must get ordained a quickly a possible not in england where there might be danger even in ordination in good wholesome protestant ireland where church of england clergyman be clergyman of church of england not priest slipping about in mud half way between england

ground on aunt letty be able to stand have a be given authority for carrying on agitation in furtherance of own view herbert soon gave up idea man thought to be clergyman must have very strong predilection in favour of profession so gradually abandoned that idea actuated a poor aunt letty feared by agency of evil one working through mean of puseyism mother sister be in favour of mr prendergast view a be gradually found by that there must not be immediate pressure a regarded pecuniary mean seemed at last to be decision herbert must remain yet for three four week at castle richmond till matter there be somewhat more thoroughly settled must then put into hand of mr prendergast in london mr prendergast must select legal tutor for proper legal chamber then not long

decent graceful order when be properly looked in face handled with steady hand be not sparing of broom three month since everything at castle richmond be ruin such ruin indeed that very power of living under seemed to be doubtful when first mr prendergast arrived there feeling came upon a though might hardly dare to live in world must look at a so thoroughly degraded a regard mean must be beggar a regard position so much worse than beggar broken world be in truth falling about ear be felt to be impossible that must endure convulsion yet live now world have fallen ruin have come be

of owen usurper herbert did not take direct road to desmond court went round a though be going to gortnaclough then turning away from gortnaclough road made way by cross lane towards clady mountain hardly knew whether have object in beyond one did not express even to that namely of not being seen on way leading to desmond court did do thereby riding out of district with be most thoroughly acquainted passing by cabin patch of now deserted land be strange to be poor bleak damp undrained country lying beyond confines of father property in good day have never be pleasant to eye now in day day be so decidedly bad be anything pleasant be one of tract of land have be divided subdivided among cottier till field have dwindled down to part of acre surrounded by rude low bank of seemed to occupy quarter of surface of land original landmark big earthen bank bank so large that horse might walk on top of be still visible enough showing to practised eye what have once be field into land

with light hand be blowing sharply on sudden squall of rain came on one of spring squall be so piercingly cold be sure to pas by rapidly if wayfarer will have patience to wait for herbert remembering former discomfiture resolved that must have such patience dismounting from horse at cabin on road side entered led horse in after in england one must think of taking steed into poor man cottage must hardly put beast into cottager shed without leave asked granted people be more intimate with other take greater liberty in ireland be uncommon thing on wet hunting day to see cabin packed with horse child moving about among almost a unconcernedly a though animal be pig then irish horse be so well mannered good natured cabin be one abutting a be on road not standing back upon land a be most customary be built in angle at spot where road made turn so that two side of stood close out in wayside be small wretched to look at without sort of outside shed even scrap of potato garden attached to miserable low roofed damp ragged tenement a wretched a might be seen even in county cork nakedness of exterior be a nothing to nakedness of interior when herbert entered followed by horse eye glanced round dark place seemed to be empty of everything there be fire on hearth though fire on hearth be easiest of luxury for irishman to acquire last be willing to lose there be not article of furniture in whole place chair table bed dresser there be there dish cup plate even iron pot in cookery of irish cottier menage be usually carried on beneath foot be damp earthen floor around be damp cracked wall over head be old lumpy thatch through water be already dropping inside be to be seen none of article of daily use be usually to be found in house even of poorest nevertheless place be inhabited squatting in middle of cabin seated on leg crossed under with nothing between wet earth there crouched woman with child in arm at first so dark be place herbert hardly thought that object before be human being did not move when entered speak to in way show sign of surprise that must have come there there be room for horse without pushing from place a seemed might have stayed there taken departure without sign having be made by a eye became used to light saw eye gleaming brightly through gloom be very large bright a turned round upon while moved large bright with dull unwholesome brightness brightness have in none of light of life then looked at more closely have on rag of clothing barely sufficed to cover nakedness baby held in arm be covered in sort must see a came to stand close over that garment be loose rag be hardly fastened round body rough short hair hung down upon back clotted with dirt head face of child held be covered with dirt sore on more wretched object in desolate solitude did eye of man ever fall in day there be form of face came upon sufferer when state of misery be far advanced be sure sign that last stage of misery be nearly run mouth must fall seem to hang lip at two end of mouth must be dragged down lower part of cheek must fall a though have be dragged pulled there be sign of acute agony when phasis of countenance be to be

be known with certainty be use in life meddling with be gone said lady to in far west of south of ireland while poor boy whose doom be thus spoken stood by listening delicacy did not equal energy in doing good for did much good in truth be difficult to be delicate when hand be so full then pointed out to sign on lad face found that reading be correct famine be not old enough at time of be speaking for herbert to have learned must have known that there be hope left in world for poor creature whom saw before skin of cheek have fallen mouth be dragged mark of death be upon agony of want

for damp chill of place struck through to bone 'deed said again made wail a to want uttered complaint a to misery be living here by without furniture utensil of kind be jist a yer honour see answered for while herbert stood still looking round for woman be so motionless uncommunicative that hardly knew how to talk to that be in lowest depth of distress be evident enough behoved to administer to immediate want before left what must do for one who seemed to be so indifferent to herself stood for time looking round till must see through gloom that there be bundle of straw lying in dark corner beyond hearth that straw be huddled up a though there be something lying under seeing left bridle of horse stepping across cabin moved straw with handle of whip a did so turned back from wall in small window hole have be pierced so that gleam of light fell upon bundle at foot must see that body of child be lying there stripped of vestige of clothing for minute two said nothing hardly indeed knowing how to speak looking from corpselike woman back to lifelike corpse then from corpse back to woman a though expected that must say something unasked did not say word though so turned head that eye rested on then knelt down put hand upon body found that be not yet stone cold child apparently have be about four year old while still living in arm might perhaps be half age be own asked herbert

yer honour 't be broad day be thinking when guv ' over moaning war way when went away who be jist mike thin be mike husband asked be not very willing to talk appeared at last that mike be husband that having become cripple through rheumatism have not be able to work on road in condition must of course have gone into poor house be easy enough to give such advice in such case when one came across such advice when given at time be usually followed there be so many who have advice who must get aid who knew not way to turn wretched man have succeeded in finding one who must give food food enough to keep alive for such work a must do in spite of rheumatism work to last must not abandon even be better to than poor house then a long a man found work out of poor house wife child must not be admitted into must not be admitted if fact of working husband be known rule in be salutary a without man must work earning such wage a be adjudged to be needful for family at same time send wife child

gone to work leaving home without one morsel of food within wife of bosom child of love without hope of getting then looking closely round herbert must see that small basin bowl lay on floor near capable of holding perhaps pint on lifting saw that there still clung to few grain of uncooked indian corn flour yellow meal a be called husband said at last have brought home with in cap handful of flour stolen from place where be working perhaps quarter of pound then worth over farthing have mixed with water in basin be food have sustained rather have not sustained since yesterday morning two child one be living one be dead such be story told by in fewest of word then asked a to hope for future though cared a seemed little for past for future cared le 'deed thin ' jist know must say no

did so made motion a though to arrange clothing closer round child limb herbert must see that be making effort to hide own nakedness be only effort that made while stood there beside be not cold said again when have turned face away to relieve from embarrassment cowld muttered with vacant face wondering tone of voice a though did not quite understand suppose be must why must be must be must enough if be still did not stir from spot on sat child though gave from time to time low moan be almost inaudible lay still in arm with big eye staring into vacancy felt that be stricken with horror a remained there in cabin with dying woman naked corpse of poor dead child what be to do must not go leave without woman have made plaint of suffering have asked for nothing felt that must be impossible to abandon without offering relief be possible that must leave body of child in horribly ghastly state so took from pocket silk handkerchief returning to corner of cabin spread a covering over corpse at first did not like to touch small naked dwindled remains of humanity from life have fled gradually overcame disgust kneeling down straightened limb closed eye folded handkerchief round slender body mother looked on while shaking head slowly a though asking with voice be left to whether be not piteous of word still uttered none then took from pocket silver coin two tendered to did take muttering word of thanks caused in emotion of joy be there waiting said till mike must return there must still wait even though must die with silver in hand will send one to said a took departure one will take poor child bury who will move other one into workhouse thanked once more with low muttered word promise brought joy when succour came be all too late for mother two child never left cabin till left together wrapped in workhouse shroud herbert a remounted horse rode quietly on forgot for while clara desmond might be extent of own calamity how must think unhappy after what have seen how must repine at aught that world have done for having now witnessed to how low state of misery fellow human being might be brought must after dare to consider unfortunate before reached desmond court did make arrangement for poor woman directed that cart might be sent for so that might be carried to union workhouse at kanturk effort in service be of little avail people then did not think much of dying woman be in special hurry to obey herbert behest woman to be carried to union be for mr fitzgerald eh what mr fitzgerald say must be done in course sure av be done before dark wo that be time enough for like of have flown to spot on wing of love must not have sufficed to prolong life one day doom have be spoken before herbert have entered cabin chapter xxxiv farewell be two hour later than have intended a rode up avenue to lady desmond gate chief thought at moment be how must describe to countess scene have just witnessed why describe at be what must say have come there to talk about other thing about other thing must be discussed must require wit let keep that poor woman on mind not embarrass with mention of for present doubt must have be wise if only have be possible out of full heart mouth speaks lady desmond have not witnessed scene have attempted to describe heart therefore be not full of be not inclined to be so filled so in answer to herbert exclamation oh lady desmond have seen sight gave little encouragement to describe by coldness reserve dignity soon quelled expression of feeling earl be present shook hand very cordially with herbert when entered room being more susceptible a being younger not having yet become habituated to famine a mother be did express eager sympathy must immediately go down send fahy with car have brought up saved mother have other work to do soon put stop to mr fitzgerald said speaking with smile upon face with much high bred dignity of demeanour a lady clara wish to see other before leave country a have known other so intimately considering circumstance have not thought well absolutely to forbid interview do doubt expediency do indeed lord desmond who feel for late misfortune a do perfectly agrees with think that must be much wiser for to have parted without pain of meeting seeing how impossible be that must ever be more to other than be now then appealed to son who stood by looking not quite so wise even quite so decided a mother word must seem to make well yes upon word see how be to be said young earl be deuced sorry for for one wish be well off so must give clara pot of money then must not care so much about not being baronet be sure must see mr fitzgerald know that do see because have very properly said so that marriage between lady clara be now impossible for such engagement must be very bad very bad indeed for must be utter ruin indeed must be ruin for unencumbered a will be with good connection will have with excellent talent will be quite within reach to win for high position with a with other gentleman who have to work way marriage must come late in life unless marry heiress think be thoroughly understood by people in position be sure that be understood by excellent mother for whom always have still have most unfeigned respect a be so undoubtedly case a can not of course consent that lady clara must remain hampered by engagement must in human probability hang over ten best year of life thought wise that must not see other have however allowed to be overruled now must only trust to honour forbearance prudence to protect child from what might possibly be ill effect of own affectionate feeling that be romantic enthusiastic to fault must perhaps rather call need not tell think that misfortune demand from sacrifice of herself know will feel that even be such sacrifice available to must not become to accept because have fallen will not wish to drag down more especially a can rise again must not so spoke countess with much worldly wisdom with considerable tact in adjusting word to object have in view herbert a stood before silent during period of oration did feel that must be well for to give up love go away in utter solitude of heart to dingy study mr prendergast be preparing for love rather assurance of clara love have be great consolation what right have with advantage of youth health friend education to require consolation then from moment to moment thought of woman whom have left in cabin confessed that did not dare to call unhappy have listened attentively although did thus think of other eloquence besides of countess of eloquence of silent solitary dying woman when have done hardly knew what to say for did make feel that must be ungenerous in to persist in engagement then again clara letter sister argument have made feel that be impossible to abandon pleaded of heart feeling so well that must not resist countess pleaded so well a to world prudence that must not resist must not willingly do anything to injure lady clara said be what knew said young earl see what be girl to do like love in cottage be very well a for rich care about must be pity if did for will be about poorest nobleman in three kingdom suppose chap when marries must have something must now to tell truth earl have be very much divided in opinion since have come home veering round point two way point two that in obedience to blast of eloquence to might be last subjected latterly idea have grown upon clara might possibly marry owen fitzgerald there be about strange fascination felt who have once loved to world be rough haughty imperious in command exacting even in fellowship to few whom absolutely loved whom have taken into heart core man ever be more tender more gracious clara though have resolved to banish from heart have found impossible to do so till herbert misfortune have given charm in eye be not own clara mother have loved have loved a never before have loved now loved still though have so strongly determined that love must be that of mother not that of wife young earl now that owen name be again rife in ear remembered pleasantness of former day have never again found companion a owen have be have met no other friend to whom must talk of sport man outward pleasure when mind be way given to whom must also talk of soft inward thing heart feeling aspiration want owen must be a tender with a woman allowing young lad arm round body listening to word outer world must have called bosh have derided a girlish so at least thought young earl to boy long to be allowed utterance occasionally for soft tender thing a also do men unless devil share in world have become altogether uppermost with young lad heart hankered after old friend have listened to sister for while have taken part mother have since whispered to that owen must now be better suitor preferable brother in law that in fact clara loved owen best though felt bound by honour to kinsman then reminded son of clara former love for owen love have witnessed thought of day when with so much regret have told friend that be unsuited to wed with earl penniless daughter of subsequent pleasantness have come with herbert arrival have seen little nothing have be told by letter herbert fitzgerald prosperous heir of castle richmond be to be future brother in law have be satisfied now if owen must return how pleasant must be chap when marries must have something must now so spoke young earl re echoing mother prudence herbert did not quite like interference on boy part be to explain to young lad from eton what future intention be with reference to mode of living period of marriage of course said addressing to countess will not insist on engagement made under such different circumstance will allow to do so through romantic feeling of generosity said countess must know own daughter lady desmond better than do answered can not say what may do at instance till will have seen do mean to say that will allow girl of age to talk into proceeding know to be wrong will allow one said to talk into proceeding know to be wrong will allow one to talk out of proceeding believe to be right then having uttered somewhat grandiloquent word shut up a though there be longer need for discussing subject poor child said countess in low tremulous voice a though did not intend to hear poor unfortunate child herbert a did hear thought of woman in cabin of misfortune of child come patrick continued countess be perhaps useless for to say anything further at present if will remain here mr fitzgerald for minute two will send lady clara to wait upon then curtsying with great dignity withdrew young earl scuffled out after mamma said a went be determined that will have poor child answered countess if be in place must be determined also may a well give up not that like owen thousand time best herbert did wait there for five minute then door be opened very gently be gently closed again clara desmond be in room came towards respectfully holding out hand that might take hers before have thought of how must act be in arm hitherto of betrothed maiden have be most retiring sometimes have thought cold when have left seat by side to go nestle closely by sister have avoided touch of hand pressure of arm have gone from speechless if not with anger then with dismay when have carried warmth of love beyond touch of hand pressure of arm now rushed into embrace hid face upon shoulder a though be over glad to return to heart from around have endeavoured to banish be be not to speak of love have be question have asked when left alone there for five minute with eloquence of countess ringing in ear now that question have in truth be answered for herbert said herbert have so sorrowed for know that have borne like man be thinking of what have now half forgotten position have lost hope have be shipwrecked title surrendered to lost estate be thinking of a loss affected have reconciled to unless be to separate from promised bride dearest clara said with arm close round waist while anger dismay appeared to disturb sweetness of position letter wrote have be chief comfort now if have intention of liberating clara from bond of engagement if really have feeling that behoved not to involve in worldly loss have come upon be taking very bad way of carrying out view in respect instead of confessing comfort have received from letter holding close to breast while did confess must have stood away from quite a far apart a have done from countess must have argued with showing how foolish imprudent letter have be explaining that behoved now to repress feeling teaching that peer daughter a well a housemaid must look out for situation must suit guided by prudence view to wage not follow dictate of impulse of heart be what must have done according believe to view of most men woman instead of that held there a close a must hold left to do most of speaking think be right according to idea woman love must be regarded a fair prize of war a long a war have be carried on with due adherence to recognized law of nation when have be fairly won let be firmly held have opinion of theory of giving up knew must not abandon did not know say that knew said clara then insisted on having answer must hardly dare to think that there be so much happiness left for said herbert then be traitor to love sir false traitor deep a be offence for arraigned be clear to see that pardon came a quick a conviction be emmeline so untrue to also a to believe emmeline said then told what emmeline have said dearest dearest emmeline give whole heart load of love from now mind do to mary too remember sir love emmeline ten time better than do twenty time because knew oh if have mistrusted do think that mistrusted yes did know did sir wrote told so now very day come here to act a though mistrusted still know have only have not courage to go on with acting then began to defend showing how ill must have become to have kept bound to engagement have feared poverty a most girl in position must have feared on point must not hear much from lest very fact of hearing must make seem that line of conduct be possible to know nothing about most girl sir about be afraid not even about one if most girl be frightfully heartless be not what right have to liken to most girl emmeline knew better why must not take a type of most girl have behaved very badly master herbert know nothing on earth will make forgive nothing promise that will not so misjudge more then tear came to eye face be again hidden on shoulder be not very probable that after commencement interview must terminate in manner favourable to wish of countess clara swore to lover that have given that have to give heart will very self swore also that must not must not take back gift must remain a be now a long a thought proper must come to whenever must tell that home be large enough for so that matter be settled between then have much to say about mother sister word too about poor father now that be settled between so fixedly that come what might be to float together in same boat down river of life have question two also to ask approbation to give to withhold a to future prospect be not to think told of deciding on anything without at rate telling so have to explain to family plan making know why have decided on law a own path to fortune asking for obtaining consent to proposed measure in way view of matter became more more firmly adopted a must be view resolutely to be taken by countess have felt that interview must be fatal to have be right how must have prevented twenty time have resolved that must prevent twenty time have be forced to confess that be powerless to do so in day mother even can only exercise such power over child a public opinion permit to use mother be who brought together can not separate now that have always be clara argument leaving countess helpless except a far a must work on herbert generosity that have tried a have seen be foiled there also if only must have taken daughter away while castle richmond family be still mersed in bitter depth of suffering at moment when blow be falling on then indeed might have done something be not like other titled mother in such step a be absolutely without mean thus talking together remained closeted for most unconscionable time clara have have purpose to carry out to herbert moment have be too precious to cause regret a passed now at last knock be heard at door lady desmond without waiting for answer to entered room clara immediately started from seat not a though be either guilty tremulous with brave resolve to go on with purposed plan mamma said be fixed now can not be altered now what be fixed clara herbert have renewed engagement nothing must now break unless die mr fitzgerald if be true conduct to daughter have be unmanly a well a ungenerous lady desmond be true think that conduct be unmanly ungenerous own relation be against sir what relation asked clara

following morning mr prendergast kept bachelor house in bloomsbury square not very far from lincoln inn just across holborn a londoner know there must expect herbert at seven o'clock will not ask one to meet said because will be tired after journey perhaps more inclined to talk to than to stranger mr prendergast be one of old fashioned people who think that spacious substantial house in bloomsbury square at rent of hundred twenty pound year be better worth having than narrow lath plaster ill built tenement at nearly double price out westward of park quite new man be necessarily afraid of such locality a bloomsbury square for have chance of getting one into house if live westward who must dine with mr jones in woburn terrace unless have known mr jones day unless jones be known a top sawyer in walk of life mr prendergast be well enough known to old friend to be allowed to live where pleased be not very anxious to add to number by new fashionable allurement herbert sent over to bloomsbury square to say that must be there at seven o'clock then sat down in new lodging be dingy abode consisting of narrow sitting room looking out into big square from over covered archway narrower bedroom looking backwards into dull dirty looking crooked street nothing thought must be more melancholy than home then what did signify day must be passed in mr die chamber evening must be spent over law book with closed window copious burning of midnight oil for herbert have wisely resolved that hard work hard work alone must mitigate misery of present position have work for present day must not at once unpack portmanteau begin law study on moment be about noon when have completed former preparation eaten such breakfast a new london landlady have gotten for breakfast have not of be bad for mr

bacon heggs to breakfastesses have only to say word then heggs hai heggs be truth hai chicken some'at betwixt two so went on during whole time that be eating moving about from place to place putting back into place have chosen for anything have chanced to move now dusting bit of furniture with apron then leaning on back of chair while asked question a to habit future mode of living also wore bonnet apparently a customary part of house costume herbert must not help thinking that looked very like aunt letty when have gone taken breakfast thing with then began tedium of day seemed to a though have mean of commencing life in london until have be with mr prendergast mr die so new did feel to so strange wonderful that hardly dared to go out of house by wander about premise of inn be not absolutely stranger in london for have be elected at club before have left oxford have be up in town twice staying on occasion few week have therefore be asked about metropolis four month since at castle richmond must have professed that knew well starting from pall mall must have gone to of central theatre to park to house of parliament to picture gallery in june now in dingy big square felt to be absolutely stranger when did venture out watched corner in order that might find way back without asking question then roamed round square about little court found out where be stone building so called because be so dull dead stony hearted a courage increased made way into one of court stood up for while on uncomfortable narrow step so that might watch proceeding a went on seemed to to be dull deadly there be life amusement such a have seen at assize court in county cork when be sworn in a one of grand jury there gentleman in wig for on munster circuit do wear wig at rate did then laughed winked talked together joyously when roman catholic fisherman from berehaven be put into dock for destroying boat net of protestant fisherman from dingle in county kerry who have chanced to come way not fishing at at yer honour just souping a papist prisoner averred with great emphasis gentleman of robe have gone to fight with animation courage of matador picador in bull ring be delightful to see way in roman catholic skill combated protestant fury with substratum below of irish fun showed to everybody that be not quite in earnest that great o'fagan great fitzberesford must sit down together afterwards with pleasure in life over modicum of claret in barrister room at imperial hotel then judge have added to life of meeting helping to bamboozle make miserable wretch of witness who have be caught in act of seeing boat smashed with fragment of rock be now in consequence being impaled alive by lordship assistance what do say name be demanded lordship angrily rowland houghton said miserable stray saxon tourist who have so unfortunately strayed way on occasion what repeated judge whose ear be sharper to such sound a obehaughnessy macgillycuddy o'callaghan rowland houghton said offender in distress quicker louder perhaps not more distinctly than before what doe man say said judge turning head down towards satellite who sat on bench beneath cushion gentleman appealed to pronounced name for judge hearing with full rolling irish brogue gave great delight through court r rowland hough h ton lor r d whereupon lordship threw up hand in dismay oulan outan said oulan outan never heard name in life then having thoroughly impaled wicked witness added materially to amusement of day judge wrote down name in book there be to day doubt oulan outan when one think of be monstrous that english witness must go into irish law court with name a rowland houghton here in dark dingy court to herbert have penetrated in lincoln inn there be such life a here skill there might be be of dark subterranean nature quite unintelligible to mind of expert a for fury fun there be spark of one of other judge sat back in seat tall handsome speechless man not asleep for eye from time to time moved slowly from dingy barrister who be on leg to dingy barrister who be sitting with hand in pocket with eye fixed upon ceiling gentleman who be in act of pleading have huge open paper in hand from droned forth certain legal quiddity of dullest most uninteresting nature be in earnest for there be perpetual energy in drone a droning bee might drone who be known to drone louder than other drone be continuous energy supported by perseverance not by impulse seemed to come of fixed determination to continue reading of paper till world must be asleep great part of world around be asleep judge eye be still open one might say that barrister be resolved to go on till that eye must have become closed in token of success herbert remained there for hour thinking that might learn something must be serviceable to in coming legal career at end of hour same thing be going on judge eye be still open lawyer drone be still sounding so came away having found absolutely dozing in uncomfortable position in be standing at last day wore away at seven o'clock found in mr prendergast hall in bloomsbury square hat umbrella be taken away from by old servant looking very much like mr prendergast having about same look of stiffness of year same look also of excellent preservation care mr prendergast be in library sir if please said old servant so saying ushered herbert into back down stair room be spacious lofty apartment well fitted up for library furnished for purpose with exceeding care room a one doe not find in flashy new house in west where dining room drawing room occupy of house be visible then how few of who live in flashy new house in west require to have library in london a entered room mr prendergast came forward to meet seemed heartily glad to see there be cordiality about herbert have never recognized at castle richmond appearance of enjoyment have seemed to be almost foreign to lawyer nature herbert perhaps have not calculated a must have done mr prendergast mission in ireland have not admitted of much enjoyment mr prendergast have gone there to do job of work that have done very thoroughly certainly have not enjoyed there be time for only few word before old man again entered room announcing dinner few word have reference to castle richmond sorrow have spoken of herbert lodging of journey word two of mr die then went in to dinner at dinner too conversation wholly turned upon indifferent matter upon reform at oxford state of party of peculiar idiosyncrasy of irish low church clergyman on of subject herbert found that mr prendergast have tolerably strong opinion of own dinner be very good though by mean showy a might have be expected in house in bloomsbury square wine excellent a might have be expected in house inhabited by mr prendergast then when dinner be over old servant have slowly removed last tray when have got into arm chair be seated at properly comfortable distance from fire mr prendergast began to talk freely not that at once plunged into middle of old history began with lugubrious force to recapitulate horror be now partly over gradually veered round to point a to thought good that must speak before setting herbert at work on new london life drink claret suppose said mr prendergast a adjusted portion of table for evening symposium oh yes said herbert not caring very much at moment what wine be will find that pretty good good deal better than what will get in most house in london nowadays know man always like own wine especially old man herbert said something about being very good did not give attention to matter mr prendergast thought that deserved indeed be thinking more about mr die stone building than about wine how do find old friend mr whereas asked lawyer seems to be very attentive sort of woman yes rather too much so sometimes people do say that never know how to hold tongue wo rob yet poison in day be saying very great deal for woman in london then there be pause a mr prendergast sipped wine with slow complacency be to go to mr die to morrow suppose said beginning again to herbert replied that must be ready at time in morning might be suitable sooner get into harness better be not only that have much to learn have much to forget also yes said herbert have much to forget indeed more than can forget be afraid mr prendergast there be fancy sorrow man can not forget be a far a memory of be likely to be painful to will not absolutely cease to remember castle richmond circumstance will still think of place people whom knew there will learn to do so without pain of course now suffer be what mean by forgetting oh complain sir know be reason why be so anxious to see happy have borne whole matter so well that be quite sure that will be able to live happily in new life be what mean when say that will forget castle richmond herbert bethought of clara desmond of woman whom have seen in cabin reflected that even at present have right to be unhappy suppose have thought of going back to ireland said mr prendergast oh none in least on whole think be right doubt family connection be great assistance to barrister there must be reason must make attorney in ireland throw business into hand at early period of life history must give eclat there if know what mean oh yes perfectly want that be kind of assistance in opinion man must not desire in first place doe not last man so bouyed up be apt to trust to such support instead of own steady exertion firmest of friend wo stick to lawyer long if can get better law for money elsewhere there must be friendship in such matter think well wo say that friendship must come of service not service of friendship good hard steady enduring work work doe not demand immediate acknowledgment reward that can afford to look forward for result be that that only in opinion will insure to man permanent success be hard though for poor man to work so many year without income said herbert thinking of lady clara desmond not hard if get price of work at last can have choice moderate fixed income can now be have by barrister early in life by barrister of fair part sound acquirement there be more barrister now filling salaried place than practising in court place be given by favour no not so generally if by favour by sort of favour be a likely to come to a to such place be not given to incompetent young men because father mother ask for wo fill glass be doing very well thank will do better if will fill glass let have bottle back be thinking of good old historical day when talk of barrister having to wait for income there have be great change in respect for better a of course will think now day man be taken away from boat racing skittle ground to be made judge little law great fund of physical strength be extent of demand mr prendergast plainly showed by tone of voice that did not admire wisdom of new policy of spoke suppose man must work five year before can earn anything said herbert still despondingly for five year be long time to expectant lover fifteen year of unpaid labour used not to be thought too great price to pay for ultimate success said mr prendergast almost sighing at degeneracy of age men in day be ambitious patient now be ambitious impatient suggested herbert covetous impatient might perhaps be truer epithet said mr prendergast with grim sarcasm be sad for man to feel when know that be fast going down hill of life that experience of old age be to be no longer valued wisdom appreciated elderly man of day think that have be robbed of chance in life when be in full physical vigour be not old enough for mental success be still winning spur at forty at fifty so doe world change learns that be past work by unconscious unlucky leap have passed from unripeness of youth to decay of age without even knowing what be to be in prime man must always seize opportunity change of time in have lived have never allowed to have one there have be period of flood in tide might lead on to fortune while have be waiting patiently for high water ebb have come upon mr prendergast have be successful man regret therefore be philosophical rather than practical a for herbert did not look upon question at in same light a elderly friend on whole be rather exhilarated by tone of mr prendergast sarcasm perhaps mr prendergast have intended that such must be effect long evening passed away cosily enough leaving on herbert mind impression that in choosing to be barrister have certainly chosen noblest walk of life in man must earn bread mr prendergast did not promise fame fortune did speak by mean in high enthusiastic language said much of necessity of long hour of tedious work of amaryllis left by in shade of neaera lock unheeded nevertheless spoke in manner to arouse ambition satisfy longing of young man who listened to there be much wisdom in what did much benevolence also then at about eleven o'clock herbert having sat out second bottle of claret betook to bed at lodging over covered way chapter xxxvi how earl be won be not quite at first that countess must explain to son how now wished that owen fitzgerald might become son in law have be so steadfast in opposition to owen when earl have last spoken of matter have said so much of wickedly dissipated life owen be leading that feared to shock boy by degree brought matter round speaking of owen great good fortune pointing out how much better be suited for rich than for poverty insisting warmly on good quality high feeling then saying at last a be without thought poor clara have be unfortunate for at one time loved fitzgerald much better than will ever love cousin herbert do think so mother be sure of truth be patrick understand sister indeed be hard to do so have also always have inward fear

occasioned by very catastrophe now following friend word like parrot declared to be so very sad now be in dining room in owen usually lived be standing on rug a two men always do stand when first get into room together be clear to see that of knew how to break at once into sort of loving genial talk be longing to have with other be so easy to speak when one have little nothing to say often so difficult when there be much that must be said same paradox be equally true of writing then owen walked away to window looking out among shrub into aby mollett have be precipitated a though must

can not live in country have not said one word of state of thing in life history of country side be so full have spoken of herbert have not alluded to herbert fall have spoken of such hope a still might have with reference to clara desmond did not make slightest reference to change in fortune in fortune in of rival might have so strong bias on hope ought so to have in mind of worldly prudent people be to speak of specially lord desmond have come thither then if opportunity must offer to lead away subject to other one now owen have begun at wrong end if called upon to speak about sister at once what must brother say except be engaged to herbert fitzgerald tell desmond whom doe sister love said owen speaking almost fiercely in earnestness know so much of at rate that may be feeling will not lie to thereby communicating to young lord accusation very well understood against truth of countess mother when have spoken to about declares that be engaged to herbert fitzgerald engaged to yes know that doubt that have be dinned into ear now for last six month till be impossible to doubt will marry too if one interferes to prevent doubt that desmond be not question have asked did love then be ordered by mother to abandon love to give heart to that in word have be obedient know well what doubt be that have in truth be able so to chuck heart about like shuttlecock can only say that be not able to do how be earl to answer very line of argument owen mind be taking be exactly that young lord desired to promote too be desirous that clara must go back to first love thought strongly that owen be man more fitted than herbert for worshipful adoration of such girl a sister clara then desmond have opposed match while owen be poor how be to frame word by might encourage now that owen be rich have be so little with hardly know said owen well be so difficult for to talk to about be why yes know have always liked always chap be ever such friend to a have be squeezed be arm with strong boyish love know about said owen well then happened about clara be young then know be now sixteen have not thought anything about idea of clara falling in love have never occurred to boy be so blind know when did happen remember day old fellow when met down at gate remember said owen must remember a thought when eternity must have passed over head told then what thought think be particular fellow about money rank that sort of thing be a poor a church mouse so will always remain for care about for one sister owen never have sister have never said hardly thinking of question one be obliged to think of such thing for must go to rack ruin whole family of box dice a indeed have pretty well already if of did not begin to look about suppose will ever marry have family must afford know in case clara son must be earl of desmond if died must be countess of desmond in own right young lord looked personification of family prudence know said owen suppose be thinking of what a regard be sure never did looking to that must never have done for to marry man a poor a be be not comfortable thing to be very poor nobleman can tell owen again remained silent wanted to talk earl over into favouring view wanted to do so a owen of hap house not a owen of castle richmond perceived at once from tone of boy voice even from word that there be longer anything to be feared from brother opposition perceiving thought that mother opposition might now perhaps also be removed be quite manifest that have come from what be supposed to be altered position man a poor a be lord desmond have said urging that though now marriage might be well enough in former day must have be line of argument be very clear a owen be a poor a ever intended to remain so there be nothing in to comfort can not say that have so much worldly wisdom a have said at last with something like sneer ah be just what knew must say think that be coming to now offering to make up matter between clara because be rich can make up matter between clara said owen eagerly well know countess seems to think might be so then again owen be silent walking about room with hand behind back then after one thing of world eye regarded a desirable be within reach have then be right in supposing that face have once looked up to so full of love have be true reflex of girl heart that have indicated to love be not changeable be true that clara having accepted suitor at mother order might now be allowed to come back to a thought of wondered at endurance obedience of woman heart must thus give up that held a sacred at instance of even though be little flattering to clara by mean lessened transport felt have have that pride in that have never ceased to believe that loved full of thought of have not dared to speak have gone about gloomily miserable since news of engagement with herbert have reached now learned a thought with certainty that belief have be well grounded through have passed clara desmond did love still a to overture of reconciliation be now made to how be to accept reject be made to because be believed to be sir owen fitzgerald of castle richmond baronet of twelve thousand year instead of poor squire whose wife must have to look narrowly to kitchen in order food in sufficiency might be forthcoming for parlour that must become sir owen thought probable that must be sir owen of hap house not of castle richmond have firmly resolved have thought of for long hour hour together felt that must never again be happy be to put foot into house a owner tenant must scorn servant must hate neighbour must condemn must be a nothing to hatred of to own scorn own condemnation yet how great be temptation to now if must consent to call master of castle richmond clara hand might still be so thought who know clara desmond better than did will know how false be hope be hardly girl to have gone back to lover when be rich whom have rejected when be poor desmond said come here sit down sat leaning on table together with arm touching understand now think remember boy that whomever may blame blame that be true honest be sure indeed there be only one person whom do blame did not say that one person be countess earl knew just a well a though have be told understand now repeated before go further must tell one thing will never be owner of castle richmond why thought be settled said earl looking up with surprise nothing at be settled to bargain there must be two party have never yet become party to bargain will make owner of castle richmond be not yours of right know what call right right of inheritance said earl who having succeeded to own rank by strength of same right enduring through many age looked upon a one substantial palladium of country look here old fellow will tell view about sir thomas fitzgerald when married that poor lady who be still staying at castle richmond did so in face of world with full assurance that made legal wife whether case a ever occurred before know be sure of in eye of god be widow herbert fitzgerald be brought up a heir to estate can not see that can fairly be robbed of right because man have be villain title can not have suppose because law wo give property can be made over to a far a be concerned will be made over earthly consideration will induce to put hand upon for in doing so must look upon a thief scoundrel mean then that herbert will have just same a be before just same a regard estate then why have gone away can not answer for can only tell what will do dare say may take month before be settled now desmond know how stand be owen fitzgerald of hap house now a have ever be that nothing more for a to handle to name be not worth talking about be still sitting at table now sat silent not looking at other with eye fixed on wood owen have in hand pen have taken from mantelpiece unconsciously began to trace sign on polished surface before earl sat with forehead leaning on two hand thinking what be to say next felt that loved man better than ever when mother must come to hear what must say know now boy said owen looking up at last a did so there be expression about face to young earl thought that have never seen like there be gleam in eye though not of joy be so bright smile round mouth be so sweet though full of sadness how can not love said to thinking of sister now desmond go back to mother tell have sent here did not send said boy stoutly almost angrily doe not even know have come go back then to sister doe know nevertheless go back to tell what have told tell also that owen fitzgerald of hap house still love better than that world else can give indeed there be nothing else that do love except desmond tell also that be owen of hap house still nothing more owen said lad looking up at fitzgerald a glanced into boy face must see that there be that arising within breast almost prevented from speaking look desmond continued fitzgerald think that will blame because turn from call mercenary do do what think right what said just now of sister well of possibility of marriage said under idea be rich man now find that be poor man may consider that word be never spoken owen said boy again now that be before rising in breast have risen to brow cheek be telling tale plainly in eye then rose from chair turning away face walking towards window before have gone two step turned again throwing on fitzgerald breast burst out into passion of tear come old fellow what be will never do said owen own eye be full of tear also too be nearly past speaking know will think be boy fool said earl through sob a soon a must speak ca help think be dearest finest best fellow that ever lived said fitzgerald pressing with arm will tell what owen must have to morrow if be in power for by heaven there be not man so worthy of girl in world will tell so care what countess say owen come what come may will always have word then stood apart rubbing eye with arm tried to look like man who be giving pledge from judgment not from impulse depends on desmond whom doe love see alone desmond talk softly to find out that said thoughtfully for in mind love must still be lord of by heaven if be know whom must love said brother must not have a gift if did not love said owen proudly if do have right to claim a own then parted earl rode back home with quieter pace than have brought there in different mood have pledged now to owen not to owen of castle richmond to owen of hap house intended to redeem pledge if be possible have be so conquered by nobleness of friend that have forgotten solicitude for family sister chapter xxxvii tale of turbot must have be owen fitzgerald desire to disclaim inheritance chance have put in way in absolute silence have course be possible to indeed not being very well conversant with matter of business have thought for while that might be done at rate something not far different from to who have hitherto spoken to upon subject to mr prendergast mr somers cousin have disclaimed inheritance that have thought must have sufficed that sir thomas must die so quickly after discovery have not of course be expected by anybody much therefore have not be thought at moment of disclaimer at moment indeed afterwards when sir thomas did die even mr somers be prepared to admit that a game have be given up a branch of fitzgerald acting under advice of friend lawyer admitted that property must go from even much a contested within own breast propriety of mr prendergast decision be fain to admit now that be be business to walk in upon property word may have spoken on impulse of moment be empty word when man becomes heir to twelve thousand year doe not give up in freak of benevolence therefore when sir thomas have be dead four five week when herbert have gone away from scene be longer one of interest to be necessary that something must be done during last two three day of life sir thomas have executed new will in admitted that son be not heir to estate so disposed of such money a be in power to leave a must have done have herbert be younger son early in life have added something to property two three hundred year also left of course to own family such having be done there must have be opposition made to owen have immediately claimed inheritance a made claim took step whatever a appeared by by letter by lawyer by agent a rumour ever got about a to what intended to do mr somers found necessary to write to did on day of herbert departure merely asking perhaps with scant courtesy who be man of business in order that mr somers a agent to late proprietor might confer with with scant courtesy for mr somers have made one visit to hap house since news have be known with intention of ingratiating with future heir tender have not be graciously received mr somers be proud man though position in life depended on income received from castle richmond estate must not make further overture so letter be somewhat of shortest merely contained request above named owen reply be sharp immediate equally short be carried back by messenger from castle richmond who have brought letter to be answer be a follows hap house thursday morning two o'clock there be other date owen probably be unaware that letter being written at two pm be not written on thursday morning dear sir have got lawyer man of business do mean to employ if can help intend to make claim to mr herbert fitzgerald property of castle richmond if be necessary must sign legal document making over to claim may have be prepared to do so at moment a have got lawyer can get arranged suppose mr prendergast have better do be dear sir faithful servant owen fitzgerald of hap house with four five line thought must be practicable for to close whole affair happened on day of herbert departure on day preceding lord desmond visit to hap house so on occasion of visit owen looked upon deed a fully done have put quite beyond own power to recede now even have so wished then came tidings to true tidings a thought that clara be still within reach if only be master of castle richmond that view of position did for moment shake will not deny be only for moment then be that have looked up at clara brother bade go back to mother sister tell owen of hap house be owen of hap house still nothing more clara desmond might be bought at price must be too costly even for such prize a be well for that so resolved for at price must have be bought mr somers when received that letter be much inclined to doubt whether might not be well to take owen at word after what just right have to estate according to eternal unalterable law of right wrong ought not to belong to herbert fitzgerald mr somers allowed wish on occasion to be father to many thought much at variance from line of thinking be customary to a man of business in ordinary mood law with be law legal claim legal claim have be life agent to hap house property instead of to of castle richmond thought so romantic must never have entered head must have scouted man a nearly maniac who must suggest to that client ought to surrender undoubted inheritance of twelve thousand year on point of feeling must have rejected a proposed crime talked much of indefeasible right of coming heir of new heir must have be a firm a rock a trenchant a sword in defence of patron claim now having in hand that short pithy letter from owen fitzgerald must not look at matter in more christian light after be not justice immutable justice better than law must not property be enough for of might not law justice make compromise let be baronet take slice of four five thousand add to hap house then if thing be well arranged might not mr somers still be agent to meditating in newly tuned romantic frame of mind mr somers sat down wrote long letter to mr prendergast enclosing short letter from owen saying that a man of business with new dash of romance must say on subject letter not having slept on road a herbert did in dublin having be conveyed with lightning rapidity for british post office have ever be remarkable especially portion of have reference to sister island be in mr prendergast pocket when herbert dined with that letter to will have to refer more specially so much at variance be mr prendergast idea from entertained by mr somers that must not even speak to herbert on subject perhaps also that other more important letter if live will read at length might also have have effect in keeping silent in truth mr somers mind that of mr prendergast did not work in harmony on subject judging of two men together by usual deed ascertained character may say that there be much more romance about mr prendergast than there be about mr somers then be general romance not one with individual object perhaps may say without injury to mr somers that be true feeling not false one mr prendergast also be much more anxious for welfare of herbert fitzgerald than of cousin then must feel on behalf of man for whom be interested that did not behove to take present of estate from hand of true owner for more than week mr somers waited got reply to letter heard nothing from mr prendergast during time be really puzzled a to what must do a regarded did not know at what moment income might end how long family might be allowed to inhabit house now held then must take step a to tenant must neither receive money pay away be altogether at wit end lady fitzgerald looked to for counsel in everything did not know how to counsel arrangement be to be made for auction in house a soon a must be able to move must not be thousand pity to sell furniture if there be prospect of family returning so waited for mr prendergast letter with uneasy heart vexation of spirit still attended relief committee worked at soup kitchen attached to estate a though be still agent to castle richmond still debated warmly with father barney on one side mr townsend on other on vexatious question of out door relief now famine be in full swing strange to say men have ceased to be uncomfortable about such men be a mr somers mr townsend cutting off of maimed limb wrenching out from socket of smashed bone be by mean shocking to skilled practitioner dying pauper with drag in face that certain sign of coming death of have spoken no longer struck men to heart like skilled surgeon worked hard enough at what good must do worked better in must treat case without express compassion for individual met eye in administering relief one may rob five unseen sufferer of what must keep in life if one be moved to bestow be comfortable on one sufferer be seen be wise to spend money in alleviating last hour of whose doom be already spoken money if duly used might save life of others not yet so far gone in misery so in one sense who be best in county who worked hardest for poor spent time most completely among became hardest of heart most obdurate in denial be strange to see devoted woman neglecting want of dying so that might husband strength time mean for want of who might still be kept among living at time there came over to parish of drumbarrow young english clergyman who might be said to be in many respect very opposite to mr townsend two men must hardly be found in same profession more opposite in idea life purpose pursuit with similarity however that be sincere on whole honest man rev mr carter be much junior being at time under thirty have now visited ireland with sole object of working among poor distributing according to own judgment certain fund have be collected for purpose in england indeed there did often exist in england at time misapprehension a to irish want led to misuse of fund england so liberally sent came at time to be duty of certain public officer to inquire into charge made against seemingly respectable man in far west of ireland purporting that have appropriated to own use sum of twelve pound sent to for relief of poor of parish have be sent by three english maiden lady to relieving officer of parish of kilcoutymorrow have come to hand then filling position so charge said unfortunately said so with only too much truth have put twelve pound into own private pocket officer duty in matter took to chairman of relief committee stanch old roman catholic gentleman nearly eighty year of age with hoary head white beard milesian name have come down to through century of catholic ancestor man urbane in manner of old school irishman such a one doe meet still here there through country now not often one who above thing be true to old religion then officer of government told story to old irish gentleman with many word for there be manner of small collateral proof to of old irish gentleman listened with courtesy patience be admirable when officer of government have done old irish gentleman thus replied neighbour hobbs such be culprit name have undoubtedly done thing have certainly spent upon own us generous offering made to poor parish by noble minded lady three miss walker have acted with perfect honesty in matter said government officer robbing poor at time a robbery at dear sir said good old irish gentleman with blandest of possible smile excellent miss walker sent money for protestant poor of parish of kilcoutymorrow mr hobbs be only protestant within from twinkle in old man eye be clear to see that triumph consisted in not only have one protestant in parish that protestant must have learned so little from religion be episode nowadays episode be allowed now mr carter have come over to see that if possible certain english fund be distributed according to wish of generous english heart by whom have be sent for a english such a three miss walker feared on one hand that babylonish woman so rampant in ireland might swallow up money for babylonish purpose so on other hand did others dread that too stanch protestantism of church militant in country might expend fund collected for undoubted bodily want in administering to supposed want of soul such fault did in truth at time prevail indomitable force of famine have absolutely knocked down there have be thing done in ireland before famine came upon gave reasonable suspicion for such fear mr townsend among others have be very active in soliciting aid from england hence have arisen correspondence between mr carter now mr carter have arrived at drumbarrow with respectable sum to credit at provincial bank intense desire to make useful in time of sore need mr carter be tall thin austere looking man one seemingly who have macerated inwardly outwardly by hard living have high narrow forehead sparse amount of animal development thin lip piercing sharp gray eye be man too of few word must have be altogether harsh in appearance have there not be that in twinkle of eye seemed to say that in spite of that gait said to contrary cockle of heart might yet be reached by play of wit if only wit be to taste mr carter be man of personal mean so that not only be not dependent on profession be able a also be willing to aid profession by liberality in one thing only be personally expensive a to eating drinking be might have be for solicitude of own little more than bread water a for comfort of home have none for since ordination mission have ever be migrating always dressed with care consequently with expense for careful dressing be ever expensive always wore new black glove very long black coat never degenerated to rust black cloth trouser high black silk waistcoat new black hat everything about be black except neck be always scrupulously white mr carter be good man one may say very good man for gave up money to carry out high view of charity religion in be sincere with sincerity of whole heart from looked for reward save such a godly ever seek yet there be about too much of pharisee be greatly inclined to condemn other men to think none righteous who differed from now have come to ireland with certain conviction that clergy of own church there be men not to be trusted that be mere irish little better in habit doctrine than under bred dissenter have be elsewhere in country before visited drumbarrow have shown too plainly then mr carter be very young man be not perhaps fair to expect zeal discretion also from who be very young mr townsend have heard of be in dismay when found that be to stay with at drumbarrow parsonage for three day if mr carter did not like clerical character of stamp neither did like of stamp of mr carter have heard of of austerity of look of habit in heart believed to be jesuit have possessed full sway in parish of drumbarrow body must have be saved at such terrible peril to soul of whole parish mr carter came with such recommendation with such assurance of money given to be given of service done to be done that there be refusing so husband more worldly wise than wife have invited jesuit to parsonage will find aeneas will have mass in room in morning instead of coming to family prayer said wife what on earth will give for dinner said husband whose soul at present moment be among flesh pot indeed mr townsend have also turned over question in prudent mind will not eat meat in lent may be sure said mr townsend remembering that be present period of year if must there be none for to eat said mr townsend calling to mind way in larder have of late be emptied protestant clergyman in ireland in day have very frequently other reason for fasting than prescribed by ecclesiastical canon well nurtured lady wife of parish rector in county cork showed larder one day about time contained two large loaf of bread pan full of stuff must have called paste called porridge be that have for husband child charity servant have left before came to pas be well nurtured handsome educated woman born to such comfort a enjoy day oh reader perhaps without much giving of thanks for poor lady struggle be too much for died under mr townsend be a have said very opposite to mr carter also be man who must do without comfort of life if comfort of life did not come readily in way liked glass of whisky punch dearly have idea that be good for not caring much about personal debt must go in debt for whisky if whisky credit be at end loss did not make miserable be man with large appetite who took great advantage of good dinner when be before nay must go long distance to insure good dinner nevertheless must leave without mean of getting mutton chop then not be unhappy now mr carter must have be very unhappy have be left without superfine long black coat in tendering invitation to mr carter mr townsend have explained that with re angusta domi be always prevailing disease have be heightened by circumstance of time that of such crust cup a have brother english clergyman must be made most welcome to partake in answer to mr carter have explained that in day good men thought little of crust cup that a regarded nature have so made that have few concupiscence of sort then having be so far explained settled mr carter came first day two clergyman spent together at berryhill found plenty to employ be now like enough to be in want of fund at berryhill soup kitchen seeing that great fount of supply house namely of castle richmond must soon have stopped running altogether mr carter be ready to provide fund to moderate extent if question be answered satisfactorily there be to be making of protestant said by giving away of soup purchased with money mr townsend thought that might have be spared regret to say replied with touch of sarcasm that have time for now so better said mr carter with sarcasm of blunter sort so better let not clog alms with impossible condition will only create falsehood condition be out of question when one have to feed whole parish answered mr townsend then mr carter must teach how to boil yellow meal on subject have theory totally opposite to practice of woman employed at soup kitchen av war to hocus that yer riverence said mr daly turning to mr townsend crathurs must ate bit of must bile at at not like try woman said mr carter when have uttered receipt oracularly for third time 'deed ' wo said mr daly whose presence there be pretty nearly labour of love who be therefore independent 'd be sin ' shame to spile christian vittels in time ' wo do then there be hard work day though mr townsend kept temper with visitor seeing that have much to get nothing to give did not on occasion learn to alter general opinion of brother of english high church then when got home very hungry after toil mr townsend made apology for poorness of table be almost ashamed said to ask english gentleman to sit down to such dinner a mr townsend will put before indeed then be much said mr townsend just bit of fish found going road dear madam anything will suffice said mr carter somewhat pretentiously anything must have sufficed have put before mess of paste of have spoken must have ate said nothing ate enough of at least to sustain till morrow thing have not come to so bad pas a at drumbarrow parsonage indeed day fortune have be propitious fortune ever favour daring mr townsend knowing that have really nothing in house have sent jerry to waylay lent fishmonger who twice week be known to make way from kanturk to mallow with donkey pannier jerry have returned with prize now sat down to dinner lo behold to great surprise of mr

against mr townsend immediately exclaimed angrily goodness have cut off fin said holding up hand in deep dismay according to philosophy if did have turbot why must not have with perfection about fin dear aeneas said mr townsend looking at with agony of domestic distress wife so well know how to assume mr carter said nothing said not word thought much then be pretended poorness of living with mock humility false irishman must not resist opportunity of showing off before english stranger of putting on table before dish english dean must afford only on gala day then clergyman who be so loudly anxious for poor must not repress sorrow of heart because rich delicacy be somewhat marred in cooking be too bad thought mr carter to too bad none thank said drawing up with gloomy reprobation of countenance will not take fish be much obliged to then face of mr townsend be one on christian heathen must have looked without horror grief what man whom in heart believed to be jesuit for whom nevertheless jesuit though be have condescended to cater with woman wit man say must not eat fish in lent be horrible to warm irish heart to think that after fish now upon table there be nothing to

riding home have seemed feasible enough must tell how nobly owen be going to behave to herbert must put to whether a intended willingly to abandon estate ought not to be put into possession of wife there be romantic justice about thought must touch clara heart on following morning when came to think what word must use for making little proposition picture did not seem to to be so beautiful if

understand a sure a be living girl will give back castle richmond to herbert fitzgerald recovered leaving brother arm walked away to window from thence looked down to path beneath elm be spot in world thought of oftenest a gazed there be lack of loyalty in heart to man to whom be betrothed seemed to a though childish day have be in life a though owen have be lover in world sweet childish innocent happy world remembered well be now dissevered from by impassable gulf thought of few word of love so few that remembered word that have then spoken thought of with singular mixture of pain pleasure now heard of noble self denial with thrill be in degree enhanced by fact that even herbert be to be gainer by rejoiced at nobility merely because be joy to to know that be so noble yet through be true to herbert work day world have come upon in womanhood a came have learned to love man of stamp with love be quieter more subdued perhaps a thought more enduring might be herbert lot in life that lot must share love for owen must never be more to than dream did send to said at last without turning face away from window yes then did did send to told to say that a owen of hap house loved still promised to do bidding promised moreover that a far a good word must go with must have now know if care for pleasure in matter will take owen let herbert have property by jove if be treated in way can not complain patrick said returning to again laying hand on must now take message also must go to bid come here may see who owen yes owen fitzgerald very well have objection in life earl thought that

desmond left in evening clara told mother owen fitzgerald be to be here to morrow said owen fitzgerald be said countess hardly knew how to bear how to interfere so a to assist own object how not to interfere lest must mar mamma patrick saw other day think be better must see also very well dear must be aware clara that have be so very wish to say headstrong exactly so very entetee about own affair hardly know how to speak of if brother be in confidence will be satisfied be in confidence so may be also mamma if please countess thought better not to have conversation forced upon at moment so asked daughter for further show of confidence then must probably be a well that owen must come plead own cause owen did come night on next morning poor girl remained alone in state of terrible doubt have sent for old lover thinking at moment that one must explain to in language so clear a own what be fixed resolve have too be so moved by splendour of offer that longed to tell what thought of grandeur of offer be enhanced tenfold in mind by fact that have be so framed a to include in comparative poverty with owen be prepared to rest contented have known that be not to be bought by wealth have given credit for nobility be akin to own yet now that moment be coming how be to talk to how be to speak word must rob of hope tell that did not must not never must posse that one treasure desired more than house land station rank ala ala if must have be otherwise if must have be otherwise also be in love with poverty at rate one must accuse now of sacrificing poor lover for rich one herbert fitzgerald must be poor enough then came have hitherto met once since afternoon now so long ago afternoon to looked back a to former world that meeting have be in very room in be now prepared to receive feeling towards have be very different then then have almost forced upon for month previously have heard nothing of what be evil have come complaining loudly heart have be somewhat hardened against now be there at bidding heart very soul be full of tenderness rose rapidly sat down again then again rose a heard footstep when entered room be standing in middle of clara said taking hand mechanically held out have come here now at brother request name sounded so sweet upon lip idea occurred to that ought to be angry with for using angry with must be possible that must ever be angry with that ever have be so yes said patrick said something to made think that must be better that must meet well yes be better if people be honest have always better say to other face that have to say mean to be honest mr fitzgerald yes be sure do so do also if be so why can not say to other that have to say tale will be very short one will be true if be short mr fitzgerald well clara will not sit down sat upon sofa drew chair for near to be too impetuous to remain seated on long during interview between be sometimes standing sometimes walking quickly about room then for moment must sit down lean down over on sofa arm mr fitzgerald be tale that wish to hear well will listen to did not listen for before have spoken dozen word have interrupted poured out upon own wild plan generous scheme poor girl have thought to tell that loved herbert herbert only a lover that if must love owen a brother friend love must so willingly give then must have gone on to say how impossible must have be for herbert under circumstance to have availed of such generosity a have be offered eloquence be cut short in bud how must speak with storm of impulse raging before a be now strong within owen fitzgerald bosom interrupted before have spoken dozen word in order that might exhibit before eye project with bosom be filled did standing for most part before looking down upon a sat beneath with eye fixed upon floor while be riveted on down turned face knew before that have to say to must hardly have understood from word be so rapid vehement yet be tender too spoken in loving tone containing ever anon assurance of respect resolve to be guided now for ever by wish even though wish must be utterly subversive of happiness now know said at last a for cousin property be safe enough earthly consideration must induce to put hand upon seeing that by justice be in hardly yet quite understood let have what luck may in other respect will still be master of castle richmond if be that that wanted a know be not that can not give can not tell with what scorn must regard if be to take advantage of such accident a to rob man of estate brother have be right so clara felt when declared that owen fitzgerald be finest fellow ever have come across made such declaration within own heart only with word be more natural to be noblest gentleman of whom have ever heard read thought continued owen a will not interfere with in must be must interfere with in must be mine clara only estate that claim be heart that estate must not give on at rate be fixed must not barter about from one to other a make weight counterpoise pleading be in vain generosity must fail in securing to one reward that desired now have to tell so brother seems to think continued that still now be turn to interrupt patrick be mistaken said with eye still fixed upon ground what will tell then that be utterly indifferent to did not say so now got up took hold of arm looked into face imploringly did not say so oh mr fitzgerald be kind to be forbearing with be good to almost embraced arm a appealed to with eye swimming with tear good to said strong passion came upon urging to throw arm round slender body press to

park earl when spoke of afterwards to mother said that owen face have be a be thundercloud chapter xxxix fox hunting in spinny lane think will be acknowledged that mr prendergast have said word throughout conversation recorded in late chapter a having taken place between herbert fitzgerald over wine must lead herbert to think possible that might yet recover lost inheritance nevertheless during whole of evening held in pocket letter received by only that afternoon did encourage to think that event might at rate be possible indeed held in pocket two letter having tendency to same effect will have nothing now to say a to letter from mr somers of have spoken before must be understood up to time certain inquiry have be going on with reference to life of mr matthew mollett that inquiry be being made by agent employed by mr prendergast have found that mollett identity with talbot have be so fully proved a to make in opinion absolutely necessary that herbert mother must openly give up castle richmond nevertheless without hope in obedience solely to what felt that prudence demanded in so momentous matter did prosecute manner of inquiry prosecuted altogether in vain now o

name rank old friend son to estate fortune nevertheless knew that be worth inquiry aby mollett have be kicked out of hap house in manner must have be mortifying to feeling mr prendergast have seen that must therefore do anything in power to injure owen fitzgerald mr prendergast be quite sure that be viler wretch even than father mr prendergast suspected having be led to think so by word have fallen from sir thomas being further confirmed in opinion by letter now in hand be not therefore led into strong opinion that new tidings be of value indeed be prone to disbelieve because ran counter to conviction have already be made in own heart have be extensively acted on by nevertheless resolved that even aby letter deserved attention that must receive that attention early on following morning thus have sat for three hour after dinner chatting comfortably with young friend holding letter in pocket have shown to herbert spoken of must have utterly disturbed equilibrium of embryo law student rendered entrance in mr die chamber absolutely futile ten will not be too early for have said mr die be always in room by hour herbert have of course declared that ten must not be at too early for mr prendergast have observed that after leaving mr die chamber must go on to city might have said beyond city for intended expedition be to spinny lane at st botolph in east when herbert be gone sat musing over fire with aby letter still in hand lawyer have always sort of affection for scoundrel such affection a hunting man have for fox love to watch skill dodge of animal to study wile by life to circumvent by wile of own still more wily be glory to run beast down then must not for world run down except in conformity with certain law fixed by old custom for guidance of men in such sport two legged vermin be adapted for pursuit a be fox with four leg be unclean animal leaving scent upon trail nose of acute law hound can pick up over almost ground more wily beast be longer can run more trouble can give in pursuit longer can stand up before pack of legal hound better doe forensic sportsman love value there be fox of so excellent nature so keen in dodge so perfect in cunning so skilful in evasion that sportsman can not find in heart to push to destruction unless field be very large so that many eye be looking on feeling be think same with lawyer mr prendergast have always felt tenderness towards molletts father son tenderness must by mean have prevented from sending to halter have that be necessary have put so far in power much a sportsman love fox be moment to of keen enjoyment when put heavy boot on beast body expectant dog standing round demanding prey there beheads betails grand old dog say to around know well be who took that day from poulnarer through castlecor right away to drumcollogher then throw heavy carcass to hungry hound so must mr prendergast have delivered up of molletts to be devoured by dog of law did not le love tenderly while be yet running so sat with letter in hand smiling to think that father son have come to grief among smiling also at dodge by a thought most probable aby mollett be striving to injure man who have kicked raise little money for own private need there be too much earnestness in prayer for cash to leave mr prendergast in doubt a to aby trust that money must be forthcoming there must be something in dodge aby must not have have such trust lawyer felt that might perhaps be inclined to give little assistance to poor aby in soreness of need fox will not do well in country be not provided with natural food rat eat if rat be plentiful be so far good one must not begrudge occasional goose turkey even break one heart if like lamb in season fox will always run well when have come far from home seeking breakfast poor aby when have be so cruelly treated by gent of appy ouse whose side in family dispute have latterly be so anxious to take have remained crouching for hour two in owen kitchen absolutely mute servant there for while felt sure that be dying in master present mood did not dare to go near with such tidings then when hound be gone place be again quiet aby gradually roused allowed to wash blood from hand face to restore to life by whisky scrap of food gradually got into car so back to kanturk hotel in south main street cork ala state there be more wretched by far than have be in hap house kitchen that father have fled be more than expected have known that other must now play separate secret game not le did complain loudly when heard that guvnor have not paid bill have left money message for how fanny have scorned upbraided ordered tom to turn out of house neck crop how have squared at tom ultimately have be turned out of house neck crop may mean by fanny father need not here to be particularly narrated with much suffering many privation such a fox in solitary wandering so often know did find way to london did moreover by mean of such wile a fox have find out something a to guvnor whereabouts secret also a to guvnor guvnor must fain have kept to have be possible then also again found for sort of home hole rather in old original gorse covert of london somewhere among jew may surmise from name of row from dated here setting to work once more with usual cunning industry for fox be very industrious once more attempted to build up slender fortune by mean of fitsjerral family grand day in must look for hand of fair emmeline be gone by still property have be too good not to leave something for might grasp properly worked by alone a said to might still yield comfortable return especially a must be able to throw over confouned old guvnor of remained at home whole of day after letter be written indeed for next three day thinking that mr prendergast must come to send for mr prendergast did one other mr prendergast took advice instead putting into hansom cab have driven to centbotollfs intheheast spinny lane st botolph in east when at last be found be not exactly sort of place that mr prendergast have expected must be known that did not allow cabman to drive up to very door indicated even to lane contented with leaving cab at st botolph church huntsman in looking after game be a wily a fox men talk at covert side at rate ought not must stand together discreetly at non running side manner of wile silence discretion be necessary though too often broken through by uninstructed much to own discomfort so in hunting fox mr prendergast did not dash up loudly into covert discreetly left cab at church of st botolph spinny lane when at last found by intelligence given to at baker never in such unknown region ask lad in street for invariably will accompany talking of whereabouts very loudly so that people stare at ask other what can possibly be business in part spinny lane say be not sort of locality that have expected knew look of half protected half condemned alsatia of present day rascal spinny lane did not at bear character be street of small new tenement built a yet only on one side of way with pavement only one third finished stone in road a yet unbroken untrodden of such street there be thousand now round london be to be found in suburb creating wonder in thoughtful mind a to who can be ten of thousand of occupant house be little too good for artisan too small too silent to be abode of various lodger too mean for clerk who live on salary be a dull looking a lethe dull silent dingy repulsive be not discreditable in appearance never have mohawk look by unknown sympathy in brick mortar attache to residence of professional ruffian number seven found to be a quiet decent house a in row having inspected from little distance walked up briskly to door rang bell walked up briskly in order that advance might not be seen unless indeed a began to think not impossible aby statement be altogether hoax doe woman named mr mary swan live here asked of decent looking young woman of seven eight twenty who opened door for be decent looking poverty stricken wan with work care with heaviness about perpetual sorrow always give otherwise must not have be ill featured even a be be feminine soft in gait manner doe mr mary swan live here asked mr prendergast in mild voice at once said mr mary swan did live there stood with door in hand by mean fully opened a though did not wish to ask to enter yet there be nothing in tone to repel mr prendergast at once felt that be on right scent that behoved at rate to make way into house for if ever modest looking daughter be like immodest looking father that young woman be like mr mollett senior then will see if please said mr prendergast entering passage without invitation not that pushed in with roughness receded before authority of tone obeyed command read in eye poor young woman hesitated a though have be intention to declare that mr swan be not within if so have not strength to carry out purpose for in next moment mr prendergast found in presence of woman have come to seek mr mary swan said mr prendergast asking question a to identity yes sir be name said sickly looking elderly woman rising from chair room in two have be sitting be very poor nevertheless be neat arranged with attention to appearance be not carpeted there be piece of drugget three yard long spread before fireplace wall have be papered from time to time with scrap of different coloured paper a opportunity offered table on work of two woman be lying be very old somewhat rickety be of mahogany mr mary swan herself be accommodated with high backed arm chair gave appearance of comfort to position be now spring have small very small fire in small grate on pot have be placed in hope that might be induced to boil thing did eye of mr prendergast take in fact eye took in with keenest glance be on other side of fire to on sat mr mary swan there be second arm chair standing close over fender ordinary old mahogany chair in be evident that younger woman have not be sitting place have be close to table side where needle thread be still lying arm chair be placed idly away from accommodation for work have a mr prendergast thought be recently filled by idle person woman who rose from chair a declared to be mary swan be old sickly looking nevertheless there be that about be prepossessing face be thin delicate pale not hard coarse voice be low a woman must be hand be white small clothes though very poor be neat worn a poor lady might have worn though there be in face aspect almost of terror a owned to name in stranger presence yet there be also about certain amount of female dignity made mr prendergast feel that behoved to treat not only with gentleness also with respect want to say few word to said in consequence of letter have received perhaps will allow to sit down for minute two certainly sir certainly be daughter mary swan do wish that must leave room sir mary swan a mother spoke got up prepared to depart quietly by mean by mean said mr prendergast putting hand out so a to detain must much rather that must remain a may be very likely that may assist in inquiry will know who be doubt when mention name mr mollett will have mentioned to be mr prendergast sir never did said mr swan oh said mr prendergast having ascertained that mr mollett be at rate well known at spinny lane thought that might probably have done so be at home at present believe sir said mary swan senior father be at home believe said mr prendergast turning to younger woman sir said mary swan junior be clear at rate that woman be not practised liar for must not bring on spur of moment to deny that be in house mr prendergast did not wish to be confronted at present with matthew mollett such step might might not be desirable before termination of interview at present moment thought that might probably learn more from two woman a be than must do if mollett be with have be acknowledged to that mollett be living in house that be now at home also that younger woman present before be child of mollett of mary swan elder that young woman be older than herbert fitzgerald that therefore connection between mollett mother must have be prior to marriage down in dorsetshire be sure then might still be possible that there have be no marriage between mollett mary swan if must show that have be man wife when child be born then must old friend mr die lose new pupil have letter in pocket mr swan from abraham mollett mr prendergast commenced pulling out letter in question be nothing to sir said woman almost in tone of anger know nothing about so must have supposed from respectability of appearance if may be allowed to say so nothing at sir a for that do try to keep respectable be very hard world for people to live in have be very hard to poor girl here be hard world to people to honest people too be harder still have always tried to be honest said mary swan elder be sure have permit to say madam that will find at last to be best policy at last even a far a world be concerned about letter can assure have never thought of identifying with abraham mollett mother be dead sir before ever set eye on father though tried to do then stopped suddenly honesty might be best policy nevertheless be necessary that must tell everything to stranger ah yes abraham mother be dead before be married said mr prendergast hunting fox ever so craftily fox whom knew to be lying in ambush up stair be of course possible that old mollett must slip away out of back door over wall if fox did not do sort of thing must not be worth attention be paid to mr prendergast be well on scent that sportsman want be good scent must rather not have view till run come to close continued mr prendergast be necessary must say few word to about letter abraham mother be suppose not exactly educated woman never saw sir died when be very young four year old sir son hardly seems to have have much education be own fault sir sent to school when came to though goodness know sir be short enough of mean of doing so have better opportunity than own daughter there though say who ought not to say be good scholar be sure be very good young woman too if can judge by appearance about letter be afraid husband have not be so particular in way of living a must have be what must do sir poor weak woman nothing what must do be sure did do have always kept house over head though be very humble a see sir have have morsel to eat cup to drink of when have come here be not often that have troubled many year past mother said mary swan younger gentleman wo care to know about about between father ah be just what do care to know sir father perhaps might choose obedience of woman to men to men to whom be legally bound be think most remarkable trait in human nature nothing equal instinctive loyalty of dog of course hear of gray mare of garment worn by wrong person xanthippe doubtless did live character from time to time be repeated rule think be a have said mr swan said mr prendergast must think dishonest be to worm secret out of seeing that be so truthful so respectable perhaps may be thought that mr prendergast be little late in looking at matter in light behoves to learn much of early history of husband who be now living with here whose name a take be not swan mollett maiden name probably be swan be honestly married sir in parish church at putney that young woman be honestly born be quite sure of have never doubted a be saying have come here for information about husband like to ask question off guard oh mr prendergast therefore think right to tell that for whom be concerned have wish to bear more heavily than can help upon husband if will only come forward with willingness to do can make do either willingly unwillingly what be about abraham letter sir well doe not so much signify now be sent here be sir how have learned where be mary poor woman turned to daughter truth be sir have never known anything of for twenty year of have not set eye on for more than twenty year not that know of never knew by other name than swan when be child took for aunt have known then that father be husband wife have always thought did sir how then after young fox have not be so full of craft a elder one thought mr prendergast to nevertheless still liked old fox best there be fox run so uncommonly short that can never get burst after suppose mr swan continued mr prendergast that have heard name of fitzgerald poor woman sat silent amazed after moment daughter answered mother sir must rather that must ask question good girl mother suppose must wish to protect father must not wish to answer question in court of law heaven forbid said poor woman father have behaved very badly to unfortunate lady whose friend be on behalf must learn truth have behaved badly sir to great many lady said mr swan mr mollett a may now call be aware be not that went through form of marriage with lady many year ago said mr prendergast almost severely let answer for said true wife mary go up stair ask father to come down chapter xl fox in earth mary swan younger hesitated moment before executed mother order not saying anything looking doubtfully up into mother face go dear said old woman ask father to come down be use denying none in least said mr prendergast then daughter went for ten minute lawyer old woman sat alone during time ear of former be

token of respect so walked away out of spinny lane chapter xli lobby of house of common mr prendergast a walked out of spinny lane back to st botolph church a returned thence again to bloomsbury square in cab have good deal of to think in first place must be explained that be not altogether self satisfied with manner in thing have gone that must have made almost sacrifice to recover property for herbert fitzgerald be certainly true be a true that must have omitted possible effort to discover have now discovered almost without necessity for effort nevertheless be not altogether pleased have made up mind month two ago lady fitzgerald be not lawful wife of husband have come to conclusion on a still thought sufficient evidence now be proved to have be wrong character for shrewdness discernment must be damaged great ally chum mr die chancery barrister must be down on with unmitigated sarcasm man who have be right so frequently a mr prendergast doe not like to find that be ever in wrong then have decision not have be sudden might not life of old baronet have be saved mr prendergast must not help feeling in degree a drove away to bloomsbury square nevertheless have also feeling of having achieved great triumph be with a with man who have made fortune when have declared to friend that must infallibly be ruined pique to think how wrong have be in prophecy still be very pleasant to have made one fortune when found at top of chancery lane in holborn stopped cab got out of have by time made up mind a to what must do so walked briskly down to stone building nodding to old clerk with whom be very intimate asked if must see mr die be second visit to chamber morning seeing that have be there early in day introducing herbert to new gamaliel yes mr die be in said clerk smiling so mr prendergast passed on into well known dingy temple of chancery god there remained for full hour message in meanwhile having be sent out to herbert fitzgerald begging not to leave chamber till must have seen mr die friend mr prendergast be with said clerk very nice gentleman be mr prendergast uncommon clever too seems to that never can hold own when come across mr die at end of hour herbert be summoned into sanctum there found mr die sitting in accustomed chair with body much bent nursing calf of leg be always enveloped in black well fitting close pantaloon smiling very blandly mr prendergast have in countenance not quite so sweet aspect mr die have repeated to perhaps once too often very well known motto of one by aid of professed to have steered safely through shoal of life perhaps others be motto must have loved to see inscribed over great gate of noble inn to belonged indeed few year since might have be inscribed there with much justice festina lente mr die must say to who came to in sort of hurry then when men accused of being dilatory by premeditation must say no have always recommended despatch festina must say festina by mean festina lente doctrine have at rate thriven with teacher for mr die have amassed large fortune herbert at once saw that mr prendergast be little fluttered judging from what have seen of lawyer in ireland must have said that be impossible to flutter mr prendergast in truth greatness be great only till encounter greater greatness mar apollo be terrible magnificent god till one be enabled to see seated at foot of jove great throne apollo mr prendergast though greatly in favour with old chancery jupiter have now be reminded that have also on occasion driven team too fast be nearly a indiscreet in own rash offering be very sorry to keep waiting here mr fitzgerald said mr die giving hand to young man without however rising from chair especially sorry seeing that be first day in harness friend mr prendergast think a well that must talk over together piece of business doe not seem a yet to be quite settled herbert of course declared that have be in hurry to go away be said quite ready to talk over anything to mind at moment nothing occurred more momentous than nature of agreement between mr die there be honorarium be presumed mr die must expect herbert fitzgerald have ready for occasion hardly know how to describe what have taken place morning since saw said mr prendergast whose feature told plainly that something more important than honorarium be now on tapis what have taken place said herbert whose mind now flew off to castle richmond gently gently said mr die in whole course of legal experience now have be very long experience have never come across so so singular family history a of yours mr fitzgerald when friend mr prendergast here on return from ireland first told whole of be inclined to think that have formed right just decision there can be doubt about said herbert stop moment dear sir wait moment just decision say regarding evidence of fact a conclusive be not quite so certain that might not have be little premature perhaps may be too strong word little too assured in taking fact a proved be proved said herbert will always maintain that there be ample ground to induce to recommend poor father so to regard said mr prendergast stoutly must remember that men must instantly have be at work on other side indeed one of did attempt without signal success believe said mr die father thought be quite right mr prendergast said herbert with tear forming in eye though may be possible that affair hurried to death there be alternative that must know whole at mr prendergast seemed to wince a sat in chair be sure of continued herbert have be left to villanies of two men last day must have be much le comfortable than be mother feel quite a strongly a do then mr prendergast looked a though be somewhat reassured be difficult crisis in to act said mr prendergast can only say that did so to best of poor judgment be difficult crisis in to act said mr die assenting why be brought up now asked herbert festina lente said mr die lente lente lente always lente more haste make in trying to understand other with le speed will arrive at object what be mr prendergast again demanded herbert who be now too greatly excited to care much for chancery wisdom of great barrister have anything new turned up about about molletts yes herbert something have turned up remember prendergast evidence be again incomplete upon word sir think be must be sufficient for intellectual jury in common law court said mr prendergast who sometimes behind back gave to mr die surname of cunctator jury in common law court be not always intelligent may be sure prendergast that gentleman taking up case on other side must have a much to say for client a counsel must have for yours remember have not even be to putney yet be to putney said herbert who be becoming uneasy onus probandi must lie with said mr prendergast take possession of be own till be proved to belong to others have already abandoned possession have done nothing already have taken legal step when believed having by own act put in present position think ought to be very careful before take up certainly ought to be careful do maintain that may be too punctilious a matter of course will go to putney to putney said herbert fitzgerald yes herbert now if mr die will permit will tell have happened on yesterday afternoon before came to dine with received that letter be from cousin owen fitzgerald must see that also by by be one from younger mollett man whom saw day in poor father room herbert anxiously put out hand for letter be again interrupted by mr die beg pardon mr fitzgerald for moment prendergast let see that letter again will taking hold of proceeded to read very carefully still nursing leg with left hand while held letter with right what be about said herbert appealing to prendergast almost in whisper lente lente lente dear mr fitzgerald said mr die while eye be still intent upon paper if will take advantage of experience of gray hair bald head own be a bald round a big white stone must put up with of disadvantage of momentary delay suppose now prendergast that be acting in concert with people in what do call street in spinny lane yes with father two woman there what must gain by share with might be able to get out of man must never accuse of bigamy for besides must have seen woman die seen woman tsh tsh tsh have seen enough of young old to know that clean apron humble tone down turned eye always go with true tongue honest heart woman be now most successful swindler of age profession at rate be not closed against will not find woman to be swindler at least think not ah want to be sure prendergast then mr die finished letter very leisurely a herbert thought when have finished folded up gave back to mr prendergast think what have strong prima facie case so strong that perhaps be right to explain whole matter to young friend here who be so deeply concerned in at same time must caution that matter be still enveloped in doubt herbert eagerly put out hand for letter may trust with said be not of sanguine temperament easily excited may be sure will not take for more than be worth so saying at last got hold of letter managed to read through much more quickly than mr die have done a did so became very red in face too plainly showed that have made false boast in speaking of coolness of temperament indeed stake be so high that be difficult for young man to be cool while be playing game have made up mind to lose to that have be reconciled now again pulse of heart nerve of body be disturbed be never wife said out loud when got to that part of letter real wife living now in spinny lane do believe that mr prendergast yes do said attorney lente lente lente said barrister quite oppressed by friend unprofessional abruptness do believe said mr prendergast must always understand herbert that new story may possibly not be true quite possible said mr die with something almost approaching to slight laugh evidence be so strong continued other do believe heartily have be to house seen man old mollett woman whom believe to be wife daughter who life with a far a poor judgment go made bow of deference towards barrister whose face however seemed to say that in opinion judgment of friend mr prendergast did not always go very far a far a poor judgment go woman be honest respectable man be a great villain a there be unhung unless son be greater one be now so driven into corner that truth may be more serviceable to than lie people of sort be never driven into corner said mr die may sometimes be crushed to death well believe matter be a tell there at rate be mollett assurance that be so woman have be residing in same place for year will come forward at time to prove that be married to man before ever saw before went to dorsetshire have marriage certificate a far a can learn there be one able willing to raise question against cousin owen certainly will not do so will hardly do to depend upon said mr die with sneer twelve thousand year be great provocative to litigation if doe must fight be of course step will be taken at once to get together in proper legal form evidence of description may bear on subject so must question ever be raised again whole matter may be in nutshell will find nutshell very difficult to crack in five twenty year time said mr die what must advise to do asked herbert that after be now main question be discussed between for long time till shade of evening came upon dull dingy chamber became almost dark a sat there mr die at first conceived that must be well that herbert must still stick to law what indeed must be more conducive to salutary equanimity in mind of young man so singularly circumstanced than study of blackstone of coke of chitty a long a remained there at work in chamber amusing occasionally with eloquence of neighbouring court there might be reasonable hope that must be able to keep mind equally poised so that success failure a regarded irish inheritance must affect injuriously thus at least argued mr die at point herbert seemed to have view of own said that in first place must be with mother then in next place a be now clear that be not to throw up castle richmond a must not now behove to allow one else to call master there must be duty to reassume place of master onus probandi will now rest with said repeating mr prendergast word then be ultimately successful in persuading even mr die to agree that must be better for to go to ireland than to remain in london sipping delicious honey of chancery buttercup will assume title suppose said mr die not at rate till get to castle richmond said blushing have so completely abandoned thought of being sir herbert fitzgerald that have now almost felt ashamed of saying that must so far presume a to call by name then mr prendergast went away dined together leaving mr die to complete legal work for day at must often sit till nine ten even eleven in evening without apparent ill result from such effect then go home to dinner port wine be already nearly seventy work seemed to have effect on in what medea caldron be that great lawyer so cook that be able to achieve immortality even while body still cling to soul mr die though must talk of bald head have idea of giving way to time superannuated men who think of superannuation at sixty be whose life have be idle not who have really buckled to work be opinion that nothing season mind for endurance like hard work port wine must perhaps be added be not till herbert once more found alone that fully realized new change in position have dined with mr prendergast at gentleman club have be specially called upon to enjoy drinking a be to own restoration in large glass of special claret mr prendergast assured be very extraordinary may be a satisfied a that be sitting there that be said hardly know anywhere else that will get assertion herbert be not in least inclined to dispute in first place be not quite clear what meant then other number must have suited palate a well drank tried to look a though appreciated wine here be wonderfully cheap said mr prendergast becoming confidential nevertheless have raised price of to twelve shilling will have bottle during herbert must hardly think of own fate fortune though indeed must hardly think of anything else be eager to be alone that might think be nearly broken hearted when second bottle of made appearance something however be arranged in intercalary moment between raising of glass mr prendergast said that must write to owen fitzgerald to mr somers be agreed that herbert must immediately return to castle richmond merely giving mother time to have notice of coming then at last got away started by for night walk through street of london seemed to now to be month since have arrived there in truth be only on yesterday that have got out of train at euston station have come up looking forward to live in london life now london life be over unless indeed other hope must come back to unless must appear again not a student in mr die chamber a one of council of legislature assembled to make law for governance of mr die of others be singular how greatly episode in life have humbled in own esteem six month ago have thought almost too good for castle richmond have regarded seat in parliament a only place must fitly fill without violation to nature now felt a though must hardly dare to show within wall of assembly have be so knocked about by circumstance so rudely toppled from high place have found necessary to put so completely into hand of other people that self pride have left that must in fact return might be held a certain lesson have learned must not altogether be thrown away upon at moment a be saying felt to be completely humbled lie spoken by one of meanest of god creature have turned away from pursuit broken hope now word from man be to restore if only that other word must not appear to be greater lie then that there must be such question a to mother name fame a to very name by must now be called that must depend on amount of infamy of wretch have be guilty whether woman whom in world most honoured be entitled to share of respect from world around that be entitled to respect of good men let truth in matter be where might herbert knew who heard story must acknowledge respect be of two sort outer respect of world can not be parted with conveniently did acknowledge to be humbled man more so than have ever yet done have be like to do while conscious of loss have fallen on be at moment when began to perceive that fortune must return to when became aware that be knocked about like shuttlecock from battledore that pride came by first fall mollett be in truth great man warwick who be to make unmake king of castle richmond month ago have pleased earl mollett to say that owen fitzgerald must reign there have be turn upon card now king herbert be to be again installed walked down alone through st james street by pall mall charing cross feeling rather than thinking of doubt of mr die did not trouble much fully believed that must regain title property rather that must never lose thought that must never show about country again a have done before be known in spite of good fortune be sad at heart little conscious of good that must do went on by horse guard treasury chamber into parliament street so up to new house of parliament sauntered into westminster hall there at privileged door between lamp on left hand saw busy men going in out slow dignified others hot hasty anxious felt a though region to from passed must be far out of reach must aspire to pas august lamp post whose very name depended on what in truth might have be early doings of low scoundrel who be now skulking from law then went on mounting by public stair anteroom

prendergast be able to prove mr matthew mollett now of spinny lane mr matthew mollett then designated a of newmarket in cambridgeshire be one same person therefore mr mollett marriage with miss wainwright be marriage therefore also marriage between sir thomas fitzgerald that lady be true marriage thing will now be plain to novel reading capacity mean a such capacity may be in respect to legal law have only further to tell in respect to part of story that molletts father son escaped punishment for fraud villanies related in page except such punishment a fraud villanies acting by own innate destructive force poison brought down upon unfortunate head for so allowing to escape will be held by many to have be deficient in sound teaching what men will say not punish evil principle

softened hoping also for younger one ministering angel may be appointed also for aid 't be grievous piece of work though of ministering angel to soul a now having seen so far on mortal career will take leave of of mr prendergast object in sparing be of course that of saving lady fitzgerald from terrible pain of having name brought forward at trial never spoke of even to herbert allowing in whom trusted to manage thing for without expression of anxiety on own part be not le thankful when found that public notice be to be taken of matter very shortly after herbert return to castle richmond be notified to that need have fear a to inheritance be so notified with great additional comfort of assuring opinion from mr die then openly called sir herbert took upon property became by right of entail issued order for preparation of marriage settlement during period saw owen fitzgerald did so in presence of mr somers not word be then said about lady clara desmond gentleman herbert mr somers cordially thanked master of hap house for way in have behaved to castle richmond family in reference to castle richmond property during terrible event of last two month owen took thanks somewhat haughtily shook hand warmly enough with cousin wishing joy on arrangement of affair be at first le distant than usual with mr somers when alluded to own conduct expressed gratitude declared that have done nothing for thanks be due that begged to be understood that laid claim to gratitude have acted otherwise said must have deserved to be kicked out of presence of honest men to be thanked for ordinary conduct of gentleman be almost insult said looking chiefly at mr somers then turning to cousin asked if intended to remain in country oh certainly said herbert will not said owen if know one who will take lease of hap house for ten twelve year will be glad to find tenant where be going to africa in first instance said there seems to be good hunting there think that will try new tidings be not long in reaching desmond court countess be alone when first heard with very great difficulty taking a be bit between teeth clara have managed to get over to castle richmond that might pay last visit to fitzgerald girl at time lady desmond mind be in terribly distracted state rumour be rife about country owen have refused to accept property countess have of course be made aware that have so refused be too keenly awake to affair of world to suppose that refusal must continue long in force a knew well must herbert accept of be offered to might be that for year to come property might be unenjoyed rich fruit might fall rotten from wall what must avail to to child herbert must still be nameless man must never be master of castle richmond nevertheless clara carried point went over to friend leaving countess alone have now permitted son to return to eton finding that be powerless to aid young earl be quite willing that sister must marry owen fitzgerald be not willing to use power of persuasion that might have in what mother considered useful legitimate manner talked of rewarding owen for generosity clara must have nothing to do either with generosity with reward so lady desmond be left alone hearing that even owen owen have now given up quest feeling that be useless to have further hope will make own bed countess said to herself must lie on then came rumour that after herbert be to be man first reached ear about same time that herbert arrived at own house did so in such manner a to make little impression at moment lady desmond have few gossip in general way heard little of what be doing in country on occasion caleb balderston of house came in making stately bow to mistress with low voice eye wide open told what gossoon running over from castle richmond have reported in kitchen of desmond court at rate lady mr herbert be expected evening at house then caleb balderston bowing stately again left room did not make much impression made then on following day clara wrote to did after deep consideration much consultation with friend must be unkind argued to leave lady desmond in ignorance on subject therefore note be written very guardedly joint production of three in with expression of many doubt be told that perhaps after herbert might yet be man even then countess did not believe during next week rumour became fact through country everybody knew even countess of desmond that family history be again changed lady fitzgerald whom have known be lady fitzgerald still herbert be once more on throne when rumour thus became fact there be longer doubt about matter countryside did not say that perhaps after so so must go in such such way that legal doubt having be entertained gentleman of long robe be about to do that by end of first week affair be a surely settled in county cork a though line of fitzgerald have never be disturbed sir herbert be fully seated on throne be well then for poor owen that have never assumed regalia of royalty have done so fall must have be very dreadful a be not only be pang spared to achieved at once immense popularity through whole country everybody called poor owen declared how well have behaved expressed almost regret that generosity must go unrewarded others went so far a to give reward be to marry emmeline fitzgerald said at club in cork considerable slice of property be destined to give additional charm to young lady hand heart for month so owen fitzgerald be most popular man in south of ireland be a far a man can be popular who never show countess have to answer daughter letter if be so said of course will be well pleased anxiety have be only for welfare to further have be willing to make possible sacrifice clara when read did not know what sacrifice have be made have countess thought a wrote word have be sacrifice to have thus alluded though heart be ever conscious of unconsciously countess sent love to at castle richmond did not fear said that must misinterpret lady fitzgerald be sure must perfectly understand that have endeavoured to do duty by child be by mean bad letter be better be in main true letter according to light have striven to do duty conduct be not misjudged at rate at castle richmond must not think harshly of mamma said clara to future mother in law oh said lady fitzgerald certainly think harshly of in position must probably have acted a have done difference however between be that be impossible that lady fitzgerald must not sympathize with child while be almost impossible that countess of desmond must do so so lady desmond remained alone at desmond court brooding over thing a now be for present be better that clara must remain at castle richmond nothing therefore be said of return on side must not add to mother comfort at home why must not remain happy where be be already fitzgerald in heart rather than desmond be not well that must be so if must love herbert fitzgerald be well also since day on have appeared at desmond court wet dirty wretched with broken spirit fortune a draggled a dress have lost claim to be hero in estimation of lady desmond to only be hero whose pride spirit be never draggled such hero there still be in close neighbourhood lady desmond herself be woman of mercenary spirit so at least will be said thought of be not altogether so although two fact be strong against that have sold for title have be willing to sell daughter for fortune poverty have endured upon whole with patience though hated scorned from very soul must now have given in marriage to poor man without rank station countess mother of earl that must have done with romantic love of girl of sixteen though be now woman verging upon forty men woman only know so much of others a circumstance destiny have allowed to appear have

love not capacity a now within last year two have learned so much to cost long month have passed since have first owned to herself since have dared to tell that be possible even for to begin world again to play game woman love to play once at least before die must have worshipped man sat at foot endowed in heart with heroism given soft brown hair to play with when suited hercules to rest from labour must have forgotten year have forgotten too child who have now grown up to seize world from beneath foot to seize before have enjoyed must have forgotten be past have be whit a young a own

digested not altogether unsatisfactorily lady desmond have a yet be allowed slice of cake have never yet taken side in game of rounder too have looked on seen how jocund be play also have acknowledged that running in ring stout hitting of ball innocent craft that bringing back by own skill with own hand of long backed fellow must be pleasant to a well a to others if only now must be chosen in at game what if side that cared for must not have tempus edax rerum though have hardly nibbled at heart wish have be feeding on freshness of brow bloom of lip child with whom must have loved to play kept aloof from too must not pick up ball when rolled to foot if one think of be hard to bear be very hard to have have period for rounder not to be able even to look back to one game to talk of to one old comrade why then did allow to be carried off by wicked wrinkled earl with gloating eye asks of prettiest girl in world just turned eighteen oh heaven be not possible that one must have one more game

word must be duly inaudible idea that be not yet over with have come upon poor heart upon lady desmond heart soon after owen fitzgerald have made familiar in old mansion have read how idea be banished how have ultimately resolved that man whom must have loved must be given up to own child when thought that be no longer poor of low rank must not sympathize with daughter love with love rejoice with

have that other not have come to pas by word have alluded to confession have regarded delusion a monstrous thing of word be to be spoken so at least said countess to herself sitting there alone where have left regard a old worn in eye be wrinkled ugly 't be thus that thought expressed then walked across room towards mirror when there must not look in turned back upon without glance returned to seat by window what mattered now be doom to live there alone for term of life with might still please god to afflict then looking out from window eye fell upon owen a rode slowly down across park horse be walking very slowly seemed a though be unconscious of pace a long a remained in sight did not take eye from figure gazing at painfully a grew dimmer more dim in distance then at last turned behind bush near lodge felt that be alone be last that ever saw of owen fitzgerald unfortunate girl marred in thy childhood by wrinkled earl with gloating eye marred rather by thine own vanity flesh pot of egypt be not always thus bitter in eating chapter xliv conclusion now story be told be not for fashion of thing last short chapter might be spared will at rate be very short be not that eschew fashion of double name for book thinking that amount of ingenuity in respect will make bad book pas muster whereas good book will turn out a such though such ingenuity be displayed might have called tale of famine year in ireland at period of year to story have brought at will leave famine be at very worst people be beginning to believe that there must never be bit more to eat in land that time for hope energy be gone land be becoming of value only thing regarded be sufficiency of food to keep body soul together under such circumstance be difficult to hope energy without hope be impossible therefore be there such apathy deadness through country be not that did not work who be most concerned to work amount of conscientious work then done be most praiseworthy be done almost without hope of success done chiefly a matter of conscience there be feeling be not often expressed seemed to prevail everywhere that ginger must not again be hot in mouth that in very truth time for cake ale in world be over be feeling made residence in ireland at period so very sad ah how little do know what be coming to irish cake ale be done over for world thought in truth irish cake be only then baking irish ale be being brewed be not sure that good thing be yet quite fit for palate of guest not a fit a little more time will make cake be still too new cake often be ale be not sufficiently mellowed of be sure that cake ale be there ginger too very hot in mouth let committee of irish landlord say how rent be paid now what amount of arrears be due through country when famine came among rent paid to day be ginger hot in mouth best plea palate of country gentleman if one did in truth write tale of famine after that must behove author to write tale of pestilence then tale of exodus three wonderful event following other be blessing coming from omniscience omnipotence by black cloud be driven from irish firmament if one through must have dared to hope have have from first wisdom have learned to acknowledge that mercy endureth for ever then same author going on with series must give in last set ireland in prosperity of who did true good conscientious work at time none exceeded in energy friend herbert fitzgerald after return to castle richmond seemed to a though thank offering be due from for good thing providence have showered upon best thank offering that must give be devoted attention to interest of poor around mr somers soon resigned to chair at committee meeting at berryhill gortnaclough be acknowledged that castle richmond arrangement for soup kitchen out door relief labour gang might be taken a model for south of ireland few other men be able to go to work with mean so ample with hand so perfectly free mr carter even who by time have become cemented in warm trilateral friendship with father barney rev aeneas townsend be obliged to own many young english country gentleman might take lesson from sir herbert fitzgerald in duty peculiar to position marriage did not take place full six month after period to story have brought baronet with twelve thousand year can not be married off hook a may be done with ordinary mortal settlement of grandiose nature be required be duly concocted perhaps mr die have something to say to so that great maxim of law be brought into play perhaps also though of herbert heard word be thought inexpedient to hurry matter while further inquiry be possible in affair of mollett connection mr die mr prendergast be certainly going about still drawing covert far near lest fox might not have be fairly run to last earth a have said tidings a to reached castle richmond there in ireland man troubled further with doubt upon subject sir herbert took title received rent by hand of mr somers exactly a though molletts father son have never appeared in part be six month before marriage be celebrated during considerable part of time clara remained visitor at castle richmond to lady fitzgerald be now same a daughter to aunt letty same a niece by girl have for month be regarded a sister so remained in house of be to be mistress learning to know way ingratiating with who be to be dependent on have rather stay with mamma if will allow clara have said to mother when countess be making arrangement with that must return to castle richmond will be leaving altogether so soon now got up close to mother side caressingly must fain have pressed into arm kissed have talked to of what be coming a daughter love to talk to loving mother lady desmond heart be sore sad harsh preferred to be alone will be better at castle richmond dear will be much happier there of course there can be reason why must come again into gloom of prison must be with dearest mamma be better that must be with fitzgerald now a for must learn to live alone indeed have learned so need not mind for clara be rebuffed by tone rather than word still looked up into mother face wistfully go dear said countess must sooner be alone at present so clara went be hard upon that even now mother must not accept love lady desmond must not be cordial with daughter made more than one struggle to do so always failed must thought that must have watched child happiness with contentment have clara married owen fitzgerald sir owen a must then have be now must only remember that owen be lost to lost through child fault did not hate clara nay must have made sacrifice for daughter welfare must not take lovingly to bosom so shut up alone in prison a called then looked back upon error of life be a well for to look back a to look forward for what joy be there for must dare to hope in day be coming however did relax something of sternness clara be of course married from desmond court very necessity of making preparation for festivity be in salutary indeed must hardly be called festivity be so quiet sombre clara have two bridesmaid be mary emmeline fitzgerald young earl gave away sister aunt letty be there mr prendergast who have
