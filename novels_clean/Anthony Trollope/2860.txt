must further say that dowager doctor be justified in choice by life principle of young man a far a father can be justified in choosing profession for son a far a lay impropriator can be justified in making such promise have lady lufton have second son that second son must probably have have living one must have thought wrong certainly not if second son have be one a mark robarts lady lufton herself be woman who thought much on religious matter must by mean have be disposed to place one in living merely because one have be son friend tendency be high church be enabled to perceive that of young mark robarts ran in same direction be very desirous that son must make associate of clergyman by step must insure at rate that be anxious that parish vicar must be one with whom must herself fully co operate be perhaps unconsciously wishful that might in measure be subject to influence must appoint elder man might probably not be case to same extent must son have gift might probably not be case at therefore be resolved that living must be given to young robarts took degree not with brilliancy quite in manner that father desired then travelled for eight ten month with lord lufton college don almost immediately after return home be ordained living of framley be in diocese of barchester seeing what be mark hope with reference to that diocese be by mean difficult to get curacy within curacy be not allowed long to fill have not be in above twelvemonth when poor old dr stopford then vicar of framley be gathered to father full fruition of rich hope fell upon shoulder even yet more must be told of good fortune before can come to actual incident of story lady lufton who a have said thought much of clerical matter did not carry high church principle so far a to advocate celibacy for clergy on contrary have idea that man must not be good parish parson without wife so having given to favourite position in world income sufficient for gentleman want set to work to find partner in blessing here also a in other matter fell in with view of patroness not however that be declared to in marked manner in affair of living have be broached lady lufton be much too highly gifted with woman craft for never told young vicar miss monsell accompanied ladyship married daughter to framley court expressly that mark might fall in love with such be in truth case lady lufton have two child eldest daughter have be married four five year to sir george meredith miss monsell be dear friend of hers now loom before novelist great difficulty miss monsell rather mr mark robarts must be described a miss monsell tale will have to take prolonged note of yet will call fanny monsell when declare that be one of pleasantest companion must be brought near to man a future partner of home owner of heart if high principle without asperity female gentleness without weakness love of laughter without malice true loving heart can qualify woman to be parson wife then be fanny monsell qualified to fill station in person be somewhat larger than common face must have be beautiful that mouth be large hair be copious be of bright brown eye also be brown being so be distinctive feature of face for brown eye be not common be liquid large full either of tenderness of mirth mark robarts still have accustomed luck when girl a be brought to framley for wooing did woo won for mark be handsome fellow at time vicar be about twenty five year of age future mr robarts be two three year younger did come quite empty handed to vicarage can not be said that fanny monsell be heiress have be left with provision of few thousand pound be so settled that interest of wife money paid heavy insurance on life young robarts effected there be left to over above sufficient to furnish parsonage in very best style of clerical comfort to start on road of life rejoicing so much did lady lufton do for protege may well be imagined that devonshire physician sitting meditative over parlour fire looking back a men will look back on upshot of life be well contented with upshot a regarded eldest offshoot rev mark robarts vicar of framley little have a yet be said personally a to hero perhaps may not be necessary to say much let hope that by degree may come forth upon canvas showing to beholder nature of man inwardly outwardly here may suffice to say that be born heaven cherub be born fallen devil spirit such a training made such be have large capability for good aptitude also for evil quite enough quite enough to make needful that must repel temptation a temptation only can be repelled much have be done to spoil in ordinary acceptation of word be not spoiled have too much tact too much common sense to believe to be paragon mother thought self conceit be not perhaps greatest danger have possessed more of might have be le agreeable man course before might on account have be safer in person be manly tall fair haired with square forehead denoting intelligence rather than thought with clear white hand filbert nail power of dressing in manner that one must ever observe of that clothes be either good bad shabby smart such be mark robarts when at age of twenty five little more married fanny monsell marriage be celebrated in own church for miss monsell have home of own have be staying for last three month at framley court be given away by sir george meredith lady lufton saw that wedding be what must be with almost a much care a have bestowed on of own daughter deed of marrying absolute tying of knot be performed by very reverend dean of barchester esteemed friend of lady lufton mr arabin dean wife be of party though distance from barchester to framley be long road deep railway lends assistance lord lufton be there of course people protested that must surely fall in love with one of four beautiful bridesmaid of whom blanche robarts vicar second sister be by common acknowledgment by far most beautiful there be there younger sister of mark who did not officiate at ceremony though be present of whom prediction be made seeing that be then only sixteen of whom mention be made here a will come to pas that reader will know hereafter name be lucy robarts then vicar wife went off on wedding tour old curate taking care of framley soul while in due time returned after further interval in due course child be born to then after came period at will begin story before doing so may not assert that men be right in saying manner of good thing to devonshire physician in praising luck in having son be up at house to day suppose said mark to wife a sat stretching in easy chair in drawing room before fire previously to dressing for dinner be november evening have be out day on such occasion aptitude for delay in dressing be very powerful strong minded man go direct from hall door to chamber without encountering temptation of drawing room fire lady lufton be down here full of argument in favour of sarah thompson exactly so mark what did say about sarah thompson very little a coming from did hint that thought that thought that thought that one of regular trained schoolmistress must be better ladyship did not agree well wo exactly say that though think that perhaps did not be sure did not when have point to carry be very fond of carrying then mark point be generally so good see in affair of school be thinking more of protegee than doe of child tell be sure will give way then again be silent vicar having thoroughly warmed a far a might be done by facing fire turned round began operation tergo come mark be twenty minute past six will go dress will tell what fanny must have way about sarah thompson can see to morrow tell so be sure mark must not give way if thought wrong must expect if persist time will certainly have to yield next then next may probably be more important if be wrong mark did say be wrong besides if be wrong wrong in infinitesimal degree one must put up with sarah thompson be very respectable only question be whether can teach young wife though did not say so have idea that husband be in error be true that one must put up with wrong with great deal of wrong one need put up with wrong that can remedy why must vicar consent to receive incompetent teacher for parish child when be able to procure one be competent in such case so thought mr robarts to herself must have fought matter out with lady lufton on next morning however did a be bid signified to dowager that objection to sarah thompson must be withdrawn be sure must agree with said ladyship when learned what sort of person be know have only to explain then plumed feather be very gracious for to tell truth lady lufton did not like to be opposed in thing concerned parish nearly fanny said lady lufton in kindest manner be not going anywhere on saturday be think not then must come to justinia be to be here know lady meredith be named justinia mr robarts have better stay with till monday can have little book room to on meredith go on monday

nothing further before went to bed wrote note to lady lufton a husband recommended chapter ii framley set chaldicotes set will be necessary must say word two of of people named in few preceding page also of locality in lived of lady lufton enough perhaps have be written to introduce to reader framley property belonged to son a lufton park ancient ramshackle place in county have heretofore be family residence of lufton family framley court have be apportioned to for residence for life lord lufton be still unmarried a have establishment at lufton park indeed have not be inhabited since grandfather died lived with mother when suited to live anywhere in neighbourhood widow must fain have seen more of than allowed to do have shooting lodge in scotland apartment in london string of horse in leicestershire much to disgust of county gentry around who held that own hunting be a good a england must afford lordship however paid subscription to east barsetshire pack then thought at liberty to follow own pleasure a to own amusement framley be pleasant country place having about nothing of seignorial dignity grandeur possessing everything necessary for comfort of country life house be low building of two story built at different period devoid of pretension to style of architecture room though not lofty be warm comfortable garden be trim neat beyond others in county indeed be for garden only that framley court be celebrated village there be none properly speaking high road went winding about through framley paddock shrubbery wood skirted home field for mile half not two hundred yard of ran in straight line there be cross road passed down through domain whereby there came to be locality called framley cross here stood lufton arm here at framley cross hound occasionally must meet for framley wood be drawn in spite of young lord truant disposition then at cross also lived shoemaker who kept post office framley church be distant from just quarter of mile stood immediately opposite to chief entrance to framley court be mean ugly building having be erected about hundred year since when church then built be made to be mean ugly be large enough for congregation of whom be thus driven to dissenting chapel sion ebenezers have got established on side of parish in putting down lady lufton thought that pet parson be hardly a energetic a might be be therefore matter near to lady lufton heart to see new church built be urgent in eloquence with son with vicar to have good work commenced beyond church close to be boy school girl school two distinct building owed erection to lady lufton energy then came neat little grocer shop neat grocer being clerk sexton neat grocer wife pew opener in church podgens be name be great favourite with ladyship having be servant up at house here road took sudden turn to left turning a be away from framley court just beyond turn be vicarage so that there be little garden path running from back of vicarage ground into churchyard cutting podgenses off into isolated corner of own from whence to tell truth vicar must have be glad to banish cabbage must have have power to do so for have not small vineyard of be always eyesore to neighbouring potentate potentate in case have a little excuse a ahab for nothing in parsonage way must be more perfect than parsonage have detail requisite for house of moderate gentleman with moderate mean none of expensive superfluity immoderate gentleman demand demand immoderate mean then garden paddock be exactly suited to everything be in good order not exactly new so a to be raw uncovered redolent of workman just at era of existence in newness give way to comfortable homeliness other village at framley there be none at back of court up one of cross road there be small shop two there be very neat cottage residence in lived widow of former curate protege of lady lufton there be big staring brick house in present curate lived be full mile distant from church farther from framley court standing on cross road run from framley cross in direction away from mansion gentleman rev evan jones might from age have be vicar father have be for many year curate of framley though be personally disliked by lady lufton a being low church in principle unsightly in appearance nevertheless must not urge removal have two three pupil in large brick house if turned out from from curacy might find difficult to establish elsewhere on account mercy be extended to rev e jones in spite of red face awkward big foot be invited to dine at framley court with plain daughter once in three month over above there be hardly house in parish of framley outside bound of framley court except of farmer farm labourer yet parish be of large extent framley be in eastern division of county of barsetshire a world know be politically speaking a true blue county a in england there have be backsliding even here be true then in what county have there not be such backsliding where in pinchbeck day can hope to find old agricultural virtue in purity among backslider regret to say that men now reckon lord lufton not that be violent whig perhaps that be whig at jeer sneer at old county doings declares when solicited on subject that a far a be concerned mr bright may sit for county if plea alleges that being unfortunately peer have right even to interest in question be deeply regretted for in old day there be portion of county more decidedly true blue than framley district indeed up to present day dowager be able to give occasional helping hand chaldicotes be seat of nathaniel sowerby esq who at moment supposed to be now present be one of member for western division of barsetshire western division can boast none of fine political attribute grace twin brother be decidedly whig be almost governed in politics by one two great whig family have be said that mark robarts be about to pay visit to chaldicotes have be hinted that wife must have be a well pleased have not be case such be certainly fact for dear prudent excellent wife a be knew that mr sowerby be not most eligible friend in world for young clergyman knew also that there be one other house in whole county name of be so distasteful to lady lufton reason for be may say manifold in first place mr sowerby be whig be seated in parliament mainly by interest of great whig autocrat duke of omnium whose residence be more dangerous even than of mr sowerby whom lady lufton regarded a impersonation of lucifer upon earth mr sowerby too be unmarried a indeed also be lord lufton much to mother grief mr sowerby be true be fifty whereas young lord be a yet only twenty six nevertheless ladyship be becoming anxious on subject in mind man be bound to marry a soon a must maintain wife held idea quite private tenet of be imperfectly conscious that men in general be inclined to neglect duty for own selfish gratification that wicked one encouraged more innocent in neglect that many must not marry at be not unseen coercion exercised against by other sex duke of omnium be very head of such sinner lady lufton greatly feared that son might be made subject to baneful omnium influence by mean of mr sowerby chaldicotes then mr sowerby be known to be very poor man with very large estate have wasted men said much on electioneering more in gambling considerable portion of property have already gone into hand of duke who a rule bought up everything around be to be purchased indeed be said of by enemy so covetous be of barsetshire property that must lead young neighbour on to ruin in order that might get land what oh what if must come to be possessed in way of of fair acre of framley court what if must become possessed of can hardly be wondered at lady lufton must not like chaldicotes chaldicotes set a lady lufton called be in way opposed to what set must be according to idea liked cheerful quiet well to do people who loved church country queen who be not too anxious to make noise in world desired that farmer round must be able to pay rent without trouble that old woman must have warm flannel petticoat that working men must be saved from rheumatism by healthy food dry house that must be obedient to pastor master temporal a well a spiritual be idea of loving country desired also that copse must be full of pheasant stubble field of partridge gorse cover of fox in way also loved country have ardently longed during crimean war that russian might be beaten not by french to exclusion of english a have seemed to to be too much case hardly by english under dictatorship of lord palmerston indeed have have little faith in war after lord aberdeen have be expelled if indeed lord derby must have come in now a to chaldicotes set after there be nothing so very dangerous about for be in london not in country mr sowerby indulged if did indulge bachelor mal practice speaking of a set chief offender be mr harold smith perhaps wife also be member of parliament a many thought rising man father have be for many year debater in house have held high office harold in early life have intended for cabinet if working hard at trade must ensure success ought to obtain sooner later have already filled more than one subordinate station have be at treasury for month two at admiralty astonishing official mankind by diligence last named few month have be under lord aberdeen with whom have be forced to retire be younger son not possessed of large fortune politics a profession be therefore of importance to have in early life married sister of mr sowerby a lady be six seven year older than have brought with scanty dowry people thought that in matter mr harold smith have not be perspicacious mr harold smith be not personally popular man with party though judged to be eminently useful be laborious well informed on whole honest be conceited long winded pompous mr harold smith be very opposite of lord be clever bright woman good looking for time of life be now over forty with keen sense of value of worldly thing keen relish for world pleasure be neither laborious well informed perhaps altogether honest what woman ever understood necessity recognized advantage of political honesty then be dull pompous if be conceited did not show be disappointed woman a regard husband seeing that have married on speculation that must at once become politically important a yet mr smith have not quite fulfilled prophecy of early life lady lufton when spoke of chaldicotes set distinctly included in own mind bishop of barchester wife daughter seeing that bishop proudie be of course man much addicted to religion to religious thinking that mr sowerby have peculiar religious sentiment there must not at first sight appear to be ground for much intercourse perhaps there be not much of such intercourse mr proudie mr harold smith be firm friend of four five year standing ever since proudies came into diocese therefore bishop be usually taken to chaldicotes whenever mr smith paid brother visit now bishop proudie be by mean high church dignitary lady lufton have never forgiven for coming into diocese have instinctively high respect for episcopal office of bishop proudie hardly thought better than did of mr sowerby of fabricator of evil duke of omnium whenever mr robarts must plead that in going anywhere must have benefit of meeting bishop lady lufton must slightly curl upper lip must not say in word bishop proudie bishop a certainly must be called be better than ought to be by curl of lip did explain to who knew that such be inner feeling of heart then be understood mark robarts at least have so heard information soon reached framley court mr supplehouse be to make one of chaldicotes party now mr supplehouse be worse companion for gentlemanlike young high church conservative county parson than even harold smith also be in parliament have be extolled during early day of russian war by portion of metropolitan daily press a only man who must save country let be in ministry jupiter have said there must be hope of reform chance that england ancient glory must not be allowed in perilous time to go headlong to oblivion upon ministry not anticipating much salvation from mr supplehouse willing a usually be to have jupiter at back did send for gentleman gave footing among how can man born to save nation to lead people be content to fill chair of under secretary supplehouse be not content soon gave to be understood that place be much higher than yet tendered to seal of high office war to knife be alternative offered to much belaboured head of affair nothing doubting that head of affair must recognize claimant value must have before eye wholesome fear of jupiter head of affair much belaboured a be knew that might pay too high even for mr supplehouse jupiter saviour of nation be told that might swing tomahawk since time have be swinging tomahawk not with so much effect a have be anticipated also be very intimate with mr sowerby be decidedly one of chaldicotes set there be many others included in stigma whose sin be political religious rather than moral be gall wormwood to lady lufton who regarded a child of lost one who grieved with mother grief when knew that son be among felt patron anger when heard that clerical protege be about to seek such society mr robarts might well say that lady lufton must be annoyed wo call at house before go will wife asked on following morning be to start after lunch on day driving in own gig so a to reach chaldicotes twenty four mile distant before dinner think not what good must do well ca explain think must call partly perhaps to show that a have determined to go be not afraid of telling so afraid that be nonsense fanny be not afraid of see why must bring down upon disagreeable thing will say besides have not time must walk up see jones about duty then what with getting ready will have enough to do to get off in time paid visit to mr jones curate feeling qualm of conscience there a rather boasted of member of parliament be going to meet of bishop who must be with mr evan jones be only curate in speaking to on matter must talk a though be quite proper thing for vicar to meet bishop at house of county member one must be inclined to say that be proper only why must not talk of in same tone to lady lufton then having kissed wife child drove off well pleased with prospect for coming ten day already anticipating discomfort on return on three following day robarts did not meet ladyship did not exactly take step to avoid meeting did not purposely go up to big house went to school a usual made one two call among farmer wife put foot within framley court ground be braver than husband even did not wish to anticipate evil day on saturday just before began to get dusk when be thinking of preparing for fatal plunge friend lady meredith came to so fanny will again be so unfortunate a to miss mr robarts said ladyship yes did ever know anything so unlucky have promised mr sowerby before heard that be coming pray think that must have gone away have known must have be sorry to keep from so much more amusing party now justinia be unfair intend to imply that have gone to chaldicotes because like better than framley court be not case hope lady lufton doe not think that be lady meredith laughed a put arm round friend waist lose eloquence in defending to said will want that for mother be mother angry asked mr robarts showing by countenance how eager be for true tidings on subject well fanny know ladyship a well a do think so very highly of vicar of framley that doe begrudge to politician at chaldicotes justinia bishop be to be there know think that consideration will at reconcile mother to gentleman absence ought to be very proud know to find that be so much thought of come fanny want to walk back with can dress at house now will go look at child after a walked together to framley court mr robarts made friend promise that must stand by if serious attack be made on absent clergyman be going up to room at once said vicar wife a soon a be inside porch leading into hall lady meredith immediately knew what friend meant decided that evil day must not be postponed have better go in have over said then will be comfortable for evening so drawing room door be opened there be lady lufton alone upon sofa now mamma said daughter must scold fanny much about mr robarts have gone to preach charity sermon before bishop under circumstance perhaps must not refuse be stretch on part of lady meredith put in with much good nature doubt still stretch for one have supposed that bishop must remain at chaldicotes for sunday how do do fanny said lady lufton getting up be not going to scold know how can talk such nonsense justinia of course be very sorry not to have mr robarts more especially a be not here last sunday that sir george be with do like to see mr robarts in own church certainly like other clergyman there a well if fanny take that for scolding why oh lady lufton be so kind of to say so mr robarts be so sorry that have accepted invitation to chaldicotes before heard that sir george be coming oh know chaldicotes have great attraction can not offer said lady lufton indeed be not that be asked to preach know mr harold smith poor fanny be only making worse have be worldly wise must have accepted little compliment implied in lady lufton first rebuke then have held peace oh harold smith be irresistible know how must man refuse to join party graced by mr harold smith mr proudie even though duty must require to stay away now mamma said justinia well dear what be to say must not wish to tell fib like mr harold smith at least what hear of for have not be fortune to meet since marriage may be conceited to own truth think that mr robarts must be better off with at framley than with harold smith at chaldicotes even though mr proudie be thrown into bargain be nearly dark therefore rising colour in face of mr robarts must not be seen however be too good wife to hear thing said without anger within bosom must blame husband in own mind be intolerable to that others must blame in hearing must undoubtedly be better off said then lady lufton people ca always go exactly where will be best off gentleman sometimes must well well dear will do have not taken at rate so will forgive lady lufton kissed a be affected low whisper between two young wife a be must e'en put up with poor old evan jones be to be here to night must go dress to receive so went off lady lufton be quite good enough at heart to like mr robarts better for standing up for absent lord chapter iii chaldicotes chaldicotes be house of much more pretension than framley court indeed if one look at ancient mark about rather than at of present day be place of very considerable pretension there be old forest not altogether belonging to property attached to called chace of chaldicotes portion of forest come up close behind mansion of give character celebrity to place chace of chaldicotes greater part of at least be a world know crown property now in utilitarian day be to be disforested in former time be great forest stretching half across country almost a far a silverbridge there be bit of here there still to be seen at interval throughout whole distance larger remaining portion consisting of aged hollow oak century old wide spreading withered beech stand in two parish of chaldicotes uffley people still come from afar to see oak of chaldicotes to hear foot rustle among thick autumn leaf will soon come no longer giant of past age be to give way to wheat turnip ruthless chancellor of exchequer disregarding old association rural beauty requires money return from land chace of chaldicotes be to vanish from earth surface part of however be private property of mr sowerby who hitherto through pecuniary distress have managed to save from axe auction mart that portion of paternal heritage house of chaldicotes be large stone building probably of time of charles second be approached on front by heavy double flight of stone step in front of house long solemn straight avenue through double row of lime tree lead away to lodge gate stand in centre of village of chaldicotes to rear window open upon four different vista run down through forest four open green ride converge together at large iron gateway barrier divide private ground from chace sowerbys for many generation have be ranger of chace of chaldicotes thus having almost a wide authority over crown forest a over own now be to cease for forest will be disforested be nearly dark a mark robarts drove up through avenue of lime tree to hall door be easy to see that house be dead silent a grave through nine month of year be now alive in part there be light in many of window noise of voice came from stable servant be moving about dog barked dark gravel before front step be cut up with many coach wheel oh be that sir mr robarts said groom taking parson horse by head touching own hat hope see reverence well quite well bob thank well at chaldicotes pretty bobbish mr robarts deal of life going on here now sir bishop lady came morning oh ah yes understood be to be here of young lady one young lady miss olivia think call reverence how mr sowerby very well reverence mr harold smith mr fothergill be duke man of business know be getting off horse now in stable yard there home from hunting eh bob yes sir just home minute then mr robarts walked into house portmanteau following on footboy shoulder will be seen that young vicar be very intimate at chaldicotes so much so that groom knew talked to about people in house yes be intimate there much more than have given framley people to understand not that have wilfully overtly deceived one not that have ever spoken false word about chaldicotes have never boasted at home that sowerby be near ally have told there how often mr sowerby lord lufton be together in london why trouble woman with such matter why annoy so excellent woman a lady lufton then mr sowerby be one whose intimacy few young men must wish to reject be fifty have lived perhaps not most salutary life dressed young usually looked well be bald with good forehead sparkling moist eye be clever man pleasant companion always good humoured when so suited be gentleman too of high breeding good birth whose ancestor have be known in county longer farmer around must boast than of other landowner in unless be thornes of ullathorne perhaps gresham of

transaction between lord lufton mr sowerby be found impracticable to complete business without lady lufton knowledge son have commissioned mr robarts not only to inform ladyship to talk over to

character of bachelor grace be not very best in world then lordship began to ask question about church affair of framley in little interest a to framley court be also mixed up when be interrupted by rather sharp voice to instantly attended bishop said rather sharp voice bishop trotted across room to back of sofa on wife be sitting miss dunstable think that will be able to come to for couple of

bowing low putting hand upon heart in meantime mr fothergill have got hold of mark robarts mr fothergill be gentleman magistrate of county occupied position of managing man on duke of omnium estate be not exactly agent be to say did not receive rent managed for saw people went about county wrote letter supported electioneering interest did popularity when be too much trouble for duke to do be in fact invaluable people in west barsetshire must often say that did not know what on earth duke must do if be not for mr fothergill indeed mr fothergill be useful to duke mr robarts said be very happy to have pleasure of meeting very happy indeed have often heard of from friend sowerby mark bowed said that be delighted to have honour of making mr fothergill acquaintance be commissioned by duke of omnium continued mr fothergill to say how glad will be if will join grace party at gatherum castle next week bishop will be there indeed nearly whole set who be here now duke must have written when heard that be to be at chaldicotes thing be hardly quite arranged then so grace have left for to tell how happy will be to make acquaintance in own house have spoken to sowerby continued mr fothergill very much hope that will be able to join mark felt that face became red when proposition be made to party in county to properly belonged wife made happy respectable looked upon duke of omnium with horror amazement now have absolutely received invitation to duke house proposition be made to that must be numbered among duke friend though in one sense be sorry that proposition be made to yet in be proud of be not young man let profession be what may who can receive overture of friendship from duke without elation mark too have risen in world a far a have yet risen by knowing great people certainly have ambition to rise higher will not degrade by calling tuft hunter undoubtedly have feeling that path most pleasant for clergyman foot be be trodden by great one of earth nevertheless at moment declined duke invitation be very much flattered said duty of parish must require to return direct from chaldicotes to framley need not give answer to night know said mr fothergill before week be past will talk over with sowerby bishop will be thousand pity mr robarts if will allow to say so that must neglect opportunity of knowing grace when mark went to bed mind be still set against going to duke nevertheless did feel that be pity that must not do so after be necessary that must obey lady lufton in thing chapter iv matter of conscience be doubt very wrong to long after naughty thing nevertheless do so one may say that hankering after naughty thing be very essence of evil into have be precipitated by adam fall when confess that be sinner confess that long after naughty thing ambition be great vice a mark antony told long time ago great vice doubt if ambition of man be with reference to own advancement not to advancement of others then how many of be there who be not ambitious in vicious manner there be nothing viler than desire to know great people people of great rank must say nothing worse than hunting of title worshipping of wealth know say day of life presuming that way into society of park lane be open to way also into of bedford row how many of be there who must prefer bedford row because be so vile to worship wealth title be led into rather trite remark by necessity of putting forward sort of excuse for frame of mind in rev mark robarts awoke on morning after arrival at chaldicotes trust that fact of being clergyman will not be allowed to press against unfairly clergyman be subject to same passion a other men a far a can see give way to in one line in almost a frequently clergyman must by canonical rule feel personal disinclination to bishopric yet believe that such personal disinclination be generally very strong mark first thought when woke on that morning flew back to mr fothergill invitation duke have sent special message to say how peculiarly glad duke must be to make acquaintance with parson how much of message have be of mr fothergill own manufacture mark robarts did not consider have obtained living at age when other young clergyman be beginning to think of curacy have obtained living a middle aged parson in dream regard a possible paradise for old year of course thought that good thing have be result of own peculiar merit of course felt that be different from other parson more fitted by nature for intimacy with great person more urbane more polished more richly endowed with modern clerical well to do aptitude be grateful to lady lufton for what have done for perhaps not so grateful a must have be at rate be not lady lufton servant even dependant so much have repeated to on many occasion have gone so far a to hint same idea to wife in career a parish priest must in most thing be judge of own action in many also be duty to be judge of of patroness fact of lady lufton having placed in living must by mean make proper judge of action often said to said a often that lady lufton certainly have hankering after judgment seat of whom generally did prime minister official bigwig think expedient to make bishop dean be not a rule of clergyman who have shown able to perform clerical duty efficiently able also to take place with ease in high society be very well off certainly at framley must never hope for anything beyond framley if allowed to regard lady lufton a bugbear putting lady lufton prejudice out of question be there reason why ought not to accept duke invitation must not see that there be such reason if one must be better judge on subject than must be bishop be clear that bishop wished to go to gatherum castle matter be still left open to mr fothergill have especially explained that therefore ultimate decision be a yet within own power visit must cost money for knew that man doe not stay at great house without expense then in spite of good income be not very flush of money have be down year with lord lufton in scotland perhaps might be more prudent for to return home then idea came to that behoved a man priest to break through framley thraldom under felt that did to certain extent exist be not fact that be about to decline invitation from fear of lady lufton if so be that motive by ought to be actuated be incumbent on to rid of feeling in spirit got up dressed there be hunting again on day a hound be to meet near chaldicotes to draw covert lying on verge of chace lady be to go in carriage through drive of forest mr robarts be to escort on horseback indeed be one of hunting day got up rather for lady than for sport great nuisance be to steady middle aged hunting men young fellow like because have thereby opportunity of showing off sporting finery of doing little flirtation on horseback bishop also have be minded to be of party so at least have said on previous evening place in one of carriage have be set apart for since that mr proudie have discussed matter in private at breakfast lordship declared that have changed mind mr sowerby be one of men who be known to be very poor a poor a debt can make man who nevertheless enjoy luxury money can give be believed that must not live in england out of jail for protection a member of parliament yet seemed that there be end to horse carriage servant retinue have be at work for great many year practice say make perfect such companion be very dangerous there be cholera no yellow fever small pox more contagious than debt if one life habitually among embarrassed men one catch to certainty one have injured community in way more fatally than mr sowerby still carried on game now on morning carriage horse thronged at gate a though be a substantially rich a friend duke of omnium robarts dear fellow said mr sowerby when be well under way down one of glade of forest for place where hound met be four five mile from house of chaldicotes ride on with moment want to speak to if stay behind will never get to hound so mark who have come expressly to escort lady rode on alongside of mr sowerby in pink coat dear fellow fothergill tell that have hesitation about going to gatherum castle well did decline certainly know be not man of pleasure a be have duty to attend to gammon said mr sowerby a said looked with kind of derisive smile into clergyman face be easy enough to say that sowerby perhaps have right to expect that must understand ah do understand say be gammon must be last man in world to ridicule scruple about duty if hesitation on part arose from such scruple answer honestly do not know that such be not case know nothing of kind ah think do if persist in refusing invitation will not be because be afraid of making lady lufton angry know what there can be in woman that be able to hold lufton in leading string robarts of course denied charge protested that be not to be taken back to own parsonage by fear of lady lufton though made such protest with warmth knew that did so ineffectually sowerby only smiled said that proof of pudding be in eating what be good of man keeping curate if be not to save from sort of drudgery asked drudgery if be drudge how must be here to day well robarts look here be speaking now perhaps with more of energy of old friend than circumstance fully warrant be older man than a have regard for like to see throw up good game when be in hand oh a far a go sowerby need hardly tell that appreciate kindness if be content continued man of world to live at framley life to warm in sunshine of dowager there why in such case may perhaps be useless for to extend circle of friend if have higher idea than think will be very wrong to omit present opportunity of going to duke never knew duke go so much out of way to be civil to clergyman a have done in instance be sure be very much obliged to fact be that may if please make popular in county can not do by obeying lady lufton behest be dear old woman be sure be sowerby must say so if knew doubt must not do for to live exactly according to idea now here in case bishop of diocese be to be one of party have believe already expressed wish that must be asked if be going exactly archdeacon grantly will be there will asked mark now must be great point gained for archdeacon grantly be close friend of lady lufton so understand from fothergill indeed will be very wrong of not to go tell so plainly what be more when talk about duty having curate a have why be gammon last word spoke looking back over shoulder a stood up in stirrup for have caught eye of huntsman who be surrounded by hound be now trotting on to join during great portion of day mark found riding by side of mr proudie a lady leaned back in carriage mr proudie smiled on graciously though daughter must not do so mr proudie be fond of having attendant clergyman a be evident that mr robarts lived among nice people titled dowager member of parliament people of sort be quite willing to instal a sort of honorary chaplain pro tem will tell what have settled mr harold smith said mr proudie to lecture at barchester will be so late on saturday evening that have better come dine with mark bowed thanked declared that must be very happy to make one of party even lady lufton must not object to although be not especially fond of mr proudie then be to sleep at hotel will really be too late for lady to think of going back so far at time of year told mr harold smith miss dunstable too that must manage to make room at rate for will not leave other lady so go to hotel for night mr robarts bishop will never allow to stay at inn so of course will take bed at palace immediately occurred to mark that a lecture be to be given on saturday evening next morning must be sunday on sunday must have to preach at chaldicotes thought be going to return same night said well did intend see mr smith be afraid must have to get back here on sunday morning mr proudie ah yes be bad very bad indeed one dislike interference with sabbath more than do indeed if be particular about anything be about work be work of necessity mr robarts be not now must necessarily be back at chaldicotes on sunday morning so matter be settled mr proudie be very firm in general in matter of sabbath day observance when have to deal with such person a mr harold smith be expedient that must give way little can start a soon a be daylight know if like mr robarts said mr proudie there be not much to boast of a to hunting be very pleasant day for lady men rode up down grass road through chace sometimes in greatest possible hurry a though never must go quick enough then coachman must drive very fast also though did not know why for fast pace of movement be of contagious disease then again sportsman must move at undertaker pace when fox have traversed hound must be at loss to know be hunt be heel then carriage also must go slowly lady must stand up talk then time for lunch came altogether day went by pleasantly enough so that be hunting be said miss dunstable yes be hunting said mr sowerby did not see gentleman do anything must not do except there be one young man slipped off into mud must like there be breaking of bone be there dear said mr harold smith nobody caught fox said miss dunstable fact be mr smith think much more of sport than do of business will take to hunting pack of hound after do dear will be whipper in wonder whether mr proudie must join will be writing to duke to night said mr fothergill to mark a be riding up to stable yard together will let tell grace that will accept invitation will not upon word duke be very kind said mark be very anxious to know can assure said fothergill what must young flattered fool of parson do say that must go mark did say that must go in course of evening friend mr sowerby congratulated bishop joked with said that knew that must not give up good company so soon miss dunstable said must make chaplain a soon a parliament must allow quack doctor to have such article allusion mark did not understand till learned that miss dunstable be proprietress of celebrated oil of lebanon invented by late respected father patented by with such wonderful result in way of accumulated fortune mr proudie made quite one of party talking to about manner of church subject then at last even miss proudie smiled on when learned that have be thought worthy of bed at duke castle world seemed to be open to must not make happy that evening on next morning must write to wife must already see look of painful sorrow must fall upon fanny brow when learned that husband be going to be guest at duke of omnium must tell to send money money be scarce then a to lady lufton must send message must not in case must declare war against then did not

mr sowerby be miss dunstable who seemed to take great fancy to whereas be not very accessible to blandishment of mr supplehouse more specially courteous even to host than good manner required of then mr supplehouse mr sowerby be bachelor while mark robarts be married man with mr sowerby robarts have more than one communication respecting lord lufton affair must willingly have avoided have be possible sowerby be one of men who be always mixing up business with pleasure who have usually scheme in mind requires forwarding men of class have a rule daily work regular routine of labour may be doubted whether toil much more incessantly than who have lufton be so dilatory mr sowerby said why did not arrange at once when promised then be so afraid of old woman at framley court well dear fellow say what will be old woman will never be younger do write to lufton tell that delay be inconvenient to will do anything for know mark said that must write indeed did do so did not at first like tone of conversation into be dragged be very painful to to hear lady lufton called old woman hardly le so to discus propriety of lord lufton parting with property be irksome to till habit made easy by degree feeling became le acute accustomed to friend sowerby mode of talking then on saturday afternoon went over to barchester harold smith during last forty eight hour have become crammed to overflowing with sarawak labuan new guinea salomon island a be case with men labouring under temporary speciality for time have faith in nothing else be not content that one near must have other faith called viscount papua baron borneo wife who headed joke against insisted on having title miss dunstable swore that must wed none south sea islander to mark be offered income duty of bishop of spice did proudie family set against little sarcastic quip with overwhelming severity be sweet to unbend at proper opportunity be proper opportunity for mr proudie unbending mortal can be seriously wise at hour in happy hour did that usually wise mortal bishop lay aside for awhile serious wisdom think of dining at five to morrow lady papua said facetious bishop will suit lordship affair of state good prelate laughed at fun how pleasantly young men woman of fifty thereabouts can joke flirt poke fun about laughing holding side dealing in little innuendo rejoicing in nickname when have mentor of twenty five thirty near to keep in order vicar of framley might perhaps have be regarded a such mentor be not for capability of adapting to company immediately around on so much piqued therefore also talked to lady papua be jocose about baron not altogether to satisfaction of mr harold smith for mr harold smith be in earnest did not quite relish jocundity have idea that must in about three month talk british world into civilizing new guinea that world of barsetshire must be made to go with by one night effort did not understand why others must be le serious be inclined to resent somewhat stiffly amenity of friend mark must not keep baron waiting said mark a be preparing to start for barchester know what mean by baron sir said harold smith perhaps joke will be against when be getting up into pulpit to morrow sending hat round among clodhopper of chaldicotes who live in glass house must throw stone eh baron said miss dunstable mr robarts sermon will be too near akin to lecture to allow of laughing if can hing towards instructing outer world till be done by parson said harold smith outer world will have to wait long time fear nobody can do anything of kind short of member of parliament must be minister whispered mr harold so be very pleasant together in spite of little fencing with edge tool at three o'clock cortege of carriage started for barchester of bishop of course leading way lordship however be not in mr proudie be sure will let go with said miss dunstable at last moment a came down big stone step want to hear rest of story about mr slope now upset everything bishop be to have gone with wife mr smith mark robarts mr sowerby have so arranged matter that must have accompanied miss dunstable in phaeton one ever dreamed of denying miss dunstable anything of course mark gave way ended in bishop declaring that have special predilection for own carriage did in compliance with glance from wife eye then other change of course followed at last mr sowerby harold smith be joint occupant of phaeton poor lecturer a seated made remark such a have be making for last two day for out of full heart mouth speaketh spoke to impatient listener d south sea islander said mr sowerby will have own way in few minute like bull in china shop for heaven sake let have little peace till time come appeared that mr sowerby little plan of having miss dunstable for companion be not quite insignificant indeed may be said that few of little plan be so at present moment flung back in carriage prepared for sleep must further plan of by tete tete conversation with brother in law then mr proudie began story about mr slope rather recommenced be very fond of talking about gentleman who have once be pet chaplain be now bitterest foe in telling story have sometimes to whisper to miss dunstable for there be one two fie fie little anecdote about married lady not altogether fit for young mr robarts ear mr harold smith insisted on having out loud miss dunstable must gratify lady in spite of mr proudie wink what kissing hand clergyman said miss dunstable did not think ever did such thing mr robarts still water run deepest said mr harold smith hush h h looked rather than spoke mr proudie grief of spirit that bad man caused nearly broke heart while know be courting then mr proudie whispered name what dean wife shouted miss dunstable in voice made coachman of next carriage give chuck to horse a overheard archdeacon sister in law screamed mr harold smith what might not have attempted next said miss dunstable be dean wife then know said mr proudie explaining well have gay set in chapter must say said miss dunstable ought to make one of in barchester mr robarts only perhaps mr robarts might not like said mr harold smith then scheme tried on with bishop said mr proudie be fair in love war know said miss dunstable little knew whom have to deal with when began that said mr proudie bishop be too many for suggested mr harold smith very maliciously if bishop be not somebody else be be obliged to leave barchester in utter disgrace have since married wife of tallow chandler wife said miss dunstable what man widow mean be one to gentleman be clearly born when venus be in ascendant said mr smith clergyman usually be believe mr robarts so mr proudie carriage be by mean dullest a drove into barchester that day by degree friend mark became accustomed to companion before reached palace acknowledged to that miss dunstable be very good fun can not linger over bishop dinner though be very good of kind a mr sowerby contrived to sit next to miss dunstable thereby overturning little scheme made by mr supplehouse again shone forth in unclouded good humour mr harold smith became impatient immediately on withdrawal of cloth lecture be to begin at seven according to watch that hour have already come declared that sowerby supplehouse be endeavouring to delay matter in order that barchesterians might become vexed impatient so bishop be not allowed to exercise hospitality in true episcopal fashion forget sowerby said supplehouse that world here for last fortnight have be looking forward to nothing else world will be gratified at once said mr harold obeying little nod from mr proudie come dear took hold of miss dunstable arm let keep barchester waiting will be ready in quarter of hour will not mr proudie so sailed off will have time for one glass of claret said bishop there seven by cathedral said harold smith jumping up from chair a heard clock if people have come must not be right in to keep waiting will go just one glass of claret mr smith will be off said bishop woman will keep hour said harold filling glass drinking standing do on purpose be thinking of wife seemed to bishop a though guest be actually speaking of mr proudie be rather late when found in big room of mechanic institute know whether on whole did harm most of mr smith hearer excepting party from palace be barchester tradesman with wife family waited not impatiently for big people then lecture be gratis fact be always borne in mind by englishman when come to reckon up calculate way in be treated when pay money then take choice may be impatient not a like sense of justice teach so much in accordance with sense usually act so people on bench rose graciously when palace party entered room seat for have be kept in front there be three arm chair be filled after little hesitation by bishop mr proudie miss dunstable mr smith positively declining to take one of though a admitted rank a lady papua of island did give claim remark a be made quite out loud reached mr smith ear a stood behind little table on small raised dais holding white kid glove annoyed rather put out did not like joke about lady papua then others of party sat upon front bench covered with red cloth will find very hard very narrow about second hour said mr sowerby mr smith on dais again overheard word dashed glove down to table felt that room must hear there be one two gentleman on second seat who shook hand with of party there be mr thorne of ullathorne good natured old bachelor whose residence be near enough to barchester to allow of coming in without much personal inconvenience next to be mr harding old clergyman of chapter with whom mr proudie shook hand very graciously making way for to seat close behind if must so please mr harding did not so please having paid respect to bishop returned quietly to side of old friend mr thorne thereby angering mr proudie a might easily be seen by face mr chadwick also be there episcopal man of business for diocese also adhered to two gentleman above named now that bishop lady have taken place mr harold smith relifted glove again laid down hummed three time distinctly then began be said most peculiar characteristic of present era in british island that who be high placed before world in rank wealth education be willing to come forward give time knowledge without fee reward for advantage amelioration of who did not stand so high in social scale then paused for moment during mr smith remarked to miss dunstable that be pretty well for beginning miss dunstable replied that a for felt very grateful to rank wealth education mr sowerby winked to mr supplehouse who opened eye very wide shrugged shoulder barchesterians took all in good part gave lecturer applause of hand foot then well pleased recommenced make remark with reference to myself hope be not going to be modest said miss dunstable will be quite new if be replied mr smith so much a to many noble talented lord member of lower house who have lately from time to time devoted to good work then went through long list of peer member of parliament beginning of course with lord boanerges ending with mr green walker young gentleman who have lately be returned by uncle interest for borough of crewe junction have immediately made entrance into public life by giving lecture on grammarian of latin language a exemplified at eton school on present occasion mr smith continued object be to learn something a to grand magnificent island lie far away beyond indie in southern ocean land of produce rich spice glorious fruit whose sea be imbedded with pearl coral papua philippine borneo moluccas friend be familiar with map know track equator make for through distant ocean then many head be turned down there be rustle of leaf for not few of who stood not so high in social scale have brought map with refreshed memory a to whereabouts of wondrous island then mr smith also with map in hand pointing occasionally to large map hung against wall went into geography of matter might have found that out from atlas think without coming way to barchester said that unsympathizing helpmate mr harold very cruelly most illogically too for there be so many thing must find out ourselves by search never do find out unless be specially told why must not latitude longitude of labuan be one rather two of thing then when have duly marked path of line through borneo celebes gilolo through macassar strait molucca passage mr harold smith rose to higher flight what said avail that god can give to man unless man will open hand to receive gift what be opening of hand process of civilization yes friend process of civilization south sea islander have that kind providence can bestow on that be a nothing without education that education civilization be for to bestow upon yes friend for for citizen of barchester a be then paused again in order that foot hand might go to work foot hand did go to work during mr smith took slight drink of water be now quite in element have got into proper way of punching table with fist few word dropping from mr sowerby did now again find way to ear sound of own voice have brought with accustomed charm ran on from platitude to truism from truism back to platitude with eloquence be charming to civilization exclaimed lifting up eye hand to ceiling oh civilization there will not be chance for now for next hour half said mr supplehouse groaning harold smith cast one eye down at immediately flew back to ceiling oh civilization thou ennoblest mankind makest equal to god what be like unto thee here mr proudie showed evident sign of disapprobation doubt must have be shared by bishop have not that worthy prelate be asleep mr smith continued unobservant at rate regardless what be like unto thee thou art irrigating stream makest fertile barren plain till thou comest be dark dreary at thy advent noontide sun shine out earth give forth increase deep bowel of rock render up tribute form be dull hideous become endowed with grace beauty vegetable existence rise to scale of celestial life then too genius appears clad in panoply of translucent armour grasping in hand whole terrestrial surface making rood of earth subservient to purpose genius child of civilization mother of art last little bit taken from pedigree of progress have great success barchester went to work with hand foot barchester except ill natured aristocratic front row together with three arm chair at corner of aristocratic front row felt to be too intimate with civilization to care much about three arm chair rather that special one contained mr proudie considered that there be certain heathenness pagan sentimentality almost amounting to infidelity contained in lecturer remark with pillar of church must not put up seated a be now in public conclave be to civilization that must look continued mr harold smith descending from poetry to prose a lecturer well know how thereby showing value of for material progress in island to christianity shouted mr proudie to great amazement of assembled people to thorough wakening of bishop who jumping up in chair at sound of well known voice exclaimed certainly certainly hear hear hear said on bench who particularly belonged to mr proudie school of divinity in city among voice be distinctly heard that of new verger in whose behalf have greatly interested oh yes christianity of course said harold smith upon whom interruption did not seem to operate favourably christianity sabbath day observance exclaimed mr proudie who now that have obtained ear of public seemed well inclined to keep let never forget that islander can never prosper unless keep sabbath holy poor mr smith having be so rudely dragged from high horse be never able to mount again completed lecture in manner not at comfortable to have there on table before huge bundle of statistic with have meant to convince reason of hearer after have taken full possession of feeling fell very dull flat at moment when be interrupted be about to explain that material progress to have alluded must not be attained without money that behoved people of barchester before to come forward with purse like men brother did also attempt from moment of fatal onslaught from arm chair be clear to to one else that mr proudie be now hero of hour time have gone by people of barchester did not care straw for appeal from cause lecture be over full twenty minute earlier than one have expected to great delight of messrs sowerby supplehouse who on evening moved carried vote of thanks to mr proudie for have gay doings yet before went to bed robarts here one moment mr sowerby said a be standing at door of mechanic institute go off with mr mr bishop be going to have little supper at dragon of wantly after what have gone through upon word want can tell one of palace servant to let in mark considered proposal wistfully must fain have joined supper party have dared like many others of cloth have fear of mr proudie before eye very merry supper have poor mr harold smith be not merriest of party chapter vii sunday morning be perhaps quite a well on whole for mark robarts that did not go to supper party be eleven o'clock before sat down nearly two before gentleman be in bed must be remembered that have to preach on coming sunday morning charity sermon on behalf of mission to mr harold smith islander to tell truth be task for have now very little inclination when first invited to do have regarded task seriously enough a always did regard such work completed sermon for occasion before left framley since air of ridicule have be thrown over whole affair in have joined without much thinking of own sermon made now heartily wish that must choose discourse upon other subject knew well that very point on have most insisted be have drawn most mirth from miss dunstable mr smith have oftenest provoked own laughter how be now to preach on matter in fitting mood knowing a must know that two lady must be looking at must endeavour to catch eye must turn into ridicule a have already turned lecturer in did injustice to one of lady unconsciously miss dunstable with aptitude for mirth may almost fairly say for frolic be in way inclined to ridicule religion anything thought to appertain to may be presumed that among such thing did not include mr proudie a be willing enough to laugh at lady mark have known better might have be sure that must have sat out sermon with perfect propriety a be however did feel considerable uneasiness in morning got up early with view of seeing what might be done in way of emendation cut out part referred most specially to island rejected altogether name over have laughed together so heartily inserted string of general remark very useful doubt flattered must rob sermon of similarity to harold smith lecture have perhaps hoped when writing to create little sensation now must be quite satisfied if passed without remark trouble for sunday be destined to be many have be arranged that party at hotel must breakfast at eight start at half past eight punctually so a to enable to reach chaldicotes in ample time to arrange dress before went to church church stood in ground close to long formal avenue of lime tree within front gate walk therefore after reaching mr sowerby house must not be long mr proudie who be early body must not hear of guest clergyman going out to inn for breakfast on sunday morning a regarded that sabbath day journey to chaldicotes to that have given assent doubt with much uneasiness of mind let have a little desecration a possible be therefore understood thing that be to return with friend must not go without advantage of family prayer family breakfast so mr proudie on retiring to rest gave necessary order to great annoyance of household to great annoyance at least of servant bishop did not make appearance till much later hour in thing now supported wife rule in thing now say for there have be moment when in first flush pride of episcopacy other idea have filled mind now however gave opposition to good woman with whom providence have blessed in return for such conduct good woman administered in thing to little personal comfort with what surprise did bishop now look back upon unholy war have once be tempted to wage against wife of bosom did of miss proudies show at early hour perhaps be absent on different ground with mr proudie have not be so successful a with bishop have will of own became stronger stronger day of three with whom mr proudie be blessed one be already in position to exercise will in legitimate way over very excellent young clergyman in diocese rev optimus grey other two having a yet such opening for power of command be perhaps little too much inclined to keep in practice at home at half past seven punctually mr proudie be there so be domestic chaplain so be mr robarts so be household servant excepting one lazy recreant where be thomas said of argus eye standing up with book of family prayer in hand so please ma'be tummas be bad with tooth ache ache exclaimed mr proudie eye said more terrible thing than let thomas come to before church then proceeded to prayer be read by chaplain a be proper decent that must be can not think that mr proudie little exceeded office in taking upon to pronounce blessing when prayer be over did however in clear sonorous voice perhaps with more personal dignity than be within chaplain compass mr proudie be rather stern at breakfast vicar of framley felt unaccountable desire to get out of house in first place be not dressed with usual punctilious attention to propriety of high situation be evident that there be to be further toilet before sailed up middle of cathedral choir have on large loose cap with other string than be wanted for tying beneath chin cap with household chaplain be well acquainted seemed ungracious in eye of mr robarts after well dressed holiday doings of last week wore also large loose dark coloured wrapper came well up round neck be not buoyed out a be dress in general with under mechanism of petticoat clung to closely added to inflexibility of general appearance then have encased foot in large carpet slipper doubt be comfortable struck visitor a being strange unsightly do find difficulty in getting people together for early morning prayer said a commenced operation with teapot ca say that do said mark then be seldom so early a parish clergyman must be early think said set good example in village be thinking of having morning prayer in church said mr robarts be nonsense said mr proudie usually mean worse than nonsense know what come to if have three service on sunday domestic prayer at home do very well so saying handed cup have not three service on sunday mr proudie then think must have where can poor people be so well off on sunday a in church bishop intends to express very strong opinion on subject in next charge then be sure will attend to wish to mark made answer devoted to egg suppose have not very large establishment at framley asked mr proudie what at parsonage yes live at parsonage certainly well not very large mr proudie just enough to do work make thing comfortable look after child be very fine living said very fine remember that have anything so good except be plumstead archdeacon place have managed to butter bread pretty well father be bishop of barchester oh yes know about only for that must barely have risen to be archdeacon suspect let see be l be not mr robarts such young man suppose have insured life highly pretty well mr proudie then too wife have little fortune have not can not all fall on foot like can mr white mr proudie in playful way appealed to chaplain mr proudie be imperious woman then so also be lady lufton may therefore be said that mr robarts ought to have be accustomed to feminine domination a sat there munching toast must not make comparison between two lady lufton in little attempt sometimes angered certainly thought comparing lay lady clerical together that rule of former be lighter pleasanter then lady lufton have given living wife mr proudie have given nothing immediately after breakfast mr robarts escaped to dragon of wantly partly because have have enough of matutinal mr proudie partly also in order that might hurry friend there be already becoming fidgety about time a harold smith have be on preceding evening did not give mr smith credit for much punctuality when arrived at inn asked if have done breakfast be immediately told that not one of be yet down be already half past eight ought to be now under weigh on road immediately went to mr sowerby room found that gentleman shaving be bit uneasy said mr sowerby smith will have phaeton horse will take there in hour not however what will be in time will send round to whole party ferret out then mr sowerby having evoked manifold aid with various peal of bell sent messenger male female

lieutenant of county by one whig minister have received garter from thing be matter of course to duke of omnium be born to be lord lieutenant knight of garter not le on account of apathy rather

that many of even who voted with must declare that be in way attributable to great men have risen in india done that even minister there governor whom have sent out be not allowed in day credit for success be achieved under order there be great reason to doubt man at helm nevertheless have be lucky there be merit in public man like success now when evil day be well nigh over came question whether have not be too successful when man have nailed fortune to chariot wheel be apt to travel about in rather proud fashion there be servant who think that master can not do without public also may occasionally have such servant what if too successful minister be one of then discreet commonplace zealous member of lower house doe not like to be jeered at when doe duty by constituent asks few

be outrageous may not be a well to ostracize for awhile have not better throw in shell against say mr harold smith let throw in shell by mean say mr supplehouse mindful a juno of despised charm when mr supplehouse declares enemy men know how much mean know that much belaboured head of affair must succumb to terrible blow be now in store for yes will throw in shell mr supplehouse rise from chair with gleaming eye have not greece a noble son a ay much nobler traitor that be must judge man by friend say mr supplehouse point away to east where dear ally french be supposed to live where head of affair be supposed to have too close intimacy understand even mr green walker know that be good to of at now say talented member for crewe junction be great deal too uppish to suit book know great many people think so too there be uncle be best fellow in world said mr fothergill who felt perhaps that coming revelation about mr green walker uncle might not be of use to fact be one get tired of

mr sowerby not least use said mr supplehouse be false to constituent in submitting to dominion let have change then said mr sowerby matter pretty much in own hand altogether said mr green walker be what uncle always say manchester men will only be too happy for chance said harold smith a for high dry gentleman said mr sowerby be not very likely that will object to pick up fruit when shake tree a to picking up fruit be a may be said mr supplehouse be not man to save nation if so why must not pick up fruit have not greatest power in country pointed out a such saviour what though country at present moment needed more saving might there not nevertheless be good time coming be there not rumour of other war still prevalent if indeed actual war then going on be being brought to close without assistance by other specie of salvation thought of country to have pointed of friend of enemy remembered that there might be still work for mighty saviour public mind be now awake understood what be about when man get into head idea that public voice call for be astonishing how great becomes trust in wisdom of public vox populi vox dei have not be so always say to a get up a go to bed then mr supplehouse felt that be master mind there at gatherum castle that there be puppet in hand be such pleasant thing to feel that one friend be puppet that string be in one own possession what if mr supplehouse be puppet month afterwards when much belaboured head of affair be in very truth made to retire when unkind shell be thrown in against in great number when exclaimed tu brute till word be

lordship why not own power trace flower a well perhaps one might help other upon whole be afraid that lord boanerges got best of then be line have be getting best of life be observed by that duke be especially attentive to young mr frank gresham gentleman on whom on whose wife miss dunstable have seized so vehemently mr gresham be richest commoner in county be rumoured that at next election must be one of member for east riding now duke have little nothing to do with east riding be well known that young gresham must be brought forward a strong conservative nevertheless acre be so extensive

property will be very glad to sell must be delighted to welcome on side of border said duke young gresham did feel rather flattered there be not many men in county to whom offer must be made without absurdity might be doubted whether duke must purchase chace of chaldicotes with ready money that gresham must do so wife between man did doubt then mr gresham thought of former day when have once be at gatherum castle have be poor enough then duke have not treated in most courteous manner in world how hard be for rich man not to lean upon rich harder indeed than for camel to go through eye of

be sure that contained gross flattery for young bride remembered however have always called lucy wife pet of sister have since be at framley though fanny have spent week at exeter on occasion of blanche marriage must hardly be said that be very intimate with nevertheless when became expedient that one of must go to framley remembrance of what wife have said immediately induced mark to make

sister in law remember very well can say that be not plain be very much taken with manner at wedding dear thought more of than did of beauty can tell must confess remember at said lordship so conversation ended then at end of fortnight mark arrived with sister did not reach framley till long after dark somewhere between six seven by time be december there be snow on ground frost in air

manner of preparation have be made three time have fanny gone to see that fire burned brightly in little room over porch at moment that sound of wheel be heard be engaged in opening son mind a to nature of aunt hitherto papa mamma lady lufton be that have known excepting of course satellite of nursery then in three minute lucy be standing by fire three minute have be taken up in embrace between husband wife let who must be brought a visitor to house after fortnight absence must kiss before welcomed one else then turned to lucy began to assist with cloak oh thank said lucy be not cold not very at least trouble can do here have made false boast for finger have be so numbed that must not do undo anything be in black of course sombreness of lucy clothes struck fanny much more than own seemed to have swallowed up in blackness to have made almost emblem of death did not look up kept face turned towards fire seemed almost afraid of position may say what like fanny said mark be very cold so be cold enough have better go up with to room wo do much in dressing way to night eh lucy in bedroom lucy thawed little fanny a kissed said to herself that have be wrong a to word plain lucy at rate be not plain will be used to soon said fanny then hope will make comfortable took sister in law hand pressed lucy looked up at eye then be tender enough be sure will be happy here said with dear papa then got into other arm have great bout of kissing cry plain said fanny to herself a at last got guest hair smoothed tear washed from eye plain have loveliest countenance that ever looked at in life sister be quite beautiful said to mark a talked over alone before went to sleep night be not beautiful be very good girl clever enough too in sort of way think perfectly lovely never saw such eye in life before will leave in hand then will get husband may be so easy think 'd marry anybody well hope not seems to to be exactly cut out for old maid to be aunt lucy for ever ever to bairn so will with heart think will very long have doubt will be hard to please if be man must fall in love with at once did ever observe teeth mark think ever did must know whether one have tooth in head believe one except dear know yours by heart be goose very sleepy one so if please will go to roost thus there be nothing more said about lucy beauty on occasion for first two day robarts did not make much of sister in law lucy indeed be not demonstrative be moreover one of few person for be very few who be contented to go on with existence without making centre of special outward circle to ordinary run of mind be impossible not to do man own dinner be to so important that can not bring to believe that be matter utterly indifferent to one else lady collection of baby clothes in early year of house linen curtain fringe in later life be so very interesting to own eye that can not believe what other people will rejoice to behold must not however be held a regarding tendency a evil lead to conversation of sort among people perhaps to kind of sympathy mr jones will look at mr white linen chest hoping that mr white may be induced to look at hers one can only pour out of jug that be in for most of if talk of ourselves at rate of individual circle of be centre can talk of nothing can not hold with who wish to put down insignificant chatter of world a for be always happy to look at mr jones linen never omit opportunity of giving detail of own dinner lucy robarts have not gift have come there a stranger into sister in law house at first seemed a though must be contented in simply having corner in drawing room place at parlour table did not seem to need comfort of condolence open hearted talking mean to say that be moody that did not answer when be spoken to that took notice of child did not at once throw hope sorrow into fanny heart a fanny must have have do mr robarts be what call demonstrative when be angry with lady lufton showed a since time love admiration for lady lufton have increased showed that also when be in way displeased with husband must not hide even though tried to do so fancied successful no more than must hide warm constant overflowing woman love must not walk through room hanging on husband arm without seeming to proclaim to one there that thought best man in be demonstrative therefore be more disappointed in lucy did not rush at once with care into open heart be so quiet fanny said to husband be nature said mark always be quiet a child while be smashing everything must never crack teacup wish must break something now said fanny then perhaps must get to talk about did not on account give over loving sister in law probably valued more unconsciously for not having aptitude with be endowed then after two day lady lufton called of course may be supposed that fanny have said good deal to new inmate about lady lufton neighbour of kind in country exercise so large influence upon whole tenor of one life that to abstain from such talk be out of question mr robarts have be brought up almost under dowager wing of course regarded a being worthy of much talking let person on account suppose that mr robarts be tuft hunter toad eater if see difference have yet got to study earliest principle of human nature lady lufton called lucy be struck dumb fanny be particularly anxious that ladyship first impression must be favourable to effect especially endeavoured to throw two together during visit in be unwise lady lufton however have woman craft enough not to be led into egregious error by lucy silence what day will come dine with said lady lufton turning expressly to old friend fanny oh do name day never have many engagement know will thursday do miss robarts will meet nobody know only son so need not regard a going out fanny here will tell that stepping over to framley court be more going out than when go from one room to in parsonage be fanny fanny laughed said that stepping over to framley court certainly be done so often that perhaps did not think so much about a ought to do consider sort of happy family here miss robarts be delighted to have opportunity of including in menage lucy gave ladyship one of sweetest smile what said at moment be inaudible be plain however that must not bring even to go a far a framley court for dinner just at present be very kind of lady lufton said to fanny be so very soon if must only go without must be so happy a object be to go with expressly to take there dinner be adjourned for short time sine die chapter xi griselda grantly be nearly month after lucy be first introduced to lord lufton then be brought about only by accident during time lady lufton have be often at parsonage have in certain degree learned to know lucy stranger in parish have never yet plucked up courage to accept one of numerous invitation have reached mr robarts wife have frequently be at framley court dreaded day of lucy initiation have not yet arrived have seen lord lufton in church hardly so a to know beyond have not seen at one day however rather one evening for be already dusk overtook mr robarts on road walking towards vicarage have gun on shoulder three pointer be at heel gamekeeper followed little in rear how be mr robarts said almost before have overtaken have be chasing along road for last half mile never knew lady walk so fast must be frozen if be to dawdle about a gentleman do then stopped shook hand with forgot at moment that lucy have not met therefore did not introduce wo make known to sister in law said taking off hat bowing to lucy have never yet have pleasure of meeting though have be neighbour for month more fanny made excuse introduced then went on till came to framley gate lord lufton talking to fanny answering for two there stopped for moment be surprised to see alone mr robarts have just said thought that captain culpepper be with captain have left for one day if will whisper will tell where have gone dare not speak out loud even to wood to what terrible place can have taken will have whispering about such horror have gone to to will promise not to tell mother not tell mother well now have excited curiosity where can be do promise then oh yes will promise because be sure lady lufton wo ask a to captain culpepper whereabouts wo tell will lucy have gone to gatherum castle for day pheasant shooting now mind must not betray ladyship supposes that be shut up in room with toothache did not dare to mention name to then appeared that mr robarts have engagement made necessary that must go up see lady lufton whereas lucy be intending to walk on to parsonage alone have promised to go to husband said lord lufton rather to husband dog ponto will do two other good thing will carry brace of pheasant with protect miss robarts from evil spirit of framley road so mr robarts turned in at gate lucy lordship walked off together lord lufton though have never before spoken to miss robarts have already found out that be by mean plain though have hardly seen except at church have already made certain that owner of face must be worth knowing be not sorry to have present opportunity of speaking to so have unknown damsel shut up in castle have once said to mr robarts if be kept prisoner much longer will find duty to come release by force of arm have be there twice with object of seeing on occasion lucy have managed to escape now may say be fairly caught lord lufton taking pair of pheasant from gamekeeper swinging over shoulder walked off with prey illustration lord lufton lucy robarts have be here long time said without having have pleasure of seeing yes lord said lucy lord have not be frequent among acquaintance hitherto tell mr robarts that have be confining illegally that will release by force stratagem have have great sorrow lately yes miss robarts know have be only joking know do hope that now will be able to come amongst mother be so anxious that must do so be sure be very kind also lord never knew own father said lord lufton speaking gravely can well understand what loss have have then after pausing moment continued remember dr robarts well do indeed said lucy turning sharply towards speaking now with animation in voice nobody have yet spoken to about father since have be at framley have be a though subject be forbidden one how frequently be case when love be dead friend dread to mention though to who be bereaved subject must be so pleasant a name rarely understand how to treat own sorrow of others there be once people in land may be still there for what know who thought sacrilegious to stay course of raging fire if house be being burned burn must even though there be facility for saving for who must dare to interfere with course of god idea of sorrow be much same think wicked at rate heartless to put out if man wife be dead must go about lugubrious with long face for at least two year perhaps with full length for eighteen month decreasing gradually during other six if be man who can quench sorrow put out fire a be in le time than let at rate not show power yes remember continued lord lufton came twice to framley while be boy consulting with mother about mark whether eton flogging be not more efficacious than at harrow be very kind to foreboding manner of good thing on behalf be very kind to one said lucy must think must have be kind good genial man just man to be adored by own family exactly so be remember that ever heard unkind word from there be not harsh tone in voice be generous a day lucy have said be not generally demonstrative now on subject with absolute stranger became almost eloquent wonder that must feel loss miss robarts oh do feel be best of brother a for fanny be too kind too good to have always be specially father friend for last year two have lived so much together be old man when died be not just seventy lord ah then be old mother be only fifty sometimes call old woman do think look older than that say that make out to be so much more ancient than need do lady lufton doe not dress young be never have in memory always used to wear black when first recollect have given that up now be still very sombre be not like lady to dress very young that be lady of of lady of fifty will say very well lady of fifty if like then be sure will like mother have now turned up through parsonage wicket little gate opened into garden at point on road nearer than chief entrance suppose will find mark up at house said daresay will lord well will go round way for business be partly in stable see be quite at home here though never have seen before miss robarts now that ice be broken hope that may be friend then put out hand when gave hers pressed almost a old friend might have done indeed lucy have talked to almost a though be old friend for minute two have forgotten that be lord stranger have forgotten also to be stiff guarded a be wont lord lufton have spoken to a though have really cared to know unconsciously have be taken by compliment lord lufton indeed have not thought much about excepting a thus that liked glance of pair of bright eye a most other young men do like on occasion evening have be so dark that have hardly seen lucy eye at well lucy hope liked companion mr robarts said a three of clustered round drawing room fire before dinner oh yes pretty well said lucy be not at complimentary to lordship did not mean to be complimentary fanny lucy be great deal too matter of fact for compliment said mark what meant be that have great opportunity for judging seeing be only with lord lufton for about ten minute ah there be girl here who must give eye for ten minute of lord lufton to know how be valued have character of being always able to make agreeable to lady at minute warning perhaps have not half minute warning in case said lucy hypocrite that be poor lucy said brother be coming up to see ponto shoulder be afraid be thinking more about dog than very likely said lucy then went in to dinner lucy have be hypocrite for have confessed to while dressing that lord lufton have be very pleasant then be allowed to young lady to be hypocrite when subject under discussion be character of young gentleman soon after lucy did dine at framley court captain culpepper in spite of enormity with reference to gatherum castle be still staying there a be also clergyman from neighbourhood of barchester with wife daughter be archdeacon grantly gentleman whom have mentioned before who be a well known in diocese a bishop more thought about by many clergyman than even illustrious prelate miss grantly be young lady not much older than lucy robarts also be quiet not given to much talking in open company be decidedly beauty somewhat statuesque in loveliness forehead be high white perhaps too like marble to gratify taste of who be fond of flesh blood eye be large exquisitely formed seldom showed much emotion indeed be impassive herself betrayed little of feeling nose be nearly grecian not coming absolutely in straight line from forehead doing so nearly enough to entitle to be considered a classical mouth too be very fine artist at least said so connoisseur in beauty to always seemed a though wanted fulness of lip exquisite symmetry of cheek chin lower face man must deny hair be light being always dressed with considerable care did not detract from appearance lacked that richness give such luxuriance to feminine loveliness be tall slight very graceful in movement there be who thought that wanted ease abandon of youth said that be too composed stiff for age that gave little to society beyond beauty of form face there can be doubt however that be considered by most men woman to be beauty of barsetshire that gentleman from neighbouring county must come many mile through dirty road on mere hope of being able to dance with whatever attraction may have lacked have at rate created for great reputation have spent two month of last spring in london even there have made sensation people have said that lord dumbello lady hartletop eldest son have be peculiarly struck with may be imagined that archdeacon be proud of so indeed be mr grantly more proud perhaps of daughter beauty than so excellent woman must have allowed to be of such attribute griselda be name be now only daughter one sister have have that sister have died there be two brother also left one in church other in army be extent of archdeacon family a archdeacon be very rich man be only child of father who have be bishop of barchester for great many year in year have be worth man while to be bishop of barchester be supposed that miss grantly must have large fortune mr grantly however have be heard to say that be in hurry to see daughter established in world ordinary young lady be merely married of real importance be established if anything added to value of prize mother sometimes depreciate ware by undue solicitude to dispose of to tell truth openly at once virtue for novelist doe not receive very much commendation griselda grantly be to certain extent already given away not that griselda knew anything about that thrice happy gentleman have be made aware of good fortune even have archdeacon be told mr grantly lady lufton have be closeted together more than once term have be signed sealed between not signed on parchment sealed with wax a be case with treaty made by king diplomat to be broken by same signed with little word sealed with certain pressing of hand treaty between two such contracting party must be binding enough by term of treaty griselda grantly be to become lady lufton lady lufton have hitherto be fortunate in matrimonial speculation have selected sir george for daughter sir george with utmost good nature have fallen in with view have selected fanny monsell for mr robarts fanny monsell have not rebelled against for moment there be prestige of success about doings felt almost confident that dear son ludovic must fall in love with griselda a to lady nothing lady lufton thought must be much better than such match for son lady lufton have said be good churchwoman archdeacon be very type of branch of church venerated grantlys too be of good family not noble indeed in such matter lady lufton did not want everything be one of person who in placing hope at moderate pitch may fairly trust to see realized must fain that son wife must be handsome wished for sake that might be proud of wife because men love to look on beauty be afraid of vivacious beauty of soft sparkling feminine charm be spread out a lure for world soft dimple laughing eye luscious lip conscious smile easy whisper what if son must bring home rattling rapid spoken painted piece of eve flesh such a must not glory joy of life be over even though such child of first mother must have come forth to present day ennobled by blood of two dozen successive british peer then too griselda money must not be useless lady lufton with high flown idea be not imprudent woman knew that son have be extravagant though did not believe that have be reckless be well content to think that balsam from old bishop coffer must be made to cure slight wound early imprudence might have inflicted on carcase of family property thus in way for reason griselda grantly have be chosen out from world to be future lady lufton lord lufton have met griselda more than once already have met before high contracting party have come to term whatsoever have evidently admired lord dumbello have remained silent one whole evening in london with ineffable disgust because lord lufton have be rather particular in attention then lord dumbello muteness be most eloquent mode of expression lady hartletop mr grantly when saw knew very well what meant that match must not exactly have suited mr grantly view hartletop people be not in line belonged altogether to set being connected a have heard before with omnium interest horrid gatherum people a lady lufton must say to raising hand eyebrow shaking head lady lufton probably thought that ate baby in pie during midnight orgy at gatherum castle that widow be kept in cell occasionally put on rack for amusement of duke guest when robarts party entered drawing room grantlys be already there archdeacon voice sounded loud imposing in lucy ear a heard speaking while be yet on threshold of door dear lady lufton must believe anything on earth about anything there be nothing too outrageous for have insisted on going there with bishop apron on must not have be surprised then knew that archdeacon be talking about mr proudie for mr proudie be bugbear lady lufton after receiving guest introduced lucy to griselda grantly miss grantly smiled graciously bowed slightly then remarked in lowest voice possible that be exceedingly cold low voice know be excellent thing in woman lucy who thought that be bound to speak said that be cold that did not mind when be walking then griselda smiled again somewhat le graciously than before so conversation ended miss grantly be elder of two having seen most of world must have be best able to talk perhaps be not very anxious for conversation with miss robarts so robarts hear that have be preaching at chaldicotes said archdeacon still rather loudly saw other day told that gave fag end of mr proudie lecture be ill natured of sowerby to say fag end said robarts divided matter into third harold smith took first part last lady intervening portion have electrified county between be told that have best of be so sorry that mr robarts went there said lady lufton a walked into dining room leaning on archdeacon arm be inclined to think must not very well have helped said archdeacon who be never willing to lean heavily on brother parson unless on one who have utterly irrevocably gone away from side of church do think not archdeacon why sowerby be friend of lufton not particularly said poor lady lufton in deprecating tone well have be intimate robarts when be asked to preach at chaldicotes must not well refuse then went afterwards to gatherum castle not that be vexed with at now understand be such dangerous house know so be very fact of duke wishing to have clergyman there must always be taken a sign of grace lady lufton air be impure doubt be le impure with robarts there than must have be without gracious heaven what blasphemy have be saying about impure air why bishop be there yes bishop be there said lady lufton understood other thoroughly lord lufton took out mr grantly to dinner matter be so managed that miss grantly sat on other side there be management apparent in to anybody there be while lucy be placed between brother captain culpepper captain culpepper be man with enormous moustache great aptitude for slaughtering game a have other strong characteristic be not probable that must make very agreeable to poor lucy have seen lord lufton once for two minute since day of walk then have addressed quite like old friend have be in parsonage drawing room fanny have be there fanny now be so well accustomed to lordship that thought little of to lucy have be very pleasant be not forward familiar kind gentle pleasant lucy did feel that liked now on evening have hitherto hardly spoken to then knew that there be other people in company to whom be bound to speak be not exactly humble minded in usual sense of word did recognize fact that position be le important than of other people there that therefore be probable that to certain extent must be overlooked not le must have liked to occupy seat to miss grantly have found way did not want to flirt with lord lufton be not such fool a must have liked to have heard sound of voice close to ear instead of of captain culpepper knife fork be first occasion on have endeavoured to dress with care since father have died now sombre though be in deep mourning did look very well there be expression about forehead be full of poetry fanny have said to husband turn head fanny make believe that be beauty mark have answered doubt be not so easy to turn head mark there be more in lucy than imagine so will find out before long be thus that mr robarts prophesied about sister in law have be asked might perhaps have said that lucy presence must be dangerous to grantly interest at framley court lord lufton voice be audible enough a went on talking to miss grantly voice not word talked in such way that there be appearance of whispering yet person to whom spoke only must hear what said mr grantly while conversed constantly with lucy brother who sat at lucy left hand never lacked for subject on to speak to country clergyman of right sort thus griselda be left quite uninterrupted lucy must not observe that griselda seemed to have very little to say at rate to say very little now then did open mouth word brace of word must fall from for most part seemed to be content in fact that lord lufton be paying attention showed animation sat there still graceful composed classical a always be lucy who must not keep ear from listening eye from looking thought have be there must have endeavoured to take more prominent part in conversation then griselda grantly probably knew much better than lucy did how to comport in situation perhaps might be that young men such a lord lufton liked to hear sound of own voice immense deal of game about here captain culpepper said to towards end of dinner be second attempt have made on former have asked whether knew of fellow of th be there said lucy oh saw lord lufton other day with great armful of pheasant armful why have seven cartload other day at gatherum seven cart full of pheasant said lucy amazed be not so much have eight gun know eight gun will do deal of work when game have be well got together manage capitally at gatherum be at duke eh lucy have heard framley report a to gatherum castle said with sort of shudder that have never be at place after captain culpepper troubled further when lady have taken to drawing room lucy found hardly better off than have be at dinner table lady lufton mr grantly got on to sofa together there chatted confidentially into other ear ladyship have introduced lucy miss grantly then naturally thought that young people might do very well together mr robarts did attempt to bring about joint conversation must include three for ten minute so worked hard at did not thrive miss grantly be monosyllabic smiling however at monosyllable lucy found that nothing must occur to at moment worthy of being spoken there sat still motionless afraid to take up book thinking in heart how much happier must have be at home at parsonage be not made for society felt sure of time must let mark fanny come to framley court by then gentleman came in there be stir in room lady lufton got up bustled about poked fire shifted candle spoke few word to dr grantly whispered something to son patted lucy on cheek told fanny who be musician that must have little music ended by putting two hand on griselda shoulder telling that fit of frock be perfect for lady lufton though did dress old a lucy have said delighted to see around neat pretty jaunty graceful dear lady lufton said griselda putting up hand so a to press end of ladyship finger be first piece of animation have shown lucy robarts watched then there be music lucy played sang fanny did for amateur did well griselda did not sing played did so in manner showed that own labour father money have be spared in instruction lord lufton sang also little captain culpepper very little so that got up concert among in meantime doctor mark stood talking together on rug before fire two mother sat contented watching billing cooings of offspring lucy sat alone turning over leaf of book of picture made up mind fully then there that be quite unfitted by disposition for such work a cared for one one cared for well must go through with now time must know better with own book fireside never felt to be miserable a be now have turned back to music for be sick of seeing lord lufton watch artistic motion of miss grantly finger be sitting at small table a far away from piano a long room must permit when be suddenly roused from reverie of self reproach by voice close behind miss robarts said voice why have cut lucy felt that though heard word plainly nobody else did lord lufton be now speaking to a have before spoken to miss grantly play lord said lucy yet sing must have made company so much more valuable to for be terribly badly off for listener perhaps like music do like sometimes very much when be sometimes will find out in time will have unravelled mystery read riddle by when will say by end of winter will not know have got mystery oh have be very mysterious in to come sit here with back to oh lord lufton if have done wrong poor lucy almost started from chair deep flush came across dark cheek have done wrong be only joking be who have done wrong in leaving to yourself who be greatest stranger among have be very well thank care about being left alone have always be used to ah must break of habit wo allow to make hermit of truth be miss robarts know yet therefore be not quite happy among oh yes be be very good to must let be good to at rate must let be so know that mark have be dear friend since be seven year old wife have be sister dearest friend almost a long now that be with must be dear friend too wo refuse offer will oh said quite in whisper indeed must hardly raise voice above whisper fearing that tear must fall from tell tale eye dr mr grantly will have gone in couple of day then must get down here miss grantly be to remain for christmas two must become bosom friend lucy smiled tried to look pleased felt that griselda grantly must never be bosom friend must never have anything in common between felt sure that griselda despised little brown plain unimportant a be must not despise griselda in turn indeed must not admire miss grantly great beauty dignity of demeanour knew that must never love be hardly possible that proud hearted must love who despise lucy robarts be very proud hearted think be very handsome said lord lufton oh very said lucy nobody can doubt ludovic said lady lufton not quite approving of son remaining so long at back of lucy chair wo give song mr robarts miss grantly be still at piano have sung away that knew mother there be culpepper have not have chance yet have got to give dream how 'dreamt that dwelt in marble hall sang that hour ago said captain not over pleased certainly have not told how 'your little lover came ' captain however must not sing more then party be broken up robartses went home to parsonage chapter xii little bill lucy during last fifteen minute of sojourn in framley court drawing room somewhat modified very strong opinion have before formed a to unfitness for such society be very pleasant sitting there in easy chair while lord lufton stood at back of saying nice soft good natured word to be sure that in little time must feel true friendship for that must do so without risk of falling in love with then have glimmering of idea friendship must be open to manner of remark must hardly be compatible with world ordinary way at rate must be pleasant to be at framley court if must come occasionally notice did not admit to herself that visit must be intolerable if whole time be devoted to griselda grantly neither admitted thought nevertheless in strange unconscious way feeling did find entrance in bosom then christmas holiday passed away how much of enjoyment fell to share how much of suffering endured will not attempt accurately to describe miss grantly remained at framley court up to twelfth night robartses also spent most of season at house lady lufton doubt have hoped that everything might have be arranged on occasion in accordance with wish such have not be case lord lufton have evidently admired miss grantly very much indeed have said so to mother dozen time may almost be questioned whether pleasure lady lufton derived from be not more than neutralized by opinion once put forward that griselda grantly wanted of fire of lucy robarts surely ludovic must never compare two girl said lady lufton of course not be very antipode to other miss grantly must probably be more to taste then be wise enough to know that be so because taste be bad taste know man with more accurate refined taste in such matter said lady lufton beyond did not dare to go knew very well that strategy must be vain must son once learn that have strategy to tell truth lady lufton be becoming somewhat indifferent to lucy robarts have be very kind to little girl little girl seemed hardly to appreciate kindness a must do then lord lufton must talk to lucy be so unnecessary know lucy have got into way of talking quite freely with lord lufton having completely dropped that short spasmodic ugly exclamation of lord so christmas festivity be at end january wore away during greater part of month lord lufton did not remain at framley be nevertheless in county hunting with hound of division staying at various house two three night spent at chaldicotes one let only be told in under voice at gatherum castle of said nothing to lady lufton why make unhappy a said to mark lady lufton knew though said not word to knew be unhappy if must only marry griselda there must be end of danger said to herself now must go back for while to vicar little bill will be remembered that first idea with reference to trouble after reading of father will be to borrow money from brother john john be down at exeter at time be to stay one night at parsonage on way to london mark must broach matter to on journey painful though must be to to tell story of own folly to brother so much younger than who have always looked up to clergyman full blown vicar a be with deference greater than such difference in age required story be told however be told in vain a mark found out before reached framley brother john immediately declared that must lend money of course eight hundred if brother wanted john confessed that a regarded remaining two must like to feel pleasure of immediate possession a for interest must not take take interest from brother of course not well if mark made fuss about supposed must take must rather not mark must have own way do just what liked be very well mark have fully made up mind that brother must not be kept long out of money then arose question how be money to be reached mark be executor one of executor under father will therefore doubt must put hand upon brother wanted five month of being of age must not therefore a yet be put legally in possession of legacy be bore said assistant private secretary to lord petty bag thinking perhaps a much of own immediate wish for ready cash a did of brother necessity mark felt that be bore there be nothing more to be done in direction must now find out how far banker must assist week two after return to framley went over to barchester called there on certain mr forrest manager of one of bank with whom be acquainted with many injunction a to secrecy told manager whole of story at first concealed name of friend sowerby soon appeared that such concealment be of avail be sowerby of course said mr forrest know be intimate with friend go through sooner later seemed to mark a though mr forrest made very light of whole transaction can not possibly pay bill when fall due said mark oh of course not said mr forrest be never very convenient to hand out four hundred pound at blow nobody will expect to pay suppose will have to do sooner later well be a may be will depend partly on how manage with sowerby partly on hand get into a bill have name on will have patience a long a interest be paid commission on renewal doubt will have to be met day by somebody mr forrest said that be sure that bill be not in barchester mr sowerby must not thought have brought to barchester bank bill be probably in london doubtless must be sent to barchester for collection if come in way said mr forrest will give plenty of time so that may manage about renewal with sowerby suppose will pay expense of doing mark heart be somewhat lighter a left bank mr forrest have made so little of whole transaction that felt justified in making little of also may be a well said to a drove home not to tell fanny anything about till three month have run round must make arrangement then in way mind be easier during last of three month than have be during two former that feeling of over due bill of bill coming due of account overdrawn of tradesman unpaid of general money care be very dreadful at first be astonishing how soon men get used to load must crush man at first becomes by habit not only endurable easy comfortable to bearer habitual debtor go along jaunty with elastic step almost enjoying excitement of embarrassment there be mr sowerby who ever saw cloud on brow made one almost in love with ruin to be in company even now already mark robarts be thinking to quite comfortably about bill how very pleasantly banker managed thing pay one will be so unreasonable a to expect to do then mr sowerby certainly be pleasant fellow gave man something in return for money be still question with mark whether lord lufton have not be too hard on sowerby have that gentleman fallen across clerical friend at present moment might no doubt have gotten from acceptance for four hundred pound one be almost inclined to believe that there be something pleasurable in excitement of such embarrassment a there be also in excitement of drink then at last time doe come when excitement be over when nothing misery be left if there be existence of wretchedness on earth must be that of elderly worn out roue who have run race of debt bill of accommodation acceptance of what if be not in day somewhat afraid of good broad english might call lying swindling falsehood fraud who having ruined whom must have loved having burnt up one who must trust much scorched who must trust little be at last left to finish life with such bread water a men get without one honest thought to strengthen sinking heart one honest friend to hold shivering hand if man must only think of a put name to first little bill a to be so good naturedly assured that can easily be renewed when three month have nearly run out so happened that robarts met friend sowerby mark have once twice ridden with lord lufton a far a meet of hound may perhaps have gone field two farther on occasion reader must not think that have taken to hunting a parson do be singular enough that whenever do so always show special aptitude for pursuit a though hunting be employment peculiarly congenial with cure of soul in country thought must do vicar injustice when lord lufton must ask what on earth must be harm of riding along road to look at hound hardly knew what sensible answer to give lordship must be absurd to say that time must be better employed at home in clerical matter for be notorious that have not clerical pursuit for employment of time in way therefore have got into habit of looking at hound keeping up acquaintance in county meeting lord dumbello mr green walker harold smith other such like sinner on one such occasion a three month be nearly closing did meet mr sowerby look here sowerby want to speak to for moment be doing about bill bill bill what bill bill whole bill nothing bill seems to be conversation now day of men morning noon night know bill signed for for four hundred pound did though be not that rather green of did seem strange to mark must really be fact that mr sowerby have so many bill flying about that have absolutely forgotten occurrence in gatherum castle bedroom then to be called green by very man whom have obliged perhaps be said mark in tone showed that be somewhat piqued same must be glad to know how will be taken up oh mark what ruffian be to spoil day sport in way man parson must be too good christian for such intense cruelty let see four hundred pound oh yes tozer have what will tozer do with make money of way may go to work will do will tozer bring to on th oh lord upon word mark be deliciously green cat must a soon think of killing mouse directly got into claw joking apart need not trouble maybe will hear no more about perhaps doubt be more probable may have to send to to be renewed need hing till hear from somebody else only let one come down upon for money there be not slightest fear of tally ho old fellow be away tally ho right over by gossetts ' barn come along never mind tozer beufficient for day be evil thereof away went together parson member of parliament then again on occasion mark went home with sort of feeling that bill did not matter tozer must manage somehow be quite clear that must not do to tell wife of just at present on st of month of february however did receive reminder that bill concerning have not merely be farce be letter from mr sowerby dated from chaldicotes though not bearing barchester post mark in gentleman suggested renewal not exactly of old bill of new one seemed to mark that letter have be posted in london if give entire will perhaps most quickly explain purport chaldicotes th february dear mark lend not thy name to money dealer for same be destruction snare if be not in proverb ought to be tozer have given certain sign of being alive strong cold weather a can of take up bill for l at moment must renew pay commission interest with rest of perquisite picking stealing from can assure tozer doe not keep hand a must do to cover other little outstanding trifle have filled in new bill for l making due rd of may next before time certain accident will trust have occurred to impoverished friend by by never told how went off from gatherum castle morning after left with gresham cart rope must not hold even though duke held did with strength of ducal hand must go to meet doctor of theirs so be put off for time think that matter stand in good train lose post in sending back bill accepted a tozer may annoy nay undoubtedly will if matter be not in hand duly signed by of day after to morrow be ungrateful brute have lived on for eight year must not let off single squeeze now to save life be specially anxious to save from annoyance cost of lawyer letter if delayed might get into paper put under cover to at duke street st james will be in town by time good bye old fellow be decent brush have other day from cobbold ash wish must get brown horse from must not mind going to hundred thirty yours ever n sowerby when mark have read through looked down on table to see whether old bill have fallen from letter there be enclosure have be no enclosure new bill then read letter through again found that there be word about old bill not syllable at least a to whereabouts sowerby did not even say that must remain in own hand mark did not in truth know much about such thing might be that very fact of signing second document must render that first document null void from sowerby silence on subject might be argued that be so well known to be case that have not thought of explaining yet mark must not see how must be so what be to do threat of cost lawyer specially of newspaper did have effect upon a doubt be intended to do then be utterly dumfounded by sowerby impudence in drawing on for l instead of l covering a sowerby so good humouredly said sundry little outstanding trifle at last did sign bill sent off a sowerby have directed what else be to do fool that be man always can do right even though have done wrong before that previous wrong add so much difficulty to path difficulty increase in tremendous ratio till man at last be choked in struggling be drowned beneath water then put away sowerby letter carefully locking up from wife sight be letter parish clergyman must have received so much acknowledged to nevertheless be necessary that must keep now again for few hour affair made very miserable chapter xiii delicate hint lady lufton have be greatly rejoiced at good deed son did in giving up leicestershire hunting coming to reside for winter at framley be proper becoming comfortable in extreme english nobleman ought to hunt in county where owns field over ride ought to receive respect honour due to from own tenant ought to sleep under roof of own ought also so lady lufton thought to fall in love with young embryo bride of own mother choosing then be so pleasant to have there in house lady lufton be not woman who allowed life to be what people in common parlance call dull have too many duty thought too much of to allow of suffering from tedium ennui nevertheless house be more joyous to when be there there be reason for little gaiety must never have be attracted thither by nevertheless did enjoy when be brought about by presence be younger brighter when be there thinking more of future le of past must look at that alone be happiness to then be pleasant mannered with joking with on little old world prejudice in tone be musical to ear a coming from smiling on reminding of smile have loved so dearly when a yet be own lying there in little bed beside chair be kind gracious to behaving like good son at rate while be there in presence when add to fear that might not be so perfect in conduct when absent may well imagine that lady lufton be pleased to have there at framley court have hardly said word to a to five thousand pound many night a lay thinking on pillow said to herself that money have ever be better expended since have brought back to own house have thanked for in own open way declaring that must pay back to during coming year comforting heart by rejoicing that property have not be sold like idea of parting with acre of have said of course not ludovic never let estate decrease in hand be only by such resolution a english nobleman english gentleman can preserve country can not bear to see property changing hand well suppose be good thing to have land in market sometimes so that millionnaires may know what to do with money god forbid yours must be there widow made little mental prayer that son acre might be protected from millionnaires other philistine why yes exactly want to see jew tailor investing earnings at lufton said lord heaven forbid said widow a have said be very nice be manifest to ladyship from lordship way of talking that vital injury have a yet be done have care on mind spoke freely about property nevertheless there be cloud even now at period of bliss somewhat obscured brilliancy of lady lufton sky why be ludovic so slow in affair of griselda grantly why so often in latter winter day did saunter over to parsonage then terrible visit to gatherum castle what actually did happen at gatherum castle never knew however be more intrusive le delicate in inquiry can say have very bad day sport with west barsetshire county be altogether short of fox one who understands matter must take point up before can do good after that have have rather dull dinner with duke sowerby have be there in evening sowerby have played billiards sowerby have won pound two have be extent of damage done saunterings over to parsonage might be more dangerous not that ever occurred to lady lufton a possible that son must fall in love with lucy robarts lucy personal attraction be not of nature to give ground for fear a might turn girl head with chatter might be fool enough to fancy folly moreover people must talk why must go to parsonage now more frequently than have ever done before lucy came there then ladyship in reference to same trouble hardly knew how to manage invitation to parsonage hitherto have be very frequent have be in habit of thinking that must hardly be too much so now be almost afraid to continue custom must not ask parson wife without lucy when lucy be there son must pas greater part of evening in talking to playing chess with now did disturb lady lufton not little then lucy took so quietly on first arrival at framley have be so shy so silent so much awestruck by grandeur of framley court that lady lufton have sympathized with encouraged have endeavoured to moderate blaze of own splendour in order that lucy unaccustomed eye might not be dazzled be changed now lucy must listen to young lord voice by hour together without being dazzled in least under circumstance two thing occurred to must speak to son to fanny robarts by little diplomacy have evil remedied then have to determine on step must take nothing must be more reasonable than ludovic so at least said to herself over over again then ludovic understood nothing about such matter have habit inherited from father of taking bit between teeth whenever suspected interference drive gently without pulling mouth about might take anywhere almost at pace smart touch let be ever so slight must bring on haunch then might be question whether must get mile day so that on whole lady lufton thought that other plan must be best have doubt that lady lufton be right got fanny up into own den one afternoon seated discreetly in easy arm chair making guest take off bonnet showing by various sign that visit be regarded a one of great moment fanny said want to speak to about something be important necessary to mention yet be very delicate affair to speak of fanny opened eye said that hoped that nothing be wrong dear think nothing be wrong hope so think may say be sure of then be always well to be on one guard yes be said fanny who knew that something unpleasant be coming something a to might probably be called upon to differ from ladyship mr robarts own fear however be running entirely in direction of husband indeed lady lufton have word two to say on subject also only not exactly now hunting parson be not at to taste matter might be allowed to remain in abeyance for few day now fanny know that have liked sister in law lucy very much then mr robarts mind be immediately opened knew rest a well a though have be spoken need hardly tell that for be sure have shown have indeed a always do must not think that be going to complain continued lady lufton hope there be nothing to complain of said fanny speaking by mean in defiant tone humbly a be deprecating ladyship wrath fanny have gained one signal victory over lady lufton on account with prudence equal to generosity felt that must afford to be submissive might perhaps not be long before must be equally anxious to conquer again well no think there be said lady lufton nothing to complain of little chat between may perhaps set matter right otherwise might become troublesome be about lucy yes dear about lucy be very nice good girl credit to father great comfort to said fanny be sure be must be very pleasant companion to so useful about child then lady lufton paused for moment for eloquent discreet a always be felt rather at loss for word to express exact meaning know what must do without said fanny speaking with object of assisting ladyship in embarrassment truth be lord lufton be getting into way of being too much together of talking to other too exclusively be sure must have noticed fanny be not that suspect evil think that be suspicious by nature oh said fanny will of get wrong idea about other about lucy will perhaps think that ludovic mean more than doe ludovic will be not quite so easy to say what ludovic might do think lady went on be sure that understand fanny with excellent sense tact lucy be clever amusing ludovic like young men be perhaps ignorant that attention may be taken to mean more than intends think that lucy be in love with oh dear nothing of kind if thought have come to must recommend that must be sent away altogether be sure be not so foolish a think there be anything in at lady lufton think there be dear therefore must not for world make suggestion about to lord lufton must not let suppose that suspected lucy of being so imprudent still may be well that must just say word to little management now then in such matter be so useful what will say to just explain to that young lady who talk so much to same young gentleman will certainly be observed that people will accuse of setting cap at lord lufton not that suspect give credit for too much proper feeling know education have be good principle be upright people will talk of must understand fanny a well a do fanny must not help meditating whether proper feeling education upright principle did forbid lucy robarts to fall in love with lord lufton doubt on subject if held be not communicated to ladyship have never entered into mind that match be possible between lord lufton lucy robarts have slightest wish to encourage now that idea be suggested to on matter must sympathize with lady lufton though did not completely agree with a to expediency of interference nevertheless at once offered to speak to lucy think lucy have idea in head upon subject said mr robarts dare say not suppose have young lady sometimes allow to fall in love then to think very ill used just because have have idea in head will put on guard if wish lady lufton exactly dear be just put on guard be be necessary be dear good clever girl must be very sad if anything be to interrupt comfortable way of getting on with mr robarts knew to nicety exact meaning of threat if lucy must persist in securing to herself so much of lord lufton time attention visit to framley court must become le frequent lady lufton must do much very much indeed for friend at parsonage not even for must permit son prospect in life to be endangered there be nothing more said between mr robarts got up to take leave having promised to speak to lucy manage everything so perfectly said lady lufton a pressed mr robarts hand that be quite at ease now that find will agree with mr robarts did not exactly agree with ladyship hardly thought worth while to say so mr robarts immediately started off on walk to own home when have got out of ground into road where make turn towards parsonage nearly opposite to podgens shop saw lord lufton on horseback lucy standing beside be already nearly five o'clock be getting dusk a approached rather a came suddenly within sight of must see that be in close conversation lord lufton face be towards horse be standing still be leaning over towards companion whip held in right hand hung almost over arm down back a though hand have touched perhaps rested on shoulder be standing by side looking up into face with one gloved hand resting on horse neck mr robarts a saw must not own that there might be cause for lady lufton fear then lucy manner a mr robarts approached be calculated to dissipate such fear to prove that there be ground for did not move from position allow hand to drop show that be in way confused conscious stood ground when sister in law came up be smiling at ease lord lufton want to learn to ride said to learn to ride said fanny not knowing what answer to make to proposition yes said horse must carry beautifully be a quiet a lamb made gregory go out with yesterday with sheet hanging over like lady habit man got up into lady saddle think gregory must make better hand of than lucy horse cantered with a though have carried lady life mouth be like velvet indeed be fault be too soft mouthed suppose be same sort of thing a man being soft hearted said lucy exactly ought to ride with very light hand be difficult cattle to manage very pleasant when know how to do see know how to do said lucy a regard horse will learn in two day do hope will try think will be excellent thing for mr robarts lucy have got habit said mr robarts making use of excuse common on such occasion there be one of justinia in house know always leaf one here in order that may be able to ride when come must not think of taking such liberty with lady meredith thing said fanny almost frightened at proposal of course be out of question fanny said lucy now speaking rather seriously in first place must not take lord lufton horse in second place must not take lady meredith habit in third place must be great deal too much frightened lastly be quite out of question for great many other very good reason nonsense said lord lufton great deal of nonsense said lucy laughing of of lord lufton talking be getting cold be not fanny so will wish good night then two lady shook hand with walked on towards parsonage astonished mr robarts most in be perfectly collected manner in lucy spoke conducted connected a must not connect with air of chagrin with lord lufton received lucy decision made manifest to mr robarts that lord lufton be annoyed because lucy must not consent to learn to ride whereas lucy have given refusal in firm decided tone a though resolved that nothing more must be said about walked on in silence for minute two till reached parsonage gate then lucy said laughing ca fancy sitting on great big horse wonder what lady lufton must say if saw there lordship giving first lesson think must like said fanny be sure must not will not try temper in respect sometimes fancy that doe not even like seeing lord lufton talking to doe not like lucy when see flirting with mr robarts said rather gravely whereas lucy have be speaking in half bantering tone a soon a even word flirting be out of fanny mouth be conscious that have be guilty of injustice in using have wished to say something must convey to sister in law idea of what lady lufton must dislike in doing so have unintentionally brought against accusation flirting fanny said lucy standing still in path looking up into companion face with eye do mean to say have be flirting with lord lufton did not say that have allowed to flirt with did not mean to shock lucy what did mean fanny why just lady lufton must not be pleased if paid marked attention if received just like affair of riding be better to decline of course declined of course never dreamt of accepting such offer go riding about country on horse what have done fanny that must suppose thing have done nothing dearest then why did speak a did just now because wished to put on guard know lucy that intend to find fault with may be sure a rule that intimate friendship between young gentleman young lady be dangerous thing then walked up to hall door in silence when have reached lucy stood in doorway instead of entering said fanny let take turn together if be not tired be not tired will be better must understand at once then again moved away from house tell truly now do think that lord lufton have be flirting do think that be little inclined to flirt with lady lufton have be asking to lecture about poor mr robarts hardly knew what to say thought well of person concerned be very anxious to behave well by of be particularly anxious to create ill feeling wished that everybody must be

a well a used to do be nice sort of hunter just rising six know how came to pas that price of splendid animal be mentioned between need not describe with exactness did come to pas mr sowerby told parson that horse must be for l really wish 'd take said sowerby must be mean of partially relieving mind of great weight mark looked up into friend face with air of surprise for did not at moment

when tozer come to horse be dog cheap will have long day for money mark at first declared in quiet determined tone that did not want horse afterwards appeared to that if be so fated that must pay portion of mr sowerby debt might a well repay to extent within power must be a well perhaps that must take horse sell did not occur to that by so doing must put in mr sowerby power to say that valuable consideration have passed between with reference to bill that must be aiding gentleman in preparing inextricable confusion of money matter between mr sowerby well knew value of must enable to make plausible story a have done in other case of lord lufton be going to have dandy sowerby said to again ca say will just at present said parson what must want of now season over exactly dear fellow what do want of now season over if be beginning of october instead of end of march dandy must be up at two hundred thirty instead of one in six month time that horse will be worth anything like to ask

possible even mr gamp have fault in first place be bad feeder one certainly doe often come across anything much better than mr gamp thus matter be talked over between with much stable conversation of tended to make sowerby more more oblivious of friend sacred profession perhaps to make vicar too frequently oblivious of also be not oblivious of be even mindful of mindful of in manner that thought on subject be nowadays always painful there be parish called hogglestock lying away quite in northern extremity of eastern division of county lying also on border of western division almost fear that will become necessary before history be completed to provide map of barsetshire for due explanation of locality framley be also in northern portion of county just to south of grand trunk line of railway from branch to barchester strike off at point thirty mile nearer to london station for framley court be silverbridge be however in western division of county hogglestock be to north of railway line of however run through portion of parish adjoins framley though church be a much a seven mile apart barsetshire taken altogether be pleasant green tree becrowded county with large bosky hedge pretty damp deep lane road with broad grass margin running along such be general nature of county just up in northern extremity nature alters there be bleak ugly with low artificial hedge without wood not uncultivated a be portioned out into new looking large field bearing turnip wheat mangel in due course of agricultural rotation have none of special beauty of english cultivation there be not gentleman house in parish of hogglestock besides of clergyman though be certainly house of gentleman can hardly be said to be fit to be so be ugly straight small there be garden attached to house half in front of half behind garden like rest of parish be by mean ornamental though sufficiently useful produce cabbage tree potato of believe excellent description hardly flower nothing worthy of name of shrub indeed whole parish of hogglestock must have be in adjoining county be by mean so attractive a barsetshire fact well known to few of reader who be well acquainted with own country mr crawley whose name have be mentioned in page be incumbent of hogglestock on principle remuneration of parish clergyman be settled when original settlement be made deepest keenest lover of middle aged ecclesiastical black letter learning can take now say that priest be to be paid from tithe of parish produce out of tithe certain other good thing be to be bought paid for such a church repair education of so much most of have inkling that rector being big sort of parson owned tithe of parish in full at rate that part of intended for clergyman that vicar be somebody deputy therefore entitled only to little tithe a being little body of so much be simple in such matter have general idea one can not conceive that even in way approximation must have be made even in old mediaeval day towards fair proportioning of pay to work at rate be clear enough that there be such approximation now what screech must there not be among clergy of church even in reforming day if over bold reformer be to suggest that approximation must be attempted who know clergyman like have lived with only fancy clergyman to be paid not according to temporality of living may have acquired either by merit favour in accordance with work to be done o doddington o stanhope think of if idea so sacrilegious can find entrance into warm ecclesiastical bosom ecclesiastical work to be bought paid for according to quantity quality nevertheless one may prophesy that englishman must come to disagreeable a idea undoubtedly be most pleasant minded churchman feel think on subject pretty much in same way present arrangement of parochial income be beloved a being time honoured gentlemanlike english picturesque must fain adhere to closely a long a can know that do so by force of prejudice not by of judgment time honoured gentlemanlike english picturesque arrangement be so far very delightful be there not other attribute very desirable nay absolutely necessary in respect to time honoured picturesque arrangement be so very deficient how pleasant be too that one bishop must be getting fifteen thousand year with equal cure of parson only four that certain prelate must get twenty thousand one year successor in same diocese only five next there be something in pleasant picturesque be arrangement endowed with feudal charm change have made be distasteful to many of bishop with regular salary appanage of land land bailiff be only bishop let man prove to contrary ever so thoroughly let prove to own self ever so often heart in matter be not thereby whit altered one liked to know that there

necessary working clergyman may live into portion so infinitesimally small that working clergyman can hardly live full blown rector vicar with full blown tithe with tithe when too full blown for strict utilitarian principle will necessarily follow stanhope doddington must bow head with such compensation for temporal right a may be extracted probably without such compensation a may be desired in other trade profession line of life men be paid according to work let be so in church such will sooner later be edict of utilitarian reforming matter of fact house of parliament have scheme of own on subject will not introduce here seeing that men woman must read with reference to matter will only here further explain that word have be brought about by fact necessary to be here stated that mr

perhaps hardest of that man may do for ten year earned seventy pound year will one say that received fair wage for fair work let be married single yet there be so many who must fain pay clergy if only knew how to apply money be long subject a mr robarts have told miss dunstable such be mr crawley in cornish curacy chapter xv lady lufton ambassador then in day followed that friend of mr crawley whose name by by be yet to be mentioned received quick great promotion mr arabin by name be then dr arabin afterwards when quick great promotion reached climax have be simply fellow of lazarus in former year then became vicar of st ewold in east barsetshire have not yet got settled there when married widow bold widow with belonging in land funded money with one small baby a encumbrance have even yet married have only engaged so to do when made dean of barchester may be read in diocesan county chronicle now that be wealthy new dean did contrive to pay debt of poor friend lawyer of camelford assisting be paltry schedule after amounting in total to something not much above hundred pound then in course of eighteen month poor piece of preferment fell in dean way incumbency of hogglestock with stipend reaching one hundred thirty pound year even be worth double cornish curacy there be moreover house attached to poor mr crawley when heard of thought that struggle of poverty be now well nigh over what might not be done with hundred thirty pound by people who have lived for ten year on seventy so moved away out of cold bleak country carrying with humble household god settled in country cold bleak also le terribly so than former settled again began struggle against man hardness devil zeal have said that mr crawley be stern unpleasant man certainly be so man must be made of very sterling stuff whom continued undeserved misfortune doe not make unpleasant man have so far succumbed to grief that have left upon mark palpable not to be effaced cared little for society judging men to be doing evil who did care for knew a fact believed with heart that sorrow have come to from hand of god that must work for weal in long run not le did make morose silent dogged have always at heart feeling that have be ill used too often solaced at devil bidding with conviction that eternity must make equal that life in world have made so unequal last bait that with devil angle after who be struggling to elude rod line framley property did not run into parish of hogglestock nevertheless lady lufton did what must in way of kindness to new comer providence have not supplied hogglestock with lady lufton with substitute in shape of lord lady squire squire hogglestock farmer male female be rude rough set not bordering in social rank on farmer gentle lady lufton knowing hearing something of crawleys from mr arabin dean wife trimmed lamp so that must shed wider light pour forth of influence on forlorn household a regard mr crawley lady lufton by mean found that work good will be thrown away mr crawley accepted kindness with thankfulness returned to of softness of life under hand a for dining at framley court be out of question mr crawley knew must not hear of even if other thing be fitting appliance be at command indeed mr crawley at once said that felt unfit to go through ceremony with anything like comfort dean said must talk of going to stay at deanery thought quite impossible that of must endure even same lady lufton be comfort to poor woman felt that be well to have lady near in case of need task be much harder with mr crawley even with be not altogether unsuccessful lady lufton talked to of parish of own made mark robarts go to by degree did something towards civilizing between robarts too there grew up intimacy rather than friendship robarts must submit to opinion on matter of ecclesiastical even theological law must listen to with patience must agree with where must differ from mildly when must not for robarts be man who made pleasant to men thus under lady lufton wing there grew up connection between framley hogglestock in mr robarts also assisted now that lady lufton be looking about to see how might best bring proper clerical influence to bear upon own recreant fox hunting parson occurred to that might use mr crawley in matter mr crawley must certainly be on side a far a opinion went must have fear a to expressing opinion to brother clergyman so sent for mr crawley in appearance be very opposite to mark robarts be lean slim meagre man with shoulder slightly curved pale lank long lock of ragged hair forehead be high face be narrow small grey eye be deeply sunken in head nose be well formed lip thin mouth expressive nobody must look at without seeing that there be purpose meaning in countenance always wore in summer winter long dusky gray coat buttoned close up to neck descended almost to heel be full six foot high being so slight in build looked a though be taller came at once at lady lufton bidding putting into gig beside servant to whom spoke single word during journey man looking into face be struck with taciturnity now mark robarts must have talked with whole way from hogglestock to framley court discoursing partly a to horse land partly also a to higher thing then lady lufton opened mind told grief to mr crawley urging however through whole length of narrative that mr robarts be excellent parish clergyman just clergyman in church a must wish to be explained with view of saving from expression of of mr crawley special idea a to church teaching of confining to one subject matter in hand got living so young mr crawley that be hardly quite a steady a must wish to be have be a much fault a own in placing in position so early in life think have said mr crawley who might perhaps be little sore on subject quite so quite so continued ladyship swallowing down with gulp certain sense of anger be done now be past cure mr robarts will become credit to profession doubt for heart be in right place sentiment be good fear that at present be succumbing to temptation be told that hunt two three time week everybody round be talking about mr crawley not two three time week very seldom above once think then do believe doe more with view of being with lord lufton than anything else can not see that must make matter better said mr crawley must show that be not strongly imbued with taste can not regard a vicious in clergyman must be vicious in men said mr crawley be in cruel lead to idleness profligacy again lady lufton made gulp have called mr crawley thither to aid felt that must be inexpedient to quarrel with did not like to be told that son amusement be idle profligate have always regarded hunting a proper pursuit for country gentleman be indeed in eye one of peculiar institution of country life in england may be almost said that looked upon barsetshire hunt a something sacred must not endure to hear that fox be trapped allowed turkey to be purloined without groan such being case did not like being told that be vicious have by mean wished to consult mr crawley on matter nevertheless swallowed down wrath be at rate unbecoming in clergyman said a know that mr robarts place high value on opinion perhaps will not object to advise to discontinue might possibly feel aggrieved be to interfere personally on question have doubt must said mr crawley be not within woman province to give counsel to clergyman on subject unless be very near very dear to wife mother sister a living in same parish know being perhaps leading person in one who naturally rule others must have be fitting word for expression of ladyship idea remembered did not use have made up mind great a influence ought to be be not proper person to speak to mr robarts a to pernicious unclerical habit must not now depart from resolve by attempting to prove that be proper person yes said mr crawley just so must entitle to offer counsel if thought that mode of life be such a to require must by mean justify in addressing to be very hard upon lady lufton be endeavouring with woman strength to do best endeavouring so to do that feeling of sinner might be spared yet ghostly comforter whom have evoked to aid treated a though be arrogant overbearing acknowledged weakness of own position with reference to parish clergyman by calling in aid of mr crawley under such circumstance might at rate have abstained from throwing weakness in teeth well sir hope mode of life may not require be not exactly to point what wish to know be whether will speak to mr robarts certainly will said then will be much obliged to mr crawley pray pray remember must not on account wish that must be harsh with be excellent young man lady lufton if do can only do in own way a best may using such word a god may give at time hope that be harsh to man be worse than useless in case to speak anything truth of course of course if ear be too delicate to hear truth mind will be too perverse to profit by then mr crawley got up to take leave lady lufton insisted that must go with to luncheon hummed have 'd must fain have refused on subject be peremptory might be that be unfit to advise clergyman a to duty in matter of hospitality did know what be about mr crawley must not leave house without refreshment a to carried point mr crawley when matter before be cold roast beef hot potato instead of relative position of parish priest parishioner became humble submissive almost timid lady lufton recommended madeira instead of sherry mr crawley obeyed at once be indeed perfectly unconscious of difference then there be basket of seakale in gig for mr crawley that must have left behind have dared did not dare not word be said to a to marmalade for child be hidden under seakale lady lufton feeling well aware that must find way to proper destination without necessity for co operation then mr crawley returned home in framley court gig three four day after walked over to framley parsonage did on saturday having learned that hound never hunted on day started early so that might be sure to catch mr robarts before went out on parish business be quite early enough to attain object for when reached parsonage door at about half past nine vicar with wife sister be just sitting down to breakfast oh crawley said robarts before other have well spoken be capital fellow then got into chair mr robarts have poured out tea lucy have surrendered to knife plate before knew under what guise to excuse coming among hope will excuse intrusion at last muttered have few word of business to will request attention presently certainly said robarts conveying broiled kidney on to plate before mr crawley there be preparation for business like good breakfast lucy hand mr crawley buttered toast egg fanny where be egg then john in livery brought in fresh egg now will do always eat egg while be hot crawley advise to do same to mr crawley said very little be not at at home under circumstance perhaps thought did pas across brain a to difference between meal have left on own table now saw before a to cause might exist for such difference if so be very fleeting thought for have far other matter now fully occupying mind then breakfast be over in few minute two clergyman found together in parsonage study mr robarts began senior when have seated uncomfortably on one of ordinary chair at farther side of well stored library table while mark be sitting at ease in own arm chair by fire have called upon on unpleasant business mark mind immediately flew off to mr sowerby bill must not think possible that mr crawley must have have anything to do with a brother clergyman a one who esteem much wish well have thought bound to take matter in hand what matter be crawley mr robarts men say that present mode of life be one be not befitting soldier in christ army men say so what men men around of own neighbourhood who watch life know doings who look to see walking a lamp to guide foot find consorting with horse jockey hunter galloping after hound taking place among vainest of worldly pleasure seeker who have right to expect example of good living who think that see mr crawley have gone at once to root of matter in doing so have certainly made own task so much easier there be nothing like going to root of matter at once when one have on hand unpleasant piece of business have such men deputed to come here one have must depute have come to speak own mind not that of other refer to what around think say because be to that duty be due owe to around to live godly cleanly life a owe also in much higher way to father who be in heaven now make bold to ask whether be doing best to lead life a then remained silent waiting for answer be singular man so humble meek so unutterably inefficient awkward in ordinary intercourse of life so bold enterprising almost eloquent on one subject be work of mind a sat there looked into companion face from out sunken grey eye with gaze made victim quail then repeated word now make bold to ask mr robarts whether be doing best to lead life a may become parish clergyman among parishioner again paused for answer there be few of said mark in low tone who must safely answer question in affirmative be there many think among who must find question so unanswerable a yourself even be there many must young enterprising talented a be be content to be numbered among be satisfied to be castaway after have taken upon christ armour if will say so be mistaken in will go way there be again pause then went on speak to brother open heart if be possible rising from chair walked across room laid hand tenderly on mark shoulder mark have be sitting lounging in chair have at first for moment only thought to brazen out idea of brazening have now left have raised from comfortable ease be leaning forward with elbow on table now when heard word allowed head to sink upon arm buried face between hand be terrible falling off continued crawley terrible in fall doubly terrible through difficulty of returning can not be that must content to place a one among thoughtless sinner for crushing of whose sin have be placed here among become hunting parson ride with happy mind among blasphemer mocking devil whose aspiration be so high who have spoken so often so well of duty of minister of christ who can argue in pride a to petty detail of church a though broad teaching of great simple lesson be not enough for energy can not be have have hypocrite beside in eager controversy not hypocrite not hypocrite said mark in tone be almost reduced to sobbing castaway be so must call mr robarts not castaway hypocrite castaway one who in walking have stumbled in dark bruised foot among stone henceforth let take lantern in hand look warily to path walk cautiously among thorn rock cautiously yet boldly with manly courage christian meekness a men must walk on pilgrimage through vale of tear then without giving companion time to stop hurried out of room from house without again seeing others of family stalked back on road to hogglestock thus tramping fourteen mile through deep mud in performance of mission on have be sent be hour before mr robarts left room a soon a found that crawley be really gone that must see more turned lock of door sat down to think over present life at about eleven wife knocked not knowing whether other strange clergyman be there for none have seen departure mark answering cheerily desired that might be left to study let hope that thought mental resolve be then of service to chapter xvi mr podgens baby hunting season have now nearly passed away great one of barsetshire world be thinking of glory of london of glory lady lufton always thought with much inquietude of mind must fain have remained throughout whole year at framley court did not certain grave consideration render course on part improper in own estimation lady luftons of whom have heard dowager ante dowager have always have season in london till old age have incapacitated for such doings sometimes for clearly long after arrival of such period then have idea perhaps not altogether erroneous that annually imported back with into country somewhat of passing civilization of time may not say idea that certainly be not erroneous for how otherwise be that form of new cap remodelled shape for woman waist find way down into agricultural part that rural eye learns to appreciate grace beauty there be who think that remodelled waist new cap have better be kept to town such people if must follow out own argument must wish to see ploughboy painted with ruddle milkmaid covered with skin for other reason lady lufton always went to london in april stayed there till beginning of june for be usually period of penance in london be very great personage have never laid out for greatness of sort did not shine a lady patroness state secretary in female cabinet of fashion be dull listless without congenial pursuit in london spent happiest moment in reading account of what be being done at framley in writing order for further local information of same kind on occasion there be matter of vital import to give interest of own to visit to town be to entertain griselda grantly a far a might be possible to induce son to remain in griselda society plan of campaign be to be a follows mr grantly archdeacon be in first place to go up to london for month taking griselda with then when returned to plumstead griselda be to go to lady lufton arrangement be not at point agreeable to lady lufton for knew that mr grantly did not turn back on hartletop people quite a cordially a must do considering term of lufton grantly family treaty then mr grantly might have alleged in excuse slow manner in lord lufton proceeded in making declaring of love absolute necessity there be for two string to one bow when one string may be in way doubtful must be possible that mr grantly have heard anything of unfortunate platonic friendship with lucy robarts there came letter from mr grantly just about end of march added much to lady lufton uneasiness made more than ever anxious to be on scene of action to have griselda in own hand after communication of mere ordinary importance with reference to london world in general lufton grantly world in particular mr grantly wrote confidentially about daughter must be useless to deny said with mother pride mother humility that be very much admired be asked out great deal more than can take to house to by mean wish to go must not refuse a to lady hartletop first ball for there will be nothing else year like of course when with dear lady lufton that house will be out of question so indeed must be with be only concerned duke be there of course really wonder lady hartletop must not be more discreet in own drawing room when world be there be clear to that lord dumbello admires griselda much more than must wish dear girl have such excellent sense think likely that head must be turned by with how many girl must not admiration of such man be irresistible marquis know be very feeble be told that since rage for building have come on lancashire property be over two hundred thousand year think that lord dumbello have said much to indeed seems to that never doe say much to one always stand up to dance with see that be uneasy fidgety when stand up with other partner whom must care about be really embarrassing to see other night at miss dunstable when griselda be dancing with certain friend of ours did look very well that evening have seldom seen more animated great deal more of same sort in same letter tended to make lady lufton anxious to be in london be quite certain there be doubt of at rate that griselda must see more of lady hartletop meretricious grandeur when have be transferred to lady lufton guardianship lady lufton did wonder that mr grantly must have taken daughter to house about lady hartletop be known to world be known that be almost only house in london at duke of omnium be constantly to be met lady lufton must almost a soon think of taking young girl to gatherum castle on account did feel rather angry with friend mr grantly then perhaps did not sufficiently calculate that mr grantly letter have be written purposely to produce such feeling with express view of awakening ladyship to necessity of action indeed in such matter a mr grantly be more able woman than lady lufton more able to see way to follow out lufton grantly alliance be in mind best seeing that did not regard money a everything failing that hartletop grantly alliance be not bad regarding a second string to bow thought that be not at bad lady lufton reply be very affectionate declared how happy be to know griselda be enjoying insinuated that lord dumbello be known to world a fool mother a being not bit better than ought to be then added that circumstance must bring up to town four day sooner than have expected that hoped dear

lady lufton lady lufton did not occur to when wrote last word intending that must have so strong effect on mind of correspondent that be telling tarradiddle be not case that have said to son in own dear kind motherly way ludovic will see something of in bruton street year will not griselda grantly will be with must not let be dull must then have not answered oh of course mother sauntered out of room not altogether graciously have said word about parliamentary duty not word o lady lufton have not now written tarradiddle to friend in day be becoming very strict about truth with child terribly strict occasionally when consider natural weakness of moral courage at age of ten twelve fourteen know that be at increasing measure of strictness with grown up people regulate own truth falsehood heaven forbid must be thought to advocate falsehood in child untruth be more pardonable in than in parent lady lufton tarradiddle be of nature be usually considered excusable at least with grown people nevertheless must have be nearer to perfection must have confined to truth let suppose that boy be to write home from school saying that boy have promised to come stay with that other having given such promise what very naughty boy must that first boy be in eye of pastor master little conversation between lord lufton mother in nothing be said about lordship parliamentary duty took place

not leave alone to choose for own friend own did not fill up void why tell lord lufton be not to choose own friend though be among best purest of god creature lucy can not think that have ceased to have regard for that have regard for be sure felt that be almost unmanly of thus to seek out hunt down then throw upon whole weight of explanation that coming thither made necessary nevertheless truth

parson sister set cap at young lord that young lord have made fool of world will say such thing said lord lufton very imperiously ah will can no more stop than king canute must water mother have interfered wisely to spare from only favour that can ask be that will spare also then got up a though intended at once to walk forth to visit to mr podgens baby stop lucy said putting between door

say with hand on heart that can not will not love then must beg to let go having so said paused while walked once twice hurriedly up down room lord lufton continued if will leave now word that have spoken will be a though have never be uttered care not who know that have be uttered sooner that be known to world better will be pleased unless indeed think of mother lord lufton what can do better than give a daughter best sweetest girl have ever met when mother really know will love a do lucy say one word to of comfort will say word to that will injure future comfort be impossible must be wife do mean that can not love have right to press further said sat down upon sofa with angry frown upon forehead by heaven said will take such answer from till put hand upon heart say that can not love oh why must press so lord lufton why because happiness depends upon because behoves to know very truth have come to love with whole heart must know how heart stand towards have now again risen from sofa be looking steadily in face lord lufton said can not love a spoke did put hand a have desired upon heart then god help for be very wretched good bye lucy stretched out hand to good bye lord be angry with without further speech left room house hurried home be hardly surprising that must that evening tell mother that griselda grantly must be companion sufficiently good for sister wanted such companion when be well gone absolutely out of sight from window lucy walked steadily up to room locked door then threw on bed why oh why have told falsehood must anything justify in lie be not lie knowing a did that loved with loving heart illustration be not lie then mother sneer of world must have declared that have set trap caught foolish young lord pride must not have submitted to strong a love be yet pride be perhaps stronger stronger at rate during interview how be to forgive falsehood have told chapter xvii mr proudie conversazione be grievous to think of mischief danger into griselda grantly be brought by worldliness of mother in few week previous to lady lufton arrival in town very grievous at least to ladyship a from time to time heard of what be done in london lady hartletop be not only objectionable house at griselda be allowed to reap fresh fashionable laurel have be stated openly in morning post that young lady have be most admired among beautiful at one of miss dunstable celebrated soiree then be heard of a gracing drawing room at mr proudie conversazione of miss dunstable lady lufton be not able openly to allege evil be acquainted lady lufton knew with very many people of right sort be dear friend of lady lufton highly conservative not very distant neighbour gresham then be also acquainted with so many people of bad sort indeed be intimate with everybody from duke of omnium to old dowager lady goodygaffer who have represented cardinal virtue for last quarter of century smiled with equal sweetness on treacle on brimstone be quite at home at exeter hall having be consulted so world said probably not with exact truth a to selection of more than one disagreeably low church bishop be not le frequent in attendance at ecclesiastical doings of certain terrible prelate in midland county who be supposed to favour stole vesper to have proper protestant hatred for auricular confession fish on friday lady lufton who be very staunch did not like must say of miss dunstable that be impossible to serve god mammon mr proudie be much more objectionable to seeing how sharp be feud between proudies grantlys down in barsetshire how absolutely unable have always be to carry decent face towards other in church matter how headed two party in diocese be when brought together a oil vinegar in battle whole lufton influence have always be brought to bear on grantly side seeing say lady lufton be surprised to hear that griselda have be taken to mr proudie evening exhibition have archdeacon be consulted about said to herself must never have happened there be wrong for in matter concerning daughter introduction to world archdeacon never interfered on whole be inclined to think that mr grantly understood world better than did lady lufton in heart of heart mr grantly hated mr proudie be with sort of hatred one christian lady allows to feel towards of course mr grantly forgave mr proudie offence wished well be at peace with in christian sense of word a with other woman under forbearance meekness perhaps may say wholly unconnected with there be certainly current of antagonistic feeling in ordinary unconsidered language of day men woman do call hatred raged be strong throughout whole year in barsetshire before eye of mankind nevertheless mr grantly took griselda to mr proudie evening party in london in day mr proudie considered to be by mean least among bishop wife have opened season year in new house in gloucester place at reception room at rate be that lady bishop must desire here have front drawing room of very noble dimension second drawing room rather noble also though have lost one of back corner awkwardly enough apparently in jostle with neighbouring house then there be third will say drawing room closet in mr proudie delighted to be seen sitting in order that world might know that there be third room altogether noble suite a mr proudie said in confidence to more than one clergyman wife from barsetshire noble suite indeed mr proudie clergyman wife from barsetshire must usually answer for time mr proudie be much at loss to know by what sort of party entertainment must make famous ball supper be of course out of question did not object to daughter dancing night at other house at least of late have not objected for fashionable world required young lady have perhaps will of own dancing at house absolutely under shade of bishop apron must be sin scandal then a to supper of mode in one may extend one hospitality to large acquaintance be most costly be horrid to think that must go out among friend for mere sake of eating drinking mr proudie must say to clergyman wife from barsetshire show sensual propensity indeed doe mr proudie be so vulgar too lady must reply elder among must remember with regret unsparing open handed hospitality of barchester palace in good old day of bishop grantly god rest soul one old vicar wife there be whose answer have not be so courteous when be hungry mr proudie have said do have sensual propensity must be much better mr athill if world must provide for at home mr proudie have rapidly replied with opinion must here profess can not by mean bring to coincide conversazione must give play to sensual propensity occasion that intolerable expense gratification of sensual propensity too often produce mr proudie felt that word be not that must have desired be little faded by old use present oblivion seemed to address to portion of london world be considered blue rather than fashionable nevertheless there be spirituality about suited one may also say economy then a regarded fashion might perhaps not be beyond power of mr proudie to regild word with newly burnished gilding leading person must produce fashion at first hand why not mr proudie plan be to set people by ear talking if talk must to induce to show there inert if more must be got from to accommodate with chair sofa a many a furniture of noble suite of room must allow especially with two chair padded bench against wall in back closet small inner drawing room a must call to clergyman wife from barsetshire to let others stand about upright group a described then four time during two hour period of conversazione tea cake be to be handed round on salver be astonishing how far very little cake will go in way particularly if administered tolerably early after dinner men ca eat woman having plate table be obliged to abstain mr jones know that can not hold piece of crumbly cake in hand till be consumed without doing serious injury to best dress when mr proudie with weekly book before looked into financial upshot of conversazione conscience told that have done right thing going out to tea be not bad thing if one can contrive to dine early then be allowed to sit round big table with tea urn in middle must however suggest that breakfast cup must always be provided for gentleman then with pleasant neighbour more especially with pleasant neighbour affair be not according to taste by mean worst phase of society do dislike that handing round unless be of subsidiary thimbleful when business of social intercourse have be dinner indeed handing round have become vulgar intolerable nuisance among second class gentry with eight hundred year there thereabouts doubly intolerable a being destructive of natural comfort wretchedly vulgar aping of men with large income duke of omnium lady hartletop be undoubtedly wise to have everything handed round friend of mine who occasionally dine at such house tell that get wine quite a quickly a can drink that mutton be brought to without delay that potato bearer follows quick upon heel of carnifer nothing can be more comfortable may doubt acknowledge that first class grandee do understand material comfort of eight hundred can no more come up to in than can in opera box equipage may not say that usual tether of class in way of carnifers cup bearer rest doe not reach beyond neat handed phyllis greengrocer that phyllis neat handed a probably be greengrocer though be ever so active can not administer dinner to twelve people who be prohibited by medo persian law from self administration may not further say that lamentable consequence to eight hundreders dining out among other be that too often get dinner at phyllis with potato can not reach till mutton be devoured in lukewarm state past power of managing ganymede greengrocer though admire skill of necktie whiteness of unexceptionable glove fails to keep going in sherry seeing lady other day in strait left without small modicum of stimulus be doubt necessary for good digestion ventured to ask to drink wine with when bowed head at looked at with eye struck with amazement have suggested that must join in wild indian war dance with nothing on paint face must not have shown greater astonishment yet must have thought might have remembered day when christian men woman used to drink wine with other god be with good old day when must hobnob with friend over table a often a be inclined to lift glass to lip make long arm for hot potato whenever exigency of plate required think may be laid down a rule in affair of hospitality that extra luxury grandeur introduce at table when guest be with must be introduced for advantage of guest not for own if for instance dinner be served in manner different from usual to must be so served in order that friend may with more satisfaction eat repast than everyday practice must produce on change must by mean be made to material detriment in order that fashion may be acknowledged again if decorate sideboard table wishing that eye of visitor may rest on be elegant pleasant to sight act in matter with becoming sense of hospitality if object be to kill mr jones with envy at sight of silver trinket be very mean spirited fellow in broad way will be acknowledged if must bear in mind same idea at time on occasion when way perhaps may not be so broad when more thinking may be required to ascertain what be true hospitality think of eight hundred must make greater advance towards really entertaining own friend than by rearrangement of actual meat dish set before knowing a do that term of lufton grantly alliance have be so solemnly ratified between two mother be perhaps hardly open to to suppose that mr grantly be induced to take daughter to mr proudie by knowledge may have acquired that lord dumbello have promised to grace bishop assembly be certainly fact high contracting party do sometimes allow latitude must be considered dishonest by contractor of lower sort may be possible that archdeacon wife did think of second string with bow be furnished be that a may lord dumbello be at mr proudie did so come to pas that griselda be seated at corner of sofa close to be vacant space in lordship must group have not be long there before lord dumbello did group fine day said coming up occupying vacant position by miss grantly elbow be driving to day thought rather cold said griselda deuced cold said lord dumbello then adjusted white cravat touched up whisker having got so far did not proceed to other immediate conversational effort did griselda grouped again a became marquis gave very intense satisfaction to mr proudie be so kind of lord dumbello said that lady coming up to shaking hand warmly so very kind of to come to poor little tea party uncommonly pleasant call said lordship like sort of thing trouble know be charm of be trouble fuss parade be what always say according to idea society consists in giving people facility for interchange of thought what call conversation aw yes exactly not in eating drinking together eh lord dumbello yet practice of life must seem to show that indulgence of animal propensity can alone suffice to bring people together world in have surely made great mistake like good dinner same said lord dumbello oh yes of course of course be by mean one of who must pretend to preach that taste have not be given to for enjoyment why must thing be nice if be not to like man who can really give good dinner have learned great deal said lord dumbello with unusual animation immense deal be quite art in one at rate by mean despise can not always be eating can said lord dumbello not always looked a though lamented that power must be so circumscribed then mr proudie passed on to mr grantly two lady be quite friendly in london though down in own neighbourhood waged war so internecine in nature nevertheless mr proudie manner might have showed to very close observer that knew difference between bishop archdeacon be so delighted to see said mind moving wo sit down just at present why did archdeacon come be quite impossible be indeed said mr grantly archdeacon never have moment in london that can call own stay up very long believe good deal longer than of like can assure london life be perfect nuisance to people in certain position must go through with know said mr proudie bishop for instance must attend house must asked mr grantly a though be not at well informed with reference to branch of bishop business be very glad that archdeacon be under such liability oh there be nothing of sort said mr proudie very seriously how uncommonly well miss grantly be looking do hear that have quite be admired phrase certainly be little hard for mother to bear world have acknowledged so mr grantly have taught to believe that griselda be undoubtedly beauty of season marquis lord be already contending for smile paragraph have be written in newspaper a to profile be too hard to be told after that daughter have be quite admired phrase might suit pretty little red cheeked milkmaid of girl can not of course come near girl in respect said mr grantly very quietly now miss proudies have not elicited from fashionable world very loud encomium on beauty mother felt taunt in fullest force must not essay to do battle on present arena jotted down item in mind kept over for barchester chapter such debt a usually paid on day if mean of doing so be at within power there be miss dunstable declare said seeing that lady have entered room away went mr proudie to welcome distinguished guest so be conversazione be said that lady speaking a usual not in suppressed voice well declare be very nice mean conversation mr proudie have have have miss dunstable there be nobody like declare well tea cake then when be tired of talking go away be that must not be tired for three hour yet oh be never tired of talking world know that how do bishop very nice sort of thing conversazione be now bishop rubbed hand together smiled said that thought be rather nice mr proudie be so fortunate in little arrangement said miss dunstable yes yes said bishop think be happy in matter do flatter that be so of course miss dunstable be accustomed to thing on much grander scale lord bless nobody hate grandeur so much a do of course must do a be told must live in big house have three footman six foot high must have coachman with top heavy wig horse so big that frighten if did not must be made out lunatic declared unable to manage own affair a for grandeur hate certainly think that will have of conversaziones wonder whether mr proudie will come put up to wrinkle two bishop again rubbed hand said that be sure must never felt quite at ease with miss dunstable a rarely must ascertain whether be earnest in what be saying so trotted off muttering excuse a went miss dunstable chuckled with inward chuckle at too evident bewilderment miss dunstable be by nature kind generous open hearted be living now very much with people on whom kindness generosity open heartedness be thrown away be clever also must be sarcastic found that quality told better in world around than generosity open heart so went on from month to month year to year not progressing in good spirit a might have done still carrying within bosom warm affection for must really love knew that be hardly living a must live that wealth affected to despise be eating into soundness of character not by splendour by style of life have seemed to produce a necessity knew that be gradually becoming irreverent scornful prone to ridicule yet knowing hating hardly knew how to break from have seen so much of blacker side of human nature blackness no longer startled a must do have be prize at so many ruined spendthrift have aimed so many pirate have endeavoured to run down while sailing in open water of life that have ceased to regard such attempt on money bag a unmanly over covetous be content to fight own battle with own weapon feeling secure in own strength of purpose strength of wit few friend have whom really loved among whom inner self must come out speak boldly what have to say with own true voice woman who thus so spoke be very different from miss dunstable whom mr proudie courted duke of omnium feted mr harold smith claimed a bosom friend if only must find among such one special companion on whom heart might rest who must help to bear heavy burden of world where be to find such friend with keen wit untold money loud laughing voice everything about be calculated to attract whom must not value to scare from sort of friend to whom must fain have linked lot then met mr harold smith who have taken mr proudie noble suite of room in tour for evening be devoting to period of twenty minute so may congratulate miss dunstable said eagerly to friend in mercy name do such thing may too probably have to uncongratulate again will be so unpleasant told that lord brock have sent for yesterday now at period lord brock be prime minister so did harold be with backwards forward day ca shut eye open mouth see what god will send a wise prudent man must do be always for bargaining prime minister like must not be in shoe if after have to come home say that bargain be off have have have well must not take very quietly what can poor woman do know when be settled dear will send line at once then mr harold smith finished course round room regained carriage within twenty minute beautiful profile have not said miss dunstable somewhat later in evening to mr proudie of course profile spoken of belonged to miss grantly yes be beautiful certainly said mr proudie pity be that mean nothing gentleman seem to think that mean good deal be not sure of have conversation see not word have be sitting there with lord dumbello at elbow for last hour yet have hardly opened mouth three time dear mr proudie who on earth must talk to lord dumbello mr proudie thought that own daughter olivia must undoubtedly be able to do so if only must get opportunity then olivia have so much conversation while two lady be yet looking at youthful pair lord dumbello did speak again think have have enough of now said addressing to griselda suppose have other engagement said oh yes believe will go to lady clantelbrocks then took departure other word be spoken that evening between miss grantly beyond given in chronicle yet world declared that that young lady have passed evening in so close flirtation a to make matter more than ordinarily particular mr grantly a be driven home to lodging began to have doubt in mind whether must be wise to discountenance so great alliance a head of great hartletop family now seemed so desirous to establish prudent mother have not yet spoken word to daughter on subject might soon become necessary to do so be very well for lady lufton to hurry up to town of what service must be if lord lufton be not to be found in bruton street chapter xviii new minister patronage at time just a lady lufton be about to leave framley for london mark robarts received pressing letter inviting also to go up to metropolis for day two not for pleasure on business letter be from indefatigable friend sowerby dear

desired sister to give new lord petty bag rest till must have promised to use influence in getting vacant prebend for mark robarts letter of sowerby mark immediately showed to wife how lucky thought

what vicar wife must have so persuaded husband yet did not altogether like feared that greek from chaldicotes even when came with present of prebendal stall in hand then what must lady lufton say do think that must go up to london mark oh certainly be if intend to accept harold smith kind office in matter suppose will be better to accept said fanny feeling perhaps that must be useless in to hope that must not be accepted prebendal stall fanny generally go begging long among parish clergyman how must reconcile to duty owe to child to refuse increase to income so be settled that must at once drive to silverbridge send off message by telegraph that must proceed to london on following day must see lady lufton first of course said fanny a soon a be settled mark must have avoided if must have decently done so felt that must be impolitic a well a indecent why must be afraid to tell lady lufton that hoped to receive piece of promotion from present government there be nothing disgraceful in clergyman becoming prebendary of barchester lady lufton have always be very civil to prebendary especially to little dr burslem meagre little man who have just now paid debt of nature have always be very fond of chapter original dislike to bishop proudie have be chiefly founded on interference with cathedral clergy on interference on of wife chaplain considering thing mark robarts tried to make believe that lady lufton must be delighted at good fortune yet did not believe at rate must revolt from gift of greek of chaldicotes oh indeed said when vicar have with difficulty explained to circumstance of case well congratulate mr robarts on powerful new patron will probably feel with lady lufton that benefice be one can hold without detriment to in position here at framley said prudently resolving to let slur upon friend pas by unheeded well hope so of course be very young man mr robarts thing have generally be given to clergyman more advanced in life mean to say that think ought to refuse what advice to might be if really came to for advice be hardly prepared to say at so very short notice seem to have made up mind therefore need not consider a be wish joy hope that may turn out to advantage in way understand lady lufton have by mean got a yet oh thought have be offered to thought spoke of new minister a having in own hand oh dear what may be amount of influence in respect at know correspondent assures mr sowerby mean why call by name mr sowerby assures that mr smith will ask for think most probable that request will be successful oh of course mr sowerby mr harold smith together must doubt be successful in anything be sort of men who be successful nowadays well mr robarts wish joy gave hand in token of sincerity mark took hand resolving to say nothing further on occasion that lady lufton be not now cordial with a used to be be well aware sooner later be determined to have matter out with must ask why now so constantly met with taunt so seldom greeted with kind old affectionate smile knew appreciated so well that be honest true be quite sure if asked question plainly must answer openly if must induce to say that must return to old way return to must in hearty manner must not do just at present be day two since mr crawley have be with be not probable that mr crawley have be sent thither by lady lufton own hand be not clean enough for remonstrance at present moment must cleanse then must remonstrate must like to live part of year in barchester said to wife sister that evening think that two house be only trouble said wife have be very happy here have always liked cathedral town said lucy be particularly fond of close barchester close be closest of close said mark there be not single house within gateway doe not belong to chapter if be to keep up two house additional income will soon be wasted said fanny prudently thing must be to let house furnished summer said lucy must take residence a term come said vicar certainly must not like to be away from framley winter must never see anything of lufton perhaps thought of hunting then thought again of cleansing of hand must not bit mind being away during winter said lucy thinking of what last winter have done for where on earth must find money to furnish one of large old fashioned house pray mark do anything rash wife laid hand affectionately on husband arm in manner question of prebend be discussed between on evening before started for london success have at last crowned earnest effort with harold smith have carried on political battle of life for last ten year late lord petty bag have resigned in disgust having be unable to digest prime minister idea on indian reform mr harold smith after sundry hitch in business be installed in place be said that harold smith be not exactly man whom premier must have chosen for high office premier hand be good deal tied by circumstance last great appointment have made have be terribly unpopular so much so a to subject popular a undoubtedly be to screech from whole nation jupiter with withering scorn have asked whether vice of kind be to be considered in day of queen victoria a passport to cabinet adverse member of house have arrayed in pure panoply of morality thundered forth sarcasm with indignant virtue keen discontent of political juvenal even own friend have held up hand in dismay under circumstance have thought obliged in present instance to select man who must not be especially objectionable to party now harold smith lived with wife circumstance be not more than ordinarily embarrassed kept race horse a lord brock now heard for first time gave lecture in provincial town on popular subject have seat be tolerably secure must talk to house by yard if required to do so moreover lord brock have great idea that whole machinery of own ministry must break to piece very speedily own reputation be not bad be insufficient for that lately selected friend of under circumstance combined chose harold smith to fill vacant office of lord petty bag very proud lord petty bag be for last three four month mr supplehouse have be agreeing to consign ministry to speedy perdition sort of dictatorship will never do harold smith have said justifying that future vote of a to want of confidence in queen government mr supplehouse in matter have fully agreed with be juno whose form wicked old paris have utterly despised too have quite made up mind a to lobby in must be found when day of vengeance must arrive now thing be much altered in harold smith view premier have shown wisdom in seeking for new strength where strength ought to be sought introducing new blood into body of ministry people must now feel fresh confidence probably house also a to mr supplehouse must use influence on supplehouse after mr supplehouse be not everything on morning after vicar arrival in london attended at petty bag office be situated in close neighbourhood of downing street higher governmental god though building be not much seeing that be shored up on one side that bulged out in front be foul with smoke dingy with dirt be devoid of single architectural grace modern scientific improvement nevertheless position gave status in world made clerk in lord petty bag office quite respectable in walk in life mark have seen friend sowerby on previous evening have then made appointment with for following morning at new minister office now be there little before time in order that might have few moment chat with brother when mark found in private secretary room be quite astonished to see change in brother appearance change in official rank have produced jack robarts have be well built straight legged lissome young fellow pleasant to eye because of natural advantage rather given to harum skarum style of gait occasionally careless not to say slovenly in dress now be very pink of perfection jaunty frock coat fitted to perfection not hair of head be out of place waistcoat trouser be glossy new umbrella stood in umbrella stand in corner be tight neat small natty well john have become quite great man said brother know much about said john find have enormous deal of fagging to go through do mean work thought have about easiest berth in whole civil service ah be just mistake people make because cover whole ream of foolscap paper at rate of fifteen line to page five word to line people think that private secretary have got nothing to do look here tossed over scornfully dozen so of little note tell what mark be easy matter to manage patronage of cabinet minister now be bound to write to one of fellow letter will please yet will refuse to one of request asks that must be difficult difficult be word for after consists chiefly in knack of thing one must have wit sharp waspish word a to pluck sting ' do day really think that people like perhaps refusal be better than other people acquiescence mean that at private secretary have to do same thing now must believe have used up three lift of note paper already in telling people that there be vacancy for lobby messenger in petty bag office seven peeress have asked for for favourite footman there there be lord petty bag bell rang private secretary jumping up from note paper tripped away quickly to great man room will see at once said returning buggins show reverend mr robarts to lord petty bag buggins be messenger for whose not vacant place peeress be striving with so much animation then mark following buggins for two step be ushered into next room if man be altered by becoming private secretary be much more altered by being made cabinet minister robarts a entered room must hardly believe that be same harold smith whom mr proudie bothered so cruelly in lecture room at barchester then be cross touchy uneasy insignificant now a stood smiling on hearthrug of official fireplace be quite pleasant to see kind patronizing smile lighted up feature delighted to stand there with hand in trouser pocket great man of place conscious of lordship feeling inch minister sowerby have come with be standing little in background from position winked occasionally at parson over minister shoulder ah robarts delighted to see how odd by by brother must be private secretary mark said that be singular coincidence very smart young fellow if mind will do well be quite sure will do well said mark ah well yes think will now what can do for robarts hereupon mr sowerby struck in making apparent by explanation that mr robarts by mean intended to ask for anything that a friend have thought that stall at barchester might be put into hand with more fitness than in of other clergyman of day be willing to accept piece of preferment from man whom respected so much a did new lord petty bag minister did not quite like a restricted from much of condescension robbed of incense of petition have expected mark robarts must make to nevertheless be very gracious must not take upon to declare said what might be lord brock pleasure with reference to preferment at barchester be vacant have certainly already spoken to lordship on subject have perhaps reason to believe that own wish must be consulted distinct promise have be made might perhaps go so far a to say that expected such result if so must give greatest pleasure in world to congratulate mr robarts on possession of stall stall be sure mr robarts must fill with dignity piety brotherly love then when have finished mr sowerby gave final wink said that regarded matter a settled not settled nathaniel said cautious minister be same thing rejoined sowerby know what flummery mean men in office mark never do make distinct promise not even to of leg of mutton be roasting before kitchen fire be so necessary in day to be safe be not harold most expedient said harold smith shaking head wisely well robarts who be now said to private secretary who came to notice arrival of bigwig well yes will say good morning with leave for be little hurried remember mr robarts will do what can for must distinctly understand that there be promise oh promise at said sowerby of course not then a sauntered up whitehall towards charing cross with robarts on arm again pressed upon sale of invaluable hunter who be eating head off shoulder in stable at chaldicotes chapter xix money dealing mr sowerby in resolution to obtain good gift for vicar of framley did not depend quite alone on influence of near connection with lord petty bag felt occasion to be one on might endeavour to move even higher power than therefore have opened matter to duke not by direct application through mr fothergill man who understood matter ever thought of going direct to duke in such affair a if one wanted to speak about woman horse picture duke must on occasion be affable enough through mr fothergill duke be approached be represented with cunning that buying over of framley clergyman from lufton side must be praiseworthy spoiling of amalekites doing so must give omnium interest hold even in cathedral close then be known to men mr robarts have considerable influence over lord lufton so guided duke of omnium did say two word to prime minister two word from duke went great way even with lord brock upshot of be that mark robarts did get stall did not hear tidings of success till day after return to framley mr sowerby did not forget to tell of great effort unusual effort a of chaldicotes called duke have made on subject know when have done thing before said sowerby may be quite sure of must not have done now have not gone to gatherum castle when asked indeed fothergill must have known that be vain to attempt will tell mark doe not do for to make little of own nest truly believe duke word will be more efficacious than lord petty bag solemn adjuration mark of course expressed gratitude in proper term did buy horse for hundred thirty pound be a well worth said sowerby a animal that ever stood on four leg only reason for pressing on be that when tozer day doe come round know will have to stand to to something about tune did not occur to mark to ask why horse must not be sold to one else money forthcoming in regular way must not have suited mr sowerby mark knew that beast be good a walked to lodging be half proud of new possession then how must justify to wife how introduce animal into stable without attempting justification in matter yet looking to absolute amount of income surely might feel entitled to buy new horse when suited wondered what mr crawley must say when heard of new purchase have lately fallen into state of much wondering a to what friend neighbour must say about have now be two day in town be to go down after breakfast on following morning so that might reach home by friday afternoon on evening just a be going to bed be surprised by lord lufton coming into coffee room at hotel walked in with hurried step face be red be clear that be very angry robarts said walking up to friend taking hand be extended to do know anything about man tozer tozer what tozer have heard sowerby speak of such man of course have if mistake have written to about very probably remember sowerby mentioning man with reference to affair why do ask man have not only written to have absolutely forced way into room when be dressing for dinner absolutely have impudence to tell that if did not honour bill hold for eight hundred pound must proceed against settled that matter with sowerby did settle at very great cost to sooner than have fuss paid through nose like fool be everything that claimed be absolute swindle if go on will expose a such robarts looked round room luckily there be not soul in mean to say that sowerby be swindling said clergyman look very like said lord lufton tell fairly be not in humour to endure more of sort of thing year ago made as of through man fault four thousand pound must have covered whole of what really lost have now paid more than three time sum by heaven will not pay more without exposing whole affair lufton understand what be bill have name to yes have will not deny name if there be absolute need will pay if do so lawyer will sift will go before jury thought bill be paid left to sowerby to get up old bill when be renewed now one of have in truth be already honoured be brought against mark must not think of two document have signed of be now undoubtedly in hand of tozer of other gentleman of same profession might be brought against second a soon a must have satisfied first then remembered that sowerby have said something to about outstanding bill for filling up of trifle must be paid of reminded lord lufton do call eight hundred pound trifle if so will probably make such demand a tell do make such demand have made man whom saw who told that be tozer friend who be probably tozer positively swore to that must be obliged to take legal proceeding if money be not forthcoming within week ten day when explained to that be old bill have be renewed declared that friend have given full value for sowerby said that must probably have to pay ten pound to redeem must offer man such sum a intention be to offer man nothing to leave affair in hand of lawyer with instruction to to spare none one else be not going to allow man a sowerby to squeeze like orange lufton seem a though be angry with be not think be a well to caution about man transaction with lately have chiefly be through therefore have only be so through wish because have be anxious to oblige hope mean to say that be concerned in bill know that be concerned in bill with why lufton be to understand then that be accusing of having interest in transaction have called swindling a far a be concerned there have be swindling there be swindling going on now answer question do bring accusation against if so agree with that have better go to lawyer think be what will do very well upon whole never heard of more unreasonable man of one whose thought be more unjust than yours solely with view of assisting solely at request spoke to sowerby about money transaction of yours then at request originated out of request using a ambassador to a have used a yours to wrote spoke to now be upshot bring accusation against robarts know have dealing with man have told so yes at request to accommodate have put name to bill only to one only to one then to same renewed not exactly to same to one stand for first be for four hundred pound last for five hundred will have to make good world will of course tell that have paid that price for stall at barchester be terrible to be borne have heard much lately have frightened scared nothing so terrible a nothing so stunned conveyed to mind so frightful reality of misery ruin made immediate answer standing on hearthrug with back to fire looked up whole length of room hitherto eye have be fixed upon lord lufton face now seemed to a though have little more to do with lord lufton lord lufton lord lufton mother be neither now to be counted among who wished well upon whom indeed must now count except wife of bosom upon whom be bringing wretchedness in moment of agony idea ran quickly through brain must immediately abandon preferment at barchester of might be said with so much colour that have bought must go to harold smith say positively that declined then must return home tell wife have occurred tell whole also to lady lufton if might still be of service must make arrangement for payment of bill a might be presented asking question a to justice of claim making complaint to one not even to sowerby must put income if half be necessary into hand of forrest banker till be paid must sell horse have must part with footman groom at rate strive like man to get again firm footing on good ground then at moment loathed with whole soul position in found placed own folly have placed there how must reconcile to conscience that be there in london with sowerby harold smith petitioning for church preferment to man who must have be altogether powerless in such matter buying horse arranging about past due bill did not reconcile to conscience mr crawley have be right when told that be castaway lord lufton whose anger during whole interview have be extreme who have become more angry more talked have now walked once twice up down room a so walked idea did occur to that have be unjust have come there with intention of exclaiming against sowerby of inducing robarts to convey to gentleman that if lord lufton be made to undergo further annoyance about bill whole affair must be thrown into lawyer hand instead of doing have brought accusation against robarts robarts have latterly become sowerby friend rather than own in horrid money dealing have galled now have expressed in term much stronger than have intended to use a to personally mark said coming back to spot on robarts be standing wish to say anything that will annoy have said quite enough lord lufton can not be surprised must be angry indignant at treatment have received might think have separated in mind who have wronged if there have be such wrong from who have only endeavoured to do will pleasure for that a clergyman have be very wrong in taking part whatsoever in matter be well aware that a man have be outrageously foolish in lending name to mr sowerby also know well enough be perhaps a well that must be told of rudely certainly did not expect lesson to come from well there have be mischief enough question be what have better now do have said what mean to do will put affair into hand of lawyer not with object of exposing exposing lord lufton why one must think that have have handling of money will misunderstand think such thing do not know that if legal step be taken in wretched affair arrangement with sowerby will be brought to light arrangement with sowerby will consist in paying having to pay on account large sum of money for have never have will never have consideration whatever what will be said about stall at barchester after charge brought against just now will decline to accept at moment three four other gentleman entered room conversation between two friend be stopped still remained standing near fire for few minute of said anything robarts be waiting till lord lufton must go away lord lufton have not yet said that have come to say at last spoke again almost in whisper think will be best to ask sowerby to come to room to morrow think also that must meet there see necessity for presence said robarts seems probable that will suffer enough for meddling with affair will do so no more of course can not make come think will be only just to sowerby will be favour to robarts again walked up down room for dozen time trying to resolve what must most become to do in present emergency if name be dragged before court if must be shown up in public paper a having be engaged in accommodation bill must certainly be ruinous to have already learned from lord lufton innuendo what might expect to hear a public version of share in transaction then wife how must bear such exposure will meet mr sowerby at room to morrow on one condition at last said what be that receive positive assurance be not suspected by of having have pecuniary interest whatever in money matter with mr sowerby a concern affair of anybody else have never suspected of such thing have thought that be compromised with so be be liable for bill ought to have known do know have never received shilling on account of such liability have endeavoured to oblige man whom regarded first a friend then a own have be result lord lufton did at last give assurance that desired a sat with head together over one of coffee room table then robarts promised that must postpone return to framley till saturday so that might meet sowerby at lord lufton chamber in albany on following afternoon a soon a be arranged lord lufton took leave went way after poor mark have very uneasy night of be clear enough that lord lufton have thought if did not still think that stall at barchester be to be given a pecuniary recompense in return for certain money accommodation to be afforded by nominee to dispenser of patronage nothing on earth must be worse than in first place must be simony then must be simony beyond description mean simoniacal very thought of filled mark soul with horror dismay might be that lord lufton suspicion be now at rest others must think same thing suspicion must be impossible to allay others must consist of outer world be always so eager to gloat over detected vice of clergyman then that wretched horse have purchased purchase of must have prohibited from saying that nothing of value have accrued to in transaction with mr sowerby what be to do about then of late have be spending have continued to spend more money than must well afford very journey of up to london must be most imprudent if must become necessary for to give up hope of holding prebend a to that have made up mind then again unmade a men always do in such trouble line of conduct have laid down for in first moment of indignation against lord lufton by adopting must have to encounter poverty ridicule discomfort annihilation of high hope ruin of ambition that said to over over again must now be best for be so hard for to give up high hope willingly encounter poverty ridicule discomfort on following morning however boldly walked down to petty bag office determined to let harold smith know that be no longer desirous of barchester stall found brother there still writing artistic note to anxious peeress on subject of buggins non vacant situation great man of place lord petty bag be not there might probably look in when house be beginning to sit perhaps at four little after certainly must not be at office in morning function of lord petty bag be doubt performing elsewhere perhaps have carried work home with practice world must know be not uncommon with civil servant of exceeding zeal mark did think of opening heart to brother of leaving message with courage failed perhaps might be more correct to say that prudence prevented must be better for thought to tell wife before told one else so merely chatted with brother for hour then left day be very tedious till hour came at be to attend at lord lufton room at last did come just a clock struck turned out of piccadilly into albany a be going across court before entered building be greeted by voice just behind a punctual a big clock on barchester tower said mr sowerby see what be to have summons from great man mr prebendary turned round extended hand mechanically to mr sowerby a looked at thought have never before seen so pleasant in appearance so free from care so joyous in demeanour have heard from lord lufton said mark in voice be certainly very lugubrious heard from oh yes of course have heard from will tell what be mark now spoke almost in whisper a walked together along albany passage lufton be child in money matter perfect child dearest finest fellow in world know very baby in money matter then entered lordship room lord lufton countenance also be lugubrious enough did not in least abash sowerby who walked quickly up to young lord with gait perfectly self possessed face radiant with satisfaction well lufton how be said seems that worthy friend tozer have be giving trouble then lord lufton with face by mean radiant with satisfaction again began story of tozer fraudulent demand upon sowerby did not interrupt listened patiently to end quite patiently although lord lufton a made more more angry by history of own wrong did not hesitate to pronounce certain threat against mr sowerby a have pronounced before against mark robarts must not said pay shilling except through lawyer must instruct lawyer that before paid anything whole matter must be exposed openly in court did not care said what might be effect on one else be determined that whole case must go to jury to grand jury special jury common jury old jewry if like said truth be lufton lost money a there be delay in paying have be harassed have paid more than lost three time over said lord lufton stamping foot will not go into question now be settled a thought time ago by person to whom referred will tell why on earth must robarts be troubled in matter have done well know arranged matter with such thing be kind enough to carry message from to to convey back return message from to have be part in suppose want to implicate do think want to implicate one be hot headed difficult to deal with very irrational into bargain what be worse must say be little suspicious in matter have harassed greatly to oblige in return have got more kick than halfpenny did not give bill to tozer bill now hold in first place doe not hold in next place did not give to thing pas through score of hand before reach man who make application for payment who came to other day that take be tom tozer brother of tozer then hold bill for saw with wait moment be very likely sent word that must have to pay for taking up of course abandon sort of thing without consideration ten pound said observed mark ten twenty such sum a be hardly so soft a to suppose that man must ask for such sum of course must demand full payment there be bill lord lufton sowerby producing document handed across table to lordship gave five twenty pound for morning lord lufton took paper looked at yes said be bill what be to do with now put with family archive said sowerby behind fire just please be last of can other be brought up know better than do what paper may have put hand to know of other at last renewal be only outstanding bill of be aware have paid five twenty pound for have only that have be in such tantrum about must have made noise afternoon if have not brought might have have for fifteen twenty in three four day must have taken fifteen odd ten pound doe not signify will pay twenty five of course said lord lufton who now began to feel little ashamed of may do a please about oh be affair a matter of course amount of kind mind sat down to fill in cheque for money well now lufton let say few word to said sowerby standing with back against fireplace playing with small cane held in hand for heaven sake try be little more charitable to around when become fidgety about anything indulge in language world wo stand though men who know a well a robarts may consent to put up with have accused since have be here of manner of iniquity now sowerby dear fellow let have say out have accused say believe that have accused have never occurred to daresay to accuse indeed have of course have be wrong in having to do with such men a tozer have also be very wrong want great moral authority to tell that pattern gentleman have dealing with tozer very much better be for not having man must have back enough to bear weight put on keep away from tozer if can for future if do deal with for heaven sake keep temper be very fine sowerby know a well a do know said devil quoting scripture a folded up check for twenty five pound put in pocket that when man sow tare wo reap wheat be use to expect be tough in matter can bear great deal be if be not pushed too far looked full into lord lufton face a spoke think have be very hard upon robarts never mind sowerby lord lufton be very old friend may therefore take liberty with other very well now have done sermon dear dignitary allow to congratulate hear from fothergill that little affair of yours have be definitely settled mark face again became clouded rather think said that will decline presentation decline said sowerby who having used utmost effort to obtain must have be more absolutely offended by such vacillation on vicar part than by personal abuse lord lufton must heap upon think will said mark why mark looked up at lord lufton then remained silent for moment there can be occasion for sacrifice under present circumstance said lordship under what circumstance must there be occasion for asked sowerby duke of omnium have used little influence to get place for a parish clergyman belonging to county must think monstrous if be now to reject then robarts openly stated whole of reason explaining exactly what lord lufton have said with reference to bill transaction to allegation must be made a to stall having be given in payment for accommodation upon word be too bad said sowerby now sowerby wo be lectured said lord lufton have done lecture said aware perhaps that must not do for to push friend too far will not give second robarts let tell a far a know harold smith have have little nothing to do with appointment duke have told prime minister that be very anxious that parish clergyman from county must go into chapter then at lord brock request named if under circumstance talk of giving up will believe to be insane a for bill accepted for need have uneasiness about money will be ready of course when time come will let have hundred thirty for then mr sowerby took leave having certainly made master of occasion if man of fifty have wit about be not too prosy can generally make master of occasion when companion be under thirty robarts did not stay at albany long after took leave having received assurance of lord lufton regret for what have passed many promise of friendship for future indeed lord lufton be little ashamed of a for prebend after what have passed of course must accept nevertheless lordship have not omitted to notice mr sowerby hint about horse hundred thirty pound robarts a walked back to hotel thought that certainly must accept barchester promotion be very glad that have said nothing on subject to brother on whole spirit be much raised that assurance of sowerby about bill be very comforting to strange to say absolutely believed in truth sowerby have be so completely winning horse at late meeting that lord lufton robarts be inclined to believe almost anything said be not always case with of chapter xx harold smith in cabinet for few day whole harold smith party held head very high be not only that man have be made cabinet minister rumour have got abroad that lord brock in selecting have amazingly strengthened party done much to cure wound own arrogance lack of judgment have inflicted on body politic of government so said harold smithians much elated when consider what harold have achieved need not be surprised that be somewhat elated also must be proud day for man when first walk into cabinet when humble minded man think of such phase of life mind becomes lost in wondering what cabinet be be god that attend there men do sit on chair hang about on cloud when speak be music of sphere audible in olympian mansion making heaven drowsy with harmony in what way do congregate in what order do address other be voice of deity free equal be plodding themis from home department cere from colony heard with a rapt attention a powerful pallas of foreign office goddess be never seen without lance helmet doe whitehall mar make eye there at bright young venus of privy seal disgusting that quaint tinkering vulcan who be blowing bellow at exchequer not altogether unsuccessfully old saturn of woolsack

god king of men be will be king rule will rule over who be smaller than harold smith when be summoned to august hall of divine council did feel to be proud man may perhaps conclude at first meeting two did not attempt to take very leading part of reader may have sat at vestry will remember how mild for most part mute be new comer at board agrees generally with abated enthusiasm must differ apologizes for liberty anon when voice of colleague have become habitual in ear when strangeness of room be gone table before be known trusted throw off awe dismay electrifies brotherhood by vehemence of declamation violence of thumping so let suppose will be with harold smith perhaps in second third season of cabinet practice ala ala that such pleasure must be so fleeting then too there came upon blow somewhat modified triumph cruel dastard blow from hand must have be friendly to from one to whom have fondly looked to buoy up in great course be before have be said by friend that in obtaining harold smith service prime minister have infused new young healthy blood into body harold have liked phrase have seen at glance how might have be made to tell by friendly supplehouse like why must supplehouse out of elysium be friendly to harold smith within men lapped in elysium steeped to neck in bliss must expect to see friend fall off from human nature can not stand if want to get anything from old friend jones like to see shoved up into high place if jones even in high place can hing for then exaltation above head be insult injury who ever belief own dear intimate companion to be fit for highest promotion mr supplehouse have known mr smith too closely to think much of young blood consequently there appeared article in jupiter be by mean complimentary to ministry in general harped good deal on young blood view of question seemed to insinuate that harold smith be not much better than diluted water prime minister article said having lately recruited impaired vigour by new infusion of aristocratic influence of highest moral tone have again added to tower of strength chosen from among people what might not hope now that possessed service of lord brittleback mr harold smith renovated in medea caldron of such potency effete limb must be acknowledged that of have become very effete must come forth young round robust new energy must diffuse through department india must be saved quieted ambition of france must be tamed even handed reform must remodel court of law parliamentary election utopia must be realized such seems be result expected in ministry from mr harold smith young blood be cruel enough even be hardly so cruel a word with article ended by time irony have be dropped writer spoke out earnestly opinion upon matter beg to assure lord brock said article that such alliance a will not save from speedy fall with arrogance want of judgment threaten to overwhelm a regard will be sorry to hear of resignation be in many respect best statesman that posse for emergency of present period if be so ill judged a to rest on such men a mr harold smith lord brittleback for assistant in work be before must not expect that country will support mr harold smith be not made of stuff from cabinet minister must be formed mr harold smith a read seated at breakfast table recognized said that recognized hand of mr supplehouse in touch that phrase about effete limb be supplehouse all over a be also realization of utopia when want to be witty always talk about utopia said mr harold smith to for mr harold be not usually present in flesh at matutinal meal then went down to office saw in glance of man that met announcement that article in jupiter have be read private secretary tittered in evident allusion to article way in buggins took coat made clear that be well known in messenger lobby wo have to fill up vacancy when go buggins be saying to then in course of morning came cabinet council second that have attended read in countenance of god goddess there assembled that chief be thought to have made mistake if mr supplehouse must have be induced to write in strain then indeed that new blood might have be felt to have be efficacious be great drawback to happiness still must not rob of fact of position lord brock must not ask to resign because jupiter have written against be lord brock man to desert new colleague for reason so harold smith girded loin went about duty of petty bag with new zeal upon word jupiter be right said young robarts to a finished fourth dozen of private note explanatory of everything in about petty bag office harold smith required that private secretary note must be so terribly precise nevertheless in spite of drawback harold smith be happy in new honour mr harold smith enjoyed also certainly among acquaintance did quiz new cabinet minister not little may be question whether be not a hard upon a writer in jupiter whispered great deal to miss dunstable about new blood talked of going down to westminster bridge to see whether thames be really on fire though laughed triumphed though flattered that bore honour without outward sign world knew that be triumphing ridiculed elation about time also gave party not pure minded conversazione like mr proudie downright wicked worldly dance at there be fiddle ice champagne sufficient to run away with first quarter salary accruing to harold from petty bag office to ball be chiefly memorable from fact that lady lufton be among guest immediately on arrival in town received card from mr h smith for herself griselda be about to send back reply at once declining honour what have to do at house of mr sowerby sister so happened that at moment son be with a expressed wish that must go yielded have there be nothing in tone of persuasion more than ordinary have merely have reference to herself must have smiled on for kind solicitude have made out occasion for kissing forehead a thanked must still have declined have reminded of griselda might a well go mother for sake of meeting said mr harold caught other day must not liberate till have given promise be attraction certainly said lady lufton do like going to house when know that will be there now that miss grantly be with owe to to do best can for certainly do ludovic have to thank for reminding of duty so gallantly so said that must go to mr harold smith poor lady gave much more weight to few word about miss grantly than deserved rejoiced heart to think that son be anxious to meet griselda that must perpetrate little ruse in order to gain wish have spoken out of mere emptiness of mind without thought of what be saying excepting that wished to please mother nevertheless went to mr harold smith when there did dance more than once with griselda grantly to manifest discomfiture of lord dumbello came in late at moment lord dumbello be moving slowly up room with griselda on arm while lady lufton be sitting near looking on with unhappy eye then griselda sat down lord dumbello stood mute at elbow ludovic whispered mother griselda be absolutely bored by man who follows like ghost do go rescue did go rescue afterwards danced with for best part of hour consecutively knew that world gave lord dumbello credit of admiring young lady be quite alive to pleasure of filling brother nobleman heart with jealousy anger moreover griselda be in eye very beautiful have be one whit more animated have mother tactic be thought better concealed griselda might have be asked that night to share vacant throne at lufton in spite of have be said sworn in drawing room of framley parsonage must be remembered that gallant gay lothario have passed considerable number of day with miss grantly in mother house danger of such contiguity must be remembered also lord lufton be by mean man capable of seeing beauty unmoved of spending hour with young lady without approach to tenderness have there be such approach be probable that lady lufton must not have pursued matter according to idea on such subject son ludovic have on occasion shown quite sufficient partiality for miss grantly to justify in hope to lead to think that nothing opportunity be wanted now at ball of mr smith did for while seem to be taking advantage of such opportunity mother heart be glad if thing must turn out well on evening must forgive mr harold smith sin for while looked a though thing must turn out well not that must be supposed that lord lufton have come there with intention of making love to griselda that ever have fixed thought that be doing so young men in such matter be so often without fixed thought be such absolute moth amuse with light of beautiful candle fluttering about on off in out of flame with dazzled eye till in rash moment rush in too near wick then fall with singed wing crippled leg burnt up reduced to tinder by consuming fire of matrimony happy marriage men say be made in heaven believe most marriage be fairly happy in spite of sir cresswell cresswell yet how little care be taken on earth towards result hope mother be using well said lord lufton to griselda a be standing together in doorway between dance oh yes be very kind have be rash to trust in hand of so very staid demure person indeed owe presence here at mr harold smith first cabinet ball altogether to know whether be aware of oh yes lady lufton told be grateful otherwise have done injury benefit do find best sitting with novel in corner of sofa in bruton street pretending to dance polka here with lord dumbello know what mean have stood up with lord dumbello evening be going to dance quadrille did exactly just what say pretending to do even be good deal for lord dumbello be then lord lufton not being pretender put arm round waist away went up down room across about with energy showed that what griselda lacked in tongue made up with foot lord dumbello in meantime stood by observant thinking to that lord lufton be glib tongued empty headed as reflecting that if rival be to break tendon of leg in one of rapid evolution suddenly come by other dreadful misfortune such a loss of property absolute blindness chronic lumbago must only serve right in frame of mind went to bed in spite of prayer doubt said a to forgiveness of other people trespass then when be again standing lord lufton in little interval between violent gasp for fresh breath asked griselda if liked london pretty well said griselda gasping also little be afraid be very dull down at framley oh liked particularly be great bore when went away know there be soul about house worth speaking to remained silent for minute till lung have become quiescent not soul continued not of falsehood prepense for be not in fact thinking of what be saying did not occur to at moment that have truly found griselda going great relief that have be able to do more in way of conversation with lucy robarts in one hour than with miss grantly during month of intercourse in same house nevertheless must not be hard upon be fair in love war if be not love be usual thing stand a counterpart for not soul said lord lufton be very nearly hanging in park next morning only rained what nonsense have mother to talk to oh mother yes may tell too if please captain culpepper be there do love mother dearly do think that must make up for absence voice be very tender so be eye miss robarts thought admired very much what lucy robarts said lord lufton feeling that lucy name be more than at present knew how to manage indeed that name destroyed life there be in little flirtation do like lucy robarts certainly be very clever so happened that saw little nothing of after be gone to griselda made answer drew up looked a cold a diana when froze orion in cave must be got to give more than monosyllabic answer to three four succeeding attempt at conversation lord lufton made then danced again griselda step be by mean so lively a before what took place between on occasion be very little more than what have be here related there may have be ice glass of lemonade into bargain perhaps faintest possible attempt at hand pressing if so be on one side to such overture a griselda grantly be a cold a diana little a be be sufficient to fill lady lufton mind heart mother with six daughter be ever more anxious to get off hand than lady lufton be to see son married married be to girl of right sort now really did seem a though be actually going to comply with wish have watched during whole evening painfully endeavouring not to be observed in doing so have seen lord dumbello failure wrath have seen son victory pride must be case that have already said something be still allowed to be indecisive only through griselda coldness might not be case by judicious aid on part indecision might be turned into certainty that coldness into warmth then such interference requires so delicate touch a lady lufton be well aware have have pleasant evening lady lufton said when griselda be seated together with foot on fender of ladyship dressing room lady lufton have especially invited guest into most private sanctum to a rule none have admittance daughter sometimes fanny robarts to what sanctum might not such daughter in law a griselda have admittance oh yes very said griselda seemed to that bestowed most of smile upon ludovic lady lufton put on look of good pleasure that such must have be case oh know said griselda did dance with two three time not once too often to please dear like to see ludovic dancing with friend be sure be very much obliged to lady lufton not at dear know where must get so nice partner then paused moment not feeling how far might go in meantime griselda sat still staring at hot coal indeed know that admires very much continued lady lufton oh be sure doe said griselda then there be pause can only say said lady lufton that if doe do so believe doe must give very great pleasure for know dear that be very fond of thank said griselda stared at coal more perseveringly than before be young man of most excellent disposition though be own son will say that if there must be anything between there be indeed lady lufton if there ever must be must be delighted to think that ludovic have made so good choice there will never be anything of sort be sure lady lufton be not thinking of thing in least well perhaps may day now good night dear good night lady lufton griselda kissed with utmost composure betook to own bedroom before retired to sleep looked carefully to different article of dress discovering what amount of damage evening wear tear might have inflicted chapter xxi why puck pony be beaten mark robarts returned home day after scene at albany considerably relieved in spirit now felt that might accept stall without discredit to a clergyman in doing so indeed after what mr sowerby have said after lord lufton assent to must have be madness considered to decline then too mr sowerby promise about bill be very comfortable to after might not be possible that might get rid of trouble with other drawback than of having to pay l for horse be well worth money on day after return received proper authentic tidings of presentation to prebend be in fact already prebendary must be a soon a dean chapter have gone through form of instituting in stall income be already own house also must be given up to in week time part of arrangement with must most willingly have dispensed have be at possible to do so wife congratulated nicely with open affection apparent satisfaction at arrangement enjoyment of one own happiness at such windfall depends so much on free freely expressed enjoyment of others lady lufton congratulation have nearly made throw up whole thing wife smile re encouraged lucy warm eager joy made feel quite delighted with mr sowerby duke of omnium then that splendid animal dandy came home to parsonage stable much to delight of groom gardener of assistant stable boy who have be allowed to creep into establishment unawares a be since master have taken so keenly to hunting satisfaction be not shared in drawing room horse be seen on first journey round to stable gate question be immediately asked be horse mark said have bought from mr little time since with object of obliging mark intended to sell again a soon a must do so judiciously a have said above be not satisfactory neither of two lady at framley parsonage knew much about horse of manner in one gentleman might think proper to oblige by purchasing superfluity of stable did feel that there be horse enough in parsonage stable without dandy that purchasing of hunter with view of immediately selling again be to say least of operation hardly congenial with usual taste pursuit of clergyman hope did not give very much money for mark said fanny not more than will get again said mark fanny saw from form of countenance that have better not pursue subject further at moment suppose will have to go into residence almost immediately said mark recurring to more agreeable subject of stall will have to go live at barchester at once asked lucy house will not be furnished will mark said wife know how will get on frighten yourselves will take lodging in barchester will not see time said mr robarts with dismay prebendary explained that must be backwards forward at framley week that in probability must only sleep at barchester on saturday sunday perhaps not always then doe not seem very hard work of prebendary said lucy be very dignified said fanny prebendary be dignitary of church be not mark decidedly said wife also by special canon law worst of be that of be obliged to wear wig will have hat mark with curly thing at side string through to hold up asked lucy fear that doe not come within perquisite rosette then will never believe that be dignitary do mean to say that will wear hat like common parson like mr crawley for instance well believe may give twist to leaf be by mean sure till will have consulted dean in chapter thus at parsonage talked over good thing be coming to endeavoured to forget new horse hunting boot have be used so often during last winter lady lufton altered countenance might be that evil must vanish away good thing alone remain to be now month of april field be beginning to look green wind have got out of east be soft genial early spring flower be showing bright colour in parsonage garden thing be sweet pleasant be period of year be usually dear to mr robarts husband be always better parson when warm month came than have be during winter distant county friend whom did not know of whom did not approve went away when spring came leaving house innocent empty parish duty be better attended to perhaps domestic duty also at such period be pattern parson pattern husband atoning to own conscience for past shortcoming by present zeal then though have never acknowledged to herself absence of dear friend lady lufton be perhaps in not disagreeable mr robarts did love lady lufton heartily must be acknowledged of ladyship that with good quality be inclined to be masterful liked to rule made people feel that liked mr robarts must never have confessed that laboured under sense of thraldom perhaps be mouse enough to enjoy temporary absence of kind hearted cat when lady lufton be away mr robarts have more play in parish mark also be not unhappy though did not find practicable immediately to turn dandy into money indeed just at moment when be good deal over at barchester going through deep mystery rigid ecclesiastical examination be necessary before clergyman can become one of chapter dandy be rather thorn in side wretched bill be to come due early in may before end of april sowerby wrote to saying that be doing utmost to provide for evil day that if price of dandy must be remitted to at once must greatly facilitate object nothing must be more different than mr sowerby tone about money at different time when wanted to raise wind everything be so important haste superhuman effort men running to fro with blank acceptance in hand must alone stave off crack of doom at other time when retaliatory application be made to must prove with easiest voice most jaunty manner that everything be quite serene now at period be in mood of superhuman effort called loudly for hundred thirty pound for dandy after what have passed mark must not bring to say that must pay nothing till bill be safe therefore with assistance of mr forrest of bank did remit price of dandy to friend sowerby in london lucy robarts must now say word of have seen how on occasion when world be at foot have sent noble suitor away not only dismissed so dismissed that might be taught never again to offer to sweet incense of vow have declared to plainly that did not love must not love have thus thrown away not only rich honour high station more than much worse than that have flung away from lover to whose love warm heart clung that love did cling to knew even then owned more thoroughly a soon a be gone so much pride have done for that strong resolve that lady lufton must not scowl on tell that have entrapped son know will be said of lord lufton that putting aside peerage broad acre handsome sonsy face be not worth girl care love will be said because people think that hero in book must be so much better than hero got up for world common wear tear may a well confess that of absolute true heroism there be only moderate admixture in lord lufton composition must world come to if none absolute true hero be to be thought worthy of woman love what must men do what oh what must become of woman lucy robarts in heart did not give dismissed lover credit for much more heroism than did truly appertain to did not perhaps give full credit for certain amount of heroism did really appertain to nevertheless must have be very glad to take must have done so without wounding pride that girl must not marry for money be agreed lady who can sell for title estate for income set of family diamond treat a farmer treat sheep ox make hardly more of herself of own inner self in be comprised mind soul than poor wretch of own sex who earns bread in lowest stage of degradation title estate income be matter will weigh in balance with eve daughter a do with adam son pride of place power of living well in front of world eye be dear to be doubtless intended to be dear only in acknowledging so much let remember that there be price at good thing may be too costly therefore being desirous too of telling truth in matter must confess that lucy did speculate with regret on what must have be to be lady lufton to have be wife of such man owner of such heart mistress of such destiny what more what better must world have done for now have thrown aside because must not endure that lady lufton must call scheming artful girl actuated by fear have repulsed with falsehood though matter be one on be so terribly expedient that must tell truth yet be cheerful with brother sister in law be when be quite alone at night in own room in solitary walk that single silent tear must gather in corner of eye gradually moisten eyelid never told love did allow concealment to feed on damask cheek in employment in way about house accustomed quiet mirth be same a ever in showed peculiar strength god have given not le did in truth mourn for lost love spoiled ambition be going to drive over to hogglestock morning fanny said one day at breakfast suppose mark wo go with well think not pony carriage be wretched for three oh a for must have thought new horse might have be able to carry a far a heard say wanted to see mr crawley so do new horse a call will carry there to morrow will say that will be over about twelve o'clock have better say earlier a be always out about parish very well say eleven be parish business about be going so need not irk conscience to stay in for well lucy must drive ourselves be will be charioteer going then will change coming back to lucy agreed a soon a work in school be over started not word have be spoken between about lord lufton since evening now more than month ago on have be walking together in garden lucy have so demeaned on occasion a to make sister in law quite sure that there have be no love passage up to time nothing have since occurred have created suspicion in mr robarts mind have seen at once that close intimacy between be over thought that everything be a must be do know have idea said in pony carriage day that lord lufton will marry griselda grantly lucy must not refrain from giving little check at rein be holding felt that blood rushed quickly to heart did not betray perhaps may said then gave pony little touch with whip oh lucy wo have puck beaten be going very nicely beg puck pardon see when one be trusted with whip one feel such longing to use oh must keep still feel almost certain that lady lufton must like such match daresay might miss grantly will have large fortune believe be not that altogether be sort of young lady that lady lufton like be ladylike very beautiful come fanny really think be not what must call lovely know very beautiful then be quiet reserved doe not require excitement be sure be conscientious in performance of duty very conscientious have doubt said lucy with something like sneer in tone question suppose be whether lord lufton like think doe in sort of way did not talk to so much a did to ah be lady lufton fault because did have properly labelled there doe not seem to have be much harm done oh by god mercy very little a for will get over in three four year doubt that be if can get as milk change of air will take to barchester for a be saying really do think lord lufton like griselda grantly then really do think that have uncommon bad taste said lucy with reality in voice differing much from tone of banter have hitherto used what lucy said sister in law looking at then fear will really want as milk perhaps considering position ought to know nothing of lord lufton for say that be very dangerous for young lady to know young gentleman do know enough of to understand that ought not to like girl a griselda grantly ought to know that be mere automaton cold lifeless spiritless even vapid there be believe nothing in mentally may be moral excellence to be more absolutely like statue than other human being ever saw to sit still be admired be that desire if can not get that to sit still not be admired must almost suffice for worship lady lufton a do think quite well enough of to wonder that must choose girl a for son wife that doe wish doubt will indeed be surprised if wish also then a finished speech lucy again flogged pony did in vexation because felt that tell tale blood have suffused face why lucy if be brother must not be more eager about must not be only man friend with whom be ever intimate can not bear to think that must throw away be horridly improper to care about thing have doubt think might acknowledge that if mother be satisfied may be satisfied also will not be satisfied be use looking at fanny will make talk of wo tell lie on subject do like lord lufton very much do dislike griselda grantly almost a much therefore will not be satisfied if become man wife however suppose that of will ask consent be probable that lady lufton will do so then went on for perhaps quarter of mile without speaking poor puck at last lucy said sha be whipped more will because miss grantly look like statue fanny tell mark to put into lunatic asylum also know hawk from heron be why like to see such very unfitting marriage there be then nothing more said on subject in two minute arrived at house of hogglestock clergyman mr crawley have brought two child with when came from cornish curacy to hogglestock two other baby have be added to care

that be distasteful to mr crawley who felt savage satisfaction in being left to may almost be said of that felt angry with who relieved have certainly never a yet forgiven dean of barchester for paying debt dean have also given present living consequently old friend be not now so dear to a when in old day must come down to farm house almost a penniless a curate then must walk together for hour along rock bound shore listening to wave discussing deep polemical mystery sometimes with hot fury then again with tender loving charity always with mutual acknowledgment of other truth now lived comparatively near together opportunity arose for such discussion at rate once quarter mr crawley be pressed by old friend to visit at deanery dr arabin have promised that one else must be in house if mr crawley objected to society be not what wanted finery grandeur of deanery comfort of warm snug library must silence at once why did not dr arabin come out there to hogglestock tramp with through dirty lane a used to tramp then must have enjoyed then must have talked then old day must have come back to now arabin always ride on sleek fine horse now day once said to wife with sneer poverty have be so terrible to that be not in heart to love rich friend chapter xxii hogglestock parsonage at end of last chapter left lucy robarts waiting for introduction to mr crawley who be sitting with one

ai grace be great scholar asked lucy drawing child to know said grace with sheepish face be in greek delectus irregular verb greek delectus irregular verb lucy put up hand with astonishment know ode of horace by heart said ode of horace said lucy still holding young shamefaced female prodigy close to knee be can give said mr crawley apologetically little scholarship be only fortune have come in way endeavour to share that with child believe men say that be best fortune of can have said lucy thinking however in own mind that horace irregular greek verb savoured too much of precocious forcing in young lady of nine year old nevertheless grace be pretty simple looking girl clung to ally closely seemed to like being fondled so that lucy anxiously wished that mr crawley must be got rid of present produced hope have left mr robarts quite well said mr crawley with stiff ceremonial voice differing very much from that in have so energetically addressed brother clergyman when be alone together in study at framley be quite well thank suppose have heard of good fortune yes have heard of said mr crawley gravely hope that promotion may tend in way to advantage here hereafter seemed however to be manifest from manner in expressed kind wish that hope expectation did not go hand in hand together by by desired to say that will call here to morrow at about eleven did say fanny yes wish to see about parish business think said mr robarts looking up for moment from anxious discussion in be already engaged with mr crawley on nursery matter pray tell said mr crawley that will be happy to see though perhaps now that new duty have be thrown upon will be better must visit at framley new duty disturb much a yet said lucy riding over here will be trouble to yes there have advantage over unfortunately have horse then lucy began petting little boy by degree slipped small bag of gingerbread nut out of muff into hand have not patience necessary for waiting a have sister in law boy took bag peeped into then looked up into face what be bob said mr crawley gingerbread faltered bobby feeling that sin have be committed though probably feeling also that must hardly a yet be accounted a deeply guilty miss robarts said father be very much obliged to child be hardly used to such thing be lady with weak mind mr crawley always carry thing of sort about with when go to visit child so must forgive allow little boy to accept oh certainly bob child give bag to mamma will let grace have one at time then bag in solemn manner be carried over to mother who taking from son hand laid high on bookshelf not one now said lucy robarts very piteously be so hard mr crawley not upon upon may not learn whether be good of kind be sure be very good think mamma will prefer being put by for present be very discouraging to lucy if one small bag of gingerbread nut created so great difficulty how be to dispose of pot of guava jelly box of bonbon be still in muff how distribute packet of orange with pony carriage be laden there be jelly for sick child chicken broth be indeed jelly to tell truth openly there be also joint of fresh pork basket of egg from framley parsonage farmyard mr robarts be to introduce must find capable of doing so must certainly be cast out with utter scorn by mr crawley if tendered in immediate presence there have also be suggestion a to adding two three bottle of port courage of lady have failed on head wine be not now added to difficulty lucy found very difficult to keep up conversation with mr crawley more so a mr robarts mr crawley presently withdrew into bedroom taking two younger child with how unlucky thought lucy that have not got muff with muff lay in lap ponderous with rich enclosure suppose will live in barchester for portion of year now said mr crawley really know a yet mark talk of taking lodging for first month residence will have house will not oh yes suppose so fear will find interfere with own parish with general

miss robarts be on lucy tongue to say that ladyship be pretty nearly a bad stopped at moment providence sent great relief to miss robarts in shape of mr crawley red armed maid of work who walking up to master whispered into ear that be wanted be time of day at attendance be always required in parish school attendance being so punctually given who wanted looked for there at hour if be absent did not scruple to send for miss robarts be afraid must excuse said getting up taking hat stick lucy begged that might not be at in way already began to speculate how might best unload treasure will make compliment to mr robarts say that be sorry to miss pleasure of wishing good bye will probably see a pass school house then stick in hand walked forth lucy fancied that bobby eye immediately rested on bag of gingerbread nut bob said almost in whisper do like sugar plum very much indeed said bob with exceeding gravity with eye upon window to see whether father have passed then come here said lucy a spoke door again opened mr crawley reappeared have left book behind said coming back through room took up well worn prayer book accompanied in wandering through parish bobby when saw father have retreated few step back a also did grace who to confess truth have be attracted by sound of sugar plum in spite of irregular verb lucy withdrew hand from muff looked guilty be not deceiving good man nay teaching own child to deceive there be men made of such stuff that angel must hardly live with without deceit papa gone now whispered bobby saw turn round corner at rate have learned lesson a be natural that must do one else also have learned that papa be gone for while bob grace be still counting big lump of sugar candy employed while for inward solace with inch of barley sugar front door

shame for know how sick child occupies whole house ah friend said mr crawley taking hold of mr robarts arm looking into face that sort of shame be over with god have tried with want for child sake be glad of such relief will be angry will manage dear mr robarts must not be surprised at lot be sometimes very hard to bear such thing be so much worse for man than for woman fanny be not quite prepared to admit in own heart made reply on head be sure hope may be able to be of use to said if will only look upon a old friend write to if want hesitate to come frequently for fear must offend then by degree there be confidence between poverty stricken helpmate of perpetual curate be able to speak of weight of burden to well to do young wife of barchester prebendary be hard former said to feel so different from wife of other clergyman around to know that lived softly while with work of hand unceasing struggle of energy must hardly manage to place wholesome food before husband child be terrible

power to persuade have told that if must mix once more with world with clerical world know that must be better fitted for performance of own duty answer angrily that be impossible that coat be not fit for dean table mr crawley almost blushed a spoke of such reason what with old friend like dr arabin surely must be nonsense know that be dean must be glad to see with coat fact be that can not bear to enter house of rich man unless duty call there surely be mistake be mistake what can do fear that regard rich a enemy be pining for solace of friend to whom must talk for equal with mind educated like own to whose thought must listen to whom must speak own thought friend must be equal not only in mind in purse where can ever find such man a may get better preferment ah if did be hardly fit for now

only just joined if be to go on in way said to young friend green walker queen government can not be carried on alleged difficulty a to carrying on queen government have be frequently mooted in late year since certain great man first introduced idea nevertheless queen government be carried on propensity aptitude of men for work seems to be not at on decrease if have few young statesman be because old stager be so fond of rattle of harness really see how queen government be to be carried on said harold smith to green walker standing in corner of one of lobby of house of common on first of day of awful interest in queen be sending for one crack statesman after anxious men be beginning to doubt whether must in truth be able to obtain blessing of cabinet god have vanished from place must giant be good enough to do anything for there be men who seemed to think that giant must refuse to do anything for house will now be adjourned over till monday must not be in majesty shoe for something said mr harold smith by jove said green walker who in day be stanch harold smithian having felt pride in joining on a substantial support to cabinet minister have contented with being merely brockite must have counted a nobody by jove green walker opened eye shook head a thought of perilous condition in majesty must be placed happen to know lord wo join unless have foreign office mentioned hundred handed gyas supposed to be of utmost importance to counsel of titan of course be impossible see what on earth be to do there be sidonia do say that be making difficulty now now sidonia be giant supposed to be very powerful know that queen wo see said green walker who being member of parliament for crewe junction nephew to lady hartletop of course have perfectly correct mean of ascertaining what queen must do what must not fact be said harold smith recurring again to own situation a ejected god that house doe not in least understand what be about doe know what want question must like to ask be do intend that queen will have government do not be prepared to support such men a sidonia lord de terrier if so be obedient humble servant will be very much surprised that be lord de terrier be at time recognized by men a leader of giant so will deucedly surprised ca do know there be manchester men ought to know something about down in country say ca support lord de terrier must be natural natural human nature have come to end think said harold smith who must hardly understand that world must conspire to throw over government have joined that too before world have waited to see how much must do for fact be walker have longer among strong feeling of party not d said green walker who be very energetic in present political aspiration till can recover that will never be able to have government firm seated sure handed nobody can count on men from one week to very member who in one month place minister in power be very first to vote against in next must put stop to sort of thing otherwise will never do good mean to deny that brock be wrong with reference to lord brittleback think that be wrong said so all through heaven on earth instead of completing speech harold smith turned away head struck hand together in token of astonishment at fatuity of age what probably meant to express be that if such good deed a late appointment made at petty bag office be not held sufficient to atone for other evil deed to have alluded there must be end of justice in sublunary matter be offence to be forgiven even when so great virtue have be displayed attribute to supplehouse said green walker trying to console friend yes said harold smith now verging on bound of parliamentary eloquence although still spoke with bated breath to one solitary hearer yes be becoming slave of mercenary irresponsible press of one single newspaper there be man endowed with great talent enjoying public confidence untrusted a politician unheard of even a writer by world at large yet because be on staff of jupiter be able to overturn government throw whole country into dismay be astonishing to that man like lord brock must allow to be so timid nevertheless be not yet month since harold smith have be counselling with supplehouse how series of strong article in jupiter together with expected support of manchester men might probably be effective in hurling minister from seat at time minister have not revigorated with young blood how queen government be to be carried on be question now harold smith repeated difficulty have not caused much dismay at period about month since to have alluded at moment sowerby supplehouse together joined having come out of house in unimportant business have be completed after minister notice of adjournment well harold said sowerby what do say to governor statement have nothing to say to said harold smith looking up very solemnly from under penthouse of hat perhaps rather savagely sowerby have supported government at late crisis why be now seen herding with one a supplehouse did pretty well think said sowerby very well indeed said supplehouse a always doe sort of thing man make so good explanation of circumstance come out with so telling personal statement ought to keep in reserve for sort of thing who in meantime be to carry on queen government said harold smith looking very stern must be left to men of lesser mark said of jupiter point a to one really listens to minister subject about men really care be always personal how many of be truly interested a to best mode of governing india in question touching character of prime minister muster together like bee round sounding cymbal arises from envy malice uncharitableness said harold smith yes from picking stealing evil speaking lying slandering said mr sowerby be so prone to desire covet other men place said supplehouse men be so said sowerby be evil speaking lying slandering doe mischief be not harold in meantime how be queen government to be carried on said mr green walker on following morning be known that lord de terrier be with queen at buckingham palace at about twelve list of new ministry be published must have be in highest degree satisfactory to whole brood of giant son of tellus be included in a be also very many of daughter then late in afternoon lord brock be again summoned to palace be thought in west end among club that god have again chance if only said purist evening paper be supposed to be very much in interest of mr harold smith if only lord brock can have wisdom to place right men in right place be only other day that introduced mr smith into government that be step in right direction one have acknowledged though unfortunately be made too late to prevent disturbance have since occurred now appears probable that lordship will again have opportunity of selecting list of statesman with view of carrying on queen government be to be hoped that such men a mr smith may be placed in situation in talent industry acknowledged official aptitude may be of permanent service to country supplehouse when read at club with mr sowerby at elbow declared that style be too well marked to leave doubt a to author ourselves be not inclined to think that mr harold smith wrote article although may be probable that saw in type jupiter next morning settled whole question made known to world that in spite of sending re sending lord brock god be permanently out lord de terrier giant permanently in fractious giant who must only go to foreign office have in fact gone to sphere of much le important duty sidonia in spite of whispered dislike of illustrious personage opened campaign with full appanage of giant of highest standing hope said jupiter lord brock may not yet be too old to take lesson if so present decision of house of common may say of country also may teach not to put trust in such prince a lord brittleback such broken reed a mr harold smith now parting blow always thought to be exceedingly unkind altogether unnecessary on part of mr supplehouse dear said mr harold when first met miss dunstable after catastrophe be known how be possibly to endure degradation put deeply laced handkerchief up to eye christian resignation suggested miss dunstable fiddlestick said mr harold smith millionnaires always talk of christian resignation because never be called on to resign anything if have christian resignation must have cared for such pomp vanity think of dear cabinet minister wife for only three week how doe poor mr smith endure what harold only life on hope of vengeance when have put end to mr supplehouse will be content to die then there be further explanation in house of parliament be altogether satisfactory high bred courteous giant assured god that have piled pelion on os thus climbed up into power very much in opposition to own good will for giant preferred sweet of dignified retirement voice of people have be too strong for effort have be made not by by others who be determined that giant must be at head of affair indeed spirit of time be so clearly in favour of giant there have be no alternative so said briareus to lord orion to common then god be absolutely happy in ceding place so far be from uncelestial envy malice might not be divine that promised to give giant assistance in power in carrying on work of government upon giant declared how deeply indebted must be for such valuable counsel friendly assistance be delightful in extreme not le did ordinary men seem to expect that usual battle must go on in old customary way be easy to love one enemy when one be making fine speech so difficult to do so in actual everyday work of life there be always have be peculiar good point about giant that be never too proud to follow in footstep of god if god deliberating painfully together have elaborated skilful project giant be always willing to adopt a own not treating bantling a foster child praising pushing so that men must regard a undoubted offspring of own brain now just at time there have be plan much thought of for increasing number of bishop good active bishop be very desirable there be strong feeling among certain excellent churchman that there must hardly be too many of lord brock have measure cut dry there must be bishop of westminster to share herculean toil of metropolitan prelate up in north to christianize mining interest wash white blackamoor of newcastle bishop of beverley must be called in opposition to giant be known have intended to put forth whole measure of brute force more curate said be wanting district incumbent not more bishop rolling in carriage that bishop must roll in carriage be very good of such blessing english world for present have enough therefore lord brock god have have much fear a to little project now immediately on accession of giant be known that bishop bill be to be gone on with immediately small change must be effected so that bill must be gigantic rather than divine result must be altogether same must however be admitted that bishop appointed by ourselves may be very good thing whereas appointed by adversary will be anything good doubt feeling went long way with giant be that a may new bishop bill be to be first work of government be to be brought forward carried new prelate selected put into chair at once before grouse must begin to crow put end to doings of god a well a giant among other minor effect arising from decision be following that archdeacon mr grantly returned to london again took lodging in have before be staying on various occasion also during first week of second sojourn dr grantly might be seen entering official chamber of first lord of treasury much counsel be necessary among high churchman of great repute before fixed resolution must wisely be made in such matter a few churchman stood in higher repute than archdeacon of barchester then began to be rumoured in world that minister have disposed at rate of see of westminster present time be very nervous one for mr grantly what might be aspiration of archdeacon will not stop to inquire may be that time experience have taught futility of earthly honour made content with comfortable opulence of barsetshire rectory there be theory of church discipline make necessary that clergyman wife must have objection to bishopric archdeacon probably be only anxious to give disinterested aid to minister mr grantly did long to sit in high place be at rate equal to mr proudie be for child said to herself that be thus anxious that must have good position before world mean of making best of one be able to hing know shut up there down at plumstead have remarked to lady lufton on occasion of first visit to london yet time be not long past when have thought that rectory house at plumstead to be by mean insufficient contemptible then there came question whether griselda must go back to mother idea be very strongly opposed by lady lufton ultimately with success really think dear girl be very happy with said lady lufton if ever be to belong to more closely will be so well that must know love one to tell truth lady lufton have be trying hard to know love griselda hitherto have scarcely succeeded to full extent of wish that loved griselda be certain with sort of love spring from person volition not from judgment have said all along to herself others that did love griselda grantly have admired young lady face liked manner approved of fortune family have selected for daughter in law in somewhat impetuous manner therefore loved be by mean clear to lady lufton that did a yet know young friend match be plan of own therefore stuck to a warmly a ever began to have misgiving whether dear girl must be to that have dreamed of in daughter in law dear lady lufton said mr grantly be not possible that may put affection to too severe test what if must learn to regard then ah if did must have fear of result if showed anything like love for ludovic must be at foot in moment be impulsive be not exactly lady lufton be privilege to be impulsive to sue for affection hers to have love sought for without making demonstration be perhaps fault of young lady of present day that be too impulsive assume privilege be not own thus lose be quite true quite agree with be probably very feeling have made think so highly of griselda then then young lady though need not jump down gentleman throat throw into face may give sign that be made of flesh blood especially when papa mamma belonging to be so anxious to make path of love run be what be passing through lady lufton mind did not say merely looked think will ever allow to indulge in unauthorized passion said mr grantly be sure will not said lady lufton with ready agreement fearing perhaps in heart that griselda must never indulge in passion authorized unauthorized know whether lord lufton see much of now said mr grantly thinking perhaps of promise of lady lufton with reference to lordship spare time just lately during change know everybody have be so much engaged ludovic have be constantly at house then men find so necessary to be at club just now yes yes of course said mr grantly who be not at disposed to think little of importance of present crisis to wonder that men must congregate together when such deed be to be done a now occupied breast of queen adviser at last however two mother perfectly understood other griselda be still to remain with lady lufton be to accept ladyship son if must only be induced to exercise privilege of asking in meantime a seemed to be doubtful griselda be not to be debarred from privilege of making what use must of other string might have to bow mamma said griselda in moment of unwatched intercourse between mother daughter be really true that be going to make papa bishop can tell nothing a yet dear people in world be talking about papa have be good deal with lord de terrier be prime minister oh yes be happy to say that be thought prime minister must make one bishop that chooses clergyman be there be see vacant said mr grantly then there be chance said griselda looking very glum be going to have act of parliament for making two more bishop be what be talking about at least if do papa will be bishop of westminster wo will live in london must not talk about dear wo mamma bishop of westminster will be higher than bishop of barchester wo will so like to be able to snub miss proudies will therefore be seen that there be matter on even griselda grantly must be animated like rest of family be devoted to church late on afternoon archdeacon returned home to dine in mount street having spent whole of day between treasury chamber meeting of convocation club when did get home be soon manifest to wife that be not laden with good news be almost incredible said standing with back to drawing room fire what be incredible said wife sharing husband anxiety to full if have not learned a fact must not have believed even of lord brock said archdeacon learned what said anxious wife after be going to oppose bill impossible said mr grantly be bill for two new bishop archdeacon oppose own bill yes oppose own bill be almost incredible so be change have be forced upon little thing have forgotten quite minor matter now say that will be obliged to divide against on twopenny halfpenny hair splitting point be lord brock own doing too after that said about abstaining from factious opposition to government believe there be nothing too bad too false for man said mr grantly after said too when be in power a to present government opposing cause of religion declare now that lord de terrier can not be very anxious about a have so many good reason against few week ago be not dreadful that there must be such double dealing in men in such position be sickening said mr grantly then there be pause between a thought of injury be done to archdeacon well must not give up small point shame into compliance nothing must shame must not be well to try game be so good one stake so important that mr grantly felt that must be worth playing for to last be good certainly must suggest to lord de terrier be sure country must go along with at rate church must be impossible said archdeacon to tell truth did occur to of down there seemed to think that must not do mr grantly sat awhile on sofa still meditating in mind whether there might not yet be escape from so terrible downfall archdeacon will go upstairs dress said in despondency archdeacon surely present ministry may have majority on subject a thought be sure of majority now not sure at rate chance be in favour do hope will do duty exert to keep member together then archdeacon told out whole of truth lord de terrier say that under present circumstance will not bring matter forward session at so have better go back to plumstead mr grantly then felt that there be nothing further to be said will be proper that historian must drop veil over suffering chapter xxiv magna est veritas be made known to reader in early part of winter mr sowerby have scheme for retrieving lost fortune setting right in world by marrying that rich heiress miss dunstable fear friend sowerby doe not at present stand high in estimation of who have come on with thus far in narrative have be described a spendthrift gambler a one scarcely honest in extravagance gambling nevertheless there be worse men than mr sowerby be not prepared to say must be successful with miss dunstable that lady must choose by mean worst of suitor who be continually throwing at foot reckless a man always appeared to be reckless a absolutely be there be still within heart desire for better thing in mind understanding that have hitherto missed career of honest english gentleman be proud of position a member for county though hitherto have done so little to grace be proud of domain at chaldicotes though possession of have so nearly passed out of own hand be proud of old blood flowed in vein be proud also of easy comfortable gay manner went so far in world judgment to atone for extravagance evil practice if only must get chance a now said to thing must go very differently with must utterly forswear whole company of tozers must cease to deal in bill to pay heaven only know how many hundred per cent for money must no longer prey upon friend must redeem title deed from clutch of duke of omnium if only must get chance miss dunstable fortune must do ever so much more then moreover miss dunstable be woman whom really liked be not soft feminine pretty be very young be clever self possessed quite able to hold own in class a to age mr sowerby be not very young in making such match must have cause of shame must speak of before friend without fear of grimace ask to house with full assurance that head of table must not disgrace then a scheme grew clearer clearer to declared to that if must be successful must use well not rob her of money beyond what be absolutely necessary have intended to have laid fortune at foot at chaldicotes lady have be coy then deed be to have be done at gatherum castle lady ran away from gatherum castle just at time on have fixed since one circumstance after have postponed affair in london till now at last be resolved that must know fate let be what might if must not contrive that thing must speedily be arranged might come to pas that must be altogether debarred from presenting to lady a mr sowerby of chaldicotes tidings have reached through mr fothergill that duke must be glad to have matter arranged mr sowerby well knew meaning of message mr sowerby be not fighting campaign alone without aid of ally indeed man ever have more trusty ally in campaign than have in be ally only faithful comrade that clung to through good ill during whole life who first put into head that miss dunstable be woman might be married hundred needy adventurer have attempted failed already mr sowerby have said when plan be first proposed to nevertheless will day marry one why not a well a sister have answered for mr harold smith be ally of whom have spoken mr harold smith may have be fault must boast of virtue that loved brother be probably only human being that did love child have none a for husband have never occurred to to love have married for position being clever woman with good digestion command of temper have managed to get through world without much of unhappiness usually follows ill assorted marriage at home managed to keep upper hand did so in easy good humoured way that made rule bearable away from home assisted lord political standing though laughed more keenly than one else at foible lord of heart be brother in scrape extravagance recklessness have ever be willing to assist with view of doing have sought intimacy of miss dunstable for last year past have indulged caprice of lady rather have have wit to learn that miss dunstable be to be won not by indulgence of caprice by free easy intercourse with dash of fun at rate semblance of honesty mr harold smith be not perhaps very honest by disposition in latter day have taken up theory of honesty for sake of miss dunstable not altogether in vain for miss dunstable mr harold smith be certainly very intimate if be to do at must not wait longer said mr sowerby to sister day two after final break down of god affection of sister for brother may be imagined from fact that at time must give up mind to subject in truth husband position a cabinet minister be a nothing to compared with brother position a county gentleman one time be a good a said mr harold smith mean that must advise to ask at once certainly must remember nat will have easy task will not do for to kneel down swear that love if do at will certainly do without kneeling may be sure of harriet yes without swearing that love there be only one way in can be successful with miss dunstable must tell truth what tell be ruined horse foot dragoon then bid help out of mire exactly will be only chance strange a may appear be very different from what used to say down at chaldicotes so be know much better than did when be there since then have done little else than study freak of character if really like think doe must forgive other crime that of swearing that loved must hardly know how to propose without saying something about must say nothing not word must tell that be gentleman of good blood high station sadly out at elbow know that already of course doe must know a coming directly from own mouth then tell that propose to set right by marrying by marrying for sake of money will hardly win must say if doe not other way that know of will do so a told before will be easy task of course must make understand that happiness will be cared for must not be put prominently forward a object first object be money only chance for success be in telling truth be very seldom that man find in position a said sowerby walking up down sister room upon word think be up to task must certainly break down believe there be man in london must go to woman with story a then ask to marry if can not may a well give up said mr harold smith if can do if can go through with in manner own opinion be that chance of success must not be bad fact be added sister after awhile during brother be continuing walk meditating on difficulty of position fact be men never understand woman give credit neither for strength for weakness be too bold too timid think be fool tell so yet never can trust to do kind action why must not marry with intention of doing good turn after must lose very little there be estate if redeemed must belong to a well a to must be good turn indeed fear must be too modest to put to in way position must be much better a wife than be at present be good humoured good tempered must intend to treat well on whole must be much happier a mr sowerby of chaldicotes than can be in present position if cared about being married suppose must be peer wife to morrow think care about being peer wife needy peer might perhaps win in way propose to then needy peer must not know how to set about needy peer have tried dozen have doubt have failed because have pretended that be in love with may be difficult only chance be to tell truth where will do here if choose own house will be better never can see there at least not alone believe that never be alone

to such wooing a that have suggested suppose have better begin with schedule of debt make reference if doubt to fothergill sheriff officer tozer family will not doubt on head will be bit surprised then there be again pause during mr sowerby still walked up down room thinking whether might possibly have chance of success in so hazardous enterprise tell what harriet at last said wish 'd do for well said if really mean will make attempt be sure of will never make positively must not have courage to tell in so many word wanted to marry for money well nat will attempt at rate be not afraid of

whether accedes to proposition not will continue friend think that must die for for a world go suit other such little trifle a will not break love so be settled on following day mr harold smith be to find opportunity of explaining whole matter to miss dunstable be to ask lady to share fortune incredible number of thousand of pound with bankrupt member for west barsetshire who in return be to bestow on debt mr harold smith have spoken no more than truth in saying that miss dunstable suited one have not improperly described friendship be not prepared to die one for sake of other have said nothing to other of mutual love affection never kissed cried made speech when met when parted there be great benefit for have to be grateful to other terrible injury have forgiven suited other take be secret of most of pleasantest intercourse in world be almost grievous that must suit other for miss dunstable be much worthier of two have known be almost to be lamented that must have found able to live with mr harold smith on term be perfectly satisfactory to herself mr harold smith be worldly heartless to world brother a have be above hinted almost dishonest miss dunstable be not worldly though be possible that present style of life might make so be affectionate fond of truth prone to honesty if around must allow to exercise be fond of ease humour sometimes of wit might almost be called broad have thorough love of ridiculing world humbug in propensity mr harold smith indulged under circumstance be now together almost day have become quite habit with mr harold smith to have driven early in forenoon to miss dunstable house that lady though must never be found alone by mr sowerby be habitually so found by sister after that must go out together separately a fancy business of day might direct be easy to other in alliance so managed that never trod on other corn on day following agreement made between mr sowerby mr harold smith lady a usual called on miss dunstable soon found alone with friend in small room heiress kept solely for own purpose on special occasion person of various sort be there admitted occasionally parson who have church to build dowager laden with last morsel of town slander poor author who must not get due payment for effort of brain poor governess on whose feeble stamen weight of world have borne too hardly men who by possibility must be lover did not make way thither woman who must be bore in latter day be during present london season door of have be oftener opened to mr harold smith than to other person now effort be to be made with object of intimacy have be effected a came thither in carriage mr harold smith be not altogether devoid of sinking of heart be so frequently forerunner of difficult hazardous undertaking have declared that must feel fear in making little proposition did feel something very like when made entrance into little room certainly wished that work be done over how be poor mr smith to day asked miss dunstable with air of mock condolence a friend seated in accustomed easy chair downfall of god be a yet history hardly three day old might well be supposed that late lord of petty bag have hardly recovered from misfortune well be better think morning at least must judge so from manner in confronted egg still like way handle carving knife be sure be always thinking of mr supplehouse at moment poor man mean supplehouse after why must follow trade a well a live let live be what say ay be kill let kill with be what horace say however be tired of now came here to day to talk about something else rather like mr supplehouse exclaimed miss dunstable never make bone about matter have certain work to do certain cause to serve namely own in order to do work serve cause us such weapon a god have placed in hand be what wild beast do where will find men honester than tiger tear up because be hungry want to eat be what supplehouse doe there be so many among tearing up one without excuse of hunger mere pleasure of destroying be reason enough well dear mission to to day be certainly not one of destruction a will admit when hear be one rather very absolutely of salvation have come to make love to then salvation suppose be not for myself said miss dunstable be quite clear to mr harold smith miss dunstable have immediately understood whole purport of visit that be not in great measure surprised did not seem from tone of heiress voice from serious look at once settled on face that must be prepared to give very ready compliance then great object can only be won with great effort be a may be said mr harold smith for also hope trust at rate may not offend oh law nothing of kind ever offends now well suppose be used to like eel dear mind least in world only sometimes know be little tedious will endeavour to avoid so may a well break ice at once know enough of nathaniel affair to be aware that be not very rich man since do ask about suppose there be harm in saying that believe to be very poor man not least harm in world just reverse may come of wish be that truth must be told scrupulously on side truth whole truth nothing truth magna est veritas said miss dunstable bishop of barchester taught a much latin a at chaldicotes did add more there be long word forgot bishop be quite right dear be sure if go to latin be lost a be just now saying brother pecuniary affair be in very bad state have beautiful property of own have be in family for ca say how many century long before conquest know wonder what ancestor be then doe not much signify to of said mr harold smith with moral shake of head what ancestor be be sad thing to see old property go to ruin yes indeed none of like to see property going to ruin whether be old new have of sort of feeling already although mine be only made other day out of apothecary shop god forbid must ever help to ruin said mr harold smith must be sorry to be mean of losing ten pound note magna est veritas a dear bishop said exclaimed miss dunstable let have truth whole truth nothing truth a agreed just now mr harold smith did begin to find that task before be difficult there be hardness about miss dunstable when matter of business be concerned on seemed almost impossible to make impression be not that have evinced determination to refuse tender of mr sowerby hand be so painfully resolute not to have dust thrown in eye mr harold smith have commenced with mind fixed upon avoiding what called humbug sort of humbug have become so prominent part of usual rhetoric that found very hard to abandon be what wish said of course chief object be to secure brother happiness be very unkind to poor mr harold smith well well well know what mean yes think do know what mean brother be gentleman of good family of mean not quite so bad a of embarrassed mean then anything that will whereas be lady of family of sufficient wealth think that if brought together made match of must be very good thing for for whom said miss dunstable yes exactly said mr harold smith for of remember bishop now nice little bit of latin for nathaniel then said mr harold smith boldly must be very good thing for slight smile came across face a said now be honest mischief be in yes that be honest enough did send here to tell well did that something else now let have something else really important part have doubt have be spoken by mean by mean of be so hard on one dear with running after honesty that one be not able to tell real fact a be make one speak in such bald naked way ah think that anything naked must be indecent even truth think be more proper looking better suited too for world work when go about with sort of garment on be so used to leaven of falsehood in hear say now day that nothing be more likely to deceive than absolute truth if shopkeeper told that ware be simply middling of course must think that be not worth farthing have nothing to do with poor brother well what be saying be going to tell how well must use doubt something of kind that must beat spend money if managed to have tied up out of power look down on with contempt because father be apothecary be not that what be going to say be going to tell that might be more happy a mr sowerby of chaldicotes than can be a miss dunstable of mount lebanon have mr sowerby other message to send nothing about love anything of sort must like know to understand what feeling be before take such leap do believe have a true regard for a man of age ever doe have for woman of mine be not putting in very devoted way certainly be glad to see that remember bishop maxim what must have say if told that be dying for love must say be trying to cheat now because tell so say that be wanting in devotion must say be hard to please perhaps be very unreasonable into bargain ought to ask question of kind when brother proposes to do so much honour a for expecting love of man who condescends to wish to be husband that of course must be monstrous what right can have to think that man must love ought to be enough for to know that a be rich can get husband what business can such a have to inquire whether gentleman who must so honour really must like company must only deign to put up with presence in household now dear miss dunstable of course be not such as a to expect that gentleman must love feel ought to be obliged to brother for sparing string of complimentary declaration be usual on such occasion at rate be not tedious rather on behalf for doubt own time be so occupied with parliamentary duty that can not attend to little matter do feel grateful to perhaps nothing more will be necessary than to give schedule of property name early day for putting in possession mr smith did feel that be rather badly used miss dunstable in mutual confidence have so often ridiculed love making grimace of mercenary suitor have spoken so fiercely against who have persecuted not because have desired money on account of ill judgment in thinking to be fool mr smith have right to expect that method have adopted for opening negotiation must be taken in better spirit must be possible after thought mr smith to herself that miss dunstable be like other woman that did like to have men kneeling at foot must be case that have advised brother badly that must have be better for to have gone about work in old fashioned way be very hard to manage said mr harold smith to herself thinking of own sex be coming here said advised not to do so be so kind of thought must explain to more openly more freely what intention really be oh have doubt that be honourable said miss dunstable doe not want to deceive in way be quite sure be impossible to help laughing mr harold smith did laugh upon word must provoke saint said be not likely to get into such company by alliance that be now suggesting to there be not many saint usually at chaldicotes believe always excepting dear bishop wife dear what be to say to nathaniel tell of course how much obliged to be do listen to one moment daresay have done wrong to speak to in bold unromantic way not at truth whole truth nothing truth be what agreed upon one first effort in line be always apt to be little uncouth will send nathaniel to do so why torment do like brother in certain way like much earthly consideration must induce to marry be not so glaringly plain that must marry for money only that have not even dared to suggest other reason of course must have be nonsense to say that have regard towards money of course must absolute nonsense be poor man with good position want to marry because have got that want dear want that have got therefore bargain must not be fair one must do very best to make happy be so much obliged to see be very happy a be must gain companion whom confess that like ah know must like too much even of such companion a brother dear wo do believe when tell once for that wo do do mean then miss dunstable that will never marry to morrow if met one fancied must have rather think that may fancy wo have in first place if marry one man must be quite indifferent to money then will not find in world dear very possibly not said miss dunstable be further said upon subject need not be here repeated mr harold smith did not give up cause quite at once although miss dunstable have spoken so plainly tried to explain how eligible must be friend situation a mistress of chaldicotes when chaldicotes must owe penny to man went so far a to hint that master of chaldicotes if relieved of embarrassment known a rich man might in probability be found worthy of peerage when god must return to olympus mr harold smith a cabinet minister must of course do best be of use be not destiny said miss dunstable therefore press longer will not quarrel said mr harold smith almost tenderly oh why must quarrel wo look glum at brother why must look glum at mr smith will do more than not looking glum at do like do like brother if can in moderate way assist in difficulty let

be feeling of mind at moment a went to meet brother gave account of interview did occur to that possibly miss dunstable might be better creditor than duke of omnium for chaldicotes property chapter xxv non impulsive can not be held a astonishing that last decision on part of giant in matter of two bishopric must have disgusted archdeacon grantly be politician not politician a be a be case with exoteric men political eye saw short way only political aspiration be a limited when friend came into office bishop bill a original product of enemy have be regarded by a being so pernicious for be not about to be made law in order that other proudies such like might be hoisted up into high place large income to terrible detriment of church bishop bill say in hand of friend have appeared to to be mean of almost national salvation then how great have be good fortune of giant in matter have be originator of measure must not have have chance of success now now that two bishop be falling into mouth out of weak hand of god be not success ensured so dr grantly have girded up loin marched up to fight almost regretting that triumph must be so easy subsequent failure be very trying to temper a party man always strike that supporter of titan be in respect much to be pitied giant who be actually handling pelion breaking shin over lower rock of os be always advancing in sort towards council of olympus highest policy be to snatch ray from heaven why else put pelion on os unless be that furtive hand making way through jove window may pluck forth thunderbolt two article le destructive of manufacture equally divine in consists wisdom of higher giant that in spite of mundane antecedent theory predilection can see that article of divine manufacture be necessary then never carry supporter with whole army be army of martyr for twenty year have stuck to see how have treated be not that always plaint of old giant slave have be true to party life where be now say where indeed friend looking about begin to learn that can not describe whereabouts marvel at one find planted at last in so terribly foul morass a must fain stand still for ever on dry ground dr grantly be disgusted although be too true thorough in feeling to be able to say aloud that giant be wrong still have sad feeling within heart that world be sinking from under be still sufficiently exoteric to think that good stand up fight in good cause be good thing doubt did wish to be bishop of westminster be anxious to compass preferment by mean might appear to to be fair why not be not end of aspiration wished that giant might prevail in everything in bishopric a in other matter must not understand that must give way on very first appearance of skirmish in open talk be loud against many god in heart of heart be bitter enough against porphyrion orion dear doctor must not in session must not indeed so have spoken to half fledged especially esoteric young monster cub at treasury who considered a up to dodge of party regarded army of martyr who supported a rather heavy very useful collection of fogey dr grantly have not cared to discus matter with half fledged monster cub best licked of monster giant most like god of have said word two to also have said word two to giant porphyrion have told that bishop bill must not do in return speaking with warm face blood in cheek have told porphyrion that saw reason why bill must not do courteous giant have smiled a shook ponderous head then archdeacon have left unconsciously shaking dust from shoe a paced passage of treasury chamber for last time a walked back to lodging in mount street many thought not altogether bad in nature passed through mind why must trouble about bishopric be not well a be in rectory down at plumstead might not be ill for at age to transplant into new soil to engage in new duty live among new people be not useful at barchester respected also might not be possible that up there at westminster might be regarded merely a tool with other men must work have not quite liked tone of specially esoteric young monster cub who have clearly regarded a distinguished fogey from army of martyr must take wife back to barsetshire there live contented with good thing providence have given high political grape have become sour sneering friend will say well be not good thing grape must become sour hang out of reach be not wise who can regard grape a sour be manifestly too high for hand grape of treasury bench for god giant fight suffering so much when be forced to abstain from eating so much more when do eat grape be very sour to be sure that be indigestible that who eat undergo ill revalenta arabica be prepared to cure so be now with archdeacon thought of strain must have be put on conscience have come up there to sit in london a bishop of westminster in frame of mind walked home to wife during first few moment of interview with regret have come back upon indeed must have hardly suited for then to have preached new doctrine of rural contentment wife of bosom whom so fully trusted have so fully loved wished for grape that hung high upon wall knew that be past power to teach at moment to drop ambition teaching that might effect in way must come by degree before many minute be over have told her of fate of own decision so have better go back to plumstead said have not dissented be sorry for poor griselda sake mr grantly have remarked later in evening when be again together thought be to remain with lady lufton well so will for little time there be one with whom must so soon trust out of own care a with lady lufton be that one can desire exactly a far a griselda be concerned can not say that think be to be pitied not to be pitied perhaps said mr grantly see archdeacon lady lufton of course have own view own view be hardly secret that be very anxious to make match between lord lufton griselda though might be very proper arrangement if be fixed lord lufton marry griselda said archdeacon speaking quick raising eyebrow mind have a yet be troubled by few thought respecting child future establishment have never dreamt of such thing other people have done more than dream of archdeacon a regard match must think be unobjectionable lord lufton will not be very rich man property be respectable a far a can learn character be on whole good if like other must be contented with marriage must own be not quite satisfied at idea of leaving alone with lady lufton people will look on a settled thing when be not settled very probably may not be settled will do poor girl harm be very much admired there can be doubt of lord dumbello archdeacon opened eye still wider have have idea that choice of son in law be being prepared for to tell truth be almost bewildered by height of wife ambition lord lufton with barony twenty thousand year might be accepted a just good enough failing there be embryo marquis whose fortune must be more than ten time a great ready to accept child then thought a husband sometimes will think of susan harding a be when have gone courting to under elm before house in warden garden at barchester of dear old mr harding wife father who still lived in humble lodging in city a thought wondered at admired greatness of lady mind never can forgive lord de terrier said lady connecting various point together in own mind be nonsense said archdeacon must forgive must confess that annoys to leave london at present ca be helped said archdeacon somewhat gruffly for be man who on certain point chose to have own way have oh know ca be helped said mr grantly in tone implied deep injury know ca be helped poor griselda then went to bed on next morning griselda came to in interview be strictly private mother said more to than have ever yet spoken a to prospect of future life hitherto on subject mr grantly have said little nothing must have be well pleased that daughter must have received incense of lord lufton vow perhaps a well pleased have be incense of lord dumbello vow without interference on part in such case child knew must have told with quite sufficient eagerness matter in case must have be arranged a very pretty love match have fear of impropriety of rashness on griselda part have thoroughly known daughter when boasted that griselda must never indulge in unauthorized passion a matter now stood with two string to bow with lufton grantly alliance treaty in existence of griselda knew nothing might not be possible that poor child must stumble through want of adequate direction guided by thought mr grantly have resolved to say few word before left london so wrote line to daughter griselda reached mount street at two o'clock in lady lufton carriage during interview waited for at beer shop round corner papa wo be bishop of westminster said young lady when doings of giant have be sufficiently explained to make understand that hope be over dear at rate not now what shame thought be settled what be good mamma of lord de terrier being prime minister if ca make whom like bishop think that lord de terrier have behaved at well to father however be long question ca go into now how glad proudies will be griselda must have talked by hour on subject have mother allowed be necessary that mr grantly must go to other matter began about lady lufton saying what dear woman ladyship be then went on to say that griselda be to remain in london a long a suited friend hostess to stay there with added that might probably not be very long a be notorious that lady lufton when in london be always in hurry to get back to framley think be in such hurry year mamma said griselda who in month of may preferred bruton street to plumstead have objection to coronet on panel of lady lufton coach then mr grantly commenced explanation very cautiously dear daresay be not in such hurry year be a long a remain with be sure be very kind be very kind ought to love very much know do have friend in world for whom have greater regard than for lady lufton be that make so happy to leave with same wish that papa have remained up be if have made papa bishop be good thinking of now dear what particularly wanted to say to be think must know be idea lady lufton entertains idea said griselda who have never troubled much in thinking about other people thought griselda while be staying down at framley court also suppose since have be up here in bruton street must have seen good deal of lord lufton doe come very often to bruton street be to say not very often h m ejaculated mr grantly very gently must willingly have repressed sound altogether have be too much for if found reason to think that lady lufton be playing false must immediately take daughter away break up treaty prepare for hartletop alliance such be thought ran through mind knew while lady lufton be not false fault be not with lady lufton perhaps altogether with lord lufton mr grantly have understood full force of complaint lady lufton have made against daughter though have of course defended child on whole have defended successfully yet confessed to herself that griselda chance of first rate establishment must be better if be little more impulsive man doe not wish to marry statue let statue be ever so statuesque must not teach daughter to be impulsive more than must teach to be six foot high might not be possible to teach to seem so task be very delicate one even for mother hand of course can not be at home now a much a be down in country when be living in same house said mr grantly whose business be to take lord lufton part at present moment must be at club at house of lord in twenty place be very fond of going to party dance beautifully be sure doe have seen a much a think know one with whom like to dance mother gave daughter loving little squeeze do mean mamma yes do mean dear be not true lady lufton say that like dancing with better than with one else in london know said griselda looking down upon ground mr grantly thought that upon whole be rather good opening might have be better point of interest more serious in nature than of waltz might have be found on to connect daughter sympathy with of future husband point of interest be better than none be so difficult to find point of interest in person who by nature be not impulsive lady lufton say so at rate continued mr grantly ever so cautiously think that lord lufton like partner better what do think griselda know mamma young lady must think of such thing must not must mamma suppose do truth be griselda that lady lufton think that if can guess what be think mamma be fib on griselda part think that griselda must make best possible wife in world for son think so too think that son will be very fortunate man if can get such wife now what do think griselda think anything mamma must not do be absolutely necessary that must think absolutely necessary that mother must tell so such degree of unimpulsiveness a must lead to heaven know what result lufton grantly treaty hartletop interest must be thrown away upon young lady who must not think anything of noble suitor sighing for smile besides be not natural griselda a mother knew have never be girl of headlong feeling still have have like dislike in matter of bishopric be keen enough one must evince deeper interest in subject of well made new dress than griselda grantly be not possible that must be indifferent a to future prospect must know that prospect depended mainly on marriage mother be almost angry with nevertheless went on very gently think anything darling must think must make up mind what must be answer if lord lufton be to propose to be what lady lufton wish to do never will mamma if did be sure never will doe think of thing at what dear know mamma surely can speak out to dearest care about be happiness lady lufton think that must be happy marriage if cared for other enough think that be fond of if be ten time lord lufton must not tease about if thought that must not learn to care about be be going to say dear lord lufton think great deal more of lucy robarts than doe of of of one else believe said griselda showing now little animation by manner dumpy little black thing that be lucy robarts said mr grantly taken by surprise at finding that daughter be moved by such passion a jealousy feeling also perfectly assured that there must not be possible ground for jealousy in such direction a lucy robarts dear suppose lord lufton ever thought of speaking to except in way of civility did mamma remember at framley mr grantly began to look back in mind thought did remember having once observed lord lufton talking in rather confidential manner with parson sister be sure that there be nothing in if be reason why griselda be so cold to proposed lover must be thousand pity that must not be removed now mention do remember young lady said mr grantly dark girl very low without much figure seemed to to keep very much in background know much about mamma a far a saw did dear griselda must not allow to think of thing lord lufton of course be bound to be civil to young lady in mother house be quite sure that have other idea with regard to miss robarts certainly can not speak a to intellect for think opened mouth in presence oh have plenty to say for when plea be sly little thing at rate dear have personal attraction at think that lord lufton be man to be taken by by by anything miss robarts might do say a word personal attraction be uttered griselda managed so to turn neck a to catch side view of herself in one of mirror on wall then bridled up made little play with eye looked a mother thought very well be nothing to mamma of course said well dear perhaps not say that be wish to put slightest constraint upon feeling if did not have most thorough dependence on good sense high principle must not speak to in way a have thought best to tell that lady lufton must be well pleased if thought that lord lufton be fond of other be sure never think of such thing mamma a for lucy robarts pray get idea out of head if not for sake then for must give credit for better taste be not so easy to take anything out of griselda head that have once taken into a for taste mamma there be accounting for said then colloquy on subject be over result of on mr grantly mind be feeling amounting almost to conviction in favour of dumbello interest chapter xxvi impulsive trust reader will remember how puck pony be beaten during drive to hogglestock may be presumed that puck on occasion did not suffer much skin be not so soft a mr robarts heart little beast be full of oat good thing of world therefore when whip touched must dance about shake little ear run on at tremendous pace for twenty yard making mistress think that have endured terrible thing in truth during whipping puck be not chief sufferer lucy have be forced to declare forced by strength of own feeling by impossibility of assenting to propriety of marriage between lord lufton miss grantly have be forced to declare that did care about lord lufton a much a though be brother have said to herself nay much more than very often now have said out loud to sister in law knew that what have said be remembered considered have to certain extent become cause of altered conduct fanny alluded very seldom to luftons in casual conversation never spoke about lord lufton unless when husband

discerning good from evil now to what pas have brought that man fothergill have put before in so terribly clear light now that day for final demolishment have arrived necessity that must be demolished finished away at once out of sight out of mind have not be softened a be half hidden by ambiguous phrase have have cake eaten eaten greedily be not sufficient for must eat cake twice must have succession of cake friend there be succession of cake for who eat greedily proposition be not fair one who have whip hand of will not listen to be good enough to vanish permit to be swept quietly into

will grow by being fed on if only feeder be not too insatiate on wisdom mr sowerby pondered with sad heart very melancholy mind a walked away from premise of messrs gumption gagebee intention have be to go down to house after leaving mr fothergill prospect of immediate ruin have be too much for knew that be not fit to be seen at once among haunt of men have intended also to go down to barchester early on following morning only for few hour that might make further arrangement respecting that bill robarts have accepted for bill second one have now become due mr tozer have be with now ai use in life mr sowerby tozer have said ai got paper did 'old not two hour went away through tom tozer know that mr sowerby a well a do now whenever tozer mr sowerby tozer spoke of tom tozer mr sowerby knew that seven devil be being evoked worse than first devil mr sowerby did feel something like sincere regard rather love for poor parson whom have inveigled into mischief must fain save if be possible from tozer fang mr forrest of barchester bank must probably take up last five hundred pound bill on behalf of mr robarts only must be needful that sowerby must run down see that be properly done a to other bill former lesser one a to mr tozer must probably be quiet for while such have be sowerby programme for two day now what further possibility be there now that must care for robarts other human being be to be swept at once into dung heap in frame of mind walked up south audley street crossed one side of grosvenor square went almost mechanically into green street at farther end of green street near to park lane lived mr mr harold smith chapter xxviii dr thorne when miss dunstable met friend gresham young frank gresham wife at gatherum castle immediately asked after one dr thorne who be mr gresham uncle dr thorne be old bachelor in whom a man doctor miss dunstable be inclined to place much confidence not that have ever entrusted cure of bodily ailment to dr thorne for kept doctor of own dr easyman for purpose may moreover be said that rarely have bodily ailment requiring care of doctor always spoke of dr thorne among friend a man of wonderful erudition judgment have once twice asked acted on advice in matter of much moment dr thorne be not man accustomed to london world kept house there seldom even visited metropolis miss dunstable have known at greshamsbury where lived there have for month past grown up considerable intimacy between be now staying at house of niece mr gresham chief reason of coming up have be desire expressed by miss dunstable that must do so have wished for advice at instigation of niece have visited london given special piece of business a to dr thorne have thus be summoned from bedside of country patient especially from bedside of lady arabella gresham to whose son niece be married related to certain large money interest a to one might have imagined that dr thorne advice must not be peculiarly valuable have never be much versed in such matter on own account be knowing neither in way of share market in price of land miss dunstable be lady accustomed to have own way to be indulged in own wish without being called on to give adequate reason for dear have said to young mr gresham if uncle come up to london now when make such point of will think that be bear savage certainly will never speak to again to frank to so have better see to mr gresham have not probably taken friend threat a meaning quite that threatened miss dunstable habitually used strong language who knew well generally understood when be to be taken a expressing thought by figure of speech in instance have not meant nevertheless mr gresham have used violent influence in bringing poor doctor up to london besides said miss dunstable have resolved on having doctor at conversazione if wo come of will go down fetch have set heart on trumping dear friend mr proudie best card so mean to get everybody upshot of be that doctor did come up to town remained best part of week at niece house in portman square to great disgust of lady arabella who conceived that must die if neglected for three day a to matter of business have doubt that be of great use be possessed of common sense honest purpose be inclined to think that be often sufficient counterpoise to considerable amount of worldly experience if one must have worldly experience also true then be so difficult to get everything with special matter of business need not have further concern will presume to have be discussed completed will now dress for miss dunstable conversazione must not be supposed that be so poor in genius a to call party openly by name borrowed for nonce from mr proudie be only among specially intimate friend mr harold smith few dozen others that indulged in little joke there have be nothing in least pretentious about card with summoned friend to house on occasion have merely signified in ordinary way that must be glad to see a soon after nine o'clock on thursday evening instant a might be convenient world understood that world be to be gathered together at miss dunstable house on night in question that effort be to be made to bring together people of class god giant saint sinner rabid through strength of morality such a dear friend lady lufton who be rabid in opposite direction such a lady hartletop duke of omnium mr sowerby orthodox martyr have be caught from east oily latter day st paul from other side of water to horror amazement of archdeacon grantly who have come up way from plumstead to be present on occasion mr grantly also have hankered to be there when heard of presence of latter day st paul triumphed loudly over husband who have made offer to take lord brock de terrier be to be at gathering be nothing pleasant king of god courtly chief of giant must shake hand with other in house with greatest pleasure men be to meet who in reference to other must shake nothing head fist supplehouse be to be there harold smith who now hated enemy with hatred surpassing that of woman even of politician minor god be thought must congregate together in one room very bitter in present state of banishment minor giant in terribly loud in triumph be fault of giant who otherwise be not bad fellow be unable to endure weight of temporary success when attempting olympus work of attempting be doubtless natural condition scratch scramble diligently using toe finger with mixture of good humoured virulence satisfied industry be gratifying to party whenever effort be unexpectedly for unfortunately successful be so taken aback that lose power of behaving with even gigantesque propriety such so great so various be to be intended gathering at miss dunstable house laughed quizzed speaking of affair to mr harold smith a though be excellent joke to mr proudie a though be simply emulous of rivalling world famous assembly in gloucester place town at large knew that effort be being made be supposed that even miss dunstable be somewhat nervous in spite of excellent joking be presumed that must be unhappy if failed to mr frank gresham did speak with little seriousness why on earth must give trouble lady have said when miss dunstable owned that be doubtful unhappy in doubt a to coming of one of great colleague of mr supplehouse when such hundred be coming big wig little wig of shade what can matter whether mr tower be there not miss dunstable have answered almost with screech dear will be nothing without understand fact be that tom tower be everybody everything at present then by mean for first time mr gresham began to lecture friend a to vanity in answer to lecture miss dunstable mysteriously hinted that if be only allowed full swing on occasion if world must now indulge must did not quite say what must do inference drawn by mr gresham be that if incense now offered on altar of fashion be accepted miss dunstable must at once abandon pomp vanity of wicked world sinful lust of flesh doctor will stay dear hope may look on a fixed miss dunstable in making demand on doctor time showed energy quite equal to with invoked god tom tower might not be absent now to tell truth dr thorne have at first thought very unreasonable that must be asked to remain up in london in order that might be present at evening party have for while pertinaciously refused when learned that three four prime minister be expected that be possible that even tom tower might be there in flesh philosophy also have become weak have written to lady arabella to say that prolonged absence for two day further must be endured that mild tonic morning evening might be continued why must miss dunstable be so anxious that dr thorne must be present on grand occasion why indeed must be so frequently inclined to summon away from country practice compounding board useful ministration to rural ailment doctor be connected with by tie of blood friendship intimate a be have a yet be of short date be very rich woman capable of purchasing manner of advice good counsel whereas be so far from being rich that continued disturbance to practice might be inconvenient to nevertheless miss dunstable seemed to have more compunction in making call upon time than might have felt have be brother idea on matter suggested to doctor be simple minded man taking thing a came especially so taking thing came pleasantly liked miss dunstable be gratified by friendship did not think of asking whether have right to put to trouble inconvenience such idea did occur to mr gresham doctor niece have miss dunstable object if so what object be simply veneration for doctor be caprice be eccentricity must possibly be love in speaking of age of two friend may be said in round term that lady be well past forty that gentleman be well past fifty under such circumstance must be love lady too be one who have have offer almost by dozen offer from men of rank from men of fashion from men of power from men endowed with personal attraction with pleasant manner with cultivated taste with eloquent tongue not only have loved none such by none such have be cajoled into idea that be possible that must love that dr thorne taste be cultivated manner pleasant might probably be admitted by three four old friend in country who valued world in london world to miss dunstable be accustomed be apparently becoming dearer to day by day must not have regarded doctor a man likely to become object of lady passion nevertheless idea did occur to mr gresham have be brought up at elbow of country practitioner have lived with a though have be daughter have be for year ministering angel of household till heart have opened to natural love of womanhood closest sympathy have be with in eye doctor be perfect did not seem to to be out of question that miss dunstable must have fallen in love with uncle miss dunstable once said to mr harold smith that be possible that might marry only condition then expressed being that man elected must be one who be quite indifferent a to money mr harold smith who by friend be presumed to know world with tolerable accuracy have replied that man miss dunstable must never find in world have passed in half comic vein of banter miss dunstable so commonly used when conversing with such friend a mr harold smith have spoken word of same import more than once to mr gresham mr gresham putting two two together a woman do have made four of little sum a final result of calculation determined that miss dunstable must marry dr thorne if dr thorne must ask then mr gresham began to bethink of two other question must be well that uncle must marry miss dunstable if so must be possible to induce to make such proposition after consideration of many pro con balancing of very various argument mr gresham thought that arrangement on whole might not be bad one for miss dunstable have sincere affection be shared by husband have often grieved at sacrifice miss dunstable made to world thinking that friend be falling into vanity indifference ill mode of life marriage a must probably cure then a to dr thorne to whose benefit be of course applied mr gresham most earnest thought in matter must not think that must be happier married than be single in point of temper woman must stand higher than miss dunstable one have ever heard of being in ill humour then though mr gresham be gifted with mind be far removed from being mercenary be impossible not to feel that benefit must accrue from bride wealth mary thorne present mr frank gresham have be great heiress circumstance have weighted hand with enormous possession hitherto have not realized truth of lesson must teach to believe that happiness rich be incompatible therefore resolved that might be well if doctor miss dunstable be brought together must doctor be induced to make such offer mr gresham acknowledged terrible difficulty in looking at matter from point of view uncle be fond of miss dunstable be sure that idea of such marriage have never entered head that must be very difficult almost impossible to create such idea that if idea be there doctor must hardly be instigated to make proposition looking at matter a whole feared that match be not practicable on day of miss dunstable party mr gresham uncle dined together alone in portman square mr gresham be not yet in parliament almost immediate vacancy be expected in division of county be known that one must stand against with chance of success threw much among politician of party giant namely whom must be business to support on account be good deal away from own house at present moment politics make terrible demand on man time said to wife then went down to dine at club in pall mall with sundry other young philogeants on men of class politics do make great demand at hour of dinner thereabouts what do think of miss dunstable said mr gresham to uncle a sat together over coffee added nothing to question asked in baldness think about said doctor well mary what do think about dare say think same be not question what do think about do think be honest honest oh yes certainly very honest must say good tempered uncommonly good tempered affectionate well yes affectionate must certainly say that be affectionate be sure be clever yes think be clever womanly in feeling mr gresham felt that must not quite say lady like though must fain have done so have dared certainly said doctor mary why be dissecting miss dunstable character with so much ingenuity well uncle will tell why because mr gresham while be speaking got up from chair going round table to uncle side put arm round neck till face be close to then continued speaking a stood behind out of sight because think that miss dunstable be be very fond of that must make happy if must ask to be wife mary said doctor turning round with endeavour to look niece in face be quite in earnest uncle quite in earnest from little thing that have said little thing have seen do believe what now tell want to dear uncle own one darling uncle want only to do will make make happy what be miss dunstable to compared to then stooped down kissed doctor be apparently too much astounded by intimation given to make further immediate reply niece seeing left that might go dress when met again in drawing room frank gresham be with chapter xxix miss dunstable at home miss dunstable did not look like love lorn maiden a stood in small ante chamber at top of drawing room stair receiving guest house be one of abnormal mansion be to be seen here there in london built in compliance rather with rule of rural architecture than with usually govern erection of city street town terrace stood back from brother alone so that owner must walk round be approached by short carriageway chief door be in back of building front of house looked on to one of park miss dunstable in procuring have have usual luck have be built by eccentric millionnaire at enormous cost eccentric millionnaire after living in for twelve month have declared that did not posse single comfort that be deficient in most of detail in point of house accommodation be necessary to very existence of man consequently mansion be sold miss dunstable be purchaser cranbourn house have be named present owner have made change in respect world at large very generally called ointment hall miss dunstable a frequently used that name for a other be impossible to quiz miss dunstable with success because always joined in joke not word further have passed between mr gresham dr thorne on subject of last conversation doctor a entered lady portal amongst tribe of servant in glare of light saw crowd before crowd behind felt that be quite impossible that must ever be at home there might be right that miss dunstable must live in way must not be right that wife of dr thorne must so live be matter of merest speculation for be well aware a said to dozen time that niece have blundered strangely in reading of miss dunstable character when gresham party entered ante room into staircase opened found miss dunstable standing there surrounded by few of most intimate ally mr harold smith be sitting quite close to dr easyman be reclining on sofa against wall lady who habitually lived with miss dunstable be by side one two others be there also so that little running conversation be kept up in order to relieve miss dunstable of tedium might otherwise be engendered by work have in hand a mr gresham leaning on husband arm entered room saw back of mr proudie a lady made way through opposite door leaning on arm of bishop mr harold smith have apparently recovered from annoyance must no doubt have felt when miss dunstable so utterly rejected suit on behalf of brother if feeling have existed even for day calculated to put stop to intimacy between two lady that feeling have altogether died away for mr harold smith be conversing with friend quite in old way made remark on of guest a passed by apparently did so in manner satisfactory to owner of house for miss dunstable answered with kindest smile in genial happy tone of voice gave peculiar character to good humour be quite convinced that be mere plagiarist in what be doing said mr harold smith speaking of mr proudie so be suppose there can be anything very original now day about evening party think be copying why not copy everybody see more le did not at first begin to wear big petticoat out of own head if mr proudie have such pride a pray rob of here be doctor gresham mary darling how be in spite of grandeur of apparel miss dunstable took hold of mr gresham kissed to disgust of dozen half of distinguished fashionable world who be passing up stair behind doctor be somewhat repressed in mode of address by communication have so lately be made to miss dunstable be now standing on very top of pinnacle of wealth seemed to to be not only so much above reach also so far removed from track in life that must not in way put on level with must neither aspire so high descend so low thinking of spoke to miss dunstable a though there be great distance between a though there have be hour of intimate friendship down at greshamsbury there have be such hour during miss dunstable dr thorne have lived a though belonged to same world at rate may be said of miss dunstable that have idea of forgetting dr thorne merely gave hand then prepared to pas on go doctor said for heaven sake go yet know when may catch if get in there sha be able to follow for next two hour lady meredith be so much obliged to for coming mother will be here hope oh be so glad from know be quite favour sir george be sinner so think so much about oh quite so said sir george perhaps rather largest men divide world into god giant said miss dunstable woman have division also be saint sinner according to party worst of be that rat almost a often a do whereupon sir george laughed passed on know doctor like kind of thing continued there be reason why must indulge altogether in own way more than be there frank be not so sure doe like said mr gresham there be of reputed friend whom owns that be anxious to see be there then there be hope of ratting too will never make good staunch sinner will mary be too old to learn new trick eh doctor be afraid be said doctor with faint laugh doe dr thorne rank among army of saint asked mr harold smith decidedly said miss dunstable must always remember that there be saint of different order be there not mary nobody supposes that franciscan dominican agree very well together dr thorne doe not belong to school of st proudie of barchester must prefer priestess whom see coming round corner of staircase with very famous young novice at elbow from can hear will have to reckon miss grantly among sinner said mr harold smith seeing that lady lufton with young friend be approaching unless indeed can make saint of lady hartletop then lady lufton entered room miss dunstable came forward to meet with more quiet respect in manner than have a yet shown to many of guest be much obliged to for coming lady lufton said more so for bringing miss grantly with lady lufton uttered pretty little speech during dr thorne came up shook hand with a did also frank gresham wife there be county acquaintance between framley people greshamsbury people therefore there be little general conversation before lady lufton passed out of small room into what mr proudie must have called noble suite of apartment papa will be here said miss grantly at least so understand have not seen yet oh yes have promised said miss dunstable archdeacon know will keep word must by mean have proper ecclesiastical balance without papa always doe keep word said miss grantly in tone be almost severe have not at understood poor miss dunstable little joke at rate be too dignified to respond to understand that old sir john be to accept chiltern hundred at once said lady lufton in half whisper to frank gresham lady lufton have always taken keen interest in politics of east barsetshire be now desirous of expressing satisfaction that gresham must again sit for county gresham have be old county member in barsetshire time out of mind oh yes believe so said frank blushing be still young enough to feel almost ashamed of putting forward for such high honour there will be contest of course said lady lufton confidentially there seldom be in east barsetshire be happy to say if there be tenant at framley must vote on right side can assure of lord lufton be saying so to only morning frank gresham made pretty little speech in reply such a young sucking politician be expected to make with sundry other small courteous murmuring detained lufton party for minute two in ante chamber in meantime world be pressing on passing through to four five large reception room noble suite be already piercing poor mr proudie heart with envy to very core be sort of room said to herself unconsciously ought to be provided by country for use of bishop people be not brought enough together said to lord think be said bishop be so essential for conversazione continued mr proudie now in gloucester place will not record adverse criticism a lady lufton be waiting for in ante room now arrival of moment have taken place arrival indeed of very great moment to tell truth miss dunstable heart have be set upon having two special person though stone have be left unturned stone must be turned with discretion be still left in doubt a to two wondrous potentate at very moment of be now speaking light airy a appeared to be for be character to be light airy mind be torn with doubt if wished for two must come evening must be thoroughly successful if not trouble must have be thrown away thing must have be failure there be circumstance connected with present assembly made miss dunstable very anxious that must not fail that two great one of earth be tom tower of jupiter duke of omnium need hardly be expressed in word now at very moment a lady lufton be making civil speech to young gresham apparently in hurry to move on while miss dunstable be endeavouring to whisper something into doctor ear must make feel at home in new world sound be heard made that lady know that wish have at rate be granted to sound be heard only by own one other attentive pair of ear mr harold smith have also caught name knew that duke be approaching there be great glory triumph in why have grace come at so unchancy moment miss dunstable have be fully aware of impropriety of bringing lady lufton duke of omnium into same house at same time when have asked lady lufton have be led to believe that there be hope of obtaining duke then when hope have dawned upon have comforted with reflection that two sun though might for few minute be in same hemisphere must hardly be expected to clash come across other orbit room be large must be crowded duke must probably do little more than walk through once lady lufton must certainly be surrounded by person of own class thus miss dunstable have comforted now thing be going wrong lady lufton must find in close contiguity to nearest representative of satanic agency according to idea be allowed to walk nether english world of ours must scream indignantly retreat out of house must proudly raise head with outstretched hand audible voice boldly defy devil work in thinking of thing a duke approached miss dunstable almost lost presence of mind mr harold smith did not lose hers so here at last be duke said in tone intended to catch express attention of lady lufton mr smith have calculated that there might still be time for ladyship to pas on avoid interview lady lufton if heard word did not completely understand at rate did not convey to mind at moment meaning be intended to convey paused to whisper last little speech to frank gresham then looking round found that gentleman who be pressing against dress be duke of omnium on great occasion when misfortune must no longer be avoided miss dunstable be by mean beneath character deplored calamity now saw that be only left to to make best of duke have honoured by coming to house be bound to welcome though in doing so must bring lady lufton to last gasp duke said be greatly honoured by kindness on part of grace hardly expected that must be so good to goodness be on other side said duke bowing over hand then in usual course of thing must have be duke must have walked on shown must have said word two to lady hartletop to bishop to mr gresham such like must then have left room by way quietly escaped be duty expected from must have done value of party must have be increased thirty per cent by such doing now a be news monger of west end be likely to get much more out of circumstance have so turned out that have absolutely be pressed close against lady lufton when heard voice be made positively acquainted with fact of great man presence by miss dunstable word turned round quickly still with much feminine dignity removing dress from contact in doing be brought absolutely face to face with duke so that must not look full at other beg pardon said duke be only word have ever passed between have spoken to other since simple a be accompanied by little by play of speaker gave rise to considerable amount of ferment in fashionable world lady lufton a retreated back on to dr easyman curtseyed low curtseyed low slowly with haughty arrangement of drapery be own curtsey though be eloquent did not say half so much did not reprobate habitual iniquity of duke with voice nearly a potent a be expressed in gradual fall of eye gradual pressure of lip when commenced curtsey be looking full in foe face by time that have completed eye be turned upon ground there be ineffable amount of scorn expressed in line of mouth spoke word retreated a modest virtue feminine weakness must ever retreat before barefaced vice virile power nevertheless be held by world to have have best of encounter duke a begged pardon wore in countenance expression of modified sorrow be common to gentleman who be supposed by to have incommoded lady over above rather under there be slight smile of derision a though be impossible for to look upon bearing of lady lufton without amount of ridicule be legible to eye so keen a of miss dunstable mr harold smith duke be known to be master of silent inward sarcasm even by by miss dunstable mr harold smith be admitted that lady lufton have conquered when ladyship again looked up duke have passed on then resumed care of miss grantly hand followed in among company illustration lady lufton duke of omnium be what call unfortunate said miss dunstable a soon a belligerent have departed from field of battle fate sometimes will be against one have not be at against here said mr harold smith if must arrive at ladyship private thought to morrow morning must find to be quite happy in having met duke will be year before have done boasting of triumph will be talked of by young lady of framley for next three generation gresham party including dr thorne have remained in ante chamber during battle whole combat did not occupy above two minute three of be hemmed off from escape by lady lufton retreat into dr easyman lap now too essayed to pas on what will desert said miss dunstable very well will find out by by frank there be to be dancing in one of room just to distinguish affair from mr proudie conversazione must be stupid know if conversaziones be alike must so hope will go dance there will presume be variation at feeding time said mr harold smith oh yes certainly be most vulgar of wretch in respect do love to set people eating drinking mr supplehouse be delighted to see do tell then whispered with great energy into ear of mr supplehouse mr supplehouse again whispered into ear think will then said miss dunstable mr supplehouse assented did think so have warrant for stating circumstance a fact then passed on hardly looking at mr harold smith a passed what hang dog countenance have said that lady ah be prejudiced dear wonder a for always liked supplehouse mean mischief then mischief be trade doe not conceal if be politician must a soon think of being angry with mr supplehouse for turning against a be now with pin for pricking be own awkwardness ought to have known how to use pin more craftily must detest man who professes to stand by party then doe best to ruin so many have done that dear with much more success than mr supplehouse be fair in love war why not add politics to list if must only agree to do that must save from deal of heartburning must make none of bit worse miss dunstable room large a be noble suite of room certainly though perhaps little too too too scattered will say eh bishop be now nearly full must have be inconveniently crowded be not that many who came only remained for hour so space however have be kept for dancer much to mr proudie consternation not that disapproved of dancing in london a rule be indignant that law of conversazione a re established by in fashionable world must be so violently infringed conversaziones will come to mean nothing said to bishop putting great stress on latter word nothing at if be to be treated in way wo nothing in least said bishop dancing may be very well in place said mr proudie have never objected to be for laity said bishop when people profess to assemble for higher object said mr proudie ought to act up to profession otherwise be better than hypocrite said bishop spade must be called spade said mr proudie decidedly said bishop assenting when undertook trouble expense of introducing conversaziones continued mr proudie with evident feeling that have be ill used have idea of seeing word so so so misinterpreted then observing certain desirable acquaintance at other side of room went across leaving bishop to fend for lady lufton having achieved success passed on to dancing whither be not probable that enemy must follow have not be there very long before be joined by son heart at present moment be not quite satisfied at state of affair with reference to griselda have gone so far a to tell young friend be own wish have declared desire that griselda must become daughter in law in answer to griselda have declared nothing be to be sure more than natural that young lady so well brought up a miss grantly must show sign of passion till be warranted in showing by proceeding of gentleman notwithstanding fully aware a be of propriety of such reticence lady lufton did think that to griselda might have spoken word evincing that alliance must be satisfactory to griselda however have spoken no such word have uttered syllable to show that must accept lord lufton if did offer then again have uttered no syllable to show that must not accept nevertheless although knew that world have be talking about lord dumbello stood up to dance with future marquess on possible occasion did give annoyance to lady lufton who began to bethink that if must not quickly bring little plan to favourable issue might be well for to wash hand of be still anxious for match on son account griselda must did not doubt make good wife lady lufton be not so sure a once have be that must be able to keep up so strong feeling for daughter in law a have hitherto hoped to do ludovic have be here long said smiling a always did smile when eye fell upon son face instant arrived hurried on after a miss dunstable told that be here what crowd have did see lord brock did not observe lord de terrier saw in centre room lord de terrier did honour of shaking hand with a passed through never saw such mixture of people there be mr proudie going out of mind because be going to dance miss proudies dance said griselda grantly not at conversaziones see difference saw spermoil there looking a pleased a punch have quite circle of own round be chattering away a though be quite accustomed to wickedness of world there certainly be people here whom one must not have wished to meet have one thought of said lady lufton mindful of late engagement must be right for walked up stair with archdeacon be absolute proof be not miss grantly have fear when be with mother know must be safe be not so sure of said lord lufton laughing mother hardly know worst of yet who be here do think know whom mean have seen said lady lufton very quietly came across just at top of stair said griselda with more animation in face than ever lord lufton have seen there before what duke yes duke said lady lufton certainly must not have come have expected to be brought in contact with man be accident on such occasion a must not be helped lord lufton at once perceived by tone of mother voice by shade of countenance that have absolutely endured personal encounter with duke also that be by mean so indignant at occurrence a might have be expected there be still in miss dunstable house expressing no anger a to miss dunstable conduct lord lufton must hardly have be more surprised have seen duke handing mother down to supper said however nothing further on subject be going to dance ludovic said lady lufton well be not sure that agree with mr proudie in thinking that dancing must contaminate conversazione be idea miss grantly griselda be never very good at joke imagined that lord lufton wanted to escape trouble of dancing with angered for only specie of love making flirtation sociability between a young lady other self a young gentleman recommended to taste be to be found in amusement of dancing be altogether at variance with mr proudie on matter gave miss dunstable great credit for innovation in society griselda toe be more serviceable to than tongue be to be won by rapid twirl much more probably than by soft word offer of must approve must be conveyed by two breathless word during spasmodic pause in waltz then a lifted up arm to receive accustomed support at back might just find power enough to say must ask papa after must not care to have affair mentioned till everything be properly settled have not thought about said griselda turning face away from lord lufton must not however be supposed that miss grantly have not thought about lord lufton that have not considered how great might be advantage of having lady lufton on side if made up mind that did wish to become lord lufton wife knew well that now be time for triumph now in very first season of acknowledged beauty knew also that young good looking bachelor lord grow on hedge like blackberry have lord lufton offered to must have accepted at once without remorse a to greater glory might appertain to future marchioness of hartletop in direction be not without sufficient wisdom then lord lufton have not offered to given sign that intended to do so to give griselda grantly due be not girl to make first overture have lord dumbello offered have given sign dumb sign such a bird give to other quite a intelligible a verbal sign to girl who preferred use of toe to of tongue have not thought about said griselda very coldly at moment gentleman stood before asked hand for next dance be lord dumbello griselda making reply except by slight bow got up put hand within partner arm will find here lady lufton when have done said then started off among dancer when work before one be dancing proper thing for gentleman to do be at rate to ask lady proper thing lord lufton have omitted now prize be taken away from under very nose there be clearly air of triumph about lord dumbello a walked away with beauty world have be saying that lord lufton be to marry world have also be saying that lord dumbello admired now have angered lord dumbello made feel a though walked about mark of scorn a disappointed suitor have not be for lord lufton perhaps must not have cared so much for griselda grantly circumstance have so turned out that did care for felt to be incumbent upon a heir to marquisate to obtain what wanted let who must have hankering after same article be in way that picture be so well sold at auction lord dumbello regarded miss grantly a being now subject to auctioneer hammer conceived that lord lufton be bidding against there be therefore air of triumph about a put arm round griselda waist whirled up down room in obedience to music lady lufton son be left together looking at other of course have intended to ask griselda to dance can not be said that very much regretted disappointment of course also lady lufton have expected that son griselda must stand up together be little inclined to be angry with protegee think might have waited minute said lady lufton why mother there be certain thing for one ever wait to give friend for instance first passage through gate out hunting such like miss grantly be quite right to take first offered lady lufton have determined to learn what be to be end of scheme of hers must not have griselda always with if anything be to be arranged must be arranged now while of be in london at close of season griselda must return to plumstead lord lufton must go nobody a yet knew where must be useless to look forward to further opportunity if did not contrive to love other now must never do so lady lufton be beginning to fear that plan must not work made up mind that must learn truth then there at least a far a son be concerned oh yes quite so if be equal to with dance said lady lufton quite equal must think unless be that dumbello be longer winded than be be sorry to hear speak of in way ludovic why sorry mother because have hoped that must have liked other said in serious tone of voice tender sad looking up into face with plaintive gaze a though knew that be asking of great favour yes mother have known that have wished that have known ludovic oh dear yes be not at sharp at keeping secret from at one time for day so thought must oblige have be so good to must almost do anything for oh said deprecating praise sacrifice seemed to offer of own hope aspiration must not for world have do so for sake mother ever have better son only ambition be for happiness mother must not make happy be mad enough for moment to think that must do so for moment did think so there be one occasion on must have asked to take what ludovic never mind passed away

smith to take place that lady stuck to through labour with admirable constancy made work bearable without such constancy on friend part must have be unbearable must be acknowledged that be much to credit of mr harold smith own hope with reference to great heiress have be shattered answer have be given to in very plain language nevertheless be true to friendship be almost a willing to endure fatigue on occasion a though have sister in law right in house at about one o'clock brother came have not yet seen miss dunstable since offer have be made have now with difficulty be persuaded by sister to show what can be use said game be up with now meaning poor ruined ne'er do well not only that game with miss dunstable be up that great game of whole life be being brought to uncomfortable termination nonsense said sister do mean to despair because man like duke of omnium want money what have be good security for will be good security for then mr harold smith made more agreeable than ever to miss dunstable when miss dunstable be nearly worn out be still endeavouring to buoy up by hope of still expected great arrival for knew that hero must show only at very late hour if be to be good fortune that showed at mr sowerby walked up stair have schooled to go through ordeal with cool effrontery be at command be clearly to be seen that effrontery did not stand in sufficient stead that interview must have be embarrassing have not be for genuine good humour of lady here be brother said mr harold smith showing by tremulousness of whisper that looked forward to meeting with amount of apprehension how do do mr sowerby said miss dunstable walking almost into doorway to welcome better late than never have only just got away from house said a gave hand oh know well that be sans reproche among senator a mr harold smith be sans peur eh dear must confess that have contrived to be uncommonly severe upon said mr harold laughing a regard poor harold most undeservedly so nathaniel

representative man of age angel minister of grace assist said miss dunstable how on earth be to behave mr sowerby do think that ought to kneel down dear will have reporter at back in royal livery then miss dunstable advanced two three step not into doorway a have done for mr sowerby put out hand smiled sweetest on mr tower of jupiter mr tower said be delighted to have opportunity of seeing in own house miss dunstable be immensely honoured by privilege of being here said honour done be conferred on bowed curtseyed with very stately grace thoroughly understood badinage of other then in few moment be engaged in very easy conversation by by sowerby what do think of threatened dissolution said tom tower be in hand of providence said mr sowerby striving to take matter without outward show of emotion question be one of terrible import to up to time have heard of such threat have mr harold smith miss dunstable have hundred others who now either listened to vaticination of mr tower to immediate report made of be given to men to originate such tidings performance of prophecy be often brought about by authority of prophet on following morning rumour that there must be dissolution be current in high circle have conscience in such matter conscience said small god speaking of giant small god whose constituency be expensive mr tower stood there chatting for about twenty minute then took departure without making way into room have answered purpose for have be invited left miss dunstable in happy frame of mind be very glad that came said mr harold smith with air of triumph yes be glad said miss dunstable though be thoroughly ashamed must be so after what good have done to to one having uttered moral reflection made way into room soon discovered dr thorne standing by against wall well doctor said where be mary frank look at comfortable standing here by be quite a comfortable a expected thank said be in room somewhere a believe equally happy that be spiteful in doctor to speak in way what must say if be called on to endure have gone through evening there be accounting for taste presume like be not so sure of give arm let get supper one always like idea of having done hard work one always like to have be successful know that virtue be own reward said doctor well be something hard upon said miss dunstable a sat down to table really think that good of sort can come from giving such party a oh yes people doubt have be amused be vanity in estimation said miss dunstable vanity vexation of spirit well there be good deal of latter certainly sherry if please must give anything for glass of beer be out of question vanity vexation of spirit yet meant to do good pray suppose that be condemning miss dunstable ah do suppose not only also whose judgment care for perhaps more than yours let tell be saying great deal do condemn dr thorne also condemn be not have done wrong game be not worth candle ah be question game be not worth candle yet be triumph to have duke tom tower must confess have not managed badly soon after that gresham went away in hour time so miss dunstable be allowed to drag to own bed be great question to be asked on such occasion be game worth candle chapter xxx grantly triumph have be mentioned cursorily reader doubt will have forgotten that mr grantly be not specially invited by husband to go up to town with view of being present at miss dunstable party mr grantly said nothing on subject be somewhat chagrined not on account of loss sustained with reference to celebrated assembly because felt that daughter affair required supervision of mother eye also doubted final ratification of lufton grantly treaty doubting did not feel quite satisfied that daughter must be left in lady lufton hand have said word two to archdeacon before went up only word two for hesitated to trust in so delicate matter be therefore not little surprised at receiving on second morning after husband departure letter from desiring immediate presence in london be surprised heart be filled rather with hope than dismay for have full confidence in daughter discretion on morning after party lady lufton griselda have breakfasted together a usual felt that manner of other be altered lady lufton thought that young friend be somewhat le attentive perhaps le meek in demeanour than usual griselda felt that lady lufton be le affectionate very little however be said between lady lufton expressed surprise when griselda begged to be left alone at home instead of accompanying ladyship when carriage came to door nobody called in bruton street afternoon one at least be let in except archdeacon came there late in day remained with daughter till lady lufton returned then took leave with more abruptness than be usual with without saying anything special to account for duration of visit did griselda say anything special so evening wore away feeling in unconscious manner that be on le intimate term with other than have previously be case on next day also griselda must not go out at four o'clock servant brought letter to from mount street mother have arrived in london wished to see at once mr grantly sent love to lady lufton must call at half past five at later hour at might be convenient for lady lufton to see griselda be to stay dine in mount street so said letter lady lufton declared that must be very happy to see mr grantly at hour named then armed with message griselda started for mother lodging will send carriage for said lady lufton suppose about ten will do thank said griselda will do very nicely then went exactly at half past five mr grantly be shown into lady lufton drawing room daughter did not come with lady lufton must see by expression of friend face that business be to be discussed indeed be necessary that must discus business for mr grantly must now be told that family treaty must not be ratified gentleman declined alliance poor lady lufton be uneasy in mind at nature of task before coming up have be rather unexpected said lady lufton a soon a friend be seated on sofa yes indeed got letter from archdeacon only morning made absolutely necessary must come bad news hope said lady lufton ca call bad news dear lady lufton thing wo always turn out exactly a one must have indeed said ladyship remembering that be incumbent on to explain to mr grantly now at present interview tidings with mind be fraught must however let grantly first tell own story feeling perhaps that one might possibly bear upon other poor dear griselda said mr grantly almost with sigh need not tell lady lufton what hope be regarding have told anything anything that must have spoken to at once be due to that must have done so be timid not unnaturally so then be right that must see father before quite made up own mind may say that be settled now what be settled asked lady lufton of course be impossible for one to tell beforehand how thing will turn out continued mr grantly beating about bush rather more than be necessary dearest wish of heart be to see married to lord lufton must so much have wished to have in same county with match a must have fully satisfied ambition well must rather think might lady lufton did not say out loud thought mr grantly be absolutely speaking of match between daughter lord lufton a though must have displayed amount of christian moderation in putting up with griselda grantly might be very nice girl even so thought lady lufton at moment might possibly be priced too highly dear mr grantly said have foreseen for last few day that mutual hope in respect must not be gratified lord lufton think perhaps be not necessary to explain have not come up to town must have written to probably to day may be dear griselda fate in life sincerely hope that may be happy think will said mr grantly in tone expressed much satisfaction have have anything lord dumbello proposed to griselda other night at miss dunstable party said mr grantly with eye fixed upon floor assuming on sudden much meekness in manner lordship be with archdeacon yesterday again morning fancy be in mount street at present moment oh indeed said lady lufton must have given world to have possessed at moment sufficient self command to have enabled to express in tone manner unqualified satisfaction at tidings have not such self command be painfully aware of own deficiency yes said mr grantly a be so far settled a know be so kindly anxious about dear griselda thought right to let know at once nothing can be more upright honourable generous than lord dumbello conduct on whole match be one with archdeacon can not be contented be certainly great match said lady lufton have seen lady hartletop yet now lady hartletop must not be regarded a agreeable connection be only word escaped from lady lufton must be considered in way disparaging on whole think that behaved well lord dumbello be so completely own master that have not be necessary said mr grantly marquis have be told archdeacon will see to morrow day after there be nothing left for lady lufton to congratulate friend did in word perhaps not very sincere on whole be not badly chosen be sure hope will be very happy said lady lufton trust that alliance word be very agreeable to mr grantly ear will give unalloyed gratification to to father position be called to fill be very splendid one think that be above merit be very generous so mr grantly felt have expected that news must be received with coldest shade of civility be quite prepared to do battle if there be occasion have wish for war be almost grateful to lady lufton for cordiality dear lady lufton said be so kind of to say so have told one else of course must tell one till knew one have known understood so well a have done can assure of that there be one to whose friendship look forward in new sphere of life with so much pleasure a doe to yours lady lufton did not say much further must not declare that expected much gratification from intimacy with future marchioness of hartletop hartletops luftons must at rate for generation live in world apart have now said that old friendship with mr grantly required mr grantly understood quite a well a did lady lufton then mr grantly be much better woman of world be arranged that griselda must come back to bruton street for night that visit must then be brought to close archdeacon think that for present have better remain up in town said mr grantly under very peculiar circumstance griselda will be perhaps more comfortable with to lady lufton entirely agreed so parted excellent friend embracing other in most affectionate manner that evening griselda did return to bruton street lady lufton have to go through further task of congratulating be more disagreeable of two especially so a have to be thought over beforehand young lady excellent good sense sterling quality made task comparatively easy one cried be impassioned went into hysteric showed emotion did not even talk of noble dumbello generous dumbello took lady lufton kiss almost in silence thanked gently for kindness made allusion to own future grandeur think must like to go to bed early said a must see to packing up richards will do that for dear oh yes thank nothing can be kinder than richards will just see to own dress so went to bed early lady lufton did not see son for next two day when did of course said word two about griselda have heard news ludovic asked oh yes be at club have be overwhelmed with present of willow branch at rate have got nothing to regret said either mother be sure that think have say that regret dearest mother say so for sake do not know in heart of heart that be not suited to be happy a wife to make happy perhaps not said lady lufton sighing then kissed son declared to herself that girl in england must be good enough for chapter xxxi salmon fishing in norway lord dumbello engagement with griselda grantly be talk of town for next ten day formed at least one of two subject monopolized attention other being dreadful rumour first put in motion by tom tower at miss dunstable party a to threatened dissolution of parliament perhaps after will be best thing for said mr green walker who felt to be tolerably safe at crewe junction regard a most wicked attempt said harold smith who be not equally secure in own borough to whom expense of election be disagreeable be done in order that may get time to tide over autumn wo gain ten vote by dissolution le than forty must hardly give majority have sense of public duty none indeed know who have by jove be just be what aunt lady hartletop say there be sense of duty left in world by by what uncommon fool dumbello be making then conversation went off to other topic lord lufton joke against about willow branch be very well nobody dreamed that heart be sore in matter world be laughing at lord dumbello for what chose to call foolish match lord lufton friend talked to about a though have never suspected that must have made as of in same direction nevertheless be not altogether contented by mean wished to marry griselda have declared to dozen time since have first suspected mother manoeuvre that consideration on earth must induce to do so have pronounced to be cold insipid unattractive in spite of beauty yet felt almost angry that lord dumbello must have be successful too be more inexcusable seeing that have never forgotten lucy robarts have never ceased to love that in holding various conversation within own bosom be a loud in lucy favour a be in dispraise of griselda hero then hear well balanced critic say be not worth very much in first place lord lufton be not hero in next place man may be very imperfect yet worth great deal man may be a imperfect a lord lufton yet worthy of good mother good wife if not how many of be unworthy of mother wife have be belief that few young men settle down to work of world to begetting of child carving paying struggling fretting for same without having first be in love with four five possible mother for probably with two three at same time yet men be a rule worthy of excellent wife ultimately fall to lot in way lord lufton have to certain extent be in love with griselda there have be one moment in life in must have offered hand have not discretion be so excellent though moment never returned still suffered from feeling akin to disappointment when learned that griselda have be won be to be worn be then dog in manger will say well be not dog in manger more le actively be not that manger doggishness one of most common phase of human heart not le be lord lufton truly in love with lucy robarts have fancied that dumbello be carrying on siege before fortress vexation must have manifested in very different manner must joke about griselda grantly with frank face happy tone of voice have heard of tidings of similar import with reference to lucy must have be past joking much doubt whether must not even have affected appetite mother said to lady lufton day two after declaration of griselda engagement be going to norway to fish to norway to fish yes have got rather nice party clontarf be going culpepper what that horrid man be excellent hand at fishing haddington peebles there will be six of altogether start day week be rather sudden ludovic yes be sudden be sick of london must not care to go so soon clontarf culpepper say that season be early year must go down to framley before start about horse therefore came to tell that will be there to morrow at framley to morrow if must put off for three day must be going lord lufton must not put off for three day may be on occasion did not wish for mother presence at framley while be there that conceived that must be more at ease in giving order about stable if be alone while so employed at rate declined company on following morning did go down to framley by mark said mr robarts hurrying into husband book room about middle of day lord lufton be at home have heard what here at framley be over at framley court so servant say carson saw in paddock with of horse wo go see of course will said mark shutting up paper lady lufton ca be here if be alone will probably come dine know about said mr robarts thinking of poor lucy be not in least particular what doe for will do for will ask at rate without further parley clergyman took up hat went off in search of friend lucy robarts have be present when gardener brought in tidings of lord lufton arrival at framley be aware that fanny have gone to tell husband wo come here will said a soon a mr robarts returned ca say said fanny hope not ought not to do so think will mark say that will ask to dinner then fanny must be taken ill there be nothing else for think will come think can be so cruel indeed feel sure that wo thought right to tell lucy also conceived that be improbable that lord lufton must come to parsonage under present circumstance declared to herself that must not be possible that must appear at table if did do so nevertheless idea of being at framley be perhaps not altogether painful to did not recognize pleasure a coming to from arrival still there be something in presence be unconsciously to herself soothing to feeling terrible question remained how be to act if must turn out that be coming to dinner if doe come fanny said solemnly after pause must keep to own room leave mark to think what plea will be better for to make fool of there than in presence in drawing room mark robarts took hat stick went over at once to home paddock in knew that lord lufton be engaged with horse groom also be in supremely happy frame of mind for correspondence with mr tozer be on increase have received notice from indefatigable gentleman certain overdue bill be now lying at bank in barchester be very desirous of mr robarts notice concatenation of certain peculiarly unfortunate circumstance made indispensably necessary that mr tozer must be repaid without further loss of time various sum of money have advanced on credit of mr robarts name c c c absolute threat be put forth singular to say actual amount be named mr robarts however must not observe with most painfully accurate attention that mention be made not of overdue bill of overdue bill what if mr tozer be to demand from instant repayment of nine hundred pound hitherto have merely written to mr sowerby might have have answer from gentleman morning such answer have a yet reached consequently be not at present moment in very happy frame of mind soon found with lord lufton horse four five of be being walked slowly about paddock in care of a many men boy sheet be being taken off off one after so that master might look at with more accuracy satisfaction though lord lufton be thus doing duty going through work be not doing with whole heart a head groom perceived very well be fretful about nag seemed anxious to get out of sight a soon a have made decent pretext of looking at how be lufton said robarts coming forward told that be down so came across at once yes only got here morning must have be over with directly be going to norway for six week so seems that fish be so early year that must start at once have matter on want to speak to before leave indeed be that brought down more than anything else there be something hurried not altogether easy about manner a spoke struck robarts made think that promised matter to be spoken of must not be agreeable in discussion did not know whether lord lufton might not again be mixed up with tozer bill will dine with to day said if a suppose be alone yes be alone then will come well quite know think can go over to dinner look so disgusted will explain to just now what must there be in wind how be possible that tozer bill must make inexpedient for lord lufton to dine at parsonage robarts however said nothing further about at moment turned off to look at horse be uncommonly nice set of animal said well yes know when man have four five horse to look at somehow other never have one fit to go chestnut mare be picture now that nobody want be able to carry well to hound single day last winter take in pounce that will do wo lordship run eye over old black 'oss said pounce head groom in melancholy tone be a fine sir a fine a stag to tell truth think be too fine will do take in now mark if be at leisure will take turn round place mark of course be at leisure so started on walk be too difficult to please about stable robarts began never mind stable now said lord lufton truth be be not thinking about mark then said very abruptly want to be frank with have sister ever spoken to about sister lucy yes sister lucy never at least nothing especial nothing can remember at moment wife spoken about fanny of course have in ordinary way must be impossible that must not what do mean have of told that made offer to sister that made offer to lucy yes made offer to lucy nobody have told so have never dreamed of such thing a far a believe have if anybody have spread report said that of have hinted at thing be base lie good heaven lufton for what do take did said lordship did what said parson did make sister offer made lucy offer of marriage yes did in a plain language a gentleman must use to lady what answer did make refused now mark have come down here with express purpose of making offer again nothing must be more decided than sister answer struck a being almost uncourteously decided still be possible that circumstance may have weighed with ought not to weigh with if love be not given to one else may still have chance of be old story of faint heart know at rate mean to try luck again thinking over with deliberate purpose have come to conclusion ought to tell before see lord lufton in love with lucy a word repeated over over again within mark robarts mind mind added to note of surprise without end how have possibly come about why in estimation sister lucy be very simple girl not plain indeed by mean beautiful certainly not stupid by mean brilliant then must have said that of men whom knew lord lufton must have be last to fall in love with girl a sister now what be to say do what view be bound to hold in what direction must act there be lady lufton on one side to whom owed everything how must life be possible to in parsonage within few yard of elbow if consented to receive lord lufton a acknowledged suitor of sister must be great match for lucy doubtless indeed must not bring to believe that lucy must in truth become absolute reigning queen of framley court do think that fanny know anything of said after moment two can not possibly tell if doe be not with knowledge must have thought that must best answer can not answer at said mark at least have have remotest idea of such thing idea of now need not be at remote said lord lufton with faint smile may know a fact did make offer of marriage be refused be going to repeat be now taking into confidence in order that a brother a friend may give such assistance a can then walked on in silence for yard after lord lufton added now will dine with to day if wish mr robarts did not know what to say must not bethink what answer duty required of have right to interfere between sister marriage if must wish still there be something terrible in thought of have vague conception that must come to evil that project be dangerous one that must not finally result happily for of must lady lufton say that undoubtedly be chief source of dismay have spoken to mother about said mother why speak to till know fate man doe not like to speak much of such matter if there be probability of being rejected tell because like to make way into house under false pretence what must lady lufton say think probable that must be displeased on first hearing that in four twenty hour must be reconciled that after week so lucy must be dearest favourite prime minister of machination know mother a well a do must give head off shoulder to do pleasure for reason said mark robarts ought if possible to do pleasure can not absolutely marry wife of choosing if mean that said lord lufton went on walking about garden for hour hardly got farther than point to have now brought mark robarts must not make up mind on spur of moment a said more than once to lord lufton must be at sure that lucy must in way be guided by be therefore at last settled between that lord lufton must come to parsonage immediately after breakfast on following morning be agreed also that dinner have better not come off robarts promised that must if possible have determined by morning a to what advice must give sister went direct home to parsonage from

fanny knew that lord lufton must not have known in truth fanny have told whole story of lucy love have described reason have induced to reject suitor have done so in word have lord lufton heard must have made twice a passionate in love then certainly did occur to lucy to think why lord lufton must have come to framley told history to brother attempted for moment to make believe that be angry with

brother if did not still love fifty time have said to herself that offer have be affair of moment fifty time have be unhappy in so saying new coming of must not be affair of moment have be dupe have thought of absurd passion on own part now how be now did not bring to think that must ever be lady lufton have still in perversely obstinate manner made up mind against result yet nevertheless did in unaccountable manner satisfy to feel that lord lufton have come down to framley told story have told everything to mark said mr robarts then again there be pause for moment during thought passed through lucy mind yes said mark have told be coming here to morrow morning that may receive answer from what answer said lucy trembling nay dearest who can say that sister in law a spoke pressed close

lucy life wretched to wife have answered that must be left in god hand have not plotted intrigued lucy though loving man in heart of heart have already once refused because must not be thought to have snatched at so great prize if lord lufton loved so warmly that have come down there in manner on purpose a have put that might learn fate then so argued mr robarts two let loyalty to lady lufton be ever so strong must not justify to conscience to stand between lucy lover mark have still somewhat demurred to suggesting how terrible must be plight if must now encourage lord lufton if after such encouragement when must have quarrelled with lady lufton must allow to be led away from engagement by mother to fanny have answered that justice be justice that right be right everything must be told to lucy must judge for know what lord lufton want said lucy with eye fixed upon ground now trembling more than ever did come to did give answer be answer to be final said mark somewhat cruelly for lucy have not yet be told that lover have made repetition of proposal fanny however determined that injustice must be done therefore at last continued story know that did give answer dearest gentleman sometimes will not put up with one answer on subject lord lufton have declared to mark that mean to ask again have come down here on purpose to do so lady lufton said lucy speaking hardly above whisper still hiding face a leaned against sister shoulder lord lufton have not spoken to mother about said mark immediately became clear to lucy from tone of brother voice that at least must not be pleased must accept lover vow must decide out of own heart dear said fanny generously mark know how well have behaved for have told everything lucy shuddered leaned closer against sister a be said to have alternative dearest to tell be best so be not nothing have be told to lord lufton mark must not let come here to day because must have flurried wished to give time to think can see to morrow

not to allow lord lufton to come there under idea that must be received a favoured lover love be powerful so also be pride must not bring to bear scorn must lay in lady lufton eye mother will despise then will despise too said to herself with strong gulp of disappointed love ambition determined to persist will leave now dear speak of again to morrow morning before come said fanny will be best said mark turn in mind way to night think of when have said prayer lucy come here to then taking in arm kissed with tenderness be not customary with towards be fair said must tell have perfect confidence in judgment feeling will stand by a brother in decision may come to fanny think that have behaved excellently be of sure that will do what be best do will stick to so will fanny dearest dearest mark now will say nothing more about till to morrow morning said fanny lucy felt that saying nothing more about till to morrow morning must be tantamount to acceptance on part of lord lufton offer mr robarts knew mr robarts also now knew secret of heart if such being case allowed lord lufton to come there with acknowledged purpose of pleading own suit must be impossible for not to yield if be resolved that must not yield now be time for to stand ground make fight go fanny at least not quite yet said well dear want to stay while tell mark must not let lord lufton come here to morrow not let

must next take sometimes for minute two be half inclined to think rather to say to that lucy be perhaps not worth trouble threw in way loved very dearly must willingly make wife thought said at such moment such moment however be only moment man in love seldom love le because love becomes difficult thus when moment be over must determine to tell mother at once urge to signify consent to miss robarts that must not be quite pleased knew if be firm enough to show that have will of own in matter must probably not gainsay must not ask humbly a favour request ladyship to go through ceremony a though be one of motherly duty a good mother must not hesitate to perform on behalf of son such be final resolve with reached chamber in albany on next day did not see mother must be well thought to have interview with immediately before started for norway so that there might be repetition of be on day before did start that made communication having invited to breakfast in brook street on occasion mother said quite abruptly throwing into one of dining room arm chair have thing to tell mother at once knew that thing be important with own peculiar motherly instinct imagined that question to be discussed have reference to matrimony have son desired to speak to about money tone look must have be different a must also have be case in different way have entertained thought of pilgrimage to pekin prolonged fishing excursion to hudson bay territory thing ludovic well be quite at liberty want to know what think of lucy robarts lady lufton became pale frightened blood ran cold to heart have feared more than rejoiced in conceiving that son be about to talk of love have feared nothing so bad a do think of lucy robarts said repeating son word in tone of evident dismay yes mother have said once twice lately that thought ought to marry be beginning to think so too selected one clergyman daughter for lady be going to do much better with indeed be not said lady lufton sharply therefore rather think will select for clergyman sister dislike miss robarts hope oh ludovic be that lady lufton must say at spur of moment be there harm in have objection to be there anything about make unfit to be wife for moment two lady lufton sat silent collecting thought thought that there be very great objection to lucy robarts regarding a possible future lady lufton must hardly have stated reason be very cogent lucy robarts have in eye beauty style manner even education be desirable lady lufton be not worldly woman be almost a far removed from being so a woman must be in position nevertheless there be certain worldly attribute regarded a essential to character of young lady who might be considered fit to take place have so long filled be desire in looking for wife for son to combine with certain moral excellence regarded a equally essential lucy robarts might have moral excellence might not a to other attribute lady lufton regarded a altogether deficient must never look like lady lufton carry in county a lady lufton must do have not that quiet personal demeanour that dignity of repose lady lufton loved to look upon in young married woman of rank lucy must have said must be nobody in room except by dint of tongue whereas griselda grantly must have held peace for whole evening yet must have impressed everybody by majesty of presence then again lucy have money again lucy be only sister of own parish clergyman people be rarely prophet in own country lucy be prophet at framley be none at least in eye of lady lufton once before a may be remembered have have fear on subject fear not so much for son whom must hardly bring to suspect of such folly for lucy who might be foolish enough to fancy that lord be in love with ala ala son question fell upon poor woman at present moment with weight of terrible blow be there anything about make unfit to be wife be son last word dearest ludovic dearest ludovic got up came over to do think so do indeed think what said in tone be almost angry do think that be unfit to be wife be not of class from must wish to see choose be of same class a griselda grantly dearest think be in error there grantlys have moved in different sphere of life think must feel that be upon word mother one man be rector of plumstead other be vicar of framley be good arguing want to take to lucy robarts have come to on purpose to ask of a favour do mean a wife ludovic yes a wife be to understand that be be engaged to well can not say that be not actually engaged to may take for granted that a far a lie in power intend to become so mind be made up certainly will not alter young lady know certainly horrid sly detestable underhand girl lady lufton said to not being by mean brave enough to speak out such language before son what hope must there be if lord lufton have already committed by positive offer brother mr robarts be aware of yes of approve of well can not say have not seen mr robarts know what may be opinion to speak mind honestly about mark think doe cordially approve be afraid of must be desirous of knowing what think be glad at rate to hear said lady lufton gravely have done anything to encourage must have be very base then there be short period of silence lord lufton have determined not to explain to mother whole state of case must not tell that everything depended on word that lucy be ready to marry only on condition that lady lufton must desire to do so must not let know that everything depended on according to lucy present verdict have strong disinclination to ask mother permission to get married must have to ask be to tell whole truth object be to make think well of lucy to induce to be kind generous affectionate down at framley then thing must turn out comfortably when again visited place a intended to do on return from norway so much thought possible might effect relying on mother probable calculation that must be useless for to oppose measure have power of stopping by authority be to tell that be to be final judge that everything be to depend on will then so thought lord lufton that permission must in probability be refused well mother what answer do intend to give said mind be positively made up must not have come to have not that be case will now be going down home must wish to treat lucy a must wish to treat girl to whom knew be engaged say that be not engaged be not have made offer to have not be rejected have confessed that love not to myself to brother under circumstance may count upon obliging there be something in manner almost frightened mother made think that there be more behind than be told to generally speaking manner be open gentle unguarded now spoke a though have prepared word be resolved on being harsh a well a obstinate be so much taken by surprise ludovic can hardly give answer if ask whether approve of such marriage must say that think that must be throwing away in marrying miss robarts be because know may not be possible that know better than do dear ludovic have be flirting with hate that word always sound to to be vulgar will say making love to if like better gentleman under circumstance will sometimes become infatuated must not have man marry girl without making love to fact be that taste mine be not exactly same like silent beauty whereas like talking beauty then do call miss robarts beautiful yes do very beautiful have beauty that admire good bye now mother will not see again before start will be use writing a will be away so short time quite know where will be will come down to framley immediately return will learn from how land lie have told wish will consider how far think right to fall in with then kissed without waiting for reply took leave poor lady lufton when be left to herself felt that head be going round round be to be end of ambition of love for son be to be result of kindness to robartses almost hated mark robarts a reflected that have be mean of bringing sister to framley thought over sin absence from parish visit to gatherum castle dealing with reference to farm be to have be sold hunting then acceptance of stall given a have be told through omnium interest how must love at moment a then thought of wife must be possible that fanny robarts own friend fanny must be so untrue to a to lend assistance to marriage a a not to use power in preventing have spoken to fanny on very subject not fearing for son with general idea of impropriety of intimacy between such girl a lucy such men a lord lufton then fanny have agreed with must be possible that even must be regarded a enemy then by degree lady lufton began to reflect what step have better take in first place must give in at once consent to marriage only thing quite certain to be that life must be not worth having if be forced into permanent quarrel with son such event must probably kill when read of quarrel in other noble family account of such quarrel will sometimes unfortunately force upon attention of unwilling reader must hug with spirit be almost pharisaical reflecting that destiny be not like of others such quarrel hatred between father daughter mother son be in eye disreputable to person concerned have lived happily with husband comfortably with neighbour respectably with world above thing affectionately with child spoke everywhere of lord lufton a though be nearly perfect in so speaking have not belied conviction under circumstance must not marriage be better than quarrel then again how much of pride of daily life must be destroyed by such match a might not be within power to prevent without quarrel that son must be sick of such chit a lucy before have be married to six month of lady lufton entertained doubt therefore conscience must not be disquieted in disturbing consummation of arrangement so pernicious be evident that matter be not considered a settled even by son also evident that regarded matter a being in way dependent on mother consent on whole might not be better for better for that must think wholly of duty not of disagreeable result to duty might possibly lead must not be duty to accede to alliance therefore must do best to prevent such at least must be attempt in first instance having so decided next resolved on course of action immediately on arrival at framley must send for lucy robarts use eloquence perhaps also little of stern dignity for be so remarkable in explaining to young lady how very wicked be on part to think of forcing into family a of luftons must explain to lucy that happiness must come of that people placed by misfortune above sphere be always miserable in short make use of excellent moral lesson be so customary on such occasion morality might perhaps be thrown away lady lufton depended much on dignified sternness then having so resolved prepared for journey home very little have be said at framley parsonage about lord lufton offer after departure of gentleman very little at least in lucy presence that parson wife must talk about between be matter of course very few word be spoken on matter by to lucy be left to own thought possibly to own hope then other matter came up at framley turned current of interest into other track in first place there be visit made by mr sowerby to dragon of wantly consequent revelation made by mark robarts to wife while latter subject be yet new before fanny lucy have a yet made up mind a to little economy might be practised in household without serious detriment to master comfort news reached that mr crawley of hogglestock have be stricken with fever nothing of kind must well be more dreadful than to who knew family seemed impossible that most ordinary want must be supplied if courageous head be even for day laid low then poverty of poor mr crawley be such that sad necessity of sick bed must hardly be supplied without assistance will go over at once said fanny dear said husband be typhus must first think of child will go what on earth must do mark said wife men on such occasion be almost worse than useless then be so much more liable to infection have child be man said lucy smiling for of exemption be thankful will go when come back will keep clear of bairn so be settled lucy started in pony carriage carrying with such thing from parsonage storehouse a be thought to be suitable to want of sick lady at hogglestock when arrived there made way into house finding door open not being able to obtain assistance of servant girl in ushering in in parlour found grace crawley eldest child sitting demurely in mother chair nursing infant grace be still young child not le on occasion of well understood sorrow did go through task not only with zeal almost with solemnity brother boy of six year old be with have care of baby there sat in cluster quiet grave silent attending on because have be willed by fate that one else must attend on how be mamma dear grace said lucy walking up to holding out hand poor mamma be very ill indeed said grace papa be very unhappy said bobby boy ca get up because of baby said grace bobby can go call papa out will knock at door said lucy so saying walked up to bedroom door tapped against lightly repeated for third time before be summoned in by low hoarse voice then on entering saw mr crawley standing by bedside with book in hand looked at uncomfortably in manner seemed to show that be annoyed by intrusion lucy be aware that have disturbed while at prayer by bedside of wife came across room however shook hand with answered inquiry in ordinary grave solemn voice mr crawley be very ill said very ill god have stricken heavily will be done have better not go to miss robarts be typhus caution however be too late for lucy be already by bedside have taken hand of sick woman have be extended on coverlid to greet dear miss robarts said weak voice be very good of make unhappy to see here lucy lost time in taking sundry matter into own hand ascertaining what be most wanted in wretched household for be wretched enough only servant girl of sixteen have be taken away by mother a soon a became known that mr crawley be ill with poor mother to give due have promised to come down morning evening to do such work a might be done in hour so must not said leave child to catch fever now at period of lucy visit step have be taken to procure nurse mr crawley having resolved to take upon duty of position in absolute ignorance of sanatory measure have thrown on knee to pray if prayer true prayer might succour poor wife of such succour might be confident lucy however thought that other aid also be wanting to if can do anything for said mr crawley let be for poor child will have moved from till be better said lucy boldly moved said mr crawley who even now even in present strait felt repugnance to idea that one must relieve of portion of burden yes said lucy be sure will be better that must lose for week two till mr crawley may be able to leave room where be to go said very gloomily a to lucy be not a yet able to say anything indeed when left framley parsonage there have be time for discussion must go back talk over with fanny find out in what way child might be best put out of danger why must not be harboured at parsonage a soon a assurance must be felt that be not tainted with poison of fever english lady of right sort will do thing one for sick neighbour for neighbour will wittingly admit contagious sickness within precinct of own nursery lucy unloaded jelly febrifuge mr crawley frowning at bitterly while have come to with food have be brought into house a act of charity in very presence in heart of heart disliked lucy robarts in have brought must not cause jar pot to be replaced in pony carriage a must have done have position of wife be different in state must have be barbarous to refuse barbarous also to have created fracas of refusal parcel be introduced be additional weight laid on sore withers of pride till total burden became almost intolerable wife saw recognized even in illness did make slight ineffectual effort to give ease lucy in new power be ruthless chicken to make chicken broth be taken out of basket under very nose lucy did not remain long have made up mind what behoved to do be soon ready to return to framley will be back again mr crawley said probably evening will stay with till be better nurse want room went on to say when mr crawley muttered something a to there being bed chamber will make up sort of litter near will see that will be very snug then got into pony chaise drove home chapter xxxv story of king cophetua lucy a drove home have much a to be necessary that must arouse thought that must go back nurse mr crawley through fever be resolved be free agent enough to take so much on to feel sure that must carry through how be to redeem promise about child twenty plan ran through mind a to farm house in might be placed cottage might be hired for entailed want of money at present moment be not inhabitant of parsonage pledged to dire economy use of pony carriage must have be illicit under circumstance le pressing than present for have be decided that carriage even poor puck must be sold have however given promise about child though own stock of money be very low that promise must be redeemed when reached parsonage be of course full of scheme found that subject of interest have come up in absence prevented from obtaining undivided attention of sister in law to present plan lady lufton have returned that day immediately on return have sent up note addressed to miss lucy robarts note be in fanny hand when lucy stepped out of pony carriage servant who brought have asked for answer verbal answer have be sent saying that miss robarts be away from home must herself send reply when returned can not be denied that colour came to lucy face that hand trembled when took note from fanny in drawing room everything in world to might depend on what that note contained yet did not open at once stood with in hand when fanny pressed on subject still endeavoured to bring back conversation to subject of mr crawley yet mind be intent on letter have already augured ill from handwriting even from word of address have lady lufton intended to be propitious must have directed letter to miss robarts without christian name so at least argued lucy quite unconsciously a one doe argue in such matter one form conclusion of one life without distinct knowledge that premise have even passed through one mind be now alone together a mark be out wo open letter said mr robarts yes immediately fanny must speak to about mr crawley first must go back there evening stay there have promised to do so will certainly keep promise have promised also that child will be taken away must arrange about be dreadful state be in there be one to see to mr crawley child be altogether left to do mean that be going back to stay yes certainly have made distinct promise must do so about child must not manage for child fanny not perhaps in house at least not at first perhaps yet during time that be thus speaking pleading for crawleys be endeavouring to imagine what might be content of letter held between finger be so very ill asked mr robarts can not say how ill may be except certainly have typhus fever have have doctor doctor assistant from silverbridge seems to that be greatly in want of better advice lucy will not read letter be astonishing to that must be so indifferent about lucy be anything indifferent now did proceed to tear envelope note be very short ran in word dear miss robarts be particularly anxious to see will feel much obliged to if can step over to here at framley court must apologize for taking liberty with will probably feel that interview here must suit better than one at parsonage truly yours m lufton there be in for now said lucy handing note over to mr robarts will have to be talked to a never poor girl be talked to before when one think of what have done be hard yes of what have not done exactly of what have not done suppose must go proceeded to re tie string of bonnet have loosened do mean that be going over at once yes immediately why not will be better to have over then can go to crawleys fanny pity of be that know a well a though have be already spoken what good can there be in having to endure ca fancy tone in will explain to conventional inconvenience arose when king cophetua must marry beggar daughter how will explain what griselda went through not archdeacon daughter other griselda came right with yes then be not griselda will explain how must certainly all go wrong with what be good when know beforehand have not desired king cophetua to take sceptre elsewhere then started having first said word two about crawley child obtained promise of puck pony carriage for afternoon be also almost agreed that puck on return to framley must bring back four child with on subject be necessary that mark must be consulted present scheme be to prepare for room outside house once dairy at present occupied by groom wife to bring into house a soon a be manifest that there be danger from infection be to be matter for deliberation fanny wanted to send over note in reply to lady lufton a harbinger of coming lucy marched off hardly answering proposition what be use of such deal of ceremony said know be at home if be not will only lose ten minute in going so went on reaching door of framley court house found that ladyship be at home heart almost came to mouth a be told so then in two minute time found in little room upstairs in little room found once before o reader lucy have never before visited that hallowed precinct there be something in air calculated to inspire awe in who first saw lady lufton sitting bolt upright in cane bottomed arm chair always occupied when at work at book paper knew when determined to receive lucy in apartment there be there arm chair easy cozy chair stood by fireside for who have caught lady lufton napping in chair of afternoon of awe have perhaps be dissipated miss robarts said not rising from chair holding out hand to visitor be much obliged to for having come over to here doubt be aware of subject on wish to speak to will agree with that be better that must meet here than over at parsonage in answer to lucy merely bowed head took seat on chair have be prepared for son continued ladyship have spoken to on subject of think understand miss robarts that there have be engagement between none said lucy made offer refused said very sharply more so undoubtedly than circumstance required with brusqueness be injudicious a well a uncourteous at moment be thinking of own position with reference to lady lufton not to lord lufton of feeling with reference to lady not to gentleman oh said lady lufton little startled by manner of communication then be to understand that there be nothing now going on between son that whole affair be over depends entirely upon on doe know what son may have told lady lufton for care to have secret from in matter a have spoken to about suppose that such be wish also be right in presuming that have spoken to on subject yes have be for reason have taken liberty of sending for may ask what have told mean of course a regard said lucy lady lufton before answered question began to reflect that young lady be taking too much of initiative in conversation be in fact playing game in own fashion be not at in accordance with motif have induced lady lufton to send for have told that made offer of marriage replied lady lufton matter of course be very serious to a mother have thought therefore have better see appeal to own good sense judgment high feeling of course be aware now be coming lecture to be illustrated by king cophetua griselda a lucy have suggested to mr robarts succeeded in stopping for awhile did lord lufton tell be answer not in word now say that refused must express admiration for good wait moment lady lufton son did make offer made to in person up at parsonage then refused foolishly a now believe for dearly love did so from mixture of feeling need not perhaps explain that most prominent doubt be fear of displeasure then came again not to to brother urged suit to nothing can have be kinder to more noble more loving more generous than conduct at first thought when be speaking to myself that be led on thoughtlessly to say that did say did not trust love though saw that did trust must not trust when came again to brother made proposal to know whether will understand lady lufton girl placed a be feel ten time more assurance in such tender of affection a than in one made to herself at spur of moment perhaps then must remember that loved from first be foolish enough to think must know not love saw going on said lady lufton with certain assumption of wisdom about took step hoped must have put stop to in time everybody saw be matter of course said lucy destroying ladyship wisdom at blow well did learn to love not meaning to do so do love with heart be use striving to think must stand with at altar to morrow give hand feeling be doing duty by a woman must do now have told of love believe in a do in own then for moment paused dear miss robarts began lady lufton lucy however have now worked up into condition of power must not allow ladyship to interrupt in speech beg pardon lady lufton will have done directly then will hear so brother came to not urging suit expressing wish for marriage allowing to judge for proposing must see son again on following morning have done so must not have accepted think of lady lufton how must have done other than accept seeing that in heart have accepted love already well said lady lufton not wishing now to put in speech of own did not see refused to do so because be coward must not endure to come into house a son wife be coldly looked on by son mother much a loved much a do love dearly a prize generous offer came down here to repeat to must not live with to be made object of scorn sent word therefore must have when must ask not before then having thus pleaded cause pleaded a believed cause of lover also ceased from speaking prepared to listen to story of king cophetua lady lufton felt considerable difficulty in commencing speech in first place be by mean hard hearted selfish woman be not that own son be concerned glory be reflected upon from son sympathy must have be given to lucy robarts a be did sympathize with admire to certain extent like began also to understand what be that have brought about son love to feel for certain unfortunate concomitant circumstance girl before might have made fitting lady lufton lucy have grown bigger in eye while sitting there talking have lost much of missish want of importance that lack of social weight lady lufton in own opinion have always imputed to girl must thus speak up explain own position now must be able to speak up explain own perhaps other position at future time not for of reason did lady lufton think of giving way power of making marring marriage be placed in hand a be very fitting power behoved to use a best might use to son advantage much a might admire lucy must not sacrifice son to admiration unfortunate concomitant circumstance still remained be of sufficient force a thought to make such marriage inexpedient lucy be sister of gentleman who by peculiar position a parish clergyman of framley be unfitted to be brother in law of owner of framley nobody liked clergyman better than lady lufton be more willing to live with on term of affectionate intimacy must not get over feeling that clergyman of own parish of son be part of own establishment of own appanage of that must not be well that lord lufton must marry among own dependant lady lufton must not have used word did think then too lucy education have be so deficient have have one about in early life accustomed to way of of what will say without making lady lufton appear more worldly than be be want in respect not to be defined in word have be exemplified by very way in have just now stated case have shown talent good temper sound judgment there have be no quiet repose about specie of power in young lady lady lufton most admired be vi inertiae belonging to beautiful dignified reticence of poor lucy have none then too have fortune though minor evil be evil have birth in high life sense of word be greater evil then though eye have sparkled when confessed love lady lufton be not prepared to admit that be possessed of positive beauty such be unfortunate concomitant circumstance still induced lady lufton to resolve that match must be marred performance of part in play be much more difficult than have imagined found obliged to sit silent for minute two during however miss robarts made attempt at further speech be greatly struck lady lufton said at last by excellent sense have displayed in whole of affair must allow to say miss robarts now regard with very different feeling from entertained when left london upon lucy bowed head slightly very stiffly acknowledging rather former censure implied than present eulogium expressed feeling continued lady lufton strongest feeling in matter must be of mother what might be conduct if such marriage did take place need not now consider must confess must think marriage very very ill judged better hearted young man than lord lufton doe not exist one with better principle deeper regard for word be exactly man to be mistaken in hurried outlook a to future life be to become man wife marriage must tend to happiness of of be clear that whole lecture be now coming a lucy have openly declared own weakness thrown power of decision into hand of lady lufton did not see why must endure need not argue about lady lufton said have told only circumstance under must marry son at rate be safe be not wishing to argue answered lady lufton almost humbly be desirous of excusing to so that must not think cruel in withholding consent wished to make believe be doing best for son be sure that think be therefore excuse be necessary exactly of course be matter of opinion do think so can not believe that marriage must make of happy therefore must be very wrong to express consent then lady lufton said lucy rising from chair suppose have now said what be necessary will therefore wish good bye good bye miss robarts wish must make understand how very highly regard conduct in matter have be above praise so will not hesitate to say when speaking of to relative be disagreeable enough to lucy who cared little for praise lady lufton might express to relative in matter pray continued lady lufton give best love to mr robarts tell that will hope to see over here very soon mr robarts also must name day for to dine perhaps will be better must have little talk with fanny first lucy muttered something be intended to signify that such dinner party have better not be made up with intention of including then took leave have decidedly have best of interview there be consciousness of in heart a allowed lady lufton to shake hand with have stopped antagonist short on occasion on attempt have be made to produce homily have be prepared during interview have spoken probably three word for one ladyship have be able to utter nevertheless there be bitter feeling of disappointment about heart a walked back home feeling also that have caused own unhappiness why must have be so romantic chivalrous self sacrificing seeing that romance chivalry have be to detriment a well a to hers seeing that sacrificed a well a why must have be so anxious to play into lady lufton hand be not because thought right a general social rule that lady must refuse gentleman hand unless gentleman mother be consenting party to marriage must have held such doctrine a absurd lady must have said must have have to look to own family further be not virtue cowardice have influenced have none of solace may come to in misfortune from consciousness that own conduct have be blameless lady lufton have inspired with awe such feeling on part be mean ignoble unbecoming spirit with wished to think that be endowed that be accusation brought against forbade to feel triumph a to result of interview when reached parsonage mark be there be of course expecting well said in short hurried manner be puck ready again have time to lose must go pack up few thing have settled about child fanny yes will tell directly have seen lady lufton seen oh yes of course have seen did not send for in case be not on card must disobey what did say how green be mark not only green impolite also to make repeat story of own disgrace of course told that did not intend must marry lord son of course said that under circumstance must not think of doing such thing lucy can not understand said fanny very gravely be sometimes inclined to doubt whether have deep feeling in matter not if have how can bring to joke about well be singular sometimes doubt whether have ought to be pale ought not very thin to go mad by degree have not least intention of doing anything of kind therefore matter be not worth further notice be civil to lucy asked mark civil in manner know oh uncommonly so will hardly believe actually asked to dine always doe know when want to show good humour if 'd broken leg wished to commiserate 'd ask to dinner suppose meant to be kind said fanny who be not disposed to give up old friend though be quite ready to fight lucy battle if there be occasion for battle to be fought lucy be so perverse said mark that be impossible to learn from what really have taken place upon word then know a well a can tell asked if lord lufton have made offer said yes asked next if meant to accept not without approval said then asked to dinner be exactly what took place can not see have be perverse at after threw into chair mark fanny stood looking at other mark said after while be unkind to make a little of a can for sake be better so fanny than must go about moaning like sick cow then looked at saw that tear be already brimming over from eye dearest dearest lucy said fanny immediately going down on knee before wo be unkind to again then have great cry together chapter xxxvi kidnapping at hogglestock great cry however did not take long lucy be soon in pony carriage again on occasion brother volunteered to drive be now understood that be to bring back with crawley child whole thing have be arranged groom wife be to be taken into house big bedroom across yard usually occupied by be to be converted into quarantine hospital until such time a

said dean then of course will dine with a go home horse also will be quite a important having be duly settled proper ceremony of introduction having taken place between dean lucy proceeded to discus character of mr crawley have known life said dean having be at school college with for year since be on term of closest intimacy with in spite of know how to help in need prouder hearted man never met one le willing to share sorrow with friend have often heard speak of said mark one of bitterest feeling have be that man so dear to must live so near to must see so little of what can do will not come to house when go to be angry with because wear shovel hat ride on horseback must leave hat horse at border of last parish said lucy timidly well yes certainly one ought not to give offence even in such matter a coat waistcoat must then be equally objectionable have changed in outward matter mean have not irritates unless must be what be in old day will not look at with same eye then rode on in order a said that first pang of interview might be over before robarts sister came upon scene mr crawley be standing before door leaning over little wooden railing when dean trotted up on horse have come out after hour of close watching to get few mouthful of sweet summer air a stood there held youngest of child in arm poor little baby sat there quiet indeed hardly happy father though loved offspring with affection a intense a human nature can supply be not gifted with knack of making child fond of for be hardly more than knack aptitude men have of gaining good grace of young such men be not always best father safest guardian carry about with certain duc ad child recognize in three minute upset barrier between five five forty mr crawley be stern man thinking ever of soul mind of bairn a father must do thinking also season be fitted for operating on soul mind a perhaps must not have done a father a teacher consequently child avoided when choice be given thereby adding fresh wound to torn heart by mean quenching of great love with regarded be standing there thus with placid little baby in arm baby placid enough one must not kiss eagerly stroke face with soft little hand a must have have do when saw dean coming towards be sharp sighted a lynx out in open air though now obliged to pore over well fingered book with spectacle on nose thus knew friend from long distance have time to meditate mode of greeting too doubtless have come if not with jelly chicken then with money advice with money advice such a thriving dean might offer to poor brother clergyman mr crawley though husband must possibly be more anxious for wife safety than be immediately put back up began to bethink how tender might be rejected how be be first word dean spoke a pulled up horse close to little gate put out hand to take of friend how be arabin said be very kind of to come so far seeing how much there be to keep at barchester can not say that be better know that be worse sometimes fancy that be delirious though hardly know at rate mind wanders then after sleep be fever le sometimes le sometimes more imagine child poor thing be well a yet must be taken from crawley a matter of course mr crawley fancied that there be tone of authority in dean advice immediately put into opposition know how may be have not yet made up mind dear crawley providence doe not admit of such removal in case said among poorer class child must endure such peril in many case be so said dean by mean inclined to make argument of at present moment in case need not must allow to make arrangement for sending for a of course time be occupied here miss robarts though have mentioned intention of staying with mr crawley have said nothing of framley plan with reference to child what mean be that intend to take burden off shoulder in fact to pay for can not allow arabin must take lot of father mother a be proper that must do again dean have inclination for arguing thought might be well to let

leave with satisfied conviction that poor lady must not be left wholly to somewhat unskilful nursing of husband chapter xxxvii mr sowerby without company now there be going to be wondrous doings in west barsetshire men mind be much disturbed fiat have gone forth from high place queen have dissolved faithful common giant finding that must effect little nothing with old house have resolved to try what new venture must do for hubbub of general election be to pervade country produced inconsiderable irritation annoyance for house be not a yet quite three year old member of parliament though naturally feel constitutional pleasure in meeting friend in pressing hand of constituent be nevertheless so far akin to lower order of humanity that appreciate danger of losing seat certainty of considerable outlay in endeavour to retain be not agreeable to legislative mind never did old family fury between god giant rage higher than at present moment giant declared that turn attempted to take in country service have be thwarted by faction in spite of benign promise of assistance made to only few week since by opponent god answered by asserting that be driven to opposition by boeotian fatuity of giant have doubt promised aid be ready to give to measure be decently prudent not to bill enabling government at will to pension aged bishop there must be limit to tolerance when such attempt a be made that limit have be clearly passed have taken place openly only day two after casual whisper dropped by tom tower at miss dunstable party by tom tower that most pleasant of pleasant fellow how must have known who flutter from one sweetest flower of garden to adding sugar to pink honey to rose so loved for what give taking nothing a go whisper have grown into rumour rumour into fact political world be in ferment giant furious about bishop pension bill threatened house most injudiciously then be beautiful to see how indignant member got up glowing with honesty declared that be base to conceive that gentleman in house must be actuated in vote by hope fear with reference to seat so matter grew from bad to worse contending party never hit at other with such envenomed wrath a did now having entered ring together so lately with such manifold promise of good will respect forbearance going from general to particular may say that nowhere be deeper consternation spread than in electoral division of west barsetshire sooner have tidings of dissolution reached county than be known that duke intended to change nominee mr sowerby have now sat for division since reform bill have become one of county institution by dint of custom long establishment have be borne with even liked by county gentleman in spite of well known pecuniary irregularity now be to be changed reason have a yet be publicly given be understood that lord dumbello be to be returned although did not own acre of land in county be true that rumour went on to say that lord dumbello be about to form close connection with barsetshire be on eve of marrying young lady from other division indeed be now engaged so be said in completing arrangement with government for purchase of noble crown property usually known a chace of chaldicotes be also stated statement however have hitherto be only announced in confidential whisper chaldicotes house must soon become residence of marquis duke be claiming a own must very shortly have completed claim taken possession then by arrangement between be to be made over to lord dumbello very contrary rumour to got abroad also men said such a dared to oppose duke few also who did not dare to oppose when day of battle came that be beyond grace power to turn lord dumbello into barsetshire magnate crown property such men said be to fall into hand of young mr gresham of boxall hill in other division that term of purchase have be already settled a to mr sowerby property house of chaldicotes opponent of omnium interest went on to explain be by mean a yet so certain that duke must be able to enter take possession place be not to be given up to quietly great fight must be made be beginning to be believed that enormous mortgage must be paid off by lady of immense wealth then dash of romance be not wanting to make story palatable lady of immense wealth have be courted by mr sowerby have acknowledged love have refused to marry on account of character in testimony of love however be about to pay debt be soon put beyond rumour became manifest enough that mr sowerby did not intend to retire from county in obedience to duke behest placard be posted through whole division in allusion be made by name to duke in mr sowerby warned friend not to be led away by report that intended to retire from representation of west barsetshire have sat placard said for same county during full period of quarter of century must not lightly give up honour have be extended to so often prized so dearly there be few men now in house whose connection with same body of constituent have remained unbroken so long a have that bound to west barsetshire confidently hoped that connection might be continued through period of coming year till might find in glorious position of being father of county member of house of common placard said much more than hinted at sundry various question of great interest to county did not say one word of duke of omnium though one knew what duke be supposed to be doing in matter be a be great llama shut up in holy of holy inscrutable invisible inexorable not to be seen by men eye heard by ear hardly to be mentioned by ordinary men at such period a without inward quaking nevertheless be who be supposed to rule euphemism required that name must be mentioned at public meeting in connection with coming election nevertheless most men in county believed that must send dog up to house of common a member for west barsetshire if so pleased be supposed therefore that friend sowerby must have chance be lucky in finding assistance in quarter from certainly have not deserved have be staunch friend of god during whole of political life a indeed be to be expected seeing that have be duke nominee nevertheless on present occasion giant connected with county came forward to rescue did not do with acknowledged purpose of opposing duke declared that be actuated by generous disinclination to see old county member put from seat world knew that battle be to be waged against great llama be to be contest between power of aristocracy power of oligarchy a power existed in west barsetshire may be added that democracy must have very little to say to on one side on other lower order of voter small farmer tradesman must doubt range on side of duke must endeavour to flatter that be thereby furthering view of liberal side must in fact be led to poll by old fashioned time honoured adherence to will of great llama by apprehension of evil if llama must arise shake in wrath what might not come to county if llama be to walk off with satellite army courtier there be great llama though came among seldom be scarcely seen when did come nevertheless not le rather more be obedience to considered a salutary opposition regarded a dangerous great rural llama be still sufficiently mighty in rural england priest of temple mr fothergill be frequent enough in men eye be beautiful to hear with how varied voice alluded to thing around to change be coming to small farmer not only on gatherum property on others also spoke of duke a beneficent influence shedding prosperity on around keeping up price by presence forbidding poor rate to rise above one fourpence in pound by general employment occasioned men must be mad thought who must willingly fly in duke face to squire from distance declared that one have right to charge duke with interference a far at least a knew duke mind people must talk of thing of understood nothing must one say that have traced single request for vote home to duke did not alter settled conviction on men mind have effect tended to increase mystery in duke doings be enveloped to own familiar to gentry immediately around mr fothergill merely winked eye knew what be what so did duke have never be bit yet in such matter mr fothergill did not think that must now submit to such operation never heard in what manner at what rate mr fothergill received remuneration for various service performed by with reference to duke property in barsetshire be very sure that might be amount earned thoroughly never be there more faithful partisan one who in partisanship be more discreet in matter of coming election declared that personally on own hook did intend to bestir actively on behalf of lord dumbello mr sowerby be old friend of very good fellow be true world must admit that sowerby be not in position county member ought to occupy be ruined man must not be for own advantage that must be maintained in position be fit only for man of property knew fothergill that mr sowerby must abandon right claim to chaldicotes if so what must be more absurd than to acknowledge that have right claim to seat in parliament a to lord dumbello be probable that must soon become one of largest landowner in county a such who must be more fit for representation beyond mr fothergill be not ashamed to confess so said that hoped to hold lord dumbello agency must be compatible with other duty therefore a matter of course intended to support lord dumbello be a to duke mind in matter have already explained how mr fothergill disposed of in day mr sowerby came down to own house for ostensibly be still own house came very quietly arrival be hardly known in own village though placard be stuck up so widely took electioneering step none at least a yet protection against arrest derived from parliament must soon be over who be most bitter against duke averred that step must be taken to arrest must give sufficient opportunity to myrmidon of law that must in such case be arrested be very likely be not likely that must be done in way at duke instance mr fothergill declared indignantly that insinuation made very angry be too prudent man to be very angry at anything knew how to make capital on own side of charge such a overshot own mark mr sowerby came down very quietly to chaldicotes there remained for couple of day quite alone place bore very different aspect now to noticed when mark robarts drove up to in early page of little narrative there be light in window now voice came from stable dog barked be dead silent a grave during greater portion of two day sat alone within house almost unoccupied did not even open letter lay piled on crowded table in small breakfast parlour in sat for letter of such men come in pile there be few of be pleasant in reading there sat troubled with thought be sad enough now then moving to fro house for most part occupied in thinking over position to have brought what must be in world eye if ceased to be owner of chaldicotes ceased also to be member for county have lived ever before world though always harassed by encumbrance have be sustained comforted by excitement of prominent position debt difficulty have hitherto be bearable have borne with ease so long that have almost taught to think that must never be unendurable now order for foreclosing have gone forth harpy of law by present speed in sticking claw into carcase of property be atoning to for delay with have hitherto be compelled to approach prey order a to seat have gone forth also that placard have be drawn up by combined effort of sister miss dunstable certain well known electioneering agent named closerstill presumed to be in interest of giant poor sowerby have little confidence in placard one knew better than how great be duke power be hopeless therefore a walked about through empty room thinking of past life of life be to come must not be well for that be dead now that be dying to have made world pleasant see hear of such men a mr sowerby be apt to think that enjoy that world can give that enjoy that without payment either in care labour doubt that with even most callous of period of wretchedness must be frequent that wretchedness very intense salmon lamb in february green pea new potato in march can hardly make man happy even though nobody pay for feeling that one be antecedentem scelestum after whom sure though lame nemesis be hobbling must sometimes disturb one slumber on present occasion scelestus felt that nemesis have overtaken lame a have be swift a have run have mouthed at last there be nothing left for to listen to whoop set up at sight of own death throe be melancholy dreary place now that big house of chaldicotes though wood be green with early leaf garden thick with flower also be melancholy dreary lawn be untrimmed weed be growing through gravel here there cracked dryad tumbled from pedestal sprawling in grass gave look of disorder to whole place wooden trellis work be shattered here bending there standard rose tree be stooping to ground leaf of winter still encumbered border late in evening of second day mr sowerby strolled out went through garden into wood of inanimate thing of world wood of chaldicotes be dearest to be not man to whom companion gave much credit for feeling thought akin to poetry here out in chace mind must be almost poetical while wandering among forest tree became susceptible of tenderness of human nature must listen to bird singing pick here there wild flower on path must watch decay of old tree progress of young make picture in eye of turn in wood must mark colour of bit of road a dipped into dell then passing through water course rose brown rough irregular beautiful against bank on other side then must sit think of old family how have roamed there time out of mind in chaldicotes wood father son grandson in regular succession giving over without blemish decrease to successor so must sit so did sit even now thinking of thing wished that have never be born be dark night when returned to house a did so resolved that must quit place altogether give up battle a lost duke must take do a pleased with a for seat in parliament lord dumbello other equally gifted young patrician might hold for must vanish from scene betake to land from whence must be neither heard seen there starve such be now future outlook into world yet a regard health physical capacity knew that be still in prime of life yes in prime of life what must do with what remained to of such prime how must turn mind strength to such account a might now be serviceable how must in sore need earn for even barest bread must not be better for that must die let not one covet lot of spendthrift even though day of early pea champagne seem to be unnumbered for lame nemesis will surely be up before game have be played out when mr sowerby reached house found that message by telegraph have arrived for in absence be from sister informed that must be with night be coming down by mail train have telegraphed to barchester for post horse must be at chaldicotes about two hour after midnight be therefore manifest enough that business be of importance exactly at two barchester post chaise did arrive mr harold smith before retired to bed be closeted for about hour with brother well said following morning a sat together at breakfast table what do say to now if accept offer must be with lawyer afternoon suppose must accept said certainly think so no doubt will take property out of own hand a completely a though duke have will leave house at rate for life what good will house be when ca keep up be not so sure of will not want more than fair interest a will be thoroughly well managed must think that there must be something over something enough to keep up house then know must have place in country tell fairly harriet will have nothing further to do with harold in way of money ah be because must go to why did not come to then nathaniel be only way in can have chance of keeping seat be queerest woman ever met seems resolved on beating duke quite understand have not slightest objection think that be interfering with young gresham about crown property have idea that have so much business at finger end when first proposed matter took up quite a lawyer might seemed to have forgotten altogether what occurred about other matter wish must forget also said mr sowerby really think that doe when be obliged to make allusion to at least felt obliged be sorry afterwards did merely laughed great loud laugh a always doe then went on about business however be clear about expense of election must be added to sum to be advanced by that house must be left to without rent if choose to take land round house must pay for by acre a tenant do be a clear about a though have passed life in lawyer office reader will now pretty well understand what last step excellent sister mr harold smith have taken on brother behalf will be surprised to learn that in course of day mr sowerby hurried back to town put into communication with miss dunstable lawyer chapter xxxviii be there cause just impediment now purpose to visit country house in

immediate payment be arranged also that security a held by miss dunstable must be very valid miss dunstable at boxall hill at greshamsbury be very different person from miss dunstable in london be difference so much vexed mr gresham not that friend omitted to bring with into country london wit aptitude for fun that did not take with up to town genuine goodness love of honesty made loveable in

cousin honourable george be not cousin well husband must not be fair to show man letter must like to show be determined then to remain single did say that why do cross question so because think so

be almost on mr gresham tongue to say that did know of one such meaning uncle in truth did not know such thing must boast to herself that have good ground for feeling that be so certainly none sufficient to justify in speaking of uncle have said word to on matter have be confused embarrassed when idea of such marriage be hinted to nevertheless mr gresham did think that of two be well inclined to love other that must be happier together than must be single difficulty however be very great for doctor must be terribly afraid of being thought covetous in regard to miss dunstable money must hardly be expected that must be induced to make first overture to doctor uncle must be only man can think of must be at fit for said mr gresham boldly what rob poor lady scatcherd said miss dunstable oh very well if choose to make joke of name in way have done why god bless girl what doe want to say a for joking surely be innocent enough be a tender about doctor a though be girl of seventeen be not about be such shame to laugh at poor dear lady scatcherd if be to hear 'd lose comfort in having uncle near be to marry so that may be safe with friend very well have done mr gresham who have already got up from seat employed very sedulously in arranging flower have be brought in for drawing room table thus remained silent for minute two during began to reflect that after might probably be thought that also be endeavouring to catch great heiress for uncle now be angry with said miss dunstable be not oh be do think be fool a not to see when person vexed must have twitched that geranium head off if 'd be in proper frame of mind like joke about lady scatcherd be that mary now do try be true if can remember bishop magna est veritas fact be have got into way of being sharp

something on mind quite dare to speak out if have got anything to say say mr gresham did not choose to say at moment held peace went on arranging flower now with more satisfied air without destruction to geranium when have grouped bunch properly carried jar from one part of room to backwards forward trying effect of colour a though mind be quite intent upon flower be for moment wholly unoccupied with other subject miss dunstable be not woman to put up with sat silent in place while friend made one two turn about room then got up from seat also mary said give over about wretched bit of green branch leave jar where be be trying to fidget into passion be said mr gresham standing opposite to big bowl putting head little on one side a though must better look at handiwork in position know be be because lack courage to speak out did begin at in way for nothing do lack courage be just said mr gresham still giving twist here set there to of small sprig constituted background of bouquet do lack courage to have ill motif imputed to be thinking of saying something be afraid therefore will not say now if like will be ready to take out in ten minute miss dunstable be not going to be put off in way to tell truth must admit that friend mr gresham be not using altogether well must either have held peace on matter altogether must probably have be wiser course must have declared own idea boldly feeling secure in own conscience a to own motif will not stir from room said miss dunstable till have have matter out with a for imputation imputing bad motif to know how far may be joking saying what call sharp thing to have right to think must think evil of if really do think so be treason to love have for if thought that thought so must not remain in house with what be not able to know difference one make between one real friend one mock friend believe of know be only striving to bully miss dunstable now took turn of walking up down room well sha be bullied said mr gresham

during whole period of doctor visit what thought mr gresham to herself what if have set two friend at variance with other instead of binding together in closest most durable friendship still have idea that a have begun to play game must play out felt conscious that what have done must do evil unless must so carry on a to make result in good indeed unless must so manage must have done manifest injury to miss dunstable in forcing to declare thought feeling have already spoken to uncle in london though have said nothing to show that approved of plan have said anything to show that disapproved

how to write love letter dr thorne in few word spoke to niece before left boxall hill have called old man be a yet on right side of sixty by five good year bore about with le of mark of age than most men of fifty five do bear one must have said in looking at that there be reason why must not marry if found that step seemed good to looking at age of proposed bride there be nothing unsuitable in respect nevertheless felt almost ashamed of in that allowed even to think of proposition niece have made mounted horse day at boxall hill for made journey about county on horseback rode slowly home to greshamsbury thinking not so much of suggested marriage a of own folly in thinking of how must be such as at time of life a to allow even course of way to be disturbed by such idea of course must not propose to wife a miss dunstable without having thought a to wealth have be pride of life so to live that world might know that be indifferent about money profession be in to air breathed a well a bread ate how must follow profession if made marriage a must expect to go to london with what must become dangling at heel there known only to world a husband of richest woman in town kind of life be one must be unsuitable to yet a rode home must not resolve to rid of idea went on thinking of though still continued to condemn for keeping in thought night at home must make up mind so declared to must then write to niece begging to drop subject having so far come to resolution went on meditating what course of life might be well for to pursue if miss dunstable must after become man wife there be two lady whom behoved to see on day of arrival whom indeed generally saw day except when absent from greshamsbury first of first in general consideration of people of place be wife of squire lady arabella gresham very old patient of doctor be custom to visit early in afternoon then if be able to escape squire daily invitation to dinner customarily went to other lady scatcherd when rapid meal in own house be over such at least be summer practice well doctor how be at boxall hill said squire waylaying on gravel sweep before door squire be very hard set for occupation in summer month quite well believe know what be come to frank think hate place now be full of election suppose oh yes told to say must be over here soon of course there will be contest so need not trouble happy dog be doctor to have before instead of behind well well be a good lad a ever lived a ever lived let see time then there be few very important word spoken on subject will just step up to lady arabella now said doctor be a fretful a possible said squire have just left nothing special matter hope think not nothing in way be only specially cross always come in way will stop dine to day of course not to day squire nonsense will have be quite counting on have particular reason for wanting to have to day most particular reason squire always have particular reason be very sorry be impossible to day will have letter to write must sit down to seriously will see when come down from ladyship squire turned away sulkily almost without answering for now have prospect of alleviation to tedium of evening doctor went up stair to patient for lady arabella though can not be said that be ill be always patient must not be supposed that kept bed swallowed daily dos be prevented from taking share in such prosy gaiety a came from time to time in way of prosy life suited turn of mind to be invalid to have doctor a doctor whom good fate have placed at elbow thoroughly understood case great harm be done fret dreadfully that can not get to see mary lady arabella said a soon a first ordinary question a to ailment have be asked answered be quite well will be over to see before long now beg that wo never think of coming when there can be possible objection travelling at present moment must be whereupon lady arabella shook head very gravely only think of importance of doctor said remember enormous stake there be to be considered must not do have'porth of harm if stake be twice a large nonsense doctor tell a if did know be very much against going to london spring of course what said be overruled always be do believe mr gresham went over to boxall hill on purpose to induce to go what doe care be fond of frank never think of looking beyond present day never did a know well enough doctor trip did good in world said dr thorne preferring anything to conversation respecting squire sin very well remember that when be in way be thought that such trip must do good perhaps thing be altered since then yes be said doctor interfere so much now day know never asked for such amusement when so much depended on quietness remember before frank be born indeed when of be born a say thing be different then can easily believe that mary be person quite determined to have own way why lady arabella must have stayed at home without wishing to stir if frank have done so much a hold up little finger so did always if mr gresham made slightest hint gave way really see what one get in return for such implicit obedience now year doctor of course must have liked to have be up in london for week two seemed to think might a well see sir omicron there must be possible objection said well exactly a mr gresham knew wished think might a well have offered suppose there can be reason now about money understood that mary specially asked augusta yes mary be very good did ask know very well that mary want room have got in house be not at too large for herself for matter of sister countess be very anxious must be with one doe like to be independent if one can for one fortnight do think that mr gresham might have managed when knew that be so dreadfully out at elbow never troubled about though goodness know be never fault squire hate london fortnight there in warm weather must nearly be death of might at rate have paid compliment of asking chance be ten to one must not have gone be that indifference cut so be here just now must believe doctor be determined to avoid further complaint for present day wonder what must feel lady arabella if squire be to take into head to go away amuse leaving at home there be worse men than mr gresham if will believe be allusion to earl de courcy ladyship brother a lady arabella very well understood argument be one be very often used to silence upon word then must like better than hanging about here doing nothing attend to nasty dog really sometimes think that have spirit left be mistaken there lady arabella said doctor rising with hat in hand making escape without further parley a went home must not think that phase of married life be not very pleasant one mr gresham wife be supposed by world to live on best of term always inhabited same house went out together when did go out always sat in respective corner in family pew in wildest dream after happiness of novelty never thought of sir cresswell cresswell in respect with regard for instance to continued duration of joint domesticity at family mansion of greshamsbury might have be taken for pattern couple yet a far a doctor must see did not seem to add much to happiness of other loved other doubtless have of be in real danger danger must have made other miserable might well be question whether must not be more comfortable without other doctor a be custom dined at five at seven went up to cottage of old friend lady scatcherd lady scatcherd be not refined woman having in early day be labourer daughter having then married labourer husband have risen in world a have be told in chronicle before mentioned widow be now lady scatcherd with pretty cottage good jointure be in thing very opposite to lady arabella gresham nevertheless under doctor auspex two lady be in measure acquainted with other of married life also dr thorne have seen something may be questioned whether memory of be more alluring than reality now existing at greshamsbury of two woman dr thorne much preferred humbler friend to made visit not in guise of doctor a neighbour well lady said a sat down by on broad garden seat world called lady scatcherd lady how do long summer day agree with rose be twice better out than see up at big house may well call long doctor be long enough surely not too long come now wo have complaining mean to tell that have anything to make wretched have better not

friend lady arabella friend lady scatcherd former be always complaining of existing husband who never refused moderate request other passed day in murmuring at loss of dead husband who in life have ever be to imperious harsh have sometimes be cruel unjust doctor have letter to write even yet have not quite made up mind what must put into indeed have not hitherto resolved to whom must be written looking at matter a have endeavoured to look at niece mr gresham must be correspondent if brought to take jump in dark in case must address direct to miss dunstable walked home not by straightest road taking considerable curve round by narrow lane through thick flower laden hedge very thoughtful be told that wished to marry be to think only of a to pride of about money be in truth hearty manly feeling be false pride of behoved to be ashamed a did of many cognate feeling if acted rightly in matter why must be afraid of thought of one life of solitude be bitter enough a poor lady scatcherd have complained then looking at lady scatcherd looking also at other near neighbour friend squire there be little thereabouts to lead on to matrimony so walked home slowly through lane very meditative with hand behind back when got home be much more inclined to resolute line of action might have drunk tea with lady scatcherd a well a have sat there in own drawing room drinking alone for got pen paper dawdled over teacup with utmost dilatoriness putting off a be evil day to only one thing be fixed to namely that letter must be written before went to bed having finished tea did not take place till near eleven went downstairs to untidy little room lay behind depot of medicine in be wont to do writing herein did at last set down to work even at moment be in doubt must write letter to miss dunstable see how looked be almost determined not to send so at least said to must do harm by writing so did write a follows greshamsbury june dear miss dunstable when have got so far leaned back in chair looked at paper how on earth be to find word to say that now wished to have said have never written letter in life anything approaching to now found overwhelmed with difficulty of have not previously thought spent half hour in looking at paper be at last nearly deterred by new difficulty must use simplest plainest language said to over over again be not always easy to use simple plain language by mean so easy a to mount on stilt to march along with sesquipedalian word with pathos spasm note of interjection letter did at last get written there be not note of interjection in dear miss dunstable think right to confess must not be now writing letter to have not be led to believe by other judgment than own that proposition be going to make must be regarded by with favour without such other judgment must own have feared that great disparity between in regard to money must have given to such proposition appearance of being false mercenary ask of now with confidence be to acquit of such fault a when have read so far will understand what mean have known other now somewhat intimately though indeed not very long have sometimes fancied that be almost a well pleased to be with a have be to be with if have be wrong in tell so simply will endeavour to let friendship run on a though letter have not be written if have be right if be possible that can think that union between will make happier than be single will plight word troth with good faith will do what old man may do to make burden of world lie light upon shoulder looking at age can hardly keep from thinking that be old fool try to reconcile to by remembering that be no longer girl see that pay compliment that need expect none from know must add anything to truth of if be to write three time a much be necessary be that must know what mean if believe to be true honest already nothing can write will make believe god bless know will not keep long in suspense for answer affectionately friend thomas thorne when have finished meditated again for half hour whether must not be right that must add something about money must not be well for to tell might be said in postscript that with regard to wealth must be free to do what chose at rate owed debt for to pay must still have own income sufficient for own purpose about one o'clock came to conclusion that must be better to leave matter alone if cared for must trust be worthy also that must trust omission of such statement must deter from coming to if there be such trust must not be created by such assurance on part so read letter over twice sealed took up together with bed candle into bed room now that letter be written seemed to be thing fixed by fate that must go have written that might see how looked when written now that be written there remained doubt that must be sent so went to bed with letter on toilette table beside early in morning so early a to make seem that importance of letter have disturbed rest sent off by special messenger to boxall hill wait for answer said boy said doctor leave letter come away breakfast hour be not very early at boxall hill in summer month frank gresham doubt went round farm before came in for prayer wife be probably looking to butter in dairy at rate did not meet till near ten therefore though ride from greshamsbury to boxall hill be nearly two hour work miss dunstable have letter in own room before came down read in silence a be dressing while maid be with in room made sign must induce abigail to think that epistle be more than ordinarily important read then quietly refolding placing in envelope put down on table at be sitting be full fifteen minute afterwards that begged servant to see if mr gresham be still in own room because want to see for five minute alone before breakfast said miss dunstable traitor false black traitor be first word miss dunstable spoke when found alone with friend why what be matter did not think there be so much mischief in so keen commonplace desire for match making look here read first four line not more if please rest be private whose be other judgment of whom uncle speaks in letter oh miss dunstable must read indeed will do such thing think be love letter dare say indeed there be not word about love in know have offered will be so glad for know like tell that be old woman insinuates may probably be old fool be sure doe not say that ah be

tell fairly that have right to tell anything what passed between passed in confidence let hear what did say told that must have if offered mr gresham a spoke looked into friend face doubtingly not knowing whether in very truth miss dunstable be pleased with displeased if be displeased then how have uncle be deceived told that a fact told that thought so then suppose be bound to have said miss dunstable dropping letter on to floor in mock despair dear dear dearest woman said mr gresham bursting into tear throwing on to friend neck mind be dutiful niece said miss dunstable now let go finish dressing in course of afternoon answer be sent back to greshamsbury in word dear dr thorne do will trust in everything will be a must have mary writes to believe word say never will again for have behaved so bad in matter yours affectionately very truly martha dunstable so be going to marry richest woman in england said dr thorne to a sat down day to mutton chop chapter xl internecine must be conceived that there be feeling of triumph at plumstead episcopi when wife of rector returned home with daughter bride elect of lord dumbello heir of marquis of hartletop be in wealth most considerable unmarried young nobleman of day be noted too a man difficult to be pleased a one who be very fine who gave air to have be selected a wife of such man a be great thing for daughter of parish clergyman have seen in what manner happy girl mother communicated fact to lady lufton hiding a be pride under veil have seen also how meekly happy girl bore own great fortune applying humbly to packing of clothes a though ignored own glory nevertheless there be triumph at plumstead episcopi mother when returned home began to feel that have be thoroughly successful in great object of life while be yet in london have hardly realized satisfaction there be doubt then whether cup might not be dashed from lip before be tasted might be that even son of marquis of hartletop be subject to parental authority that barrier must spring up between griselda coronet there have be nothing of kind archdeacon have be closeted with marquis mr grantly have be closeted with marchioness though of noble person have expressed gratified by son proposed marriage so also of have made attempt to prevent lord dumbello be man who have will of own a grantlys boasted amongst poor griselda day may perhaps come when fact of lord masterful will may not to be matter of much boasting in london a be saying there have be time for appreciation of family joy work to be done be nervous in nature glorification might have be fatal now when be safe at plumstead great truth burst upon in splendour mr grantly have one daughter formation of child character establishment in world have be one main object of mother life of griselda great beauty plumstead household have long be conscious of discretion also of conduct of demeanour there have be no doubt father have sometimes hinted to mother that did not think that grizzy be quite so clever a brother agree with at mr grantly have answered besides what call cleverness be not at necessary in girl be perfectly ladylike even wo deny that archdeacon have never wished to deny be now fain to admit that what have called cleverness be not necessary in young lady at period of family glory archdeacon be kept little in abeyance be hardly allowed free intercourse with own magnificent child indeed to give due must be said of that must not consent to walk in triumphal procession moved with stately step to fro through barchester region kissed daughter blessed bade love husband be good wife such injunction a seeing how splendidly have done duty in securing to herself marquis seemed out of place almost vulgar girl about to marry curate sucking barrister must be told to do duty in station of life to god might be calling seemed to be almost impertinence in father to give such injunction to future marchioness think that have ground for fear on behalf said mr grantly seeing in what way have hitherto conducted have be good girl said archdeacon be about to be placed in position of great temptation have strength of mind suited for position replied mr grantly vain gloriously nevertheless even archdeacon moved about through close at barchester with somewhat prouder step since tidings of alliance have become known there time have be in latter day of father lifetime when be greatest man of close dean have be old infirm dr grantly have wielded bishop authority since thing have altered new bishop have come there absolutely hostile to new dean have also come who be not only friend brother in law of wife even advent have lessened authority of archdeacon vicar choral did not hang upon word a have be wont to do minor canon smiled in return to smile le obsequiously when met in clerical circle of barchester now seemed that old supremacy be restored to in mind of many men archdeacon who be father in law of marquis be a good a bishop did not say much of new connection to others beside dean be conscious of fact conscious also of reflected glory shone around own head a regard mr grantly may be said that moved in unending procession of stately ovation must not be supposed that continually talked to friend neighbour of lord dumbello marchioness be by far too wise for such folly a that coming alliance having be once announced name of hartletop be hardly mentioned by out of own domestic circle assumed with ease be surprising even to herself air grace of mighty woman went through work of morning call a though be business to be affable to country gentry astonished sister dean wife by simplicity of grandeur condescended to mr proudie in manner nearly broke that lady heart will be even with yet said mr proudie to herself who have contrived to learn various very deleterious circumstance respecting hartletop family since news about lord dumbello griselda have become known to griselda herself be carried about in procession taking little part in of own like eastern god suffered mother caress smiled in mother face a listened to own praise triumph be apparently within to one did say much on subject greatly disgusted old family housekeeper by declining altogether to discus future dumbello menage to aunt mr arabin who strove hard to lead into open hearted speech a to future aspiration be perfectly impassive oh yes aunt of course will think about aunt eleanor of course will do that if lord dumbello wish nothing beyond must be got from so after dozen ineffectual attempt mr arabin abandoned matter then there arose subject of clothes of wedding trousseau sarcastic people be wont to say that tailor make man be one might certainly assert that milliner make bride a regarding bridehood in distinction to girlhood wifehood a being line of plain demarcation between two period of woman life milliner doe do much to make must be hardly bride if trousseau be not there girl married without such appendage must seem to pas into condition of wife without such line of demarcation in moment in find in first fruition of marriage finery becomes bride in other moment when begin to act upon finest of thing a clothes to be packed up becomes wife when subject be discussed griselda displayed lack of becoming interest went to work steadily slowly almost with solemnity a though business in hand be one must be wicked to treat with impatience even struck mother with awe by grandeur of idea depth of theory let be supposed that rushed away at once to consideration of great fabric be to be ultimate sign mark of status quintessence of briding outer veil a be of tabernacle namely wedding dress a great poet work up by degree to inspiration be necessary for grand turning point of epic so did slowly approach hallowed ground on must sit with minister around when about to discus nature extent design colouring structure ornamentation of momentous piece of apparel there be much indeed to be done before came to a poet to whom have already alluded first invokes muse then brings smaller event gradually out upon stage so did miss grantly with sacred fervour ask mother aid then prepare list of article of under clothing must be substratum for visible magnificence of trousseau money be object know what mean frequently understand when word be used that blaze of splendour be to be attained at cheapest possible price in instance money be object amount of money at least a must by possibility be spent on lady clothes independently of jewel with reference to diamond such like archdeacon at once declared intention of taking matter into own hand except in so far a lord dumbello hartletop interest might be pleased to participate in selection be mr grantly sorry for such decision be not imprudent woman must have dreaded responsibility of trusting on occasion among dangerous temptation of jeweller shop a far a silk satin went in matter of french bonnet muslin velvet hat riding habit artificial flower head gilding curious netting enamelled buckle golden tagged bobbin mechanical petticoat a regarded shoe glove corset stocking linen flannel calico money may conscientiously assert be object under circumstance griselda grantly went to work with solemn industry steady perseverance be beyond praise hope will be happy mr arabin said to sister a two be sitting together in dean drawing room oh yes think will why must not said mother oh know of reason be going up into station so much above own in eye of world that one can not feel anxious for must feel much more anxious if be going to marry poor man said mr grantly have always seemed to that griselda be fitted for high position that nature intended for rank state see that be not bit elated take all a if be own by right think that there be danger that head will be turned if mean be thinking rather of heart said mr arabin never must have taken lord dumbello without loving said mr grantly speaking rather quickly be not quite what mean susan be sure must not have accepted have not loved be so hard to keep heart fresh among grandeur of high rank be harder for girl to do so who have not be born to than for one who have enjoyed a birthright quite understand about fresh heart said mr grantly pettishly if doe duty love husband fill position in god have placed with propriety know that need look for anything more at approve of plan of frightening young girl when be making first outset into world must not frighten think must be almost difficult to frighten griselda hope must great matter with girl be whether have be brought up with proper notion a to woman duty of course be not for to boast on subject such a be of course be responsible must own see occasion to wish for change then subject be allowed to drop among of relation who wondered much at girl fortune allowed to say little be grandfather mr harding be old clergyman plain simple in manner not occupying very prominent position seeing that be only precentor to chapter be loved by daughter mr grantly be treated by archdeacon if not invariably with highest respect at least always with consideration regard old plain a be young people at plumstead did not hold in great reverence be poorer than other relative made attempt to hold head high in barsetshire circle moreover in latter day home of heart have be at deanery have indeed lodging of own in city be gradually allowing to be weaned away from have own bedroom in dean house own arm chair in dean library own corner on sofa in mr dean drawing room be not therefore necessary that must interfere greatly in coming marriage still became duty to say word of congratulation to granddaughter perhaps to say word of advice grizzy dear said to always called grizzy endearment of appellation have never be appreciated by young lady come kiss let congratulate on great promotion do so very heartily thank grandpapa said touching forehead with lip thus being a be very sparing with kiss lip now be august reserved for nobler forehead than of old cathedral hack for mr harding still chanted litany from sunday to sunday unceasingly standing at well known desk in cathedral choir griselda have thought in mind that when hartletop people must hear of practice must not be delighted dean archdeacon might be very well if grandfather have even be prebendary might have put up with have thought almost disgraced family in being at age one of working menial clergy of cathedral kissed therefore sparingly resolved that word with must be few be going to be great lady grizzy said umph said what be to say when so addressed hope will be happy make others happy hope will said always think most about latter dear think about happiness of around own will come without thinking understand that do not oh yes understand said a be speaking mr harding still held hand griselda left with unwillingly therefore ungraciously looking a though be dragging from grizzy believe be quite a easy for rich countess to be happy a for dairymaid griselda gave head little chuck be produced by two different operation of mind first be reflection that grandpapa be robbing her of rank be to be rich marchioness second be feeling of anger at old man for comparing lot to of dairymaid quite a easy believe continued though others will tell that be not so with countess a with dairymaid must depend on woman being countess fact alone wo make happy lord dumbello at present be only viscount said griselda there be earl title in family oh did not know said mr harding relinquishing granddaughter hand after that troubled with further advice mr proudie bishop have called at plumstead since mr grantly have come back from london lady from plumstead of course returned visit be natural that grantlys proudies must hate other be essentially church people view on church matter be antagonistic have be compelled to fight for supremacy in diocese family have so conquered other a to have become capable of magnanimity good humour did hate other hatred have at one time almost produced absolute disseverance of even courtesy be so necessary between bishop clergy bitterness of rancour have be overcome lady of family have continued on visiting term now match be almost more than mr proudie must bear great disappointment a well knew grantlys have encountered in matter of proposed new bishopric have for moment mollified have be able to talk of poor dear mr grantly be heartbroken know in matter repetition of such misfortune be hard to bear have be heard to say with complacency have be quite becoming to now that complacency be at end olivia proudie have just accepted widowed preacher at district church in bethnal green man with three child who be dependent on pew rent griselda grantly be engaged to eldest son of marquis of hartletop when woman be enjoined to forgive enemy can not be intended that such wrong a must be included mr proudie courage be nothing daunted may be boasted of that nothing must daunt courage soon after return to barchester olivia olivia being very unwilling have driven over to plumstead not finding grantlys at home have left card now at proper interval mr grantly griselda returned visit be first time miss grantly have be seen by proudie lady since fact of engagement have become known first bevy of compliment passed might be likened to crowd of flower on hedge rosebush be beautiful to eye be so closely environed by thorn that must not be plucked without great danger a long a compliment be allowed to remain on hedge while attempt be made to garner realize fruit for enjoyment did mischief first finger be put forth for such purpose be soon drawn back marked with spot of blood of course be great match for griselda said mr grantly in whisper meekness of must have disarmed enemy whose weapon be le firmly clutched than of mr proudie independently of that connection be one be gratifying in many way oh doubt said mr proudie lord dumbello be so completely own master continued mr grantly slight unintended semi tone of triumph mingled with meekness of whisper be likely to remain so from hear said mr proudie scratched hand be at once drawn back of course estab then mr proudie who be blandly continuing list of congratulation whispered sentence close into ear of mr grantly so that not word of what said might be audible by young people never heard word of said mr grantly gathering up believe oh may be wrong be sure hope so young men will be young men know child will take after parent suppose will see great deal of duke of omnium now mr grantly be not woman to be knocked down trampled on without resistance though have be lacerated by rosebush be not a yet placed altogether hors de combat said word about duke of omnium very tranquilly speaking of merely a barsetshire proprietor then smiling with sweetest smile expressed hope that might soon have pleasure of becoming acquainted with mr tickler a spoke made pretty little bow towards olivia proudie now mr tickler be worthy clergyman attached to district church at bethnal green will be down here in august said olivia boldly determined not to be shamefaced about love affair will be starring about continent by time dear said mr proudie to griselda lord dumbello be well known at homburg em place of sort so will find quite at home be going to rome said griselda majestically suppose mr tickler will come into diocese soon said mr grantly remember hearing very favourably spoken of by mr slope who be friend of nothing short of fixed resolve on part of mr grantly that time have now come in must throw away shield stand behind sword declare war to knife give take quarter must have justified speech a allusion to mr slope acted on mr proudie a red cloth be supposed to act on bull when allusion connected name of mr slope in friendly bracket with of mr proudie future son in law might be certain that effect must be terrific there be more than for very mr slope have once entertained audacious hope hope not thought to be audacious by young lady with reference to miss olivia proudie mr grantly knew knowing still dared to mention name countenance of mr proudie became darkened with black anger polished smile of company manner gave place before outraged feeling of nature man speak of mr grantly said be never known a friend by mr tickler oh indeed said mr grantly perhaps have made mistake be sure have heard mr slope mention when mr slope be running after sister mr grantly be encouraged by a be perhaps saw more of than did mr proudie be never case have reason to know that archdeacon conceived to be so that be very unhappy about now unfortunately be fact mr grantly must not deny archdeacon may have be mistaken about mr slope said a be other people at barchester be think mr proudie who be responsible for bringing here mr grantly at period of engagement might have inflicted fatal wound by referring to poor olivia former love affair be not destitute of generosity even in extremest heat of battle knew how to spare young tender when came here mr grantly little dreamed what depth of wickedness might be found in very close of cathedral city said mr proudie then for dear olivia sake pray bring poor mr tickler to barchester mr tickler mr grantly be man of assured moral of highly religious tone of thinking wish one must be so safe a regard daughter future prospect a be yes know have advantage of being family man said mr grantly getting up good morning mr proudie good day olivia great deal better than blow fell upon empty air for mr grantly have already escaped on to staircase while olivia be ringing bell for servant to attend front door mr grantly a got into carriage smiled slightly thinking of battle a sat down gently pressed daughter hand mr proudie face be still dark a acheron when enemy withdrew with angry tone sent daughter to work mr tickler will have great reason to complain if in position indulge such habit of idleness said therefore conceive that be justified in saying that in encounter mr grantly be conqueror chapter xli don quixote on day on lucy have interview with lady lufton dean dined at framley parsonage robarts have known other since latter have be in diocese now owing to mark preferment in chapter have become almost intimate dean be greatly pleased with manner in poor mr crawley child have be conveyed away from hogglestock be inclined to open heart to whole framley household a still have to ride home must only allow to remain hour after dinner in half hour said great deal about crawley complimented robarts on manner in be playing part of good samaritan then by degree informed that have come to dean ear before left barchester that writ be in hand of certain person in city enabling to seize did not know whether be person property of vicar of framley fact be that tidings have be conveyed to dean with express intent that might put robarts on guard task of speaking on subject to brother clergyman have be so unpleasant to that have be unable to introduce till last five minute before departure hope will not put down a impertinent interference said dean apologizing said mark think that be so sad at heart that hardly knew how to speak of understand much about such matter said dean think if be must go to lawyer must imagine that anything so terribly disagreeable a arrest might be avoided be hard case said mark pleading own cause though men have claim against have never received shilling in money money worth yet name be to bill said dean yes name be to bill certainly be to oblige friend then dean having given advice rode away must not understand how clergyman situated a be mr robarts must find called upon by friendship to attach name to accommodation bill have not power of liquidating when due on evening be wretched enough at parsonage hitherto mark have hoped that perhaps after absolutely hostile step must be taken against with reference to bill unforeseen chance might occur in favour person holding might consent to take small instalment of payment from time to time now seemed that evil day be actually coming upon at blow have no longer secret from wife must go to lawyer if so to what lawyer when have found lawyer what must say to mr robarts at one time suggested that everything must be told to lady lufton mark however must not bring to do that must seem said a though wanted to lend money on following morning mark did ride into barchester dreading however lest must be arrested on journey did see lawyer during absence two call be made at parsonage one by very rough looking individual who left suspicious document in hand of servant purporting to be invitation not to dinner from one of judge of land other call be made by lady lufton in person mr robarts have determined to go down to framley court on day in accordance with usual custom must have be there within hour two of lady lufton return from london thing between be not now a usually have be affair of lucy must make difference let resolve to contrary a might indeed mr robarts have found that closeness of intimacy with framley court have be diminishing from day to day since lucy have first begun to be on friendly term with lord lufton since have be le at framley court than usual have heard from lady lufton le frequently by letter during absence than have done in former year be aware that be le implicitly trusted with affair of parish have not made angry for be in manner conscious that must be so made unhappy what must do must not blame lucy must blame lady lufton lord lufton did blame did so in hearing of one husband mind however be made up to go over bear first brunt of ladyship argument when be stopped by ladyship arrival if be not for terrible matter of lucy love matter on must not now be silent when met there must be twenty subject of pleasant at rate not unpleasant conversation even then there must be terrible bill hanging over conscience almost crushing by weight at moment in lady lufton walked up to drawing room window mr robarts held in hand that ominous invitation from judge must not be well that must make clean breast of disregarding what husband have said might be well only have never yet done anything in opposition to husband wish so hid slip within desk left matter open to consideration interview commenced with affectionate embrace a be matter of course dear fanny dear lady lufton be said between with usual warmth then first inquiry be made about child second about school for minute two mr robarts thought that perhaps nothing be to be said about lucy if pleased lady lufton to be silent at least must not commence subject then there be word two spoken about mr podgens baby after lady lufton asked whether fanny be alone yes said mr robarts mark have gone over to barchester hope will not be long before let see perhaps can call to morrow must come dine to morrow not to morrow think lady lufton mark be sure will go over call why not come to dinner hope there be to be change among eh fanny lady lufton a spoke looked into other face in manner almost made mr robarts get up throw on old friend neck where be to find friend who must give such constant love a have received from lady lufton who be kinder better more honest than change hope not lady lufton a spoke tear stood in eye ah will think there be if will not come to a used to do always used to come dine with day came home a matter of course what must say poor woman to be in confusion yesterday about poor mr crawley dean dined here have be over at hogglestock to see friend have heard of illness will go over see what ought to be done go do hear fanny with young child must never forgive if did then mr robarts explained how lucy have gone there have sent four child back to framley be now staying at hogglestock with object of nursing mr crawley in telling story abstained from praising lucy with strong language must have used have not lucy name character be at present moment of peculiar import to lady lufton nevertheless must not tell without dwelling much on lucy kindness must have be ungenerous to lady lufton to make much of lucy virtue at present moment unjust to lucy to make nothing of be actually with mr crawley now asked lady lufton oh yes mark left there yesterday afternoon four child be here in house not exactly in house be not a yet have arranged sort of quarantine hospital over coach house what where stubbs life yes stubbs wife have come into house child be to remain up there till doctor say that there be danger of infection have not even seen visitor a yet said mr robarts with slight laugh dear said lady lufton declare have be very prompt so miss robarts be over there must have thought mr crawley must have made difficulty about child well did kidnapped be lucy mark did dean gave such account of lucy brought out by two packed in pony carriage then mark drove off at gallop while mr crawley stood calling to in road dean be there at time saw that miss lucy of yours seems to be very determined young lady when take thing into head said lady lufton now sitting down for first time yes be said mr robarts having laid aside pleasant animation for discussion dreaded be now at hand very determined young lady continued lady lufton of course dear fanny know about ludovic sister in law yes have told about be very unfortunate very think lucy have be to blame said mr robarts a spoke blood be already mounting to cheek be too anxious to defend dear before one accuses whenever person doe that look a though cause be weak cause be not weak a far a lucy be concerned feel quite sure that have not be to blame know how obstinate can be fanny when think necessary to dub one champion don quixote be not better knight errant than be be not pity to take up lance shield before enemy be within sight hearing be ever way with don quixotes perhaps there may be enemy in ambush be mr robarts thought to herself did not dare to express so remained silent only hope be continued lady lufton that when back be turned fight a gallantly for ah be never under cloud like poor lucy be not fanny see cloud sun doe not always shine for of down pouring rain heavy wind scatter also fairest flower a have done hers poor girl dear fanny hope may be long before cloud come across brightness of heaven of creature know be one most fitted for quiet continued sunshine then mr robarts did get up embrace friend thus hiding tear be running down face continued sunshine indeed dark spot have already gathered on horizon be likely to fall in very waterspout of rain what be to come of terrible notice be now lying in desk under lady lufton very arm be not come here to croak like old raven continued lady lufton when have brought embrace to end be probable that may have sorrow be quite sure of if endeavour to do duty honestly will find consolation have joy also now dear let say few word about unfortunate affair must not be natural if be to hold tongue to other must suppose not said mr robarts must always be conceiving worse than truth a to other thought now time ago when spoke to about sister in law ludovic daresay remember oh yes remember thought then that there must really be no danger to tell plain truth fancied indeed hoped that affection be engaged elsewhere be altogether wrong then wrong in thinking wrong in hoping mr robarts knew well that lady lufton be alluding to griselda grantly conceived that must be discreet to say nothing on subject at present remembered however lucy flashing eye when possibility of lord lufton making such marriage be spoken of in pony carriage must not feel glad that lady lufton have be disappointed at impute blame to miss robarts for what have occurred since continued ladyship wish distinctly to understand see how one must blame have behaved so nobly be of use inquiring whether one can be sufficient that think be hardly sufficient said mr robarts pertinaciously be not asked ladyship raising eyebrow only think what lucy have done be doing if have chosen to say that must accept son really know how must have justly blamed by mean say must have advised thing be glad of fanny have not given advice be needed know one more able than lucy to see clearly by own judgment what course ought to pursue must be afraid to advise one whose mind be so strong who of own nature be so self denying a be be sacrificing now because will not be mean of bringing trouble dissension between son if ask lady lufton think owe deep debt of gratitude do indeed a for blaming what have done that possibly must blame don quixote on horseback said lady lufton fanny will always call don quixote day other will get somebody to write adventure truth be dear there have be imprudence may call mine if will though really hardly see how be to take blame must not do other than ask miss robarts to house must not very well turn son out of in point of fact have be old story exactly story be a old a world will continue a long a people be born into be story of god own telling dear child mean that young gentleman young lady must fall in love with other directly meet such doctrine must be very inconvenient mean that lord lufton miss grantly did not fall in love with other though meant to do so be not quite a natural that lord lufton lucy must do so instead be generally thought fanny that young lady must not give loose to affection until have be certified of friend approval that young gentleman of fortune may amuse a please know be what world teach can not agree to justice of terrible suffering lucy have to endure make cry out against did not seek son moment began to suspect that there might be danger avoided scrupulously must not go down to framley court though not doing so be remarked by must hardly go out about place lest must meet be contented to put altogether in background till must have pleased to leave place came to here insisted on seeing found when be out declared determined to speak to what be to do did try to escape stopped at door be fault that made offer dear one have said so yes do say so when tell that young lady must not give play to affection without permission persisted in saying to here that pleased though implored to be silent can not tell word used did implore doubt that behaved well persisted begged to accept hand refused then lady lufton not a girl do with mock reserve not intending to be taken at word steadily god forgive untruly knowing what feeling must be knowing what world must say declared to that be indifferent to what more must do in behalf then mr robarts paused will wait till have done fanny spoke of girl giving loose to affection did not do so went about work exactly a have done before did not even speak to of what have passed not then at least determined that must all be a though have never be have learned to love son be misfortune must get over a might tidings came to here that be engaged about to engage to miss grantly tidings be untrue yes know now did not know then of course must not suffer suffered within mr robarts a said remembered pony carriage how puck have be beaten made complaint that have ill treated not even to herself have thought right to reject offer there a far a be concerned be to be end of must be matter of course must suppose be not matter of course lady lufton returned from london to framley on purpose to repeat offer sent for brother talk of young lady waiting for friend approval in matter who must be lucy friend mr robarts of course exactly only friend well lord lufton sent for mark repeated offer to mind mark have never heard word of before may guess whether be surprised lord lufton repeated offer in most formal manner claimed permission to see lucy refused to see have never seen since day when in opposition to effort made way into room mark a think very properly must have allowed lord lufton to come up here looking at age position must have have right to forbid lucy positively refused to see son sent message instead of purport of be now aware that must never accept unless did so at request be very proper message say nothing about have accepted must not have blamed so told lady lufton can not understand saying that fanny well did say so want to argue now about whether be right wrong did say so whatever sanction must give must have have again chose to sacrifice although believe regard with a true love a ever girl felt for man upon word know that be right consideration for world may perhaps be carried too far think that be perfectly right very well lady lufton can understand after such sacrifice on part sacrifice made entirely to how can talk of 'not blaming ' be that language in speak of whose conduct from first to last have be superlatively excellent if be open to blame at be be here mr robarts stopped in defending sister have worked almost into passion state of feeling be not customary to now that have spoken mind sank suddenly into silence seems to fanny that almost regret miss robarts decision said lady lufton wish in matter be for happiness regret anything may mar think nothing then of welfare yet know to whom might have looked for hearty friendship for sympathy in difficulty if not to poor mr robarts be almost upset by few month ago before lucy arrival must have declared that interest of lady lufton family must have be paramount with after next to of own husband even now seemed to argue so black ingratitude on part accusation that be indifferent to from childhood upwards have revered loved lady lufton for year have taught to regard a epitome of be good gracious in woman lady lufton theory of life have be accepted by a right theory whom lady lufton have liked have liked now seemed that idea have taken life to build up be to be thrown to ground because be bound to defend sister in law whom have only known for last eight month be not that regretted word that have spoken on lucy behalf chance have thrown lucy together a lucy be sister must receive from sister treatment did not le feel how terrible must be effect of disseverance from lady lufton oh lady lufton said say that fanny dear must speak a find be talking about cloud just now do think that be not cloud in sky ludovic tell that be attached to miss robarts tell that be attached to be called upon to decide between very act obliges to do so dear lady lufton said mr robarts springing from seat seemed to at moment a though whole difficulty be to be solved by act of grace on part of old friend yet can not approve of such marriage said lady lufton mr robarts returned to seat saying nothing further be not that cloud on one horizon continued ladyship do think that can be basking in sunshine while have weight upon heart a ludovic will soon be home instead of looking to return with pleasure dread must prefer that must remain in norway must wish that must stay away for month fanny be great addition to misfortune to feel that sympathize with having said in slow sorrowful severe tone lady lufton got up took departure of course mr robarts did not let go without assuring that did sympathize with did love her a ever have loved wound can not be cured a easily a may be inflicted lady lufton went way with much real sorrow at heart be proud masterful fond of own way much too careful of worldly dignity to lot have called be woman who must cause sorrow to loved without deep sorrow to herself chapter xlii touching pitch in hot midsummer day end of june beginning of july mr sowerby have uneasy time of at sister instance have hurried up to london there have remained for day in attendance on lawyer have to see new lawyer miss dunstable men of business quiet old cautious gentleman whose place of business be in dark alley behind bank messrs slow bideawhile by name who have scruple in detaining for hour while clerk talked to about anything about nothing be of vital consequence to mr sowerby that business of must be settled without delay yet men to whose care settling be now confided went on a though law process be sunny bank on delighted men to bask easily then too have to go more than once to south audley street be worse infliction for men in south audley street be le civil now than have be wont be well understood there that mr sowerby be no longer client of duke opponent no longer nominee dependant enemy in county chaldicotes a old mr gumption remarked to young mr gagebee chaldicotes gagebee be cooked goose a far a sowerby be concerned what difference must make to whether duke be to own miss dunstable for part can not understand how gentleman like sowerby can like to see property go into hand of gallipot wench whose money still smell of bad drug nothing can be more ungrateful said than sowerby conduct have held county for five twenty year without expense now that time for payment have come begrudges price called better than cheating did not mr gumption according to idea sowerby be attempting to cheat duke may be imagined therefore mr sowerby did not feel very great delight in attending at south audley street then rumour be spread about among bill discounting leech that blood be once more to be sucked from sowerby carcase rich miss dunstable have taken up affair so much a became known in purlieu of goat compass tom tozer brother declared that sowerby be going to make match of that scrap of paper with sowerby name on must become worth weight in bank note tom tozer tom who be real hero of family pooh poohed at screwing up nose alluding in most contemptuous term to brother softness knew better a be indeed fact miss dunstable be buying up squire by jingo must buy up tozers a well a others knew value tozers did whereupon became more than ordinarily active from brother mr sowerby at time endeavoured to keep distance endeavour be not altogether effectual whenever must escape for day two from lawyer ran down to chaldicotes tom tozer in perseverance followed there boldly sent in name by servant at front door mr sowerby be not just at home at present moment said well trained domestic will wait about then said tom seating on heraldic stone griffin flanked big stone step before house in way mr tozer gained purpose sowerby be still contesting county behoved not to let enemy say that be hiding have be part of bargain with miss dunstable that must contest county have taken into head that duke have behaved badly have resolved that must be made to pay for duke said have meddled long enough must now see whether chaldicotes interest must not suffice of to return member for county even in opposition to duke mr sowerby be so harassed at time that must have given way on point if have have power miss dunstable be determined be obliged to yield to in manner mr tom tozer succeeded did make way into mr sowerby presence of intrusion one effect be following letter from mr sowerby to friend mark robarts chaldicotes july dear robarts be so harassed at present moment by infinity of trouble of own be almost callous to of other people say that prosperity make man selfish have never tried that be quite sure that adversity doe so nevertheless be anxious about bill of

further annoyance about that kite tom tozer have just be with insists that of will be paid know one better consideration be given for latter know also that dealing be not with even with brother will be prepared to swear that gave value for must swear anything for five hundred pound for money for matter think that father of mischief ever let loose upon world greater rascal than tom tozer declares that nothing will induce to take one shilling le than whole sum of nine hundred pound have be brought to by hearing that debt be about to be paid heaven help meaning of be that wretched acre be now mortgaged to one millionnaire be to change hand be mortgaged to instead by exchange may possibly obtain benefit of having house to live in for next twelve month other tozer however be altogether wrong in scent worst of be that malice will fall on rather than on what want to do be let pay one hundred pound between though sell last sorry jade of horse have will make up fifty know can at rate do a much a then do accept bill conjointly with for eight hundred will be done in forrest presence handed to will receive back two old bill into own hand at same time new bill must be timed to run ninety

idea that be part of sum covered by existing mortgage what said other day at barchester a to never executing bill be very well a regard future transaction nothing can be wiser than resolution must be folly worse than folly if be to allow furniture to be seized when mean of preventing be so ready to hand by leaving new bill in forrest hand may be sure that be safe from claw of such bird of prey a tozers even if can not get settled when three month be over forrest will enable to make arrangement may be most convenient for heaven sake dear fellow refuse can hardly conceive how weighs upon fear that bailiff must make way into wife drawing room know think ill of wonder at must be le inclined to do so if knew how terribly be punished pray let hear that will do a counsel yours always faithfully n sowerby in answer to parson wrote very short reply framley july dear sowerby will sign more bill on consideration yours truly mark robarts then having written having shown to wife returned to shrubbery walk paced up down looking now then to sowerby letter a thought over past circumstance of friendship with gentleman that man who have written letter must be friend very fact be disgrace to sowerby so well knew own reputation that did not dare to suppose that own word must be taken for anything not even when thing promised be act of commonest honesty old bill will be given back into own hand have declared with energy knowing that friend correspondent must not feel secure against further fraud under le stringent guarantee gentleman county member owner of chaldicotes with whom mark robarts have be so anxious to be on term of intimacy have now come to such phase of life that have given over speaking of a honest man have become so used to suspicion that argued of a of thing of course knew that one must trust spoken written word be content to speak to write without attempt to hide conviction be man whom have be so glad to call friend for whose sake have be willing to quarrel with lady lufton at whose instance have unconsciously abandoned so many of best resolution of life looked back now a walked there slowly still holding letter in hand to day when have stopped at school house written letter to mr sowerby promising to join party at chaldicotes have be so eager then to have own way that must not permit to go home talk matter over with wife thought also of manner in have be tempted to house of duke of omnium conviction on mind at time that giving way to temptation must surely bring to evil then remembered evening in sowerby bedroom when bill have be brought out have allowed to be persuaded to put name upon not because be willing in way to assist friend because be unable to refuse have lacked courage to say though knew at time how gross be error be committing have lacked courage to say hence have come upon on household misery cause for bitter repentance have written much of clergyman in doing so have endeavoured to portray a bear on social life rather than to describe mode working of professional career have done latter must hardly have steered clear of subject on have not be intention to pronounce opinion must either have laden fiction with sermon must have degraded sermon into fiction therefore have said little in narrative of man feeling doings a clergyman must protest against being on account considered that mr robarts be indifferent to duty of clerical position have be fond of pleasure have given way to temptation a be so customarily done by young men of six twenty who be placed beyond control who have mean at command have remained a curate till age subject in movement to eye of superior must may say have put name to bill have ridden after hound have seen nothing of iniquity of gatherum castle there be men of twenty six a fit to stand alone a ever will be fit to be prime minister head of school judge on bench almost fit to be bishop mark robarts have not be one of have within many aptitude for good not strengthened courage of man to act up to stuff of manhood be to be formed have be slow of growth a be with many men consequently when temptation be offered to have fallen deeply grieved over own stumbling from time to time a period of penitence came upon resolved that must once more put shoulder to wheel a became one who fight upon earth battle for have put on armour over over again did think of word of mr crawley now a walked up down path crumpling mr sowerby letter in hand thought of again be terrible falling off terrible in fall doubly terrible through difficulty of returning yes be difficulty multiplies in fearful ratio a one go on pleasantly running down path whitherward have come to with that must not return that must never again hold up head with safe conscience a pastor of parish be sowerby who have led into misery who have brought on ruin then have not sowerby paid have not that stall now held in barchester be sowerby gift be poor man now distressed poverty stricken man nevertheless wished with heart that have never become sharer in good thing of barchester chapter will resign stall said to wife night think may say have made up mind a to mark will not people say that be odd can not help must say fanny fear that will have to bear saying of harder word than nobody can ever say that have done anything be unjust dishonourable if there be such men a mr sowerby blackness of fault will not excuse mine then again sat silent hiding eye while wife sitting by held hand make yourself wretched mark matter will come right can not be that loss of few hundred pound must ruin be not money be not money have done nothing wrong mark how be to go into church take place before when one will know that bailiff be in house then dropping head on to table sobbed aloud mark robarts mistake have be mainly have thought to touch pitch not to be defiled looking out from pleasant parsonage into pleasant upper rank of world around have seen that men thing in quarter be very engaging own parsonage with sweet wife be exceedingly dear to lady lufton affectionate friendship have value be not thing rather dull for one who have lived in best set at harrow oxford unless indeed must supplement with occasional burst of more lively life cake ale be a pleasant to palate a to palate of with whom have formerly lived at college have same eye to look at horse same heart to make go across country a then too found that men liked men woman also men woman who be high in worldly standing as ear be tickled learned to fancy that be intended by nature for society of high people seemed a though be following appointed course in meeting men woman of world at house of fashionable rich be not first clergyman have so lived have so prospered yes clergyman have so lived have done duty in sphere of life altogether to satisfaction of countryman of sovereign thus mark robarts have determined that must touch pitch escape defilement if be possible with what result who have read so far will have perceived late on following afternoon who must drive up to parsonage door mr forrest bank manager from barchester mr forrest to whom sowerby have always pointed a deus ex machina who if duly invoked must relieve from present trouble dismiss whole tozer family not howling into wilderness a one must have wished to do with brood of tozers so gorged with prey that from further annoyance need be dreaded mr forrest must do nay more most willingly must do only let mark robarts put into banker hand blandly sign what document banker might desire be very unpleasant affair said mr forrest a soon a be closeted together in mark book room in answer to observation parson acknowledged that be very unpleasant affair mr sowerby have managed to put into hand of about worst set of rogue now existing in line of business in london so supposed curling told same curling be barchester attorney whose aid have lately invoked curling have threatened that will expose whole trade one of who be down here man named tozer replied that have much more to lose by exposure than have went further declared that must defy jury in england to refuse money swore that discounted bill in regular way of business though be of course false fear that will be impossible to prove so well know that be clergyman that therefore have stronger hold on than on other men disgrace will fall on sowerby said robarts hardly actuated at moment by strong feeling of christian forgiveness fear mr robarts that be somewhat in condition of tozers will not feel a will do must bear mr forrest a best may will allow mr robarts to give advice perhaps ought to apologize for intruding upon a bill have be presented dishonoured across counter have of necessity become acquainted with circumstance be sure be very much obliged to said mark must pay money at rate most considerable portion of whole of indeed with such deduction a lawyer may be able to induce hawk to make on sight of ready money perhaps l l may see clear of whole affair have not quarter of sum lying by suppose not what must recommend be that must borrow money from bank on own responsibility with joint security of friend who may be willing to assist with name lord lufton probably must do mr forrest listen to first before make up mind if took step of course must do so with fixed intention of paying money without further reliance on sowerby on one else will not rely on mr sowerby again may be sure of what mean be that must teach to recognize debt a own if can do with income can surely pay with interest in two year if lord lufton will assist with name will so arrange bill that payment will be made to fall equally over period in way world will know nothing about in two year time will once more be free man many men mr robarts have bought experience much dearer than can assure mr forrest be quite out of question mean that lord lufton will not give name certainly will not ask be not in first place income will not be what think for will probably give up prebend at barchester give up prebend give up six hundred year beyond think may say that nothing will tempt to put name to bill have learned lesson hope may never forget then what do intend to hing then men will sell stick of furniture about place know that property here be enough to secure that claim if have power must sell world will know fact so must be of fault man commits must bear punishment if be only be where be mr robarts think what wife will have to suffer in going through such misery a that have better take advice lord lufton be sure very name of lord lufton sister lover again gave courage thought too of accusation lord lufton have brought against on night when have come to in coffee room of hotel felt that be impossible that must apply to for such aid must be better to tell to lady lufton that must relieve let cost to herself be what might be very sure only that in looking to for assistance must be forced to bite dust in very deed thank mr forrest have made up mind think that be le obliged to for disinterested kindness for know that be disinterested think may confidently say that not even to avert so terrible calamity will again put name to bill even if must take own promise to pay without addition of second name must not do there be nothing for mr forrest to do under such circumstance simply to drive back to barchester have done best for young clergyman according to light perhaps in worldly view advice have not be bad mark dreaded very name of bill be a dog have be terribly scorched nothing must again induce to go near fire be not that man from bank said fanny coming into room when sound of wheel have died away yes mr forrest well dearest must prepare for worst will not sign more paper eh mark have just now positively refused to do so then can bear anything dearest dearest mark will not let tell lady lufton let look at matter in way punishment be very heavy chapter xliii be not insignificant now month went by at framley without increase of comfort to friend there also without absolute development of ruin have be daily expected at parsonage sundry letter have reached mr robarts from various personage acting in tozer interest of referred to mr curling of barchester of letter contained prayer for money pointing out how innocent widow lady have be induced to invest on faith of mr robarts name be now starving in garret with three child because mr robarts must not make good own undertaking majority of be filled with threat only two day longer must be allowed then sheriff officer must be enjoined to do work then one day of grace must be added at expiration of dog of war must be unloosed a fast a came be sent to mr curling who took notice of individually continued endeavour to prevent evil day second bill mr robarts must take up such be mr curling proposition must pay by two instalment of l first in two month second in four if be acceptable to tozer interest well if be not sheriff officer must do worst tozer interest must look for what must get tozer interest must not declare satisfied with term so matter went on during rose faded from day to day on cheek of mr robarts a under such circumstance may easily be conceived in meantime lucy still remained at hogglestock have there become absolute mistress of house poor mr crawley have be at death door for day be delirious afterwards remained so weak a to be almost unconscious now worst be over mr crawley have be informed that a far a human judgment might pronounce child must not become orphan must become widower during week lucy have not once be home have seen of framley people why must incur risk of conveying infection for so small object a argued writing by letter be duly fumigated before be opened at parsonage so remained at hogglestock crawley child now admitted to honour of nursery be kept at framley be kept at framley although be expected from day to day that bed on lay must be seized for payment of mr sowerby debt a have said became mistress of house at hogglestock made absolutely ascendant over mr crawley jelly fruit even butter came from lufton court displayed on table absolutely on cloth before yet bore can not say that partook of delicacy with freedom did drink tea when be given to although contained framley cream have known bohea from framley chest in truth in day have given over to dominion of stranger said nothing beyond well well with two uplifted hand when came upon a be sewing button on to own shirt sewing on button perhaps occasionally applying needle elsewhere not without utility said to at period very little in way of thanks protracted conversation did have now again during long evening even in did not utter many word a to present state of life be on religion chiefly that spoke not lecturing individually laying down idea a to what life of christian must be especially what must be life of minister though can see miss robarts said be bound to say that one have fallen off so frequently a have renounced devil work be by

treaty what if have be successful after prize have be other than have expected be sometimes prone to think that prize be not exactly that have once hoped griselda looked very thing that lady lufton wanted for queen how must queen reign who trusted only to look in respect be perhaps well for destiny have interposed griselda be driven to admit be better suited to lord dumbello than to son still

shocking unnatural doubt grievous to excellent ecclesiastical heart cluster so thickly in quarter first of have reference to new prebendary to disgrace have brought on chapter disgrace a of boasted barchester have never known before however like most other boast be hardly true for within very few year there have be execution in house of late prebendary old dr stanhope on occasion doctor have be forced to fly away to italy starting in night lest also must fall into hand of philistine a well a chair table be scandalous shame said mr proudie speaking not of old doctor of new offender scandalous shame must only serve right if gown be stripped from back suppose living will be sequestrated said young minor canon who attended much to ecclesiastical injunction of lady of diocese be deservedly

doubt more spirit poetry be displayed there than in house of le gifted clergy show manner in misfortune of mr robarts be generally discussed indeed have deserved better treatment at hand name did not run gauntlet for usual nine day indeed did fame endure at height for more than two sudden fall be occasioned by other tidings of still more distressing nature by rumour so affected mr proudie that caused a said blood to creep be very careful that blood of others must creep also if blood of others be equally sensitive be said that lord dumbello have jilted miss grantly from what adverse spot in world cruel tidings fell upon barchester have never be able to discover know how quickly rumour fly making common through city mr proudie must have known more of fact connected with hartletop family than one else in barchester be not surprising seeing that be so much more conversant with great world in such people lived knew be therefore correct enough in declaring that lord dumbello have already jilted one other young lady lady julia mac mull to whom have be engaged three season back that therefore character in such matter be not to be trusted that lady julia have be terrible flirt greatly given to waltzing with certain german count with whom have since gone off that suppose mr proudie did not know much a be conversant with great world seeing that said nothing about to of ecclesiastical listener on present occasion will be terrible warning mr quiverful to most useful warning to not to trust to thing of world fear made inquiry about young nobleman before agreed that name must be linked with of daughter said to wife of present warden of hiram hospital lady who have received favour from be therefore bound to listen attentively to voice hope may not be true said mr quiverful who in spite of allegiance due by to mr proudie have reason of own for wishing well to grantly family hope so indeed said mr proudie with slight tinge of anger in voice fear that there be doubt must confess that be more than have right to expect hope that may be taken by of a lesson ensample teaching of lord mercy wish must request husband from mr quiverful to dwell on subject in morning evening lecture at hospital on sabbath next showing how false be trust put in good thing of world behest to certain extent mr quiverful did obey feeling that quiet life in barchester be of great value to did

by archdeacon wife dean heard disregarded a did also dean wife at first who generally sided with grantlys in diocesan battle pooh poohed tidings saying to other that archdeacon mr grantly be very well able to take care of own affair dripping water hollow stone at last be admitted on side that there be ground for fear on side except at plumstead be sure there be nothing in really be sure of said mr arabin whispering to sister after turning over in mind thought right to tell yet know now be wrong quite right dearest eleanor said mr grantly be much obliged to understand know come of course like other christian blessing from palace then there be nothing more said about between mr grantly sister on following morning there arrived letter by post addressed to mr grantly bearing postmark of littlebath letter ran madam be known to writer lord dumbello have arranged with certain friend how may escape from present engagement think therefore that be duty a christian to warn of yours truly wellwisher now have happened that embryo mr tickler most intimate bosom friend confidante be known at plumstead to live at littlebath have also happened most unfortunately that embryo mr tickler in warmth of neighbourly regard have written friendly line to friend griselda grantly congratulating with female sincerity on splendid nuptials with lord dumbello be not natural hand said mr grantly talking matter over with husband may be sure have come from be part of new christianity learn day by day from palace teaching thing have effect on archdeacon mind have learned lately story of lady julia mac mull be not sure that son in law a ought to be about to be have be entirely blameless in matter then in day lord dumbello made great sign immediately on griselda return to plumstead have sent magnificent present of emerald however have come to direct from jeweller might have be probably be ordered by man of business since that have come sent written griselda did not seem to be in way annoyed by absence of usual sign of love went on steadily with great duty nothing a told mother have be said about writing therefore did not expect archdeacon be not quite at ease keep dumbello up to p q know friend of have whispered to at club by heaven yes archdeacon be not man to bear with indifference wrong in such quarter in spite of clerical profession few men be more inclined to fight against personal wrong few men more able can there be anything wrong wonder said to wife be worth while must go up to london mr grantly attributed to palace doctrine what must be more natural looking at circumstance of tickler engagement therefore gave voice against step being taken by archdeacon day two after mr proudie met mr arabin in close condoled with openly on termination of marriage treaty quite openly for mr tickler a be to be be with mother mr arabin be accompanied by sister in law mary bold must be very grievous to mr grantly very grievous indeed said mr proudie sincerely feel for mr arabin lesson be sent to for eternal welfare of course said mr arabin a to special lesson be inclined to doubt that ah h fear be too true fear there be room for doubt of course be aware that lord dumbello be off for continent mr arabin be not aware of be obliged to admit a much started four day ago by way of boulogne said mr tickler who seemed to be very well up in whole affair be so sorry for poor dear griselda be told have got thing be such pity know why must not lord dumbello come back from continent said miss bold very quietly why not indeed be sure hope may said mr proudie doubt will day if be such man a say be be really well for griselda that must be relieved from such marriage for after mr arabin what be thing of world dust beneath foot ash between teeth grass cut for oven vanity vexation nothing more well pleased with variety of christian metaphor mr proudie walked on still muttering however something about worm grub by intended to signify own specie dumbello grantly sect of in particular now have gone so far that mr arabin conceived bound in duty to see sister be then settled in consultation at plumstead that archdeacon must call officially at palace beg that rumour might be contradicted did early on next morning be shown into bishop study in found lordship mr proudie bishop rose to greet with special civility smiling very sweetest on a though of clergy archdeacon be favourite mr proudie wore something of gloomy aspect a though knew that visit at hour must have reference to special business morning call made by archdeacon at palace in way of ordinary civility be not numerous on present occasion dashed at once into subject have called morning mr proudie said because wish to ask favour from whereupon mr proudie bowed mr proudie will be most happy be sure said bishop find that foolish people have be talking in barchester about daughter said archdeacon wish to ask proudie most woman under such circumstance must have felt awkwardness of situation must have prepared to eat past word with wry face not so mr proudie mr grantly have have imprudence to throw mr slope in face there in own drawing room be resolved to be revenged mr grantly too have ridiculed tickler match too great niceness must now prevent mr proudie from speaking mind about dumbello match great many people be talking about be sorry to say said mr proudie poor dear be not fault might have happened to girl only perhaps little more care will excuse dr grantly have come here to allude to report have be spread about in barchester that match between lord dumbello daughter have be broken off everybody in barchester know believe said mr proudie continued archdeacon to request that report may be contradicted contradicted why have gone right away out of country never mind where have gone to mr proudie beg that report may be contradicted will have to go round to house in barchester then said by mean replied archdeacon perhaps may be right must explain to bishop came here because bishop know nothing about said mr proudie nothing in world said lordship be sure hope that young lady may not be disappointed because matter be so distinctly mentioned to mr arabin by yesterday distinctly mentioned of course be distinctly mentioned there be thing ca be kept under bushel dr grantly seems to be one of going about in way wo make lord dumbello marry young lady be true must make mr proudie hold tongue perhaps archdeacon be wrong in present errand so now began to bethink at rate said when tell that there be ground whatever for such report will do kindness to say that a far a be concerned will go further think lord be not asking too much in asking that bishop know nothing about said mr proudie again nothing at said bishop a must protest that believe information have reached on head said mr proudie see how be possible must contradict can easily understand feeling dr grantly considering daughter position match be a regard earthly wealth very great one wonder that must be grieved at being broken off trust that sorrow may eventuate in blessing to to miss griselda worldly disappointment be precious balm trust know how to accept a such fact be that dr grantly have done altogether wrong in coming to palace wife might have chance with mr proudie have none since have come to barchester have have only two three encounter with in of have gone to wall visit to palace always resulted in leaving presence of inhabitant in frame of mind by mean desirable now found that have to do so once again must not compel mr proudie to say that report be untrue must condescend to make counter hit at about own daughter a wife must have done thus having utterly failed got up took leave worst of matter be that in going home must not divest mind of idea that there might be truth in report what if lord dumbello have gone to continent resolved to send back from thence reason why be impossible that must make miss grantly wife such thing have be done before now by men in rank whether mr tickler have be letter writing wellwisher from littlebath have induced friend to be so did seem manifest to dr grantly that mr proudie absolutely believed report promulgated so diligently wish might be father to thought no doubt that thought be truly there dr grantly must not induce to disbelieve wife be le credulous to certain degree comforted that evening received letter greatly confirmed suspicion set on foot by mr proudie even shook wife faith in lord dumbello be from mere acquaintance who in ordinary course of thing must not have written to bulk of letter referred to ordinary thing a to gentleman in question must hardly have thought of giving trouble to write letter at end of note said of course be aware that dumbello be off to paris have not heard whether exact day of return be fixed be true then said archdeacon striking library table with hand becoming absolutely white about mouth jaw can not be said mr grantly even be now trembling if be so will drag back to england by collar of coat disgrace before step of father hall archdeacon a uttered threat looked character a irate british father much better than did other character a clergyman of church of england archdeacon have be greatly worsted by mr proudie be man who knew how to fight battle among men sometimes without too close regard to cloth have lord dumbello intended such thing must have written got friend to write by time said mr grantly be quite possible that might wish to be off must be too chary of name not to endeavour to do so with decency thus matter be discussed appeared to to be so serious that archdeacon resolved to go at once to london that lord dumbello have gone to france did not doubt must find one in town acquainted with young man intention must doubt be able to hear when return be expected if there be real reason for apprehension must follow runagate to continent must not do without absolute knowledge according to lord dumbello present engagement be bound to present in august next at plumstead episcopi with view of then there taking griselda grantly in marriage if kept word in respect one have right to quarrel with for going to paris in meantime most expectant bridegroom must doubt under such circumstance have declared intention to future bride if lord dumbello be different from others who have right on account to be indignant with be unlike other men in other thing especially unlike other men in being eldest son of marquis of hartletop must be very well for tickler to proclaim whereabouts from week to week eldest son of marquis might find inconvenient to be so precise nevertheless archdeacon thought only prudent to go up to london susan said archdeacon to wife just a be starting at moment neither of be in happiest spirit think must say word of caution to griselda do feel so much doubt about a said mr grantly even did not dare to put direct negative to proposal so much have be moved by what have heard think must do so not frightening more than must help will lessen blow if be that blow be to fall will kill said mr grantly think that will be able to bear on next morning mr grantly with much cunning preparation went about task husband have left to perform took long to do for be very cunning in doing of at last dropped from in word that there be possibility bare possibility that disappointment might even yet be in store for do mean mamma that marriage will be put off mean to say that think will god forbid be just possible daresay be very wrong to tell of know that have sense enough to bear have gone to london will hear from soon then mamma have better give order not to go on with marking chapter xlvi lady lufton request bailiff on day have meal regular beer state of thing together with absence of duty in way of making inventory like take to be earthly paradise of bailiff on next morning walked off with civil speech many apology a to intrusion be very sorry said to have troubled gen'leman a be gen'leman in way of business what must do to one of added remark that business be business statement be not prepared to contradict must recommend men in choosing profession to avoid may require apology at turn apology else somewhat violent assertion of right younger male reader may perhaps reply that have thought of becoming sheriff officer then be there not other cognate line of life to perhaps attention of such may be attracted on evening of day on went mark received note from lady lufton begging to call early on following morning immediately after breakfast went across to framley court may be imagined that be not in very happy frame of mind felt truth of wife remark that first plunge into cold water be always worst lady lufton be not woman who must continually throw disgrace into teeth however terribly cold might be first word with spoke of strove hard a entered room to carry usual look bearing to put out hand to greet with customary freedom knew that failed may be said that good man who have broken down in goodness can carry disgrace of fall without look of shame when man be able to do that cease to be in way good have be distressing affair said lady lufton after first salutation yes indeed said have be very sad for poor fanny well must have little period of grief may perhaps be fortunate if none of have worse than will not complain be sure complain be sure will not now have got to say mr robarts be hope lufton have have enough to do with black sheep to last life for must protest that late friend mr sowerby be black sheep in possible way must lady lufton have alluded to matter with greater kindness than in thus joining mark name with of son took away bitterness of rebuke made subject one on even might have spoken without difficulty now seeing that be so gentle to must not lean more hardly on have be very foolish said very foolish very wrong very wicked very foolish believe mr robarts to speak frankly once for a also believe nothing worse thought best for of that must just have one word about now recommend that matter be never mentioned between again god bless lady lufton said think man ever have such friend a be have be very quiet during interview almost subdued not speaking with animation be usual to for affair with mr robarts be not only one have to complete day perhaps one most difficult of completion cheered up little under praise now bestowed on for be sort of praise loved best did hope perhaps flatter that be good friend must be good enough then to gratify friendship by coming up to dinner evening fanny too of course can not take excuse for matter be completely arranged have particular reason for wishing last violent injunction have be added because lady lufton have seen refusal rising in parson face poor lady lufton enemy for even have enemy used to declare of that invitation to dinner be only method of showing of good humour be cognizant let ask of enemy whether be not a good method a other known to be extant under such order a obedience be of course necessity promised that with wife must come across to dinner then when went away lady lufton ordered carriage during doings at framley lucy robarts still remained at

crawley have be complaining again about cream in tea mr crawley have on one occasion stated assured conviction that surreptitious daily supply be being brought into house because have detected presence of cream instead of milk in own cup a however cream have be going for sundry day before miss robarts have not thought much of ingenuity in making discovery ah know how speaks of when back be turned how doe speak of know must not have courage to tell whole have not for must think absurd coming from one who look like say that if be to write poem about womanhood must make heroine with cream

so have be can almost feel in heart to be glad have be ill seeing have have for friend might have have good fortune without fever must not in married life have made friend till illness brought to must

will make keep promise too will come also if like will come whether like wo hear word about old dress old dress will wear a well at framley a at hogglestock from will appear that mr crawley lucy robarts have become very intimate during period of nursing a two woman always will at least must do when shut up for week together in same sick room conversation be still going on between when sound of wheel be heard upon road be highway passed before house carriage of sort be not frequent there be fanny be sure said lucy rising from chair there be two horse said mr crawley distinguishing noise with accurate sense of hearing be always attached to sickness be not noise of pony carriage be regular carriage said lucy speaking from window stopping here be somebody from framley court for know servant a spoke blush came to forehead might not be lord lufton thought to herself forgetting at moment that lord lufton did not go about country in close chariot with fat footman intimate a have become with mr crawley have said nothing to new friend on subject of love affair carriage stopped down came footman nobody spoke to from inside have probably brought something from framley said lucy having cream such like matter in mind for cream such like matter have come from framley court more than once during sojourn there carriage probably happened to be coming way mystery soon elucidated partially perhaps became more mysterious in way red armed little girl who have be taken away by frightened mother in first burst of fever have now returned to place at present moment entered room with awestruck face declaring that miss robarts be to go at once to big lady in carriage suppose be lady lufton said mr crawley lucy heart be so absolutely in mouth that kind of speech be at moment impossible to why must lady lufton have come thither to hogglestock why must want to see lucy robarts in carriage have not everything between be settled yet lucy in moment for thought be allowed to must not determine what might be probable upshot of such interview chief feeling be desire to postpone for present instant red armed little girl must not allow that be to come at once said then lucy without having spoken word got up left room walked downstairs along little passage out through small garden with firm step hardly knowing whither went why presence of mind self possession have deserted knew that be unable to speak a must do felt that must have to regret present behaviour yet must not help why must lady lufton have come to there went on big footman stood with carriage door open stepped up almost unconsciously without knowing how got there found seated by lady lufton to tell truth ladyship also be little at loss to know how be to carry through present plan of operation duty of beginning however be clearly with therefore having taken lucy by hand spoke miss robarts said son have come home know whether be aware of spoke with low gentle voice not quite like lucy be much too confused to notice be not aware of said lucy have however be so informed in fanny letter have gone out of head yes have come back have be in norway know fishing yes said lucy be sure will remember took place when came to not long ago in little room upstairs at framley court in answer to lucy quivering in nerve wrongly thinking that be visibly shaking in limb timidly answered that did remember why be that have then be so bold now be so poor coward well dear said to then said to thinking that be for best at rate will not be angry with for loving own son better than love one else oh said lucy be best of son best of men be sure that will be best of husband lucy have idea by instinct however rather than by sight lady lufton eye be full of tear a spoke a for herself be altogether blinded did not dare to lift face to turn head a for utterance of sound be quite out of question now have come here lucy to ask to be wife be quite sure that heard word came plainly to ear leaving on brain proper sense yet must not move make sign that have understood seemed a though must be ungenerous in to take advantage of such conduct to accept offer made with so much self sacrifice have not time at first moment to think even of happiness let alone own thought only of magnitude of concession have be made to when have constituted lady lufton arbiter of destiny have regarded question of love a decided against have found unable to endure position of being lady lufton daughter in law while lady lufton must be scorning therefore have given up game have given up game sacrificing a far a might be sacrifice sacrificing also have be resolute to stand to word in respect have never allowed to think possible that lady lufton must comply with condition lucy have laid upon yet such be case a so plainly heard now have come here lucy to ask to be wife how long sat together silent can not say counted by minute time must not probably have amounted to many to of duration seemed considerable lady lufton while be speaking have contrived to get hold of lucy hand sat still holding trying to look into lucy face however must hardly see so much be turned away indeed be lady lufton eye perfectly dry answer came to question therefore after while be necessary that must speak again must go back to lucy tell that there be other objection something besides stern old mother hindrance perhaps not so easily overcome said lucy be at moment must say what will tell then will say yes simply yes simply yes said lucy a to stern old mother who thought only son too precious to be parted with at first word be nothing to be said to oh lady lufton forgiveness to be spoken sign of affection to be given be always to be regarded a stern cross vexatious disagreeable lucy slowly turned round head looked up into companion face though have a yet voice to speak of affection must fill eye with love in way make to future mother promise be needed lucy dearest lucy must be very dear to now then be in other arm kissing other lady lufton now desired coachman to drive up down for little space along road while completed necessary conversation with lucy wanted at first to carry back to framley that evening promising to send again to mr crawley on following morning till permanent arrangement must be made by lady lufton intended substitution of regular nurse for future daughter in law seeing lucy robarts be now invested in eye with attribute made unbecoming that must sit in attendance at mr crawley bedside lucy must not go back to framley on evening on next morning must be so glad if fanny must come to there then must arrange about going home lucy dear what be to say to ludovic perhaps must feel awkward if be to come to see here oh yes lady lufton pray tell not to do be that be to tell tell tell wo want to tell anything only must like to be quiet for day lady lufton well dearest will be quiet day after to morrow then mind must not spare longer because will be right that must be at home now must think very hard if be to be so near be not to be allowed to look at there will be one else who will want to see will want to have very near to for will be wretched lucy if can not teach to love in answer to lucy did find voice enough to make sundry promise then be put out of carriage at little wicket gate lady lufton be driven back to framley wonder whether servant when held door for miss robarts be conscious that be waiting on future mistress fancy that be for sort of people always know everything peculiar courtesy of demeanour a let down carriage step be very observable lucy felt almost beside a returned not knowing what to do how to look with what word to speak behoved to go at once to mr crawley room yet longed to be alone knew that be quite unable to conceal thought express did wish at present moment to talk to one about happiness seeing that must not at present moment talk to fanny robarts went however without delay into mr crawley room with little eager way of speaking quickly be so common with people who know that be confused said that feared have be very long time away be lady lufton yes be lady lufton why lucy did not know that ladyship be such friend have something particular wanted to say said lucy avoiding question avoiding also mr crawley eye then sate down in usual chair be nothing unpleasant hope nothing at unpleasant nothing of kind oh mr crawley will tell other time pray ask now then got up escaped for be absolutely necessary that must be alone when reached own room that in child usually slept made great effort to compose not altogether successfully got out paper blotting book intending a said to herself to write to fanny knowing however that letter when written must be destroyed be not able even to form word hand be unsteady eye be dim thought be incapable of being fixed must only sit think wonder hope occasionally wiping tear from eye asking why present frame of mind be so painful to during last two three month have felt fear of lord lufton have always carried before on equal term have be signally capable of doing so when made declaration to at parsonage now looked forward with undefined dread to first moment in must see then thought of certain evening have passed at framley court acknowledged to herself that there be pleasure in looking back to griselda grantly have be there constitutional power of two family have be at work to render easy process of love making between lord lufton lucy have seen understood without knowing that understood have in certain degree suffered from beholding have placed apart not complaining painfully conscious of inferiority at same time almost boasting to herself that in own way be superior then have come behind chair whispering to speaking to first word of kindness good nature have resolved that must be friend friend even though griselda grantly might be wife what resolution be worth have soon become manifest to have soon confessed to herself result of friendship have determined to bear punishment with courage now sate so for about hour must fain have so sat out day a must not be got up having washed face eye returned to mr crawley room there found mr crawley also to great joy for knew that while be there question must be asked of be always very gentle to treating with old fashioned polished respect except when compelled on one occasion by sense of duty to accuse of mendacity respecting purveying of victual have never become absolutely familiar with a wife have done be well for now that have not done so for must not have talked about lady lufton in evening when three be present did manage to say that expected mr robarts must come over on following day will part with miss robarts with deepest regret said mr crawley must not on account keep longer mr crawley can do without now what must have done have not come to be at loss to think did not say must go said lucy will said mr crawley yes dear will know that be proper now that must return nay will not have longer poor dear child too may return how be to thank mr robarts for what have done for be settled that if mr robarts came on following day lucy must go back with then during long watch of night for on last night lucy must not leave bed side of new friend till long after dawn have broken did tell mr crawley what be to be destiny in life to herself there seemed nothing strange in new position to mr crawley be wonderful that poor a be must have embryo peeress at bedside handing cup to drink smoothing pillow that might be at rest be strange must hardly maintain accustomed familiarity lucy felt at moment must make difference know said eagerly none at between promise that will make difference promise be of course exacted be not possible that promise must be kept very early on following morning so early that woke while still in first sleep there came letter for from parsonage mr robarts have written after return home from lady lufton dinner letter said own own darling how be to congratulate be eager enough in wishing joy do wish joy be so very happy write now chiefly to say that will be over with about twelve to morrow must bring away with if did not one else by mean so trustworthy must insist on doing though be thus stated to be chief part of letter though might be so in matter be by mean so in space be very long for mr robarts have sat writing till past midnight will not say anything about went on to say after two page have be filled with name must tell how beautifully have behaved will own be dear woman will not lucy have already owned many time since visit of yesterday have declared to a have continued to declare ever since that have never doubted took by surprise when got into drawing room before dinner told first of that have be to see at hogglestock lord lufton of course must not keep secret brought out instantly ca tell now how told be sure will believe that did in best possible manner took hand pressed dozen time thought be going to do something else did not so need not be jealous be so nice to mark saying such thing in praise of paying manner of compliment to father lord lufton scolded immensely for not bringing said be lackadaisical nonsensical must see how much loved for what have done must see too for know way know that be delighted with must not keep eye off evening certainly never did see look so well then while lord lufton mark be in dining room where remained terribly long time must make go through house that might show room explain how be to be mistress there have got arranged to perfection be sure have be thinking about for year great fear at present be that must go live at lufton if have gratitude in to will not let do consoled by saying that there be not two stone upon one at lufton a yet believe such be case besides everybody say that be ugliest spot in world went on to declare with tear in eye that if be content to remain at framley must never interfere in anything do think that be best woman that ever lived so much a have given of letter formed small portion of comprises that be necessary that must know exactly at twelve o'clock on day puck pony appeared with mr robarts grace crawley behind grace having be brought back a being capable of service in house nothing be confidential very little be loving must be said at moment because mr crawley be there waiting to bid miss robarts adieu have not a yet be informed of what be to be future fate of visitor so must only press other hand embrace to lucy be almost relief for even to sister in law hardly a yet knew how to speak openly on subject may god almighty bless miss robarts said mr crawley a stood in dingy sitting room ready to lead out to pony carriage have brought sunshine into house even in time of sickness when there be sunshine will bless have be good samaritan binding up wound of afflicted pouring in oil balm to mother of child have given life to have brought light comfort good word making spirit glad within a have not be gladdened before hath come of charity vaunteth not be not puffed up faith hope be great beautiful charity exceedeth having so spoken instead of leading out went away hid how puck behaved a fanny drove back to framley how two lady in carriage behaved of perhaps nothing further need be said chapter xlvii nemesis in spite of joyful tidings must ala be remembered that poena just rhadamanthine goddess whom modern ordinarily call punishment nemesis when wish to speak of goddess ship very seldom fails to catch wicked man though have sometimes lame foot of own though wicked man may possibly get start of in instance wicked man have be unfortunate friend mark robarts wicked in that have wittingly touched pitch gone to gatherum castle ridden fast mare across country to cobbold ash fallen very imprudently among tozers instrument used by nemesis be mr tom tower of jupiter than whom in day there be deadlier scourge in hand of goddess in first instance however must mention though will not relate little conversation took place between lady lufton mr robarts that gentleman thought right to say few word more to ladyship respecting money transaction must not feel said that have received that prebendal stall from hand of mr sowerby under such circumstance considering have happened must not be easy in mind a long a held what be about to do must be aware delay considerably final settlement with lord lufton lufton hoped must pardon agree with a to propriety of what be about to do on first blush of thing lady lufton did not quite go along with now that lord lufton be to marry parson sister might be well that parson must be dignitary of church might be well also that one so nearly connected with son must be comfortable in money matter there loomed also in future distant possibility of higher clerical honour for peer brother in law top rung of ladder be always more easily attained when man have already ascended step two nevertheless when matter came to be fully explained to when saw clearly circumstance under stall have be conferred did agree that have better be given up well for of be well for at framley that conclusion have be reached before scourge of nemesis have fallen nemesis of course declared that scourge have produced resignation be generally understood that be false boast for clerical men at barchester knew that stall have be restored to chapter in other word into hand of government before tom tower have twirled fatal lash above head manner of twirling be a follows be with difficulty enough said article in jupiter that church of england maintains at present moment that ascendancy among religious sect of country so loudly claim perhaps be rather from old fashioned time honoured affection for standing than from intrinsic merit of own that such general acknowledgment of ascendancy be still allowed to prevail if however patron clerical member of church be bold enough to disregard general rule of decent behaviour think may predict that chivalrous feeling will be found to give way from time to time hear of instance of such imprudence be made to wonder at folly of who be supposed to hold state church in greatest reverence among position of dignified ease to fortunate clergyman may be promoted be stall of canon prebendary in cathedral of a be well known carry little emolument with be rich in good thing of world excellent family house be attached to with hardly know what domestic privilege clerical income moreover of amount if divided must make glad heart of many hard working clerical slave reform have be busy even among stall attaching amount of work to pay paring off superfluous wealth from such of a be over full reform have be lenient with acknowledging that be well to have such place of comfortable dignified retirement for who have worn out in hard work of profession there have of late prevailed taste for appointment of young bishop produced doubt by feeling bishop must be men fitted to get through really hard work have never heard that young prebendary be considered desirable clergyman selected for position must have always thought have earned evening of ease by long day of work must above thing be one whose life have be therefore in human probability will be so decorous a to be honourable to cathedral of adoption be however other day given to understand one of luxurious benefice belonging to cathedral of barchester have be bestowed on rev mark robarts vicar of neighbouring parish on understanding that must hold living stall together on making further inquiry be surprised to learn that fortunate gentleman be a yet considerably under thirty year of age be desirous however of believing that learning piety conduct might be of nature to add peculiar grace to chapter therefore though almost unwillingly be silent now have come to ear indeed to ear of world that piety conduct be sadly wanting judging of mr robarts by life associate be inclined to doubt even learning have at moment at rate have few day since execution in parsonage house at framley on suit of certain most disreputable bill discounter in london probably must have execution in other house in barchester close for fact that have never thought necessary to go into residence then followed very stringent doubt much needed advice to clerical member of church of england who be supposed to be mainly responsible for conduct of brother article ended a follows many of stall be in gift of respective dean chapter in such case dean chapter be bound to see proper person be appointed in other instance power of selection be vested in crown then equal responsibility rest on government of day mr robarts learn be appointed to stall in barchester by late prime minister really think that grave censure rest on for manner in patronage have be exercised may be impossible that must in such case satisfy by personal inquiry government be altogether conducted on footing of vicarial responsibility quod facit per alium facit per se be in special manner true of minister man who rise to high position among must abide by danger thereby incurred in peculiar case be informed that recommendation be made by very recently admitted member of cabinet to whose appointment alluded at time a great mistake gentleman in question held high individual office of own evil such a have now be done at barchester be exactly sort of mischief follows exaltation of unfit men to high position even though great scope for executive failure may be placed within reach if mr robarts will allow to tender to advice will lose time in going through such ceremony a may be necessary again to place stall at disposal of crown may here observe poor harold smith when read writhing in agony declared to be handiwork of hated enemy mr supplehouse knew mark so at least said be inclined to believe that animosity misled think that one greater than mr supplehouse have taken upon punishment of poor vicar be very dreadful to at framley when first read seemed to crush to atom poor mr robarts when heard seemed to think that for world be over attempt have be made to keep from such attempt always fail a did article be copied into good natured local newspaper soon discovered that something be being hidden at last be shown to by husband then for few hour be annihilated for few day be unwilling to show for few week be very sad after that world seemed to go on much a have done before sun shone upon a warmly a though article have not be written not only sun of heaven a rule be not limited in shining by display of pagan thunder also genial sun of own sphere warmth light of be so essentially necessary to happiness neighbouring rector did not look glum did rector wife refuse to call people in shop at barchester did not regard a though be disgraced woman though must be acknowledged that mr proudie passed in close with coldest nod of recognition on mr proudie mind alone did article seem to have enduring effect in one respect be perhaps beneficial lady lufton be at once induced by to make common cause with own clergyman thus remembrance of mr robarts sin passed away quicker from mind of whole framley court household indeed county at large be not able to give to matter undivided attention must have be considered due at period of more than ordinary interest at present moment preparation be being made for general election although contest be to take place in eastern division very violent fight be being carried on in west circumstance of fight be so exciting that mr robarts article be forgotten before time edict have gone forth from gatherum castle directing that mr sowerby must be turned out answering note of defiance have be sounded from chaldicotes protesting on behalf of mr sowerby that duke behest must not be obeyed there be two class of person in realm who be constitutionally inefficient to take part in returning member to parliament peer namely woman yet be soon known through whole length breadth of county that present electioneering fight be being carried on between peer woman miss dunstable have be declared purchaser of chace of chaldicotes a be just in very nick of time purchase so men in barsetshire declared not knowing anything of fact must have gone altogether other way have not giant obtained temporary supremacy over god duke be supporter of god therefore so mr fothergill hinted money have be refused miss dunstable be prepared to beard ducal friend of god in own county therefore money have be taken be inclined however to think that mr fothergill knew nothing about to opine that miss dunstable in eagerness for victory offered to crown more money than property be worth in duke opinion that crown took advantage of anxiety to manifest profit of public at large soon became known also that miss dunstable be in fact proprietor of whole chaldicotes estate that in promoting success of mr sowerby a candidate for county be standing by own tenant also became known in course of battle miss dunstable have herself at last succumbed that be about to marry dr thorne of greshamsbury greshamsbury apothecary a adverse party now delighted to call have be little better than quack life said dr fillgrave eminent physician of barchester now be going to marry quack daughter by like to dr thorne did not allow to be much annoyed gave rise to very pretty series of squib arranged between mr fothergill mr closerstill electioneering agent mr sowerby be named lady pet description be given of lady who kept pet be by mean flattering to miss dunstable appearance manner age then western division of county be asked in grave tone a county borough be asked by mean of advertisement stuck up on blind wall barn door whether be fitting proper that must be represented by woman upon
