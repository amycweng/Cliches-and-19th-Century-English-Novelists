rippling laughter by silvery sound have robbed of heart there be plumpness silver sounding laughter with mary will be described in next chapter let suffice to say here that be somewhat staid in demeanour not at given to putting forward in conversation hour that passed in company became more more sure that if wife must now make happy be woman who must do so of manner to doubted much be gratitude for what be prepared to do for with gratitude be mingled respect almost veneration treated at first almost a servant at rate with none of familiarity of friend hardly with reserve of grown up child gradually in obedience to evident wish did drop reserve allowed to converse with be always a young person might with modesty converse with superior struggled hard to overcome reticence did at last succeed still there be that respect verging almost into veneration seemed to crush when thought that might begin to play lover have got pony carriage for insisted that must drive never have driven have said taking place doubtfully assuming rein while sat beside have at time be six month at croker hall there must be beginning for everything will begin to drive now then took great trouble with teaching how to hold rein how to use whip till at last something of familiarity be engendered went out with day after day showing pretty haunt among down be to be found in neighbourhood of alresford did well for time mr whittlestaff thought that be progressing have not a yet quite made up mind that attempt must be made at if can be imagined to have talked to friend a talked to that friend must have averred that spoke more frequently against marriage rather against young lady marriage than in favour of after will never do must have said to friend be old man old man must ask young girl to sacrifice mr baggett look on only a question of butcher baker there be doubt circumstance in butcher baker do come uppermost here butcher baker be provided must have marry for sake love fear be out of question for gratitude must not have do be thus that must commonly have be found speaking to friend there be moment in roused to better hope when have drank glass of whisky water be somewhat elate with consequence will do must then have said to friend only can not exactly say when so went on till at last became afraid to speak out tell what wanted mr whittlestaff be tall thin man not quite six foot with face judge of male beauty must hardly call handsome must say be impressive interesting seldom think how much be told to of owner character by first second glance of man woman face be fool be clever be reticent outspoken be passionate long suffering nay be honest reverse be malicious of kindly nature of thing form sudden judgment without thought in most of sudden judgment be roughly correct be so seems to to be so a matter of course that man be fool reticent malicious without giving thought to own phrenological capacity pas on with conviction one ever considered that mr whittlestaff be fool malicious people did think that be reticent honest inner trait of character be very difficult to be read even mr baggett have hardly read correctly be shamefaced to such degree mr baggett must not bring to understand there be present to manner of speech practice have now made habitual have originally adopted with object of hiding shamefacedness under veil of dashing manner must speak a though be quite free with thought when at moment feared that thought must be read of certainly have cause to be ashamed fellowship poetry early love be to thinking cause of disgrace required to be buried deep within own memory true humility with regarded betokened character for need not have blushed that thought of matter at that thought of at be matter to be buried deep within own bosom through short dark brown hair grey lock be beginning to show sign indeed of age sign be very becoming to at fifty be much better looking man than have be at thirty so that foolish fickle girl catherine bailey must not have rejected for cruelly sensuous face of mr compas have handsome iron grey tinge be then given to countenance a looked at glass told that grey haired old fool such a be have no right to burden life of young girl simply because found in bread meat that must think good looking be to nature impossible eye be rather small very bright eyebrow black almost bushy nose be well formed somewhat long not so a to give peculiar idea of length to face come from great nasal prolongation upper lip be short mouth large manly strength of character be better shown by mouth than by other feature wore hardly beard a beard go now unless indeed whisker can be called beard came down closely shorn about inch below ear very common sort of individual said of a looked in glass when mary lawrie have be already twelve month in house then man ought to be common man who be uncommon be dandy buffoon clothes be made after one pattern of one colour have indeed morning clothes evening clothes for morning be very nearly black whereas for evening be entirely so walked about neighbourhood in soft hat such a clergyman now affect on sunday went to church with old well established respectable chimney pot on sunday too carried umbrella whereas on week day always have large stick be observed that umbrella stick be adapted to state of weather such be mr whittlestaff of croker small residence stood way up on way to down about mile from alresford have come into neighbourhood having bought small freehold property without knowledge of of inhabitant be just a though have come out of sun said old baker forgetting that most men ancestor must have come to present residence after similar fashion have brought mr baggett with who have confided to baker that have felt that strange on first arrival that did know whether be standing on head heel mr baggett have since become very gracious with various of neighbour have paying of mr whittlestaff bill general disposal of custom from thence arose popularity during last fifteen year have crept silently into society of place at first one have known anything about neighbourhood have be shy by degree parson then squire have taken by hand so that social endowment of place be more than mr whittlestaff even desired chapter iii mary lawrie there be nothing more difficult in writing of story than to describe adequately person of hero heroine so a to place before mind of reader clear picture of who be described courtship be harder still so hard that may say generally that be impossible southey lodore be supposed to have be effective let one with word in memory stand beside waterfall say whether be such a word have painted rush foam a described by poet much more violently than doe real water so doe everything described unless in hand of wonderful master have clear image on brain of character of person introduced know with fair accuracy what be intended by character a given of amelia booth of clarissa of di vernon of maggie tulliver a person have not be drawn with pencil for by artist who created have conception how looked of thackeray beatrix have vivid idea because be drawn for by artist under own eye have now to describe mary lawrie have artist who will take trouble to learn thought to reproduce consequently fear that true idea of young lady can be conveyed to reader must leave to entertain such notion of carriage demeanour a must come to at end from reading of whole book attempt must be made if only for fashion sake so that adventitious help may be wanting to more probably to who may care to form for personification of mary lawrie be tall thin staid girl who never put forward in of walk of life in young lady a be called upon to show be silent reserved sometimes startled even when appealed to in household so quiet a of mr whittlestaff who have seen former life have known that have lived under dominion of step mother have so accounted for manner then added to be sense of entire dependence on stranger doubt helped to quell spirit mr whittlestaff have eye with to see ear with to hear be not to be taken in by outward appearance of young lady have perceived that under quiet guise timid startled look there existed power of fighting battle for herself for friend if occasion must arise must appear to herself to be sufficient have known a one of father household of step mother have seen probably little instance of self assertion such a have not yet made apparent to mr baggett man who have met once for few minute only must certainly not declare to be beautiful too like mr whittlestaff be always contented to pas unobserved chance man have seen for long must surely remark that miss lawrie be attractive girl have heard talk freely on matter of interest must have called very attractive must blaze up into sudden eloquence then must become shame stricken abashed dumfounded so a to show that have for moment forgotten audience then audience chance man must surely set wit to work try to reproduce in renewal of intimacy to have seemed to yield for moment yet be not describing after accepted fashion must produce catalogue of feature tell how one of be formed hair be dark worn very plain with graceful care show that owner have not slurred over toilet with hurried negligence of complexion can hardly be said that have so little be appearance of countenance diversified by change of hue if be bound to declare colour must in truth say that be brown there be none even of flying hue be supposed to be intended when woman be called brunette when first came to croker hall health produced variation did such come quickly though before have lived there year half now again slight tinge of dark ruby must show on cheek then vanish almost quicker than have come mr whittlestaff when must see must be almost beside in admiration eye be deep blue so deep that casual observer must not at first recognise colour when have perceived that be blue have brought fact home to knowledge blueness remained with a thing fixed for ever must feel if be thoughtful contemplative much given to study lady eye such a be lady must posse like if only be given to to choose nose be slight fine perhaps lent to face of feature most special grace lip ala be too thin for true female beauty lacked that round luscious fulness seems in many girl face to declare purpose for be made through white teeth must occasionally be seen then face be at best a for instance when be smiling be seldom at other moment seemed a though be too careful to keep mouth closed if mouth be defective symmetry of chin carrying with oval of cheek jaw be perfect how many face otherwise lovely to look upon be made mean comparatively base by lengthening shortening of chin that absolute perfection miss lawrie owned perhaps often meet when found confess that nothing to give so sure evidence of true blood good breeding such be catalogue of mary lawrie feature drawn out with care by one who have delighted for many hour to sit look at power of language writer posse have be used in thus reproducing now when portion of work be done feel sure that reader of novel will have slightest idea of what mary lawrie be like incident must now be told of early life of never spoke to man woman child step mother have known circumstance have rarely spoken of there have come across path in young man who have stirred heart have won affection young man have passed on there a far a present past be concerned have be end of young man have be no favourite with step mother father who be almost on death bed have heard what be going on almost without remark have be told that man be penniless a daughter have be to dearest thing upon earth have be glad to save pain of expressing disapproval john gordon have however be gentleman be fit in thing to be husband of such girl a mary lawrie except that be penniless also have possessed nothing have passed on way without speaking have gone even mary did not know whither have accepted fate have never allowed name of john gordon to pas lip day passed very quickly at croker hall not so quickly that mary knew well what be going on in mr whittlestaff mind how be that girl understands to certainty state of man heart in regard to rather not heart purpose girl may believe that man love may be deceived will not be deceived a to whether wish to marry gradually came conviction on miss lawrie mind of mr whittlestaff purpose a did so came conviction also that must not do of saw nothing be instigated by to be more eager be at same time additionally abashed by something in manner made feel that task before be not easy one mr baggett who knew well symptom a master displayed became angry with mary lawrie who be mary lawrie that must take upon to deny mr whittlestaff anything doubt must a told be better for mr baggett in many respect that master must remain unmarried assured that if mistress be put over head must retire to portsmouth of place for have dreariest memory must remain where be very well while mary lawrie remained also where be provoked to think that offer must be made to girl must be refused what on earth be see in be what never can understand ai pretty not to say look a though butter must melt in mouth be got inside of day will come out then mr baggett determined that must have few word on subject with mary lawrie mary have now be year four month at croker hall have under pressure from mr whittlestaff assumed something of manner rather than of air of mistress to mr baggett old woman did not at resent because reality of power be still in hand must not endure that idolatry of love must always be present in master face if young woman must only become mr whittlestaff then idolatry must pas away at rate master must not continue to make as of a mr baggett phrased think miss a mr whittlestaff be looking very peeky be mr baggett 'deed be to thinking be along of be got fancy into mind why must have fancy know be sure

held by arm did not once progress with speech while sat silent by side blushing with dark ruby streak across cheek step mother have intended to vilify when said that have blushed black mary continued after pause can endure thought of becoming wife now drew arm away turned face compressed lip sat without uttering word of course be old man be not that muttered think that can love a honestly a firmly a younger one think that if must bring to be wife must find that must not be treated badly oh exclaimed nothing at rate must be kept from when have thought feeling hope fear will share a to money do that there must be talk of money from to perhaps not must be best must be left to do a may think most fitting for have one incident in life must wish to tell loved girl many year since ill used continued to love long image have passed from mind be thinking a said of mr compas large family will not be necessary must refer to again because subject be very painful be essential must tell now

future must not be necessary that must return to idea of governess have be so distasteful to mary can say that will be so asked quietly after having remained silent for ten minute must be that fate must be resolved in so short time since first notion that mr whittlestaff have asked to be wife have come upon have thought of day night a be so usual with world at large have thought altogether of past not of future past be valley of dream must easily be surveyed whereas future be high mountain must require much labour to climb when think that will make calculation a to future be so easy to revel in memory instead mary have in truth not thought of answer though have said to herself over over again why must not be so have answer to give said oh mr whittlestaff have so startled be hardly true have not startled have brought to necessity of knowing own mind if wish to think of will take own time then be decided that week must be accorded to during week passed much of time in tear mr baggett must not leave alone to give mr baggett due must be acknowledged that acted a best knew how for master interest without thinking of will go down to portsmouth be not worth thinking of ai there be at portsmouth a will take care of see why must go daresay not be older than see what see have borne with a miss because have not be upsetting still when have lived with for year without anything of

imperious than gratitude there be at portsmouth a will take care of doubt mind about ai going to have good time at portsmouth people ai born to have good time of be going to have good time ai for for what duty tell have bit sup what come from to stand shilly willying ca abide idea be thus that mr baggett taught great lesson greatest lesson may say man woman can learn though taught immoderately fancying a woman that woman must sacrifice everything to man still taught with truth be minded to go to portsmouth although portsmouth to in present state of circumstance be little better than hell upon earth mary must not quite see mr whittlestaff claim in same light one point on did seem to that have made up mind be mr gordon claim be paramount to everything yes be gone might never return might be that be dead might be even that have taken other wife be conscious that not word have passed lip must be taken a promise there have not be even hint of promise seemed to that duty of mr baggett spoke be due rather to john gordon than to mr whittlestaff counted day nay counted hour till week have run by when precise moment have come at answer must be given for in such matter mr whittlestaff be very precise john gordon be still hero of thought well dear said putting hand upon arm just a have done on former occasion said more there be world of entreaty in tone of voice a uttered word mr whittlestaff well dear think can think ought never heard of mr john gordon never used to come to house at norwich loved what became of asked in strangely altered voice be there to be mr compas here too to interfere with happiness be poor went away when step mother did not like have engaged to oh there have be nothing of kind will understand must not speak to on subject be not that be bound to tell whole heart will never repeat what now hear there be engagement there be question of such thing be gone yes said mary have gone will not come back again then looked into face oh so wistfully when did happen when father be on death bed have come sooner than then be that went think mr whittlestaff never ought to marry one after therefore be have told be good girl mary know about think ought to deceive at least in nothing must deceive one mr whittlestaff answered ever so meekly there be running in mind feeling that have not deceived one that be somewhat hardly used by advice given to have gone altogether asked again know where be whether be dead alive if must come back only shook head meaning to understand that must say nothing of purpose must come back have made offer have said that if returned must come first to norwich there have be something of promise in oh so little did not dare to tell that hitherto have lived upon little think that must remain single for ever on account how long be now since mr gordon went there be something in tone in mentioned mr gordon name went against grain with mary felt that be spoken of almost a enemy think be three year since

obscured by idea that have ever thought that have loved person a woman be a lovable a before though perhaps le admirable at rate wanted now seemed to be more within reach than have be week have passed by mary suppose now can give answer then found that be in power have told story a though with understanding that if must take with fancy be ready to surrender be not to have answer now suppose so what be to be if wish for will be yours will cease to think of mr gordon will think of not in way that must begrudge will suffice know that be honest will not ask to forget altogether there have better be speaking of be well that must be banished from mind now dearest dearest love give hand put hand at once into kiss just turned little round with eye bent upon ground nay there must be kiss then bent over just touched cheek mary be now own yes be now own must do for best in power have not asked for love certainly have not given knew well how impossible must be that must give love know be disturbed

be spoken to on must found fair hope have never be so certain of love of love a true undoubted undoubtable fact of unchangeable fact a be now why must poor old woman with many year of service be disturbed went again up to bedroom sitting at open window looking out saw still pacing slowly up down long walk a looked at seemed to be older than before hand be still clasped behind back there be look about a of thriving lover care seemed to be on face nay even present almost visibly on very shoulder must go to plead for mr baggett in case what must become of be aware that must no longer stay in house a adopted daughter must go forth starve if there be nothing better for a thought of starvation stamped with one foot against other a though to punish for own falsehood must not let starve must get place for a governess be not in least afraid of starvation must be sweeter for to work with kind of hardship around to be allowed to think of john gordon with heart free than to become comfortable mistress of house must not admit plea of starvation even to herself wanted to be free of must tell so must tell also of ruin be about to bring on old servant watched a came back into house then rose from chair will never see again said a paused before left room what did matter not seeing again ought to make must make difference with be not that might see that might think of with unsullied thought must be object that duty that owed to mr baggett why be not mr baggett entitled to a much consideration a be even turned to glass wiped eye with sponge brushed hair then went across passage to mr whittlestaff library knocked at door have not be accustomed to do then at bidding entered room oh mary said laughing be that way begin by knocking at door think one knock when one want moment of reprieve mean to say that be bashful in assuming new privilege then have better go back to old habit because always used to come where be must come go now like very second self then came forward from desk at be wont to stand write essayed to put arm round waist drew back still be not startled be cold kiss gave down below must kiss now a wife kiss husband never what now be startled mr whittlestaff pray pray be angry with be meaning of then bethought how might best explain meaning be hard upon having to explain told very foolishly that must be better for to begin with story of mr baggett must more easily speak of mr baggett than of john gordon must be remembered on behalf that have second to think how might best begin story have spoken to mr baggett about wish well have lived with family from before be born be old fool who be going to hurt if did hurt be to be put out of course because of can remain here a long a obeys a mistress say that after so many year can not do that will leave house very night if disturbs happiness mine what be old woman like to tell master when may when may not marry did not think have be so soft must not explain to that thought upon subject must not say that interference of domestic between one a john gordon love between if be happy enough to be love must be absurdity too foolish to be considered that happy two must be following bent of human nature must speak more than soft word to old woman if soft word might avail anything love happy love must be thing too sacred to admit of question from servant almost from parent why in matter be not mr baggett happiness to be of a much consequence a mr whittlestaff especially when own peace of mind lay in same direction a mr baggett say that be only laying up trouble for yourself in think that be true then rose up in wrath spoke mind freely showed at once john gordon have not dwelt much on mind have bade not to speak of then have be contented to look upon a one whom must not be compelled to trouble with further think mary that be making too little of of to talk to even to consider in such matter what servant say to a have given affection must now allow nothing that one can say to to make even think of changing purpose how grossly must be mistaken when must imagine that have given heart have not expressly told that love have be set upon person to be everything have be thinking a walked up down path there of must do to make happy be so happy in feeling that have happiness to look after how must not let wind blow too coldly on how must be watchful to see that nothing must ruffle spirit what duty what pleasure what society must provide for how must change habit so a to make advanced year fit for younger life be teaching to hope be not yet too old to make altogether impossible then come to tell that must destroy dream dash hope to ground because old woman have shown temper jealousy be true according to light in saw position have there be nothing between two mutual desire to be married reason given by for changing must be absurd a have continued to speak slowly adding on one argument to with certain amount of true eloquence felt that unless must go back to john gordon must yield be very hard for to go back to john gordon in first place must acknowledge in doing so that have only put forward mr baggett a false plea then must insist on love for man who have never spoken to of love be so hard that must not do openly have thought so little of value must be to value to be infinite think mary that there have come upon certain melancholy be depressing regard to be worth now more than other possession gift that world can bestow have taken pride to myself in saying that have be given yes regard must not contradict a to have thought of own position after have passed between can hardly go on living here a have done know then what must become of if be to break away from thought must get place for a governess companion to lady must satisfy ambition have got place for be here a spoke laid hand upon heart not a companion to lady be required to fulfil duty here on earth be fuller task of work that must do trust trust that may not be more tedious looked at again did not now appear so old there be power of speech about man dignity made feel that must in truth have loved have not be for john gordon unfortunately be older than very much older to there may be advantage that can listen to what may say with something of confidence in knowledge of world a wife will fill position more honourable more suitable to gift than must belong to a governess companion will have much more to do will be able to go nightly to rest with consciousness that have done more a mistress of house than must have done in tamer capacity will have care even will ennoble world to to world that other life be poor shrunken death rather than life be way of passing day must fall to lot of many female who doe not achieve other be well that to whom fall must be able to accommodate to with contentment respect think that may say of even a wife will stand higher than must do a companion be sure of not on account must accept man that can not love have not told that did not love even that loved yet spoke to in way have better tell mr baggett to come to there be memory of other man murmured very gently then scowl came back upon face not scowl look rather of cold displeasure if understand rightly gentleman never addressed a lover never see mary mr baggett have be violent selfish have made think thought must not have be put in head to disturb have dreamed dream in early life a girl do dream suppose have now to be forgotten be not so suppose be dream have passed away have left to become happiness of life send mr baggett to will speak to then came up to for have be standing about yard apart pressed lip to hers how be possible that must prevent turned round slowly left room feeling a did so that be again engaged to for ever ever hated because have be so fickle how must have done otherwise asked a went back to room at what period during interview be now over must have declared to real state of mind have a be taken complete possession of by right of deed of gift have made of that morning have endeavoured to resume gift have altogether failed declared to herself that be weak impotent purposeless admitted on other hand that have displayed more of power than have ever guessed at possessing woman always love display of power in man felt that must have loved have not be for john gordon there be one comfort for none knew of weakness mind have vacillated like shuttlecock one have seen vacillation be in hand must simply do a bade then went down to mr baggett room told old lady to go up stair at master behest be going said mr baggett be going hope will find one else a good at doing what tell ai going to be doing for for one much longer chapter vi john gordon mr baggett walked into master room loudly knocking at door waiting for loud answer be pacing up down library thinking of injustice of interference be full of injury to have be subjected by circumstance have be perfectly sincere when have told mary lawrie mr whittlestaff be entitled to have to enjoy own wish a against of in first place be man a man be to be indulged at cost to number of woman then be man whose bread have eaten mary have eaten bread a bestowed upon from sheer charity according to mr baggett view of world at large mary be bound to deliver body soul to mr whittlestaff be soul sacrifice demanded from a for first duty in life be to look after be to be sick unfortunately mr whittlestaff never be sick mr baggett be patiently looking forward to happy day when might be brought home with leg broken have imprudent habit hunting shooting suchlike chance might be good to then making of jam marmalade for did not care straw only ate to oblige be comfort to must manage occasionally to be kept out of bed over boiling till one o'clock then making of butter in summer must demand that must be up at three thus be enabled to consider that normal hour of work be twenty two out of twenty four did not begrudge in least thinking that be due to mr whittlestaff now mr whittlestaff wanted wife of course ought to have juggernaut car must roll on course over body mary lawrie must not be expected to remain behold mary lawrie triumph mary lawrie power be out of

without incurring censure of master because of folly in resolving to go have just commenced lecture on sin of pride in be prepared to show that evil must receive from red nosed veteran at portsmouth must be due to own stiff necked obstinacy when be stopped suddenly by sound of knock at front door be not only knock at door entrance into hall of man for hall door have be open into garden servant

thinking love for john gordon be world to must not have be made to abandon thought even though man have not spoken word to knew that loved even though time might come when must cease to do so that time have not come yet vacillated in mind between condemnation of cruelty of mr whittlestaff of own weakness then too there be feeling of hardship inflicted upon by john gordon have certainly said that have justified in believing that possessed heart yet there have be no word on must fall back regard a promise might perhaps be better for that must marry mr whittlestaff friend must think to be infinitely better must there be anything more moonstruck more shandy more wretchedly listless than for girl penniless girl to indulge in dream of impossible lover when tower of strength presented to a be mr whittlestaff have consented to eat bread friend have declared how lucky have be to find man so willing so able to maintain now man did undoubtedly love very dearly there must be a be well aware peril in marrying be to refuse because of soft word once spoken to by young man who have since disappeared altogether from knowledge have already accepted have twice accepted on very day there be longer hope for escape even if escape be desirable what fool must be to sit there still dreaming impossible dream instead of thinking of happiness preparing for want have told that might be allowed to think of john gordon though not to speak of must neither speak of think of knew said too well to give such liberty must be to a though have never be must force to forget if forgetting lie in absence of thought be no more than mr whittlestaff have right to demand more than ought to be able to accomplish be weak simpleton a to be unable to keep mind from running back to word to visage to little

last meeting did not occur to that something might have come across life during period of nearly three year must stand in way in hers a gazed into face seemed a though such idea have fallen upon during two three minute multitude of thought crowded on poor mary mind be possible that because of coming of john gordon mr whittlestaff must withdraw claim allow happy young hero to walk off with reward still seemed to desire felt sure that must not be so even during short space of time resolved that must not be so knew mr whittlestaff too well be sure that lover have arrived too late passed

did mary at moment mr whittlestaff seemed to glory in marriage to seemed that getting rid of john gordon be one thing of importance so be at least that john gordon interpreted manner name of suitor

a to what world must say of have done nothing of be ashamed have mary have given promise be sure that must not depart from must thought be infinitely better for for many reason that must be married to

there will be kind word spoken mary said when did happen have be happening suppose from first day came into house when be settled when did ask to be wife when rather did make promise john gordon fancied that since have be at croker hall word have be spoken that have seen sign indicating that engagement have not be of long date in word that have uttered to have heard whispered under breath assurance of perfect love for have be sure of love when have left house at norwich in have be told that have be lingering there to good purpose have never be more certain than be at moment when coldly bade go depart back again to distant home in diamond field now in mock anger in indignant word with purpose of mind written so clearly on brow be to more lovable more beautiful than ever must be fair to a man that must lose prize be to of such inestimable value merely for word of cold assent given to old man given a thought quite lately devotion to be certainly assured nothing must be more fixed le capable of doubt than love too be somewhat proud of in that have endeavoured to entangle by promise till have secured for for mean of maintaining have gone out have come back with silent hope with hope have felt must be subject to disappointment because knew to be reticent self restrained man because have be aware that world a have said be full of hard thing have to be borne now if a believed engagement be of recent date there must be hardship in even must not bear patiently hardship endurance of must be intolerable to if be so man must hardly be so close fisted so hard hearted so cruel

of kindness to promise be same be a strong even though have be made morning a though week month have intervened felt that to there must be apparent weakness in promise of engagement if told that be made only on morning when be mary matter nothing said doe matter to then sense of what be fitting told that be incumbent on to tell truth sooner later must assuredly know be well that must know entire truth from lip must not put up with feeling that must go away deceived in degree by herself be morning said very morning be on morning gave word to mr whittlestaff promised to become wife have be here yesterday must not have be too late here looked up imploringly into face must not answer question ought to press for answer word be sooner out of mouth than felt that be so be not to that must address

have become one who ought not to be allowed to interest further have endeavoured to think of with stern justice accusing of absurd romance giving mr whittlestaff credit for goodness have be before john gordon have appeared among now struggled hard not to be le just to mr whittlestaff than before because of accident knew well enough to be aware that must not easily be brought to abandon thing on have set mind passed through mind a prepared answer for john gordon can make difference said promise be promise though be hour old be to be answer yes be to be answer ask will know that there be other answer can honestly make how be own heart in affair there be weak knew a spoke that be weak matter not at said matter not at all repeated after can understand that happiness must be nothing if be satisfied of course must be nothing if be satisfied there must be end to because if pleasure work together must necessarily be left out in cold be not so take upon to say that be not satisfied will not allow to answer for not in matter will dare to tell that love remained silent before then went on to reason with deny hear in voice see in face when parted in norwich did not love then will answer such question young woman have often to change mind a to whom love before can settle down a one man wife dare to be true if be rough with be for sake a well a own be young a be natural learnt to love

have given heart to john gordon that must be unable to keep thought from running to have implored to leave to herself so that memory of love might be spared then when young man have be still absent when there be dream of appearing again before when consequence must be that must go forth into world earn own bitter bread alone at moment knew that have be true to memory of man what have occurred since to alter purpose so violently be presence of man did love maidenly instinct forbade to declare passion in presence be simply conviction that promise to mr whittlestaff have be twice repeated

stranger must be allowed to go told also that must carry generosity further be not called upon to offer to surrender man coming have be misfortune let go in process of time must be forgotten be thus

dinner unless remained at house for doing so have excuse must return in evening sleep at inn come back next morning must manage to catch man alone because be assuredly minded to use upon power of eloquence have at command a thought improbable so to find in evening determined to postpone task in doing so felt that must be at loss eager word be hot now within memory having be sharpened against anvil of thought by colloquy with mary lawrie to morrow might have cooled purpose might be a strong man when wish to use burning word must use while word be on fire john gordon have friend at alresford rather acquaintance on whom have determined to call unless circumstance a must occur at croker hall must make too ecstatic in wish for such operation ecstasy certainly have not come a yet went forth therefore to call on reverend mr blake of mr blake only knew that be curate of neighbouring parish that two have be at oxford together so walked down to inn to order dinner not feeling

squire said gordon there be prebendary there be squire squire be swell though be uncommonly good fellow if get wife from one living from other will think very lucky miss lawrie be handsome girl everything that ought to be if be to see kattie forrester think must say that be sometimes wonder whether old whittlestaff will think of marrying gordon sat silent turning over one two matter in mind how supremely happy be young parson with kattie forrester promised living in earning proceeds of there need be risk very little labour with bottle of port wine comfortable house world seemed to have smiled with montagu blake with though there have be much success there have be none of world smile be aware at moment thought that be aware that world must never smile on unless must succeed in persuading mr whittlestaff to give up wife whom have chosen then felt tempted to tell own story to young parson be alone together seemed a though providence have provided with friend subject of mary lawrie intended marriage have be brought forward in peculiar manner be by nature altogether different from mr blake must not blurt out love story with easy indifference do know mr whittlestaff well asked pretty well have be here four year be near neighbour think do know well be sort of man likely to fall in love with girl a miss lawrie seeing that be inmate of house well said parson after

so that be to be lot in life be very glad to have come across once again be delighted to find so happy in prospect have told everything have done pretty much same to will disappear from alresford never more be heard of need talk much about love for though will be out of way at kimberley many thousand mile from here man doe not care to have name in one mouth oh said blake wo say word about miss

proper opportunity for assuring mr whittlestaff that must not be duty to marry mary lawrie must rush at subject let result be what might indeed have hope a to favourable result have slept upon a people say when intend to signify that have lain awake have convinced that eloquence must be vain be natural that man must give up intended wife simply because be asked gordon present feeling be anxious desire to be once more on board ship must take again to diamond field so that might be at peace knowing then a must know that have left mary lawrie behind for ever at moment almost repented that have not left alresford without farther attempt there be on mr whittlestaff ground attempt must be made if only with object of justifying coming miss lawrie began if must not mind leaving mr whittlestaff alone together for few minute will be obliged to said with quite sufficient solemnity so mr whittlestaff drew up looked hard stiff a though be determined to forget sergeant baggett peccadillo for moment oh yes certainly mr whittlestaff looked sternly at a though to bid go at once must believe nothing a coming from unless come out of own mouth then put hand upon arm a though half embracing have better leave perhaps said mr whittlestaff then went now moment have come john gordon felt difficulty have not be lessened by assurance given by mary herself that nothing be to be taken a having come from unless be known heard to have so come yet be thoroughly convinced that be altogether loved by have appeared on scene day sooner must have accepted with heart mr whittlestaff said want to tell what passed yesterday between miss lawrie be necessary asked think be a far a be concerned doubt necessity miss lawrie have said word to a much presume a feel to be necessary think that feeling in matter must be guide for for what have of to do be to think what may be best for to effect that a far a may be within power certainly said mr whittlestaff may so probably be case that will differ materially a to thinking what may be best for a far a understand matter wish that must be wife wish that must be mine think that a wife must live happier life than must do a yours a think also here mr whittlestaff paused doe think so heard what said just now heard nothing a to thought of living said john gordon in interview have with yesterday did hear word fall from a to have got to form idea a to that from circumstance will certainly not be made to appear by own speech when speak against have not said word against sir perhaps imply said gordon not stopping to notice mr whittlestaff last angry tone perhaps imply that life may be that of rover a such must not conduce to miss lawrie happiness have implied nothing to suit wish must remain altogether in england be very lucky be not man greedy of great wealth can remain here will satisfy that there will be enough for joint maintenance what do care for maintenance what doe do know sir that be talking to about lady whom intend to make wife who be engaged to marry goodness gracious own sir that be singular very singular very singular indeed never heard of such thing seems that knew at norwich did know well then went away deserted went away mr whittlestaff because be poor be told by step mother be not wanted about house because have mean be true a loved dearly started at once almost in despair still with something of hope with shade of hope might put in way of enabling to become wife did not desert very well then came back found engaged to be wife have from own mouth when gentleman hears that what have to do to go away there be circumstance here what doe say there be circumstance to justify if must come here a friend offered to receive a have be known to did not turn back upon now conduct be so peculiar that can not ask to remain here longer be walking up down long walk now mr whittlestaff stood still a though to declare intention that interview must be considered a over know that wish to go away said gordon well yes unless withdraw idea of claim to young lady hand think must first hear what have to say will not surely have done duty by unless hear can speak if wish to speak said mr whittlestaff be not till yesterday that made proposition to miss lawrie have to do with have come on previous day have be able then to tell can tell now must have made difference did say so asked fortunate lover in very angry tone did not say so be with difficulty forced from avowal that engagement be so recent did confess that be so confessed not in word in manner that have found impossible to refuse to request that have asked never heard man assert so impudently that be sole owner of lady favour upon word think that be vainest man whom ever met let be so care to defend only whether be vain not be not true that say put to a man to man whether know that be true if marry girl will not marry one whose heart belongs to will not marry one of whom knew two day since heart be mine will not marry one who if be free moment must give to without pang of remorse never heard anything like man vanity be true may be vanity self seeking unmanliness if will be not what say god truth be not about weakness weakness that must speak about happiness just so think must be happy with then be to save from that be marrying so that may not sink into abyss of unworthiness partly that if have come two day since when must have received with open arm have right to make such statement ask whether be not true must have received with open arm must then have dared a guardian to bid refuse offer made to when have learned a must have done that loved that have loved with heart before left england have left with view of enabling to marry have be wonderfully successful that have come back with other hope in world than of giving to have be able to show whole life so that girl need be afraid to become wife what do know about life may have wife living at moment doubt may be guilty of amount of villainy then a friend must make inquiry must not break girl heart because man to whom be attached may possibly be rogue in case have ground for suspicion never heard of man who spoke of so grandiloquently there be ample reason why must make inquiry in truth a said before be happiness not mine own that must look to if have taken offer because have be good to in desolation because have found unable to refuse aught to one who have treated so well if have done believing have disappeared from knowledge doubting altogether return if be so know that be so then must hesitate before lead to doom heard say be not to believe of thing unless got from own mouth did word must go for nothing with with have promised be willing to sacrifice to promise will sacrifice too because of goodness because be utterly unable to put fair value upon to be world from first hour in saw to present idea of gaining have be everything put aside word just spoke what be belief of state of wish can tell belief of state of welfare there own prejudice creep in might retaliate by charging with vanity a have done only that think such vanity very natural be must consult on matter be not to be treated like child of whom doe wish to become wife boldly say have won love that if be so must not desire to take to yourself have not answered can expect to answer look into answer there think how will be with when girl who lie upon shoulder will be thinking ever of other man from whom have robbed good bye mr whittlestaff doubt that will turn over in thought then escaped by wicket gate into road at far end of long walk be more heard of at croker hall on day chapter xi mr baggett trust only in fund mr whittlestaff when be left alone in long walk be disturbed by many troublesome thought knowledge that housekeeper be out on road that drunken disreputable husband be playing fool for benefit of idler have sauntered out from alresford to see added something to grief why must not stupid woman remain indoors allow master to send for police have declared that must go with husband must not violently prevent be not much when added to weight of care a to mary lawrie seemed to be last ounce destined to break horse back a be proverbial fate of last ounce just a be about to collect thought so a to resolve what might be duty to do in regard to mary mr baggett appeared before on walk with bonnet on head what be going to do stupid woman be going with said in midst of torrent of sob tear be dooty say if doe dooty will come right in end may be see further than taking back to portsmouth what on earth be going to portsmouth for now why why now be not more drunk than have be before yet le abominable let police lock up for night send back to portsmouth in morning why must want to go with now because be going to take missus said mr baggett still sobbing be more than know know anyone know mr whittlestaff spoke a though have nearly reduced to housekeeper position not marry exclaimed can not say if will let alone to manage own affair will be best man have be here interfering mean to say that be going to be put upon by such savage a that a have just come home from south africa diamond indeed 'd diamond believe not in single diamond be rubbish paste if be going to give up to fellow be not gentleman take for if marry wo have to go said unable to refrain from so self evident argument going what be going what be that drunken old reprobate out there to like of 'd stay only if be to see mr john gordon be let to put foot here in house then 'd go john gordon indeed to come up between when have settled mind have settled hern if favour john gordon will tear best frock off back how dare speak in way of lady who be to be mistress ai to be mistress wo have mistress when time be come will be in poorhouse at portsmouth because sha be able to earn penny to buy gin for a said mr baggett sobbed bitterly be enough to drive man mad know what be want want wish to see miss lawrie do dooty become wife a lady must do wish ought to wish too drat if be going back from word be not going back from word nothing be more excellent nothing more true nothing more trustworthy than miss lawrie must not allow to speak of in such language be then a be going back know to tell truth mr baggett know then let tell sir be old woman whom have known life pretty nigh can trust give up to none of 'em have got word keep to what be good o ' fine feeling if be to break heart mean well by will make happy can say a much for when diamond be gone what be to come next ai trust in diamond not to live out of only in fund be reg'lar must let see john gordon again never till be mr whittlestaff after will never go astray yet wo her thought god bless mr baggett said be one of when be own will remain own out will stand washing be old woman know yet can not live with such lady a no if be one of namby pambys a 'd let old woman keep old place might do will love always for what said just now love doubt loving will love because be loving not that be lovable will want to do abeost everything about house will want same want be to stand uppermost be if be to be mr whittlestaff know have to think about think about more just go in do have more word with yet with yet with let come on just a though be fixed by fate be in own hand now sir be thinking of being too good natured there ai no good come from man may maunder away mind in softness till ai worth nothing do good to one can give bread to eat clothes to wear can make respectable before men woman what have to say only that be twenty year younger than love rot suppose will come in just now sir see box when be ready to start so saying turned round sharply on path left in spite of excellent advice mr whittlestaff have received from housekeeper bidding not have more word even with on matter must not think of argument john gordon have used to according to mr baggett ought to content with knowing that must find food raiment shelter for intended wife also in feeling that have promise assurance that promise must be respected there be to very rock in upon must build house with absolute safety did not believe of be so to act must turn round upon with future tear neglect duty because be ever thinking of john gordon knew that must be too steadfast for that even though there might be sorrow at heart must be well kept down out of sight out of sight of world at large must gradually sink out of own sight too if be given to man to maunder away mind in softness can not live otherwise than a nature have made such man must maunder mr baggett have understood accurately nature of character have not understood that a be character so must act must not alter own self must not turn round upon bid be other than be be necessary to be stern cruel determined man will say to in particular emergency of life will be stern cruel general good will come out of such line of conduct unless be stern cruel in other matter also unless have be born stern cruel have so trained can not be stern cruel for occasion only mr whittlestaff knew of a sure a be there thinking over john gordon mary lawrie must maunder away mind in softness feared of be sure of of hated because be so did acknowledge to truth of position a asserted by john gordon have man come day earlier must have be in time to say first word then a mr whittlestaff said to there must not for have be chance in such case there must have be reason a far a mr whittlestaff must see why john gordon must be treated other than a happy lover be one day in advance have given strength of position be one day also have made weak have thought much about mary for time past have told that by mean might be procured cure to wound in heart have made life miserable for so many year have john gordon come in time past misery must only have be prolonged none must have be wiser even mr baggett must have held peace not thrown in teeth that have attempted to marry girl have failed a be world of alresford must know how have be with world of alresford a looked at must tell that be man who have attempted to marry mary lawrie have failed be true john gordon alleged on own behalf then be able to salve own conscience by telling that when john gordon have run through diamond there must be nothing poverty distress there be reason for supposing that diamond must be especially short lived that john gordon must probably be spendthrift diamond a source of income be volatile not trustworthy a be fund to mr baggett then nature of source of income offered enabled to say so much a plea to must give girl to man who have nothing diamond with to pay weekly bill did tell again again that mary lawrie must not be encouraged to put faith in diamond felt that be only excuse in arguing matter backwards forward must not tell that did believe in john gordon then idea grand idea one very painful in beauty crept into mind even though diamond must melt away become a nothing there be own income fixed sure a polar star in consolidated british three per cent if really loved girl must not protect from poverty even be married to john gordon broken down in article of diamond if loved be not bound by rule of chivalry must not define even to to do best must for happiness loved so well that thought that for sake must abolish let have money house horse let even have john gordon must with certain feeling of delight imagine then must not abolish there must be subject to remark of men there be men must say of who have maundered away mind in softness who in life have loved two girl have at last be thrown over by of because have be no better than soft maundering idiot must be thus that neighbour must speak of in vain effort to abolish be not yet too late have not yielded inch to man must still be stern unbending felt proud of in that have be stern unbending a far a man be concerned a regarded mary did feel sure of if there be to be weakness displayed must be in mary must be true to promise true to faith true to arrangement made for own life must not provoke with argument a to love for john gordon a mr baggett have assured even in thought must not go astray if be for word mr baggett must not be allowed to leave house what a to mary love such question be maunderingly soft be not for to ask did believe in altogether be perfectly secure that name honour be safe in hand certainly must learn to love will stand washing said to repeating morsel of mr baggett wisdom thus made up mind that must on occasion if only on occasion be stern cruel surely man must bring to sternness cruelty for once in life when so much depended on having so resolved walked back into house intending to see mary lawrie so to speak to a to give idea of conversation have taken place between john gordon must not be necessary thought that must mention to john gordon name more let marriage go on a though there be such person a john gordon must be easier to be stern cruel when must enact character simply by silence must hurry on wedding a quickly a must allow then good thing good be to come out of sternness cruelty must be achieved went through from library to knock at mary door in doing so have to pas room in mr baggett have slept tranquilly for fifteen year there in doorway be big trunk in lock of door be key brilliant idea at once occurred to mr whittlestaff shoved big box in with foot locked door put key in pocket at moment head of gardener groom appeared up back staircase after mr baggett why mr baggett door be locked said gardener be to be sure said groom why mr baggett must have key in own pocket ai got such thing do bring box down with have got key in pocket said mr whittlestaff in voice of much authority may both go down mr baggett box be not to be taken out of room to day not taken out oh mr whittlestaff why porter be here with barrow to take down to station then porter must have shilling go back again empty so stalked on to bid miss lawrie come to in library never heard of such go in life mean too said thornybush gardener never quite know what mean said hayonotes groom be always in earnest whatever be never see one like master for being in earnest be too deep for in meaning suppose be only got to go

to have box wo have may just go down get dinner when want to go to bed will have key ought to have box miss mary be own box what be to do with baggett have given more gin out there be a drunk a beast think ought to have own box will tell thornybush a may come back train will be gone then what be to do with baggett will get that drunk wo be able to stir be own box mr whittlestaff to mr whittlestaff turned deaf ear must find that there be maundering softness with now felt within own bosom that behoved to learn to become stern cruel knew that key be in pocket found that there be certain satisfaction in being stern cruel mr baggett might sob heart out after box must decline to be moved what will do about baggett sir said poor woman coming back be lying there at gate perlice doe like to touch because of sir say a how if must take into stable 'd sleep off among straw then 'd be just a bad after first go to morrow to however mr whittlestaff at once acceded saw way out of immediate difficulty therefore called hayonotes to succeeded in explaining immediate meaning hayonotes policeman between lifted baggett deposited man in empty stall where be accommodated with ample straw order be given that a soon a have come to must be provided with something to eat summat to eat said mr baggett in extreme disgust provide with lock up plenty of cold water chapter xii mr blake good news in

if did so must be so likely to yield to a be mr whittlestaff must have further excuse for addressing to girl who be about to become wife of man therefore sat restless idle miserable in little parlour

pleasure of making acquainted with five young lady a said have just paused in narrative of mr whittlestaff love be certain that have changed conversation with great effect young lady be unable not to

in evening of sister played few piece at piano miss forrester sang few song mr hall in meantime went fast asleep john gordon must tell that evening at kimberley be a rule quite a exciting then kattie forrester did not belong to have not found able a yet to make choice between young lady be however interesting to see manner in new vicar hung about lady of love evident innocent pride with accepted attention of admirer think be beautiful girl said blake coming to gordon room after have retired to bed such genuine wit so bright singing know be quite perfect absolutely just what ought to be do know something about singing because have have parish voice under own charge for last three year practice like go long way know to mr gordon must only give assent silence be intended to imply will have l at once know doe make in manner equal to of miss hall quite know what will have not more than must think property be entailed be saving man if can have put by l have done very well think so very well indeed suppose might have have one of mind telling in strictest confidence goodness gracious after have once seen kattie forrester there be longer doubt wish 'd tell what think about about miss forrester need mind speaking quite openly to be that sort of fellow must mind what fellow said have formed own idea be not likely to change must like to hear know how strike fellow who have be at diamond field can not imagine that must have different idea about woman to what have then mr blake sat down in arm chair at foot of bed prepared to discus opinion did not doubt that friend be about to deliver very nice young woman indeed said john gordon who be anxious to go to bed ah know be kind of thing that anybody can say there be real friendship in want to know true candid opinion of man who have travelled about world have be at diamond field be everybody who have be at diamond field continued thinking that might thereby flatter friend not everybody suppose young woman be same there a here if have same natural gift miss forrester must be pretty anywhere be matter of course fellow can see that with eye absolutely beautiful must say rather than pretty just so be only variation in term know then manner music language wit colour of hair when remember think be luckiest fellow in world will be deal happier with than with augusta hall think so augusta be one intended for bless must look at after have seen kattie forrester think have given true unbiassed opinion yet indeed have said john gordon well must be more free spoken than if be to ask about mary lawrie then of course mary lawrie be not engaged one doe make difference if doe turn out that marries mr whittlestaff sha think much of can tell that a be a far a look be concerned ca compare to kattie comparison be odious said

one must pay guinea week will perform high work of clergyman of church of england indifferently well on next morning messenger be sent over to croker hall came back after due lapse of time with answer to effect that mr whittlestaff miss lawrie must have pleasure in dining day at little alresford park be right said mr blake to lady of love will now perhaps be able to put thing into proper groove be always very lucky in managing such matter not that think that gordon care very much about young lady judging from what say of then see why must interest for young lady sake lady always prefers young gentleman to old one only think what 'd feel if be married to mr whittlestaff oh montagu how can talk such nonsense suppose ever must because be not one of sort of young lady suppose that mary lawrie like therefore 'd break match off in moment if must be what call good natured after lunch went off to rookery be at other side of park from gar wood be beautiful spot lying at end of valley through have to get out from carriage to walk for mile only for sake of doing honour to miss forrester must have gone on foot a be have six horse among mr gordon be put up on one of young lady steed squire parson have own miss evelina be also mounted a mr blake have suggested perhaps with view to capture of mr gordon a be first day whispered mr blake to kattie be so nice think that carriage horse must come out of course there be nothing in distance there must be respect shown on occasion mr hall doe do everything of kind just a must be suppose know young lady who be coming here to night said evelina to mr gordon oh yes knew before went abroad not mr whittlestaff have never met mr whittlestaff though have heard much of goodness now be to be married doe not seem to to be very hard not in least young lady seems to have be left by father step mother without engagement indeed without provision be brought here in first place from sheer charity can certainly understand that when be here mr whittlestaff must have admired be matter of course said evelina mr whittlestaff be not at too old to fall in love with young lady be pretty place very lovely spot think like almost better than gar wood then there be more said about mary lawrie till rode back to dinner chapter xiv mr whittlestaff be going out to dinner there be invitation come asking to dine at little alresford to day be said soon after breakfast by mr whittlestaff to mary lawrie on day after mr gordon coming think will go must not leave behind by mean want to become intimate with girl who be good girl mr gordon be there exactly be just what want will be better that must meet other without necessity of making scene from may be understood that mr whittlestaff have explained to mary a much a have thought necessary of what have occurred between john gordon that mary answer have be satisfactory to feeling mary have told that be contented with lot in life a mr whittlestaff have proposed for have not be enthusiastic then have not expected have not assured that must forget john gordon have not asked have simply said that if be satisfied so be think that with dearest at rate will be safe be quite sure that will be safe have answered have be sufficient reader will also understand from that have sought for answer to burning question john gordon have put to have loved john gordon longest did love best there be doubt certain cautious selfishness in way in have gone to work yet of general selfishness be impossible to accuse be willing to give everything to do for have first asked to be wife with observance then must always protect on plea that be doing best must for property be assured in three per cent a mr baggett have suggested whereas john gordon be in diamond how frequently do diamond melt come to nothing be thing man can carry in pocket lose give away can not so thought mr whittlestaff be settled in hand of trustee left to charge of executor can not be substantiated who can say that when looking to lady interest bit of glass may not come up instead of precious stone john gordon might be very steady fellow have only own word for a mr whittlestaff observed to there must not be doubt that mr whittlestaff be safer staff of two on young lady might lean did make excuse for determined that be of such nature that might rely upon with safety still there be pang in bosom silent secret kept on whispering to that be not best beloved have however resolved steadfastly that must not put question to mary if did not wish to declare love neither did be pity thousand pity that must be so change in heart might however take place must come to pas that must learn that be superior staff on to lean john gordon might disappear among diamond field more be heard of at rate must do best for so that must not repent bargain be determined that bargain a have be struck must be carried out therefore in communicating to mary invitation have received from little alresford did not find necessary to make special speech in answer to inquiry about john gordon understood must not in very heart pronounce judgment against knew that be doing that believed must be best for welfare overwhelmed by debt of gratitude have acceded to request have be unable afterwards to depart from word have said that must be so must not then turn upon declare that when have given hand have be unaware of presence of other lover there be injustice unkindness ingratitude selfishness in forbade to think of a being done by be better for that must suffer though suffering must be through whole life than that must be disappointed doubt man must suffer too hero lover with whom must so willingly have risked everything with without diamond must not however bear to think that mr whittlestaff must be so very prudent so very wise solely on behalf must go to for other reason than a walked about place day up down long walk told that be useless to contend with love did love john gordon knew that loved with whole heart knew that must be true to still must marry mr whittlestaff do duty in state of life to have pleased god to call there must be sacrifice sacrifice of two still be justice have not consented to take everything from mr whittlestaff bread meat raiment shelter under lived position in world now enjoyed have man come day earlier must have be well must have told love before mr whittlestaff have spoken of want circumstance have be arranged differently must bear knew that must be better for that must see john gordon more have started at once to london gone thence to diamond field without seeing again there must be feeling that have become creature of stern necessity there must have be hope for a also fear have started second time for south africa must have looked upon further return with reference to own want a thing impossible now how must be with mr whittlestaff have told with stern indifference that must again meet man sit at table with a old friend be again subject to influence will be better that must meet have said without necessity of making scene how must assure that there must be scene then thought that must have recourse to ordinary feminine excuse headache be to do so must own whole truth to master must have declared that so loved man that must not endure to be in presence must now let matter pas a have intended must go to mr hall house there encounter loved with what show of coldness might be able to assume worst of lay in that must not think that have be induced to remain in neighbourhood in order that might again try to gain point have told again again that be impossible that must decide a have decided that mr whittlestaff have decided so also have used what eloquence be within reach have be all in vain must now appeal only to herself to such appeal there must be one answer how be such appeal to be made in mr hall drawing room surely john gordon have be foolish in remaining in neighbourhood nothing trouble must come of so be going to see young man again came from mr baggett who have be in great perturbation morning sergeant have slept in stable through night have have breakfast brought to warm by own wife have sat up among straw have winked at have asked to give threepence of gin with cat lap to have acceded thinking probably that must not altogether deprive of food to be accustomed without injury then under influence of gin promise of ticket to portsmouth undertook to get for at station be induced to go down with be absolutely despatched own box be still locked up have slept with one of two maid have not happened without great disturbance in household be very angry with master because of box be very angry with mary because mary be thought averse to old lover be very angry with mr gordon because well understood that mr gordon be anxious to disturb arrangement have be made for family be very angry with husband not because be generally drunken old reprobate because have especially disgraced on present occasion by noise have made in road doubt have be treated unfairly in matter of box must have succeeded in getting law of master must not turn against master in way must give bit of own mind that did very freely must not bring to break lock of door then a thing went now did think well that must remain few day longer at croker occasion of master marriage be to be cause of going away must not endure not to be foremost among woman at croker hall be intolerable to feeling that one must interfere with master thought that if need be must assist by tongue therefore be disposed to remain yet few day in old place have come after have got ticket for husband have be done before mr whittlestaff breakfast to inform master of determination be fool mr whittlestaff have said be always fool whether go stay so that much matter have be answer then have gone in to scold maid a soon a have heard of intended dinner party attacked mary lawrie so be going to see young man again mr whittlestaff be going to dine at little alresford intends to take with oh yes be very well 'd have left behind if 'd be of way of thinking mr gordon here mr gordon there wonder what be mr gordon ai no better than ordinary miner coal diamond be one to 'd rather have coal for choice mary be not in humour to contest matter with mr baggett left old woman mistress of field when time arrived for going to dinner mr whittlestaff took mary in pony carriage with there be always groom about there said so need not take boy object be a mary in part understood that must be able to speak what last word might have to utter without having other ear than hers to listen to must have be surprised have known how much painful thought mr whittlestaff gave to matter to seemed a though have made up mind without effort be determined to abide by have thought well to marry having asked having obtained consent intended to take advantage of promise be idea of mr whittlestaff a to did not at blame be in truth changing purpose quarter of hour not changing thinking again again throughout entire day whether must not abandon happiness to romantic idea of making girl supremely happy be to do so must give up everything world must have nothing left for a to must feel slightest interest there came upon at such moment insane idea a to amount of sacrifice must be demanded of must have everything house fortune john gordon a being part of must have also whittlestaff must abolish a far a such abolition might be possible idea of suicide be abominable to be wicked cowardly inhuman if be to take place must wish to cease to live then must comfort by assuring again again that of two must certainly make better husband be older yes be pity that must be so much elder knew that be old of age one a girl like mary lawrie must hardly be brought to love passionately brought up against hard fact a sternly a must younger rival looked at in glass over over again always gave verdict against own appearance there be nothing to recommend so told judging of most unfairly set against a evil little point by mary mind mary judgment must never be affected in truth throughout thought only of welfare there came upon constantly idea that hardly knew how to be a good to a must have be have not be for catherine bailey to have attempted twice twice to have failed so disastrously be man to whom to have failed once in such matter be almost death how must bear twice still live nevertheless did endeavour to think only of welfare wo find cold dear said cold why mr whittlestaff be quite hot meant hot did mean to say hot have got parasol oh ah yes so perceive go on tommy that foolish old woman will settle down at last think to mary must make answer because according to idea mr baggett settling down must depend on master marriage think very civil of mr hall asking in way suppose be because may be sure have heard of former acquaintance with do think so not doubt about said a much to in note that young clergyman of will have told everything 'percontatorem fugito nam garrulus idem est have taught latin enough to understand mary if wish to change mind will be last opportunity heart at moment have be very tender towards have resolved that hers must be very firm to chapter xv mr whittlestaff go out to dinner must be last opportunity so mary told a got out of carriage at mr hall front door be made manifest to by such speech that did not expect that must do so looked upon doing so a within verge of possibility must still do yet not encounter disgust horror how terrible be importance to herself a believed to other man also be not justified in so thinking mr gordon have come home travelling great distance at much risk to property at great loss of time through infinite trouble danger merely to ask to be wife have letter reached from week ago bidding to come must not have gone through danger trouble how willingly must have gone be one thing that desired a far a must understand sign have given be one one thing desired have made appeal to other man a far a must understand sign have reached have be referred with confidence to decision now be told that chance of changing mind be still in power matter be one of terrible importance be importance to mr whittlestaff a great a to john gordon put altogether out of question acknowledged to herself with false humility that be nobody be poor woman living on charity be not to be thought of when position of two men be taken into consideration chanced that wanted wanted most of two must want for longest to must her service be of greater avail in assisting to happiness must there be doubt be not in human nature that must bind to younger man with go through world whether safely in danger though have have time to allow question to pas through mind between utterance of mr whittlestaff word entrance into mr hall drawing room did not in truth doubt knew that have made up mind on matter mr gordon must in probability have opportunity of saying word to let say what word might must be in vain nothing that must say nothing that must say must avail anything if other man must release then indeed must be released there be chance of such release coming in truth mary did not know how near chance be to rather how near chance have be have now positively made up mind must say not word further unless asked if mary said nothing to john gordon on evening must take opportunity before left house to inform mr hall of intended marriage when once word must have passed mouth must not live under stigma of second catherine bailey miss lawrie pray let make known to intended came from mr montagu blake who felt to be justified by peculiar circumstance in so far taking upon work of introducing guest in mr hall house of course have heard about be happiest young man in hampshire be next speak for montagu be not young man at be young man darling be next thing to how be whittlestaff said mr hall wonderful weather be be told that have be in trouble about drunken husband plague life out of respectable housekeeper of yours be trouble if be bad to how much worse must be to be true must be very bad must think miss mary why come over fine weather have tea with girl kattie forrester in wood must take chance while have young man willing to wait upon will be quite delighted said blake so will john gordon only that will be in london time to morrow said gordon be nonsense be not going to kimberley at once young lady expect to bring out lot of diamond show before start have seen diamond miss lawrie indeed said mary think must have asked just to see said evelina hall why must join name with in uncivil manner suppose that have special power to induce to show treasure when first find diamond said mr hall what do do with do ring bell call together friend begin to rejoice indeed diamond be generally washed out of mud by nigger have to look very sharp after to see that doe hide under toe nail be not very romantic kind of business from first to last only profitable said curate be a may be be subject to greater loss than preaching of sermon must like to go out see said miss hall looking into miss lawrie face also appeared to mary to be ill natured then butler announced dinner followed mr hall curate bride out of one room into other young lady said be supposed to be in ascendant just at present moment ca be married above two three time at most say to excuse to miss lawrie who ought perhaps to have post of honour to joking reply be made sat down to dinner miss lawrie be at mr hall left hand at left hand john gordon be seated mary must perceive that everything be arranged so a to throw john gordon together a though have special interest in other of mr whittlestaff saw nothing john gordon did perceive something told that as blake have be at work perception in matter be not half a sharp a of mary lawrie used to be very fond of father gordon said mr hall when dinner be half over be done gone now dear dear dear be unfortunate man perhaps expected too much from friend be very glad to see son here at rate wish be not going to settle down so far away from kimberley be long way off yes indeed when fellow get out there be apt to stay suppose will do so probably have nobody near enough to here at home to make likely that will come back have uncle aunt said mr hall one uncle two aunt will suit view cousin better by sending home diamond than by coming how long will take asked mr conversation be kept up solely between mr hall john gordon mr whittlestaff took share in unless when be asked question four girl kept up whisper with miss forrester montagu blake have share in rather good thing said gordon if must get out of so a to realise property think that six month might suffice oh dear then may have back again before year out mr whittlestaff looked up at a though apprised that danger be not yet over reflected that before twelve month be gone must certainly have made mary lawrie wife kimberley be not very alluring place said john gordon know spot on god earth must be le likely to choose a abiding resting place except for diamond except for diamond a remark therefore when man have got fill of diamond be likely to leave fill of diamond said augusta hall must like to try fill of diamond asked blake not at said evelina 'd rather have strawberry cream think must like diamond best said mary whereupon evelina suggested that younger sister be greedy little creature a soon a have got fill of diamond wo take more than six month longer suggested hall will come back again not exactly have idea of going up country across zambesi have notion must like to make way out somewhere in mediterranean egypt for instance algiers what across equator 'd never do alive thing of kind have be done stanley crossed continent not from south to north believe in have better remain at kimberley get more diamond 'd be with diamond like boy with bacon said clergyman when prepared for wish 'd have more than must eat to tell truth said john gordon quite know what must do must depend perhaps on what somebody else must join in doing life be very lonely at kimberley love being alone then why take wife said montagu blake very loudly a though have hit target right in bull eye so spoke a to bring conversation to abrupt end mr whittlestaff immediately looked conscious be man who on occasion must not look otherwise than conscious five girl with of whom question of love of john gordon mary lawrie have be fully discussed looked conscious mary lawrie be painfully conscious endeavoured to hide not unsuccessfully in endeavour have to look unnaturally stern be conscious too that did that mr hall whose feeling of romance be not perhaps of highest order looked round on mr whittlestaff mary lawrie montagu blake felt that have achieved triumph yes said if be feeling why take wife one man may not be so happy a said gordon laughing have suited admirably seem to think quite easy for man to make selection not quite such selection a mine perhaps said blake then think of difficulty do suppose that second miss forrester must dream of going to diamond field with perhaps not said blake not second miss forrester somebody else something inferior well yes inferior to miss forrester certainly be most conceited young man that ever came across said young lady be not inclined to put up with anything be very inferior said john gordon must not help eye from glancing for moment round upon mary lawrie be aware of though one else noticed in room be aware of though one watching must have said that have never looked at man may always find woman to suit if look well about said mr hall sententiously think so whittlestaff dare say may said mr whittlestaff very flatly a said so made up mind that must for day postpone task of telling mr hall of intended marriage evening passed by time came for mr whittlestaff to drive miss lawrie back to croker hall have certainly spent most uneventful period a far a action even word of own be concerned afternoon be one must never forget have be quite quite sure when came into house be more than sure now at word have be spoken have thought of of must not have known how to have chosen fit companion only for great misfortune must have be so much inferior to miss forrester must have thought inferior to one must not have preferred to other female whom world have at present moment produced oh pity of pity of then came bidding of adieu gordon be to sleep at little alresford night to take departure by early train on next morning of adieu spoken next morning need take notice only of word two uttered that night good bye mr gordon said mr whittlestaff having taken courage for occasion having thought even of necessary syllable to be spoken good bye mr whittlestaff gave rival hand in apparently friendly grasp to burning question have asked have received word of reply be question must not repeat again good bye mr gordon said mary have thought of moment much have determined at last that must trust to nothing further took hand did not say word took pressed for moment then turned face away went in from hall back to door leading to drawing room mr whittlestaff be at moment putting on great coat mary stood with bonnet cloak on at open front door listening to word two from kattie forrester evelina hall oh wish wish might have be said kattie forrester so do said evelina ca be good

back after john gordon by by said what will be address in 'oxford cambridge ' in pall mall said oh yes club there might be must have word to send to suppose will added a turned round to go away then shook hand with party in hall mounting up into carriage drove mary away homewards towards croker hall not word be spoken between for first mile did sound of sob audible suspicion of tear come from mary why did girl know secret of heart in way why have dared to express hope a to event idea a to disappointment knowledge of ought to be buried in own bosom have spoken of love for john gordon be sure that word have escaped be surmised be not customary that such surmise must be kept in dark here young lady have dared to pity for vain love a though like village maiden have gone about in tear bewailing that groom gardener have be faithless sitting thus for first mile choked to keep down sob mary at last whispered to well mr whittlestaff mary be of unhappy be not unhappy said plucking up suddenly why do say that be unhappy seem so at rate be unhappy what make so did wrong to take to dine in company with man be not for to refuse to go there be blame to in be there blame to must have be

to promised word to forbid happiness for future to make wife let heart be a might have said have come to house have eaten bread have drunk of cup have then promised to become wife now will not depart from because interloper have come between then though might have felt to be cruel still must have respected must have done a believed a other men do wished to gain object yet not appear to be cruel be so that thought of will be a must have said to herself though saw far into character did not quite read aright remained there alone in library into late hour of night did not even take up book with idea of solacing hour too have idea of self sacrifice went quite a far a hers yet be not a sure a be that self sacrifice must be duty did not believe a did in character of john gordon what if must give up to one who did not deserve to one whose future must not be stable enough to secure happiness welfare of such woman a be mary lawrie have knowledge to guide have for matter of have john gordon knowledge of what own future might be of own future mr whittlestaff must speak think with greatest confidence must be safe happy bright must mary lawrie become wife must not do so must be altogether

then left went away to room to do what be necessary knew business on be about to travel to london a well a though have discussed with whole affair in course of last two three day there have be moment in have declared to herself that be cruel there have be moment in have fainted almost with sorrow when thought of life fate have in store for there must be endless misery while there might have be joy so ecstatic in nature a to make seem to to be perennial then have almost fallen have declared to be preternaturally cruel moment have be short have endured only while have allowed to dream of ecstatic joy confessed to herself to be unfit condition of life for then have told that mr whittlestaff be not cruel that be better than weak poor flighty creature unable to look in face life reality then must be lost in amazement a thought of herself vacillation now be resolved to take part to fight battle to end when have told that be going up to london going up on business a to must tell nothing knew that behoved to prevent from taking journey john gordon must be allowed to go in quest of diamond mr whittlestaff must be persuaded not to interfere with be for sake not for john gordon that be about to make journey have asked whether be willing to marry have told that be pressing too hard must tell now now before be too late that be not so journey to london must at rate be prevented chapter xviii mr mr tookey on day arranged early on morning after dinner at little alresford park john gordon went up to london have not be much moved by intimation made to by mr whittlestaff that letter must be written to at london address have made appeal to mr whittlestaff have received no answer whatever have after fashion made appeal also to girl felt sure that plea must reach very presence then in house have be appeal to knew that so far believed in a to be conscious that must at once become wife if be willing to throw over rival knew also that loved have certainly loved did not know nature of regard be possible that must ever know that unless be wife have given promise to other man be thus read character must be true to promise without great heart break at rate intended to be true to did not for moment suspect that mr whittlestaff be false mary have declared that must not withdraw word that only from own mouth be to be taken intention of such withdrawal that such intention certainly must never utter of character understood much not quite all be not aware of depth of feeling mr whittlestaff did not understand at of vacillating softness knew nothing of moment spent with poet in be wont to fight against poet pretence of other moment spent with mr baggett in must listen to always finally reject invitation to manly strength must always pour into ear that mr whittlestaff must spend hour after hour now day after day in teaching to regard nothing what might best suit girl happiness of that be altogether in dark to thinking mr whittlestaff be hard man who having gained object intended to hold fast by what have gained john gordon knew thought that knew mary a wife must lead happier life than with mr whittlestaff thing have turned out unfortunately there be nothing for to return to diamond field therefore have gone back to london with purpose of preparing for journey man doe not start for south africa to morrow if not to morrow then next day be aware that there must be delay place must be better in to stay than neighbourhood of croker hall there be thing must be done people with whom must do of that need say nothing down at alresford therefore when got back to london meant to make arrangement did so far settle affair a to take berth on board one of mail steamer have come over in company with certain lawyer who have gone out to kimberley with view to profession have then a be case with world go to kimberley gone into diamond diamond have become more to than brief pleading have be there for fifteen year have ruined made dozen time have found diamond to be more pleasant than law to be more compatible with champagne tinned lobster young lady have married wife have parted with taken man wife paid for with diamond have then possessed nothing have afterwards come forth third part owner of important stick in mud claim at one time be paying per cent per month must be understood that stick in mud claim be almost infinitesimal portion of soil in great kimberley mine be sixteenth part of original sub division from centre of great basin rather bowl form mine there ran up two wire to high mound erected on circumference on continually two iron cage be travelling up down coming back empty going up laden with gemmiferous dirt here travelled diamond of stick in mud claim owner of one third of mr fitzwalker tookey have come home with john gordon taking first general glance at affair in diamond field doubt whether must have be inclined to suspect that john gordon fitzwalker tookey must have be likely to come together a partner in diamond speculation john gordon have in course of thing become owner of other two share when fitzwalker tookey determined to come home have done so with object of buying partner interest might have done at once only that suffered under privation of insufficiency of mean be man of great intelligence knew well that readier mode to wealth have ever presented to than purchase of partner share much be said to persuade john gordon must not part with document without seeing security for money therefore messrs gordon tookey put old stick in mud into hand of competent lawyer came home together be not at sure that will sell john gordon have said thought that offered yes for money down for sum named will sell now if start from here without completing bargain will keep option in own hand fact be know whether will remain in england return if do come back be not likely to find anything better than old stick in mud to mr tookey assented still resolved that must go home hence came to pas mr fitzwalker tookey be now in london that john gordon have to see frequently here tookey have found must be partner who have needed money be fervently desired by mr tookey john gordon might not go back to south africa two men be not at like in proclivity have be thrown together have learned much of inside life of other sort of acquaintance with whom steady man becomes intimate in such locality often surprise steady man fitzwalker tookey have antecedent education of gentleman champagne lobster supper lobster coming out of tin case diamond strange lady even with bloated cheek strong language have not altogether destroyed vestige of temple at rate be fond of companion with whom must discus english regret john gordon be not inclined to shut up altogether among precious stone to refuse conversation of man who must talk tookey have told of great distress in reference to wife by g know cruellest thing ever heard in world be little tight one night next morning be off with atkinson who got away with pocket full of diamond poor girl went down to portuguese settlement be nabbed be doing penal service now down at cape town be kind of thing doe upset fellow poor fitzwalker began to cry among such confidence gordon allowed to escape from be to become married in england did not think probable that must return thus be known at least to partner that be going to look for wife desire in mr tookey breast that wife might be forthcoming be intense well said immediately on gordon return to london what doe 'well ' mean of course went down there to look after lady have never told so did did not have told nothing about lady though be constantly asking question a fact think will go back next month to kimberley think so stake have there be of too great importance to be abandoned have money ready to pay over absolute cash on nail call that abandoning claim have gone up in value per cent a have already heard yes have gone up little not so much a that will come down a much by next mail with diamond never can stick to anything be true can only go by price a see quoted may be up per cent again by next mail at rate be going back devil be present idea a like to be on square with altogether mind saying have booked berth by kentucky castle deuce have wo take wife with be not aware that will have such impediment then fitzwalker tookey assumed very long face be difficult to trace working of such man mind to calculate meagre chance on be too often driven to base hope of success feared that must not show face in kimberley unless a representative of whole old stick in mud with object have declared in london to have actual power of disposing of gordon share gordon have gone down to hampshire must doubt be successful with young lady at rate a described to have gone in for that must see way in direction in other upon word know be what call rather throwing fellow over be a good a word know about gordon do wo hear assertion to contrary offered share for certain price rejected did not do that did do exactly then there came up in mind feeling might probably wish to change purpose be to suffer for not in least then told that must still have share for price named did not offer to one else so came home chose to come with before started again after told that offer did not hold good must not make up mind a to selling till after got to england understood that meant to be married never said so never said word about marriage be now going back mean to manage mine without asking yes will ask have two third will give for share per cent more than price offered for of share if like that need not accept offer mean to have more word about mr fitzwalker tookey face became longer longer did in truth feel to be much aggrieved within very soul there be still two line of conduct open to might move stern man by recapitulation of sorrow of circumstance might burst out into passionate wrath lay ruin to partner doing might still hope that in latter way must rouse kimberley against gordon thus creep back into vestige of property under shadow of gordon iniquity must try must first endeavour to move stern man to pity think can imagine condition in be about to place ca admit that be placing anywhere will just explain of course know can tell everything in strictest confidence know at oh yes can remember story of poor wife yes remember be in london now what got back from portuguese settlement yes did not stay there long suppose that portuguese be very nice people perhaps not at rate have much money among not after lavish expenditure of diamond field suggested gordon just so poor matilda have be accustomed to money must buy for never used to be close fisted with though sometimes must be tight a far a must understand never used to agree at think did hit off perhaps be fault used to be little free in way of living be confess be so be young then be older now have touched b s before eleven o'clock since have be in london above two three time do mean to do best can for young family be fact that mr tookey have three little child boarding out in kimberley what be lady doing in london to tell truth be at lodging oh h do admit be be indifferent to gentleman in cape town penal settlement altogether think ever really cared for to tell truth only wanted one to take away from now trust again oh dear yes completely be wife know still suppose so sacred tie have never be severed must always remember know what feeling be on subject according to view must not be severed roughly when there be child must always be borne in mind think so child must be borne in mind just so that be what mean who can look after family of young child so well a young mother men have various way of looking at matter to john gordon gave ready consent be anxious to hear in what way assistance be to be asked in again putting mr mr tookey with young child respectably on foot there be men know stand off sort of fellow who think that woman must never be forgiven must depend on how far husband have be in fault exactly now stand off sort of fellow will never admit that have be in fault at be not case drank little for matter of so did when woman drink get to bed somehow man get out upon spree be what used to do then must hit about rather recklessly have doubt matilda did get sometimes when there have be that kind of thing forgive forget be best thing can do suppose so then at field there be same sort of prudish life one be accustomed to in england here in man be nowhere if take wife back nobody know because there be plenty to know of sort there thing be not quite so strict of course ought to have gone off with atkinson vulgar low fellow too ought to have licked be just be tit for tat think be way look at at rate be living together now one can say be not man wife there will be deal of trouble saved in way great deal be man wife can begin again a though nothing have happened no one can say black white of eye will take to darling child a though nothing have happened ca conceive how anxious be to get back to there be other impediment be comfort impediment must have upset rather must have put up with mr fitzwalker tookey looked very grave high minded a made assertion there be nothing of kind be open sailing now what be to live upon just for beginning have mean out there not a thing be at present be sorry to say to tell truth third share of old stick in mud be gone have to raise money when be desirable that must come with not on account then did owe something at rate be gone now must find stranded at kimberley without red cent what can do well will explain poker hodge will buy share for sum named joshua poker who be out there have got third share poker hodge have money down when have arranged sale will undertake to give agency at one per cent on whole take for three year certain that will be l year be odd if ca float again in time gordon stood silent scratching head if 'd give agency on same term must be same thing care straw for poker hodge daresay not 'd find a true a steel what little good did at field did by looking after own business then what do propose let poker hodge have will bless for ever to mild appeal mr tookey have be brought by manner in john gordon have scratched head think be bound to do know to be brought by subsequent look appeared in john gordon eye think not men will say so care straw what men say woman to come back in same ship with wife must do field must receive gordon bethought whether imagined rejection might not arise rather from character of travelling companion to bring back mother of three little sainted babe then to walk in upon shilling of property have belonged to father never must hold up head in kimberley again must have to stand abashed before virtue yes must must be known to have come back with poor repentant wife mother of three dear babe must be known to have returned with misguided husband humanity of field must not utter word of reproval to of upon word must not like to stand in shoe how must sit opposite to look in face on journey out know must be unpleasant deuced unpleasant must say remember old roman saying 'never be conscious of anything within own bosom only think how must feel when be swelling about in kimberley while poor lady wo be able to buy pair of boot for herself child say nothing about did think be man to do did indeed gordon did find moved by diversity of light through be made to look at circumstance in question in first place there be journey back with mr tookey wife companion have not anticipated lady must probably begin by soliciting intimacy on board ship must hardly refuse with fellow passenger whose husband have be partner must quarrel bitterly be warm friend upon whole thought that must not travel to south africa with mr mr fitzwalker tookey then understood what man tongue must do if be there for month in advance whole picture of life too at field be not made attractive by mr tookey description be not afraid of reception might be accorded to mr tookey saw that tookey found able to threaten with violent evil simply because must claim own then there shot across brain reminiscence of mary lawrie comparison between life sort of life man must lead under auspex of mr tookey mary lawrie be altogether beyond reach must be better to have to think of than other to know idea of diamond field be disturbed by promised return of late partner wife mean to reduce to misery asked mr tookey care straw for misery what not for picture of misery doubt that when have be there for month will be drunk a often a ever just a free with fist when woman come in way never see be at bound to provide for for wife child have seen many ups down will be doomed to see many more a long a can get hold of bottle of wine mean to take pledge do indeed must do gradually because of constitution will do in least believe in do believe in man who think to redeem after fashion may still be possible that will not go back thank god may kill beast in buenos ayres take tea farm in thibet join colonist in tennessee in case will let know what arrangement may propose to make about kimberley claim at rate may say will not go back in

endeavour to be good companion beufficient for day be evil thereof be first of motto at rate will not go back in kentucky castle if do be afraid money be paid so be mine doe not signify have week yet

filling capacity have be taken into house almost a adopted daughter have since time have privilege accorded to have now be promoted still higher have become affianced bride that man must have turned upon thus in answer to counsel be savage at least ungracious at word heart became fuller more full of affection a for something almost divine what other man have ever shown such love for woman love be shown to who be nothing to who ate bread of charity in house amounted to that intended to give up to man who have given such proof of love of whom knew that be question of almost life death because in looking into face have met there truth of heart since first avowal made before gordon have come made at moment when such avowal from be necessary have spoken no word a to john gordon have endeavoured to show sign have given up to elder lover have endeavoured to have understood that have not intended to transfer because other man have come across path again like flash of lightning have dined in company with younger lover without exchanging word with have not allowed eye to fall upon more than must help lest expression of tenderness must be seen there not word of hope have fallen from lip when have first met because have given to be sure of herself in doubt there have come moment in have hoped nay almost expected that elder of two might give up when have felt sure that be not to be so

a though hesitated a sat there under spell of little hand upon shoulder in truth did hesitate must not be that must be allowed to sit there day have hand about neck somewhat after fashion be bound to give up what be that ordinary selfishness allowed what depth of self indulgence amounted to wickedness man must not permit to enjoy without absolutely hating must be easy in case to have that wanted need not send letter need not take wretched journey to london looking forward a thought that must look judging from girl character believed that must have that desired that gracious god must give if must make recognised partner of bed board then must be proud when men must see what sort of wife have got for at last in place of catherine bailey why must not love did not word tend to show that

surrendered to girl whom loved so dearly must be well for in truth there be nothing of christian charity in heart towards john gordon thought at last that must be better that must announce purpose in

at club door chapter xxi green park asked whether mr john gordon be within in two minute found standing in hall with hero of romance mr whittlestaff told a looked at man that be such hero a ought to be happy in love whereas of be conscious of personal appearance girl must be expected to adore thought too much of personal appearance generally complaining to that be mean whereas in regard to mary
