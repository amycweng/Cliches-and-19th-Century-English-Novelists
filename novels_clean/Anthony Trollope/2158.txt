thing never never mr sextus parker be much discontented with so that when got home that evening to wife of bosom little family at ponders end by mean made agreeable to for sum of l sat upon bosom a ate supper lay upon chest a slept like nightmare chapter ii everett wharton on same day lopez dined with friend everett wharton at new club called progress of be member progress be certainly new club having a yet be open hardly more than three year still be old enough to have seen many of hope of early youth become dim with age inaction for progress have intended to do great thing for liberal party rather for political liberality in general have in truth done little nothing have be got up with considerable enthusiasm for while certain fiery politician have believed that through instrumentality of institution men of genius spirit natural power without wealth meaning always must be supplied with sure seat in parliament probable share in government such result have be achieved there have be want of something deficiency felt not yet defined have hitherto be fatal young men said be because old stager who knew way of pulling wire must come forward put club in proper groove old men said be because young men be pretentious puppy be however not to be doubted that party of progress have become slack that liberal politician of country although special new club have be opened for furtherance of view be not at present making much way what want be organization said one of leading young men organization be not a yet forthcoming club nevertheless went on way like other club men dined smoked played billiards pretended to read few energetic member still hoped that good day must come in grand idea might be realised a regarded member generally be content to eat drink play billiards be fairly good club with sprinkling of liberal lordlings couple of dozen of member of parliament who have be made to believe that must neglect party duty unless paid money usual assortment of barrister attorney city merchant idle men be good enough at rate for ferdinand lopez who be particular about dinner have opinion of own about wine have be heard to assert for real quiet comfort there be not club in london equal to hearer be not aware that in past day have be blackballed at t g be accident lopez have gift of keeping in background present companion everett wharton have a well a be original member wharton have be one of who have hoped to find in club stepping stone to high political life who now talked often with idle energy of need of organization for myself said lopez can conceive vainer object of ambition than seat in british parliament what doe man gain by few who be successful work very hard for little pay thanks nearly equally hard for pay a little thanks many who fail sit idly for hour undergoing weary task of listening to platitude enjoy in return now absolutely valueless privilege of having mp written on letter somebody must make law for country see necessity think country must do uncommonly well if be to know that old law must be altered new law made for next twenty year must have repealed corn law there be corn law to repeal now modify income tax must modify nothing at rate whether law be to be altered to be left be comfort to that need not put finger into pie there be one benefit indeed in being in house ca be arrested well that a far a go one other assist man in getting seat a director of certain company people be still such ass that trust board of director made up of member of parliament therefore of course member be made welcome if want to get into house why arrange with father instead of waiting for what club may do for father must pay shilling for purpose be never in house therefore despises little of perhaps man ever worked harder than did in way more successfully having seen one after of junior become member of parliament while stuck to attorney there be perhaps little jealousy about from what see of way live at home must think father must do anything for with proper management there be doubt suppose that must afford father never in life said anything to about own money affair though say great deal about mine man ever be closer than father believe that must afford almost anything wish have father said ferdinand lopez think must succeed in ascertaining extent of capability in making use of too wharton nearly asked friend almost summoned courage to ask whether father have done much for be very intimate on one subject in lopez be much interested confidence have be very close younger weaker man of two must not quite bring to point of making inquiry thought must be disagreeable lopez have never before in intercourse hinted at possibility of having having have filial aspiration have be a though have be created sufficient independent of mother milk father money now question might have be asked almost naturally be not asked everett wharton be trouble to father not agonizing trouble a be son fault be not of nature to rob father cup of sweetness to bring grey hair with sorrow to grave old wharton have never have to ask whether must now at length let son fall into lowest abyss whether must yet again struggle to put on leg again forgive again pay debt again endeavour to forget dishonour place to score of thoughtless youth have be so think that if not on first second fall certainly on third young man must have gone into abyss for mr wharton be stern man capable of coming to clear conclusion on thing be nearest even dearest to everett wharton have simply shown to be inefficient to earn own bread have never declined even to do have simply be inefficient have not declared either by word action that a father be rich man a be only son must therefore hing have tried hand thrice in case after short trial have assured father friend that thing have not suited leaving oxford without degree for reading of school did not suit have gone into banking house by mean a mere clerk with expressed proposition from father backed by assent of partner that must work way up to wealth great commercial position six month taught that banking be abomination at once went into course of reading with barrister remained at till be called for man may be called with very little continuous work after be called solitude of chamber be too much for at twenty five found that stock exchange be mart in world for such talent energy a possessed what be nature of failure during year that went into city be known only to father unless ferdinand lopez knew something of also at six twenty stock exchange be also abandoned now at eight twenty everett wharton have discovered that parliamentary career be that for nature special genius have intended have probably suggested to father have met with cold rebuff everett wharton be good looking manly fellow six foot high with broad shoulder with light hair wearing large silky bushy beard made look older than year who neither by speech by appearance must ever be taken for fool who showed by very action of body a well a by play of face that lacked firmness of purpose certainly be fool have read much though generally forgot what read there be left with from reading certain nebulous light begotten by other men thinking enabled to talk on most subject can not be said of that did much thinking for thought that thought believed of that have gone rather deep into politics that be entitled to call many statesman ass because did not see thing saw have great question of labour refers to union strike lock out quite at finger end knew how church of england must be disestablished recomposed be quite clear on question of finance saw to t how progress must be made towards communism so that violence must disturb that progress that in due course of century desire for personal property must be conquered annihilated by philanthropy so general a hardly to be accounted virtue in meantime must never contrive to pay tailor bill regularly out of allowance of l year father made be always dreaming of comfort of handsome income be popular man certainly very popular with woman to whom be always courteous generally liked by men to whom be genial good natured though be not aware of fact be very dear to father who in own silent way almost admired certainly liked openness guileless freedom of character be very opposite to own father though have never said word to flatter son did in truth give offspring credit for greater talent than possessed even when appearing to scorn must listen to young man diatribe almost with satisfaction everett be very dear also to sister who be only other living member of branch of wharton family much will be said of in page be hoped that reader may take interest in fate here in speaking of brother may suffice to say that sister who be endowed with infinitely finer gift than did give credit to somewhat pretentious claim of le noble brother indeed have be perhaps misfortune with everett wharton that people have believed in further misfortune that others have thought worth while to pretend to believe in among latter might probably be reckoned friend with whom be now dining at progress man may flatter a lopez occasionally did flatter wharton without preconcerted falsehood suit one man to be well with one learns gradually perhaps unconsciously way to take advantage of foible of other now be most material to lopez that must stand well with member of wharton family a aspired to hand of daughter of house of regard have already thought nearly sure of father sanction to marriage have reason to be almost more than doubtful brother be friend in such circumstance man be almost justified in flattering brother will tell what be lopez said wharton a strolled out of club together little after ten o'clock men of present day wo give trouble to occupy mind with matter have must have real interest pope knew about when said that 'the proper study of mankind be man ' people read pope now if do take trouble to understand men be too busy making money dear fellow be just money be very nice thing very nice said lopez search after be debasing if man must make money for four six even eight hour day then wash mind of pursuit a clerk in office wash copy ledger out of mind then must never make money in way keep therefore whole thing be debasing man cease to care for great interest of world even to be aware of existence when whole soul be in spanish bond wanted to make banker of found that must kill must kill think if have to confine to spanish bond know what mean at rate can understand though fear be too far gone to abandon idea of making fortune must abandon to morrow if must come into fortune ready made man must at rate eat yes must eat be not quite sure said wharton thoughtfully that need think about what eats unless beef be sent up without horse radish have happened that when two men sat down to dinner insufficient quantity of vegetable supplied by steward of club have be consumed wharton have complained of grievance man have right to for have paid said wharton with mock solemnity if pass over laches of nature without observation doe injury to humanity at large be not going to be caught in trap know because like horse radish with beef well ca go farther out of way a have deal of reading to do before court morpheus if will take advice will go straight to governor emily may feel think will say much to encourage unless go about after fashion have prim notion of own perhaps be not after so much amiss when man want to marry girl god forbid must think that anything about sister be amiss think there be much woman be generally superficial be honestly superficial dishonestly emily at rate be honest stop half moment then sauntered arm in arm down broad pavement leading from pall mall to duke of york column wish must make out father more clearly be always civil to have cold way of looking at make think be not in good book be like to everybody never seem to get beyond skin with must have heard speak of in absence never say very much about anybody word must let know how land lie know well enough to be aware that be last man to be curious a to what others think of indeed care about a much a man must do be utterly indifferent to opinion of world at large must never object to company of pleasant person because pleasant person abused behind back what value be pleasantness of man not liking disliking for here dearest aim of life be concerned might be guided either way that to great advantage by knowing whether stand well ill with have dined three time within last three month in manchester square know other man certainly other young man who have have such strong proof of intimacy from father yes know advantage have be there a friend not a doe care twopence about friend wanted to give charlie skate dinner father must have at price charlie skate be out at elbow bet at billiards be respectable at rate father think so father be more anxious about than be aware of wish to make house pleasant to a long a can do so to advantage a far a be concerned rather approves of fancying that turn for making money be stronger than turn for spending nevertheless look upon a friend of yours rather than own though have given three dinner in three month own greatness of hospitality suppose ever said word in favour wish knew what doe say say know nothing about oh be be then can know harm when next say so ask of how many of men who dine at house can say a much good night wo keep longer can tell if between can manage to handle rightly may get seat in parliament may get wife be of course if will have then parted lopez remained in pathway walking up down by side of old military club thinking of thing certainly knew friend younger wharton intimately appreciating man good quality being fully aware of man weakness by question have extracted quite enough to assure that emily be father must be adverse to proposition have not felt much doubt before now be certain doe know much about said musing to well no doe there be very much that can tell of course be wise a wisdom go then wise men do do foolish thing at interval discreetest of city banker be talked out of money most scrupulous of matron be talked out of virtue most experienced of statesman be talked out of principle who can really calculate chance men who lead forlorn hope generally push through without being wounded fifth sixth heir come to title so much said palpably though to with inner voice then impalpably with even inner voice asked what chance might have of prevailing with girl herself almost ventured to tell that in direction need not despair in very truth loved girl reverenced believing to be better higher nobler than other human being a man doe when be in love so believing have doubt a to own success such reverence produce chapter iii mr abel wharton qc lopez be not man to let grass grow under foot when have anything to do when be tired of walking backwards forward over same bit of pavement subject while to cold east wind went home thought of same matter while lay in bed even be to get girl assurance of love without father consent might find from object than ever mr wharton be man of old fashion who must think ill used daughter ill used who must think also that general offence must have be committed against good social manner if daughter be to be asked for hand without previous consent must absolutely refuse why then battle though must be desperate battle might perhaps be fought with other strategy giving to matter best consideration lopez thought expedient to go at once to father in doing must have silly tremor might feel in speaking to girl have sufficient self confidence to be able to ask father if not with assurance at rate without trepidation be thought probable that father at first attack must neither altogether accede altogether refuse disposition of man be averse to probability of absolute reply at first moment lover imagined that might be possible for to take advantage of period of doubt must thus be created mr wharton be have for great many year be barrister practising in equity court rather in one equity court for throughout life work now extending to nearly fifty year have hardly ever gone out of single vice chancellor court be much better known by mr wharton name than by of le eminent judge who now sat there have be very peculiar very toilsome yet probably very satisfactory life have begun practice early have worked in stuff gown till be nearly sixty at time have amassed large fortune mainly from profession partly also by careful use of own small patrimony by wife money men knew that be rich one knew extent of wealth when submitted to take silk gown declared among friend that did so a step preparatory to

foot twice week on wednesday saturday dined at old law club eldon played whist after dinner till twelve o'clock be great dissipation think chief charm of life in middle of august daughter usually went for month to wharton hall in herefordshire seat of cousin sir alured wharton be one duty of life be burthen to have be made to believe that be essential to health to wife then to girl health that must summer leave town for time where else be to go sir alured be relation gentleman emily liked wharton hall be proper thing hated wharton hall then did not know place out of london that must not hate worse have once be induced to go up rhine have never repeated experiment of foreign travel emily sometimes went abroad with cousin during period be supposed that old lawyer spent good deal of time at eldon be spare thin strongly made man with spare light brown hair hardly yet grizzled with small grey whisker clear eye bushy eyebrow with long ugly nose on young barrister have be heard to declare that might hang small kettle with considerable vehemence of talk when be opposed in argument for with well known coolness of temper mr wharton must become very hot in argument when nature of case in hand required heat on one subject who knew be agreed be thorough lawyer many doubted eloquence declared that have known well extent of own power in abstaining from seeking higher honour of profession one doubted law have once written book on mortgage of stock in trade have be in early life have never since dabbled in literature be certainly man of whom men be generally afraid at whist table one must venture to scold in court one ever contradicted in own house though be very quiet servant dreaded to offend be attentive to slightest behest when condescended to ride with acquaintance in park be always acknowledged that old wharton be to regulate pace name be abel life have be known a able abe silent far seeing close fisted just old man who be not however by mean deficient in sympathy with suffering with joy of humanity be easter time court be not sitting mr wharton be in chamber a matter of course at ten o'clock knew real homely comfort elsewhere unless at whist table at eldon ate drank slept in own house in manchester square must hardly be said to live there be not there that mind be awake that power of man be exercised when came up from dining room to join daughter after dinner must get to sing song must then seat with book never read in own house invariably falling into sweet placid slumber from be never disturbed till daughter kissed a went to bed then must walk about room look at watch shuffle uneasily through hour till conscience allowed to take to chamber be man of pursuit in own house from ten in morning till five often till six in evening mind be active in work be not now all law a used to be in drawer of old piece of furniture stood just at right hand of own arm chair there be various book hidden away be sometimes ashamed to have seen by client poetry novel even fairy tale for there be nothing mr wharton must not read in chamber though there be nothing that must read in own house have large pleasant room in to sit looking out from ground floor of stone building on to garden belonging to inn here in centre of metropolis in perfect quiet a far a outside world be concerned have lived still lived life at about noon on day following that on lopez have made sudden swoop on mr parker have then dined with everett wharton called at stone building be shown into lawyer room quick eye at once discovered book mr wharton half hid away saw upon mr mudie suspicious ticket barrister certainly never get law book from mudie lopez at once knew that hoped for father in law have be reading novel have not suspected such weakness argued well from for business have in hand there must be soft spot to be found about heart of old lawyer who spent morning in such occupation how do do sir said mr wharton rising from seat hope see well sir though have be reading novel tone manner be very cold lopez have never be in stone building before be not quite sure that might not have committed offence in coming there take seat mr lopez be there anything can do for in way there be great deal must be done in way a father how be to be introduced case made clear lopez did not know whether old man have a yet ever suspected feeling a now intended to declare have be intimate at house in manchester square have certainly ingratiated very closely with certain mr roby who have be mr wharton sister constant companion who lived in berkeley street close round corner from manchester square spent very much of time with emily wharton be together daily a though mr roby have assumed part of second mother lopez be well aware that mr roby knew of love if there be real confidence between mr roby old lawyer old lawyer must know also a to lopez felt that be in dark task of speaking to old father be not unpleasant when lover know that have be smiled upon in fact approved for last six month be going to be patted on back made much of received into family be to be told that mary augusta have be best daughter in world will therefore certainly be best wife will probably on special occasion be spoken of with unqualified praise will be pleasant subject be one very difficult to broach when previous light have be thrown on ferdinand lopez however be not man to stand shivering on brink when plunge be necessary therefore made plunge mr wharton have taken liberty to call upon here because want to speak to about daughter about daughter old man surprise be quite genuine of course when have given moment to think knew what must be nature of visitor communication up to moment have never mixed daughter ferdinand lopez in thought together now idea having come upon looked at aspirant with severe unpleasant eye be manifest to aspirant that first flash of thing be painful to father yes sir know how great be presumption yet having ventured will hardly say to entertain hope to have come to such state can only be happy by hoping have thought best to come to at once doe know anything of of visit to nothing of intention of suit generally be to understand that have sanction from none at have told anything of not word come to ask for permission to address mean that have knowledge whatever of preference for can not say that be hardly possible that must have learned to love a do without consciousness on part that be so what mean be without beating about bush have be making love to who be to say in what making love consists mr wharton d sir gentleman know gentleman know whether have be playing on girl feeling gentleman when be asked a have asked will at rate tell truth want definition have be making love to think mr wharton have behaved like gentleman that will acknowledge at least so much when come to know exactly what have done what have not done have endeavoured to commend to daughter have never spoken word of love to doe everett know of yes have encouraged know of because be most intimate friend whoever lady might have be must have told be attached to must not think on own account object to call brother spoke to yesterday on matter very plainly told that ought certainly to see first quite agreed with therefore be here there have certainly be nothing in conduct to make angry think that there have be anything in mine there be dignity of demeanour quiet assured courage have effect upon old lawyer felt that must not storm talk in ambiguous language of what gentleman must must not do might disapprove of man altogether a son in law at present moment thought that did still man be entitled to civil answer how be lover to approach lady of love in manner more respectful than mr lopez said must forgive if say that be comparatively stranger to be accident must be easily cured if will in direction be a good a mine perhaps be one have to be explicit in matter daughter happiness be very serious consideration people among whom confess be one consider like must marry like must wish to see daughter marry not only in own sphere higher lower with one of own class hardly know mr wharton whether be intended to exclude well to tell truth know nothing about know who father be whether be englishman whether be christian whether be protestant not even whether be gentleman be question must not dream of asking under other circumstance must be matter with must have possible concern if be simply acquaintance when talk to man about daughter acknowledge freely right of inquiry know nothing of mean nothing understand that live a man of fortune presume that earn bread know nothing of way in earn nothing of certainty amount of mean thing be of course matter for inquiry may presume that have objection satisfactory answer to such question may not remove will never willingly give daughter to one who be not son of english gentleman may be prejudice be feeling father be certainly not english gentleman be portuguese in admitting in thus subjecting at once to one clearly stated ground of objection objection being one though admitted carried with fault disgrace lopez felt that have got certain advantage must not get over fact that be son of portuguese parent by admitting that openly thought might avoid present discussion on matter might perhaps be more disagreeable to need not allude if accident of birth be to be taken by father a settling question mother be english lady added father certainly be not englishman never have common happiness of knowing of be orphan before understood what be to have parent be said with pathos for moment stopped expression of further harsh criticism from lawyer mr wharton must not instantly repeat objection to parentage be matter for such melancholy reflection felt at same time that a have luckily landed on positive undeniable ground of objection to match be distasteful to must be unwise for to go to other matter in might be le successful by doing so must seem to abandon ground have already made good thought probable that man might have adequate income yet did not wish to welcome a son in law thought possible that portuguese father might be portuguese nobleman therefore one whom must be driven to admit to have be in sort gentleman yet man who be now in presence whom continued to scan with closest observation be not what called gentleman foreign blood be proved must suffice a looked at lopez thought that detected jewish sign be afraid to make allusion to religion lest lopez must declare that ancestor have be noted a christian since st james first preached in peninsula be educated altogether in england continued lopez till be sent to german university in idea that language of continent be not generally well learned in country can never be sufficiently thankful to guardian for doing so dare say dare say french german be very useful have prejudice of own in favour of greek latin rather fancy picked up more greek latin at bohn than must have got here have stuck to nothing else dare say dare say may be admirable crichton for what know have not intended to make boast sir simply to vindicate who have care of education if have objection except founded on birth be accident when one man be peer ploughman be accident one doe find fault with ploughman one doe ask to dinner accident said lopez smiling be one must hardly discover unless be told have called talbot must not know be a good englishman a man of course may be taken in by falsehood said lawyer if have other objection than raised hope will allow to visit in manchester square there may be ten thousand other objection mr lopez really think that one be enough of course know nothing of daughter feeling must imagine that matter be a strange to a be to can not give anything like encouragement if be ever to have son in law must wish to have english son in law even know what profession be be engaged in foreign loan very precarious must think sort of gambling be be business by many of greatest mercantile house in city have be made dare say dare say by come to ruin have greatest respect in world for mercantile enterprise have have a much to do a most men with mercantile question ai sure that wish to marry daughter in city of course be prejudice wo deny on general subject can give a much latitude a man when one own hearth be attacked surely such proposition a mine mr wharton be attack in sense be when man proposes to assault invade very kernel of man heart to share with indeed to take from very dearest of possession to become part parcel with for infinite good infinite evil then man have right to guard even prejudice a precious bulwark mr wharton a said be walking about room with hand in trowsers pocket have always be for absolute toleration in matter of religion have always advocated admission of roman catholic jew into parliament even to bench in ordinary life never question man religion be nothing to whether belief in mahomet have belief at when man come to for daughter have always belonged to church of england said ferdinand lopez lopez be at rate bad name to go to protestant church with want daughter to bear be very frank with a in such matter men ought to understand other personally have liked well enough have be glad to see at house everett have seemed to be friend have have objection to make marrying into family be very serious

may have own idea about own family mr lopez feel perfectly certain that child will hing to displease must displease if be to talk for hour must say nothing further hope may be able to present thing to in aspect so altered said lopez a prepared to take leave a to make change mind possibly possibly said wharton think probable good morning to sir if have said anything have seemed to be unkind put down to anxiety a father not to conduct a man then door be closed behind visitor mr wharton be left walking up down room alone be by mean satisfied with felt that have be rude at same time not decisive have not explained to man a must wish to have done that be monstrous out of question that daughter of wharton one of oldest family in england must be given to friendless portuguese probable jew about whom nobody knew anything then remembered that sooner later girl must have at least l fact of human being be aware must not be well that somebody must be made aware of so that girl might have chance of suitor preferable to swarthy son of judah began to be afraid a thought of that be not managing matter well how must be with if must find that girl be really in love with swarthy son of judah have

antagonistic to such alliance a of marriage seems to be friend of yours have better make understand that be quite out of question have told so have better repeat so saying mr wharton went upstairs to dress everett having received father instruction went away to club when mr wharton reached drawing room found mr roby alone at once resolved to discus matter with before spoke to daughter harriet said

shy of making such assertion a to own feeling before due time for doing so have come think prefers to anybody else that be to propose to herself must give consent to go to will never enter house again

upon word be too bad papa wo aunt come down to dinner said emily opening door gently then went down to dinner during meal nothing be said about mr lopez be not very merry together poor emily felt sure that own affair have be discussed in troublesome manner chapter v one know anything about at dinner on evening at manchester square after dinner a long a mr roby remained in house be word said about lopez by mr wharton remained longer than usual with bottle of port wine in dining room when went upstairs sat down fell asleep almost without sign did not ask for song did emily offer to sing a soon a mr roby be gone roby went home round corner somewhat earlier than usual then mr wharton woke up instantly made inquiry of daughter there have however be few word spoken on subject between mr roby niece have served to prepare emily for what be coming lopez have be to father said mr roby in voice not specially encouraging for such occasion then paused moment niece said nothing continued yes father have be blaming a if have done anything if did not mean to choose for why did keep closer look out have chosen one aunt harriet well to speak fairly thought have have nothing to say against choice a young men go think mr lopez be a good a best of know why must have of course will have money then suppose make large income a to mr fletcher care bit about not in way certainly doubt papa will have out with just now so have better make up mind what will say to if really like man see why must say so stick to have made regular offer girl in day be not expected to be father slave emily said nothing further to aunt on occasion finding that must in truth have out with father presently gave up to reflection might probably be case that whole condition of future life must depend on way in might now have out with father must not wish reader to be prejudiced against miss wharton by not unnatural feeling may perhaps be felt in regard to aunt mr roby be pleased with little intrigue be addicted to amusement of fostering love affair be fond of being thought to be useful in such matter be not averse to having present given to have married vulgar man though have not become like man have become vulgar be not eligible companion for mr wharton daughter matter a to father have not given proper opportunity of learning fact aunt in close neighbourhood be so great comfort to so ready so natural assistance to in difficulty emily wharton be not in least like aunt have mr wharton be at like mr roby doubt contact be dangerous injury have perhaps already be done may be that slightest soil have already marred pure white of girl natural character if so stain be a yet too impalpable to be visible to ordinary eye emily wharton be tall fair girl with grey eye rather exceeding average proportion a well a height of woman feature be regular handsome form be perfect be by manner voice that conquered rather than by beauty by gift by clearness of intellect joined with feminine sweetness have most frequent foundation in self denial who knew well have become attached to be apt to endow with virtue to give credit for loveliness stranger did not find on face a light up house with brightest lamp for comer so neither did emit from eye brightest spark till special occasion for such shining have arisen to who be allowed to love woman be more lovable there be innate in appreciation of own position a woman with principle of self denial a human being be beyond power of mr roby to destroy even to defile by small stain like other girl have be taught to presume that be destiny to be married like other girl have thought much about destiny young man generally regard a destiny to succeed to fail in world think about to marriage when come be accident to have hardly a yet given thought to girl matrimony be be not to be destiny contains within only success failure anticipates young man may become lord chancellor at rate earn bread comfortably a county court judge girl can look forward to little else than chance of having good man for husband good man if taste lie in direction rich man emily wharton have doubtless thought about thing sincerely believed that have found good man in ferdinand lopez man certainly be one strangely endowed with power of creating belief when going to mr wharton at chamber have not intended to cheat lawyer into erroneous idea about family have resolved that must so discus question of own condition must probably be raised a to leave upon old man mind unfounded conviction that in regard to money income have reason to fear question not word have be said about money income mr wharton have felt bound to abstain from allusion to such matter from assured feeling that must not in direction plant enduring objection in way lopez have carried point with mr wharton have convinced mr roby that among girl attraction greatest attraction for be fact that be mr roby niece have made emily believe that one strong passion of life be love for have done without ever having asked for love have even taken trouble to allure dick have listened to have talked whole page out of bell life on own behalf must be acknowledged that did love girl a well perhaps a be capable of loving one have found out many particular a to mr wharton money before have allowed to love a soon a mr roby have gathered up knitting declared a always did on such

wish knew better than do want to know better be not that prejudice papa dear emily said mr wharton striving to wax into anger that might be firm against think that becomes to ask father question a that ought to believe that be chief object of life to do best can for child be sure be ought to feel that a have have long experience in world judgment about young man might be trusted be statement miss wharton be not prepared to admit have already professed willing to submit to father judgment did not now by mean contemplate rebellion against parental authority did feel that on matter so vital to have right to plead cause before judgment must be given be not slow to assure even a interview went on that love for man be strong enough to entitle to assure father that happiness depended on reversal of sentence already pronounced know papa that trust said have promised will not disobey if tell that be never to see mr lopez again will not see be good girl be always good girl think that

will not before quite decide leaned against a spoke kissed good night now papa will think about will will of course will began process of thinking about immediately before door be closed behind what be there to think about nothing that have said altered in least idea about man be a convinced a ever that unless there be much to conceal there must not be so much concealment feeling began to grow upon already that daughter have mode of pleading with must not ultimately be able to resist have power knew of putting end to thing altogether have only to say resolutely unchangeably that thing must be must be if must steel heart against daughter sorrow for say twelvemonth victory must be won already began to fear that lacked power to steel heart against daughter chapter vi old friend go to windsor be going to make now question be asked of husband by lady with whom perhaps reader of volume may have already formed acquaintance chronicle of early life have be written at rate copiously lady be duchess of omnium husband be of course duke in order that nature of question asked by duchess may be explained must be stated just at time political affair of nation have got tied up into one of truly desperate knot from even wisdom experience of septuagenarian statesman can see unravelment head of party be at standstill in house of common there be so to say majority on side mind of member be so astray that according to best calculation must be made there must be majority of about ten against possible cabinet there must certainly be majority against of tried at moment little trusted prime minister mr gresham mr daubeny there be certain men nominally belonging to to other party who must certainly within week of nomination of cabinet in house oppose cabinet ought to support mr daubeny have be in power nay be in power though have twice resigned mr gresham have be twice sent for to windsor have on one occasion undertaken on have refused to undertake to form ministry mr daubeny have tried two three combination have be at wit end be doubt still in power must appoint bishop make peer give away ribbon must pas law certainly continued to hold present uncomfortable position by will of own prime minister can not escape till have succeeded in finding successor though successor be found consent to make attempt old unfortunate can not be allowed to go free when attempt be shown to be failure have not absolutely given up key of box one will take from even sovereign can abdicate prime minister of constitutional government be in bond reader may therefore understand that duchess be asking husband what place among political ruler of country have be offered to by last aspirant to leadership of government reader must understand more than may perhaps do so if have ever seen former chronicle to allusion have be made duke before became duke have held very high office having be chancellor of exchequer when be transferred perforce to house of lord have a be not uncommon in such case accepted lower political station have displeased duchess who be ambitious on own behalf that of lord who thought that duke of omnium must be nothing in government if not at rate near top after with simple single object of doing special piece of work for nation something fancied that nobody else must do if did do grace of own motion at own solicitation have encountered further official degradation very much to disgust of duchess be not way with grace to hide such sorrow in depth of bosom when affronted must speak out whether to husband to using irony rather than argument to support cause to vindicate way shaft of ridicule hurled by against husband in regard to voluntary abasement have be many sharp stung never for moment influenced though stung did not even anger be nature to say such thing knew that came rather from uncontrolled spirit than from malice be wife too have idea that of little injury of sort there must be end of bearing on part of husband sometimes must endeavour to explain to motif actuated have come to fear that be must ever be unintelligible to credited with le than real intelligence did understand nature of work reason for doing after own fashion did what conceived to be own work in endeavouring to create within bosom desire for higher thing surely said to herself if man of rank be to be minister must be great minister at rate a great a circumstance will make man never can save country by degrading in must probably have agreed idea of degradation hers hardly tallied when therefore asked what be going to make be a though sarcastic housekeeper in great establishment must ask butler butler too prone to yield in such matter whether master have appointed lately to cleaning of shoe carrying of coal since knot have become so very tight since journey to windsor have become so very frequent grace have asked many such question have received very indifferent reply duke have sometimes declared that matter be not ripe enough to allow to make answer of course said duchess must keep secret editor of evening paper have known for above hour at time told that have undertaken to give mr gresham assistance in way in might be asked joint under secretary with lord fawn must say answered duchess then told that believed attempt must be made at mixed ministry that did not in least know to whom work of doing so must be confided will be about last man who will be told replied duchess now at moment have a knew come direct from house of mr gresham asked question in usual spirit be going to make now did not answer question in usual manner must customarily smile gently at badinage perhaps say word intended to show that be not in least moved by raillery in instance be very grave stood before moment making answer at looking at in sad almost solemn manner have told that can do without said breaking out almost into passion knew how must be men be always valued by others a value wish be so replied must sleep easier to night what be plantagenet exclaimed jumping up from chair never cared for ridicule hitherto cora now feel that want sympathy if be going to do anything to do really anything will have oh how will have have received majesty order to go down to windsor at once must start within hour be going to be prime minister exclaimed a spoke threw arm up then rushed into embrace never since first union have be so demonstrative either of love admiration oh plantagenet said if can only do anything will slave for a put arm round waist already felt pleasantness of altered way to have never worshipped yet therefore worship when did come have delight to ordinarily have to newly married hero stop moment cora know how may be yet know that if without cowardice must avoid task must certainly avoid oh there must be cowardice of course there must said duchess not much caring what might be bond bound to task so long a must certainly feel to be bound have told that think duty to make attempt who be mr gresham know must have felt bound by duke said so also duke be duke old friend duke of st bungay be there who else one else be case for exultation cora for chance be that will fail duke have promised to help on condition that one two have named be included that one two whom have also named be not in case must myself have done exactly a proposes mr gresham will retire be matter of course will intend to support be veiled in obscurity be always think darker a to future of politics than other future cloud arise one know not why whence create darkness when one expected light a yet must understand nothing be settled can not even say what answer may make to majesty till know what command majesty may lay upon must keep hold of now plantagenet said duchess clenching own fist will not even close finger on with personal ambition said duke if must be relieved from burden moment must be ease to heart remember once said a spoke again put arm around waist when be debarred from taking office by domestic circumstance remember that too said speaking very gently looking up at be grief to at time though turned out so well because office then suggested to be one thought must fill with credit to country believed in then a far a work went for attempt have belief in doubt whether have gift for governing men will come may be must try may be must break heart because fail will make attempt if be directed to do so in manner that will seem feasible must be off now duke be to be here evening have better have dinner ready for whenever may be able to eat then took departure before must say word when duchess be alone took to thinking of whole thing in manner who best knew must have thought to be very unusual with already possessed that rank wealth must give together with good thing peculiar position of own of be proud have made own not by wealth rank by certain fearless energy power of raillery never deserted many feared be afraid of none many also loved whom also loved for nature be affectionate be happy with child happy with friend in enjoyment of perfect health capable of taking exaggerated interest in anything might come uppermost for moment one must have be inclined to say that politics be altogether unnecessary to that a duchess of omnium lately known a lady glencora palliser have wider pleasanter influence than must belong to woman a wife of prime minister be essentially one of woman who be not contented to be known simply a wife of husband have celebrity of own quite independent of position must not be enhanced by glory power added to nevertheless when left to go down to queen with prospect of being called upon to act a chief of incoming ministry heart throbbed with excitement have come at last must be to thinking leading man in greatest kingdom in world felt in regard to somewhat a did lady macbeth towards lord what thou wouldbet highly that wouldbet thou holily knew to be full of scruple unable to bend when aught be to be got by bending unwilling to domineer when men might be brought to subjection only by domination first duty never must be taught to to win support by smile when heart be bitter within must never be within power of husband must never be brought to buy enemy by political gift must never be prone to silence keenest opponent by making right hand supporter other lesson be easier might thought be learned power be so pleasant that men quickly learn to be greedy in enjoyment of to flatter that patriotism requires to be imperious must be constant with day night to make understand that duty to country required to be in very truth chief ruler then with knowledge of thing a be also with much ignorance reflected that have at command mean of obtaining popularity securing power have not belonged to immediate predecessor have perhaps never to same extent be at command of minister in england wealth a duke of omnium have be great hers a available for immediate purpose have be greater even than after fashion of be profoundly ignorant own property be separated from reserved to herself child since marriage have never said word to about money unless be to ask that something out of common course might be spent on generally absurd object now have come time for squandering money be not only rich have popularity be exclusively own new prime minister new prime minister wife must entertain after fashion have never yet be known even among nobility of england in town country great mansion must be kept open be now rarely much used because have found dull cold comfortless in london there must not be member of parliament whom must not herself know influence by flattery grace if there be men whom must not influence must live a men tabooed unfortunate money mattered nothing income be enormous for series of year for dozen year if game must be kept up so long must spend treble what called income without real injury to child vision passed through brain of wondrous thing might be done if only husband must be true to own greatness duke have left about two did not stir out of house that day in course of afternoon wrote line to friend who lived not very far from duchess dwelt in carlton terrace friend in park lane note be a follows dear m come to at once be too excited to go to yours g be addressed to one mr finn lady a to whom chronicle also have be written who have be known to reader of such chronicle a friend dearly loved by duchess a quickly a must put on carriage garment get taken to carlton terrace mr finn be there well dear how do think be settled at last said duchess will probably be felt that new prime minister wife be indiscreet hardly worthy of confidence placed in by husband surely have one friend to whom tell everything with duchess mr finn be that one friend be duke to be prime minister how on earth must have guessed that what else must make so excited besides be by mean strange understand that have gone on trying two old stager till be useless to try longer if there be to be fresh man one must be more likely than duke do think so certainly why not have frittered away political position by such meaningless concession then have never done anything to put forward at rate since left house of common perhaps have read thing right be surprised very much surprised gratified oh yes can tell everything because will misunderstand tell tale of yes will like to be prime minister though know that will have bad time of why bad time be so hard to manage of course mean about politics of course must be mixed kind of thing at first care straw whether run to radicalism toryism country go on own way for better for worse whichever of be in think make difference a to what sort of law be passed among in set make deal of difference who get garter county who be made baron then earl whose name stand at head of everything be way of looking at politics own to must teach to never will do lady glen never be long word mean to try for look back tell of prime minister who have become sick of power become sick of want of power when be falling away from then affect to disdain put aside thing can no longer enjoy love of power be kind of feeling come to man a grows older politics with duke have be simple patriotism said mr finn patriotism may remain dear not simplicity want to sell country to germany to turn into american republic in order that may be president when get rein in hand want to keep there if be so much honester than other people of course be best man for place must make believe that very existence of country depends on firmness to tell truth lady glen think will ever make duke believe anything what belief belief from very old habit from working of own mind be always singing praise marie know that there be special praise in what say a far a can see be man character mr finn will come in of course said duchess mr finn will be like duke in one thing will take own way a to being in out quite independently of wife 'd like to be in office indeed why must must be more often at house keep later hour be always away morning into bargain will like to do a like fancy thinking of 'd sit up night night of life 'd listen to debate in

be common to married woman must not choose that must have duty unconnected with joint family home a first minister of crown must altogether object to holding office believed to be at disposal looked at with large eye wide open then left without word have other way of showing displeasure for knew that when spoke a have spoken now argument be unavailing duke remained hour alone before be joined by other duke during did not for moment apply mind to subject might be thought to be most prominent in thought filling up namely of list of new government that must do in direction without further assistance have be already done very easily there be four five certain name name be of certain political friend three four almost equally certain of men who have be political enemy who must now clearly be asked to join ministry sir gregory grogram late attorney general must of course be asked to resume place sir timothy beeswax who be up to moment solicitor general for conservative must also be invited to retain that held many detail be known not only to two duke who be about to patch up ministry between to political world at large be fact upon newspaper be able to display wonderful foresight general omniscience with usual confidence a to point be in doubt whether not for instance consistent old tory sir orlando drought must be asked to put up with post office must be allowed to remain at colony younger duke did not care to trouble till elder must have come to assistance own position questionable capacity for filling that occupied mind if nominally first must be really first of so much seemed to that honour required to assure to be faineant ruler be in direct antagonism to conscience predilection to call by great name before world then to be something infinitely le than name must be to degradation though felt fixed a to that be by mean assured a to that other point to most men firm in resolve a be backed up a have be by confidence of others must be cause of small hesitation did doubt ability to fill place must now be duty to occupy more than doubted told again again that there be wanting to certain noble capacity for commanding support homage from other men with thing fact must deal human being have not opened to now be too late yet a said to wife to fail must break heart ambition have prompted be sure of there one only consideration have forced into great danger have be assurance of others that be manifest duty to encounter now there be clearly escape escape compatible with clean handed truth from be not possible for to swerve might create difficulty in order that through way might still be opened to of restoring to queen commission have be entrusted to might insist on that impossible concession memory of escape such a must break heart a surely a failure when duke be announced rose to greet old friend almost with fervour be shame said to bring out so late ought to have gone to not at be always rule in case that man who have most to do must fix a well a can where others may be able to find duke of st bungay be old man between seventy eighty with hair nearly white who on entering room have to unfold out of various coat comforter be in full possession not only of intellect of bodily power showing a many politician do show that care of nation may sit upon man shoulder for many year without breaking even bending for duke have belonged to ministry for nearly last half century a chronicle have also dealt with further record of past life will now be given have said something about queen expressing gracious wish for comfort of majesty in matter something of inconvenience of political journey to fro something also of delicacy difficulty of operation on hand be enhanced by necessity of bringing men together a cordial ally who have hitherto acted with bitter animosity one to before younger duke said word may a well said elder make out small provisional list can ask name to be with early to morrow perhaps have already made list indeed have not even have pencil in hand may a well begin then said elder facing table when saw that le experienced companion made attempt at beginning there be something horrible to in idea of writing down men name for work a just a boy at school used to draw out eleven for cricket match old stager turned round stared at younger politician thing be so momentous that one ought to have aid from heaven plantagenet palliser be last man from whom duke of st bungay must have expected romance at time least of at time a aid from heaven may have said by saying prayer doubt ask for other thing generally angel wo come to tell who ought to be chancellor of exchequer angel will therefore wish must wash hand of old friend still stared at be like sacrilege to attempting without feeling one own fitness for work unmans necessity of doing know can not do with fitting judgment mind have be little too hard at work to day have be at work at have have nothing to do have be unable really to think of work feel chance circumstance have put into position for be unfit yet have be unable to avoid how much better must be that must do alone utterly out of question do know think always have known own power neither have aptitude in debate capacity for work justified in looking to premiership that forgive be now not worthy of consideration be because do work can work because have fitted for continued course of lucid explanation now call debate men on side have called upon a best man to come forward in difficulty excuse friend again if say expect to find manliness equal to capacity if must only escape from psha nonsense said old duke getting up there be such thing a conscience with so fine edge that will allow man to hing have got to serve country on such assistance a can give know that may depend with absolute assurance now let get to work suppose must wish must take chair at council certainly of course said duke of omnium turning to table one practical suggestion have fixed from moment gave to work in hand with energy be not very difficult did take very long time if future prime minister have not name at finger end future president of council have eight men be soon named whom be thought well that duke of omnium must consult early in morning a to willingness to fill certain place one of may have other one two whom may insist on bringing with said elder duke though of course can not yield to pressure in such case will be wise to allow scope for amount of concession will find will shake down after usual amount of resistance compliance leave house to morrow to see anybody unless be mr daubeny majesty will come to at two if grace will give luncheon will lunch with good night think too much of bigness of thing remember dear old lord brock telling how much more difficult be to find good coachman than good secretary of state duke of omnium a sat thinking of thing for next hour in chair succeeded only in proving to that lord brock never ought to have be prime minister of england after having ventured to make so poor joke on so solemn subject chapter viii beginning of new career by time that easter holiday be over holiday have be used so conveniently for making of new government work of getting team together have be accomplished by united energy of two duke other friend filling up of great place have be by mean so difficult so tedious indeed cause of half so many heartburn a completion of list of subordinate noblesse oblige secretary of state chancellor first lord selected from other party felt that eye of mankind be upon that behoved to assume virtue if have not be habitually indifferent to self exaltation allowed to be thrust into that unfitting role professing that queen government good of country be only consideration lord thrift made way for sir orlando drought at admiralty because be felt on side that sir orlando must not join new composite party without high place same grace be shown in regard to lord drummond who remained at colony keeping office to have be lately transferred under mr daubeny sir gregory grogram said not word whatever may have thought when be told that mr daubeny lord chancellor lord ramsden be to keep seal sir gregory did doubt think very much about for legal office have signification differing much from that attache to place simply political lord chancellor becomes peer on going out of office enjoys large pension when woolsack have be reached there come end of doubt beginning of ease sir gregory be not young man be terrible blow bore manfully saying not word when duke spoke to became convinced from moment that more inefficient lawyer ever sat upon english bench more presumptuous politician in british parliament than lord ramsden real struggle however lay in appropriate distribution of rattler robys fitzgibbons macphersons among subordinate office of state mr macpherson mr roby with host of others who have belonged to mr daubeny be prepared a declared from first to lend assistance to duke have consulted mr daubeny on subject mr daubeny told that duty lay in direction at first blush of matter arrangement took form of gracious tender from to statesman called upon to act in very difficult circumstance be thanked accordingly by duke with something of real cordial gratitude when actual adjustment of thing be in hand duke having little power of assuming soft countenance using soft word while heart be bitter felt on more than one occasion inclined to withdraw thanks be astounded not so much by pretension a by unblushing assertion of pretension in reference to place have be innocent enough to think be always bestowed at rate without direct application have measured rightly when told older duke in one of anxious conversation have be held before attempt be made that long a have be in office did not know what be way of bestowing office two gentleman have be here morning said one day to duke of st bungay one on heel of other assuring not only that whole stability of enterprise depends on giving certain office to actually telling to face have promised to old statesman laughed to be told within same half hour by two men have made promise to of inconsistent with other who be two men mr rattler mr roby be assured that be inseparable since work be begun always have leaning to other now hear pas time between step of carlton reform club what be to do one must be patronage secretary doubt be good men in way know why do come to with mouth open like dog craving bone used not to be so of course men be always anxious for office a be now well yes have heard of before to day think think man ever ventured to ask mr mildmay time have done much for in consolidating authority perhaps present world be le reticent in eagerness than be in younger day doubt however whether be more dishonest whether struggle be not made quite a disgraceful to struggler a anything be done now ca alter men must use younger duke sat down sighed over degenerate patriotism of age at last even rattler robys be fixed if not satisfied complete list of ministry appeared in newspaper though thing have be long doing still have come suddenly so that at first proposition to form coalition ministry newspaper have hardly known whether to assist to oppose scheme there be doubt in mind of editor contributor teaching of tradition that coalition of kind have be generally feeble sometimes disastrous on occasion even disgraceful when man perhaps through long political life have bound to certain code of opinion how can change that code at moment when at same moment together with change secures power patronage pay how will public voice absolve then again men who have by work of life grown into certain position in country have unconsciously not therefore le actually made indispensable either to side in politics to can not free altogether from responsibility of managing when period come such a now reached also newspaper perceived having since commencement of session be very loud in exposing disgraceful collapse of government affair must hardly refuse support to attempt at feasible arrangement when be first known that duke of omnium have consented to make attempt have on one side other be loud in praise going so far a to say that be only man in england who must do work be probably encouragement have enabled new premier to go on with undertaking be personally distasteful to for from day to day believed to be le le fit when newspaper told that be only man for occasion how must be justified in crediting in preference to work in parliament began under new auspex with great tranquillity that there must soon come cause of hot blood english church county suffrage income tax further education question men knew who knew anything for moment for month even perhaps for session there be to be peace with full latitude for performance of routine duty there be so to say opposition at first seemed that one special bench in house of common must remain unoccupied after day two on one of mr daubeny have be seen sitting just below gangway that gentleman returned to place usually held by prime minister rival saying with smile that might be for convenience of house that seat must be utilised mr gresham at time have with declared purpose asked obtained speaker leave of absence be abroad who must lead house have be great question caused by fact that prime minister be in house of lord what office must leader hold mr monk have consented to take exchequer right to sit opposite to treasury box to consider for time principal spirit in chamber be at last assigned to sir drought will never do said mr rattler to mr roby mean to say anything against drought who have always be very useful man to party lack something of position fact be said roby that have trusted to two men so long that know how to suppose one else big enough to fill place monk must have done house doe care about monk always thought must be wilson so told duke have idea that must be one of men think be right there said roby there ought to be something like fair division individual might be content party must be dissatisfied for 'd have sooner stayed out a independent member daubeny said that thought be bound to make useful told duke from beginning said rattler did think must be of service to of course must support have be too thoroughly party man for new movement of kind said just same that considered be bound to join asked gresham when gresham said so too of course have help for of excellent public servant have told lie in such conversation a reported have passed man doe lie when exaggerates emphasis even when give by tone meaning to man word exactly opposite to tone must convey if doe lie in doing so doe not know that lie mr rattler have gone back to old office at treasury mr roby have be forced to content with secretaryship at admiralty a old duke have said be close friend prepared to fight together battle might keep in present position many of care of office prime minister did succeed in shuffling off altogether on to shoulder of elder friend must not concern with appointment of lady about whom said knew nothing a to whose fitness claim professed to be a ignorant a office messenger offer be of course made in usual form a though coming direct from queen through prime minister selection be in truth effected by old duke in council with illustrious personage matter affected duke only in so far that must not get out of mind that strange application from own wife that must have even dreamed of must say to not yet having acquired sufficient experience of fellow creature to be aware how wonderfully temptation will affect even who appear to be least subject to town horse used to gaudy trapping doubt despises work of country brother yet now again there come upon sudden desire to plough desire for ploughing have come upon duchess duke must not understand perceived however in spite of multiplicity of official work that refusal sat heavily on wife breast that though spoke further word brooded over injury heart be sad within when thought that have vexed loving a did with heart with heart be never demonstrative when be unhappy be miserable though must hardly know cause of misery ridicule raillery must bear though stung sorrow if ever be sorrowful sullenness if ever be sullen upset altogether be in truth so soft of heart that must not bear discomfort of one person in world who seemed to to be near to have expressly asked for sympathy in business have on hand thereby going much beyond usual coldness of manner with eagerness might have be expected from have promised that must slave for if slavery be necessary then have made request have be refused be now moody duchess of be to be mistress of robe said to one day have gone to up to own room before dressed for dinner having devoted much more time than a prime minister ought to have done to resolution that must make thing straight with to best way of doing so be told ought to know way about place a remember be at same work when be girl of eleven be not so very long ago cora silverbridge be older now than be then think that make very long time ago lord silverbridge be duke eldest son what doe matter if began career in time of george fourth what be to nothing on earth only that did in truth begin career in time of george third be sure be nearer sixty than fifty be glad to see remember date so well be pity must not remember hers in way dress said duchess be marvellous to that wife who a lady glencora palliser have be so conspicuous for wild disregard of social rule a to be looked upon by many a enemy of own class must be so depressed by not being allowed to be queen head servant a to descend to personal invective be afraid said attempting to smile that wo come within compass of office to effect even to propose radical change in grace apparel think that can afford to ignore can certainly may be antiquated eve for hope cora be not still disappointed because did not agree with when spoke about place for not because did not agree with because did not think fit to be trusted with judgment of own know why be always to be looked upon a different from other woman a though be savage be what have made have always rejoiced that be a be fresh untrammelled without many prejudice afflict other lady free from bond by be cramped confined of course such turn of character be subject to certain danger of own there be doubt about danger chance be that when see grace will tell what think about will be sure say nothing unkind to lady who be supposed to be in place now fill by authority let quarrel about old woman wo quarrel with even about young one can not be at ease within while think be resenting refusal know how constantly carry about with carry very unnecessary burden then said must tell at once from altered tone of voice from light of eye a glanced into face that anger about robe be appeased have done a asked about friend of yours said occurred just before final perfected list of new men have appeared in newspaper what friend mr finn be to go to ireland go to ireland how do mean be looked upon a being very great promotion indeed be told that be considered to be luckiest man in scramble mean a chief secretary yes do certainly must go a lord lieutenant said that barrington erle be going to ireland well yes know that 'd be interested by in out of mr erle declined seems that mr erle be after one man in parliament modest enough not to consider to be fit for place can be offered to poor

be fit for did have pleasure in proposing to because thought that must please doe please wo be cross more duchess of may wear clothes just a plea go without a for mr finn see why must be with always when go can quite understand how necessary be to be in truth only woman in london to whom can say what think be comfort know to have one in way domestic peace of prime minister be readjusted that sympathy co operation for have first asked be accorded to may be question whether on whole duchess did not work harder than did did not at first dare to expound to grand idea have conceived in regard to magnificence hospitality said nothing of extraordinary expenditure of money set to work after own fashion making to suggestion a to dinner evening reception to objected only on score of time must eat dinner somewhere said need only come in just before sit down go into own room if please without coming upstairs at can at rate do that part of for did do part of with marvellous energy through month of may so that by end of month within six week of time at first heard of coalition ministry world have begun to talk of prime minister dinner of reception given by prime minister wife chapter ix mr dick dinner party reader must not forget trouble of poor emily wharton amidst gorgeous festivity of new prime minister throughout april may did not see ferdinand lopez may be remembered that on night when matter be discussed between father promised that must not do so without permission saying however at same time very openly that happiness depended on such permission being given to for two three week not word further be said between father on subject have endeavoured to banish subject from mind feeling doubt that if nothing further be ever said must be so much better then daughter referred to matter very plainly with simple question without disguise of own feeling still in manner must not bring to rebuke aunt harriet have asked once twice to go there of evening when have be out have declined because thought mr lopez must be there must tell be not to meet mr lopez papa if have there on purpose to throw in way will think very badly of have be in habit of being there papa of course if be decided about be better must not see did not tell be decided said must make further inquiry speak to again now mr wharton have made inquiry have learned nothing to reassure neither have be able to learn fact putting finger on must point out to daughter clearly that marriage must be unsuitable for of man ability position a certainly also of manner world at large seemed to speak well have be blackballed at two club apparently without defined reason lived a though possessed handsome income yet be in degree fast flashy be supposed to be intimate friend of mr mill happerton one of partner in world famous commercial house of hunky son dealt in million indeed there have be at one time rumour that be going to be taken into house of hunky son a junior partner be evident that many people have be favourably impressed by outward demeanour by mode of talk by way of living one knew anything about with regard to material position mr wharton must of course ask direct question if pleased require evidence a to alleged property felt that by doing so must abandon right to object to man a being portuguese stranger did not wish to have ferdinand lopez a son in law even though must be partner in hunky son able to maintain gorgeous palace at south kensington have made inquiry well papa know anything about nobody know anything about must not ask anything want to know if might see must ask must not do at come to papa be to sever from man to whom be attached whom must admit have be allowed to meet from day to day with caution that intimacy be unpleasant to because be called lopez be that at there be english people of name be englishman of course if say so papa must be so have told aunt harriet consider to be prohibited from meeting mr lopez by what have said think papa be little cruel to cruel to said wharton almost bursting into tear be a ready to obey a child not being child think ought to have reason to mr wharton made further immediate answer pulled hair shuffled foot about then escaped out of room few day afterwards sister in law attacked be to understand mr wharton that emily be not to meet mr lopez again make very unpleasant because have be intimate at house never said word about not meeting of course wish that meeting must be contrived between a stand now be prejudicial to of course can not be observed be so odd that young lady must be forbidden to meet certain man look so unpleasant for a though have misbehaved have never thought so for moment of course have not how must have thought so mr wharton say that never did what must think when know a of course doe know that have be forbidden to meet must make fancy that be made very much of be so very bad for girl indeed be mr wharton of course there be absolute dishonesty in on part of mr roby be true enough to emily lover too true to be false to emily father if emily must have yielded to must have arranged meeting at own house between lover altogether in opposition to father nevertheless there be show of reason about what said mr wharton be unable to overcome at same time there be reality about girl sorrow overcame have never hitherto consulted one about anything in family having always found own information intellect sufficient for own affair now felt grievously in want of pillar female pillar on must lean did not know mr roby iniquity still felt that be not pillar of be in need there be such pillar for use be driven to acknowledge to that in distressing position must be guided by own strength own light thought out a well a must in own chamber allowing book brief to lie idle beside for many half hour be much puzzled a to extent of own authority manner in must be used certainly have not desired daughter not to meet man must understand that unless affront have be offered edict enforced a to conduct of young lady must induce acquaintance to suppose that be either very much in love else very prone to misbehave feared indeed that be very much in love must not be prudent to tell secret to world perhaps must be better that must meet always with understanding that be not to accept from peculiar attention if must be obedient in one particular must probably be so in other indeed did not at doubt obedience must obey must take care to show that be made miserable by obeying began to foresee that have bad time before then a still sat idle thinking of mind wandered off to view of subject must be happy even comfortable if be unhappy of course endeavoured to convince that if be bold determined dictatorial with must only be in order that future happiness might be secured parent be often bound to disregard immediate comfort of child then be sure that be right of course have own way of looking at life be reasonable that must force girl to look at thing with eye man be distasteful to a being unlike idea of english gentleman a being without far reaching fibre root by thought that solidity stability of human tree must be assured world be changing around day royalty be marrying out of degree peer son be looking only for money more than peer daughter be bestowing on jew shopkeeper have not better make usual inquiry about man mean if satisfied on head let girl do a must added to there be growing on feeling ultimately youth must a usual triumph over age that must be beaten if be so why worry why worry on day after mr roby attack upon again saw that lady having on occasion sent round to ask to come to want to understand that put embargo on emily a to meeting mr lopez can trust fully wish to encourage attention by mean wish to avoid be to tell emily what say will tell think better to say a much to a seemed to be embarrassed by fear that might happen to see other in drawing room be rather awkward be have spoken now because seemed to think so manner to be not very pleasant mr roby have known for many year did not care very much for manner have object to gain must put up with good deal for sake of object very well then will know how to act mr wharton must say know emily have will of own must not hold responsible for anything may occur a soon a heard almost resolved to withdraw concession have made did not do so very soon after there came special invitation from mr mr roby asking wharton father daughter to dine with round corner be quite special invitation because came in form of card be unusual between two family dinner be too in degree special dinner a emily be enabled to explain to father whole speciality having be fully detailed to herself by aunt mr roby whose belonging be not generally aristocratic have one great connexion with whom after many year of quarrelling have lately come into amity be half brother considerably older than be other than mr roby who be now secretary to admiralty who in last conservative government have be one of secretary to treasury oldest mr roby of now long since gathered to father have have two wife two son elder son have not be left a well off a friend perhaps a must have wished have risen in world by wit have made way into parliament have become a reader of chronicle know staff of great strength to party have always be poor man period of office have be much shorter than of friend rattler other source of income have not be certain younger half brother who a far a great world be concerned have none of elder brother advantage have be endowed with fortune from mother in evil hour for of have lent politician money a one consequence of transaction have not spoken to other for year on quarrel mr roby be always harping with own husband not taking part roby dick have indeed mean of supporting with fair comfort have of own power of introducing to sort of society for soul craved mr thomas roby be great man though unfortunately poor moved in high circle because have lent money doubt be lost for ever why must also lose advantage of such connexion must not be wiser rather to take debt a basis whereon to found claim for special fraternal observation kindred social intercourse dick who be fond of money must not for long time look at matter in light harassed brother from time to time by application be quite useless by acerbity of language altogether shut mr roby out from good thing might have accrued to from so distinguished brother in law when came to pas that thomas roby be confirmed in office by coalition have be mentioned mr dick became very energetic went to official hero told how desirous be of peace nothing more must be said about money at rate for present let brother be brother so came to pas that secretary to admiralty with wife be to dine in berkeley street that mr wharton be asked to meet particularly want to meet mr thomas roby old barrister said want to come said emily because there have be family reconciliation usually do go once twice year suppose may a well be done said mr wharton think papa that mean to ask mr lopez said emily demurely told before want to have banished from aunt home by man said father so matter be settled invitation be accepted be just at end of may at time people be beginning to say that coalition be success wise men to predict at last fortuitous parliamentary atom have so come together by accidental connexion that ministry have be formed might endure for dozen year indeed there be reason why there must be end to ministry built on foundation of course be very comfortable to such men a mr roby so that admiralty secretary when entered sister in law drawing room be suffused with rosy hue of human bliss feeling of triumph bestows yes said in answer to must be facetious remark from brother think have weathered that storm pretty well doe seem rather odd sitting cheek by jowl with mr monk gentleman of kidney bite have got one of own set at head of own office lead house think upon whole have got little best of be listened to by mr wharton with great disgust for mr wharton be tory of old school who hated compromise abhorred in heart class of politician to whom politics be profession rather than creed mr roby senior having escaped from house be of course last have indeed kept other guest waiting hour a becomes parliamentary magnate in heat of session mr wharton who have be early saw other guest arrive among mr ferdinand lopez there be also mr mill happerton partner in hunky son with wife respecting whom mr wharton at once concluded that be there a being friend of ferdinand lopez if so how much influence must ferdinand lopez have in house nevertheless mr mill happerton be in way great man credit to mr roby there be sir damask lady monogram who be people moving quite in first circle sir damask shot pigeon so did also dick roby whence have perhaps arisen intimacy lady monogram be not at person to dine with mr dick roby without other cause than great official among one acquaintance can do so much for one be probable that lady monogram presence be among first fruit of happy family reconciliation have taken place then there be mr leslie pretty widow rather poor who be glad to receive civility from mr roby be emily wharton be pet aversion mr leslie have said impertinent thing to about ferdinand lopez have snubbed mr leslie mr leslie be serviceable to mr roby have now be asked to great dinner party two most illustrious guest have not yet be mentioned mr roby have secured lord absolute peer of parliament be le man than lord mongrober whose father have be great judge in early part of century have be made peer mongrober estate be not supposed to be large be mongrober influence at time extensive nobleman be seen about good deal in society when dinner given be supposed to be worth eating be fat silent red faced elderly gentleman who said very little who when did speak seemed always to be in ill humour must now then make ill natured remark about friend wine a suggesting ' when man must boast of claret when costly dainty be supplied for use must remark that such such dish be very well at other time of year so that lady attentive to table host proud of cellar must almost shake in shoe before lord mongrober may also be said that lord mongrober never gave chance of retaliation by return dinner there lived not man woman who have dined with lord mongrober yet robys of london be glad to entertain mr robys when be coming must urge cook to superhuman energy by mention of name there be lady eustace of lady eustace be impossible to say whether beauty wit wealth remarkable history of past life most recommended to such host hostess a mr mr roby a history may be already known to detail of will be repeated here at moment be free from marital persecution be very much run after by certain set in society there be others again who declared that decent man woman ought to meet on score of lover there be really little

inclined to criticise lax principle of men who for sake of carrying on majesty government must be conservative one day liberal next be laborious honest man hardly of calibre sufficient not to regret own honesty in such emergency a present be easy for most of to keep hand from picking stealing when picking stealing plainly lead to prison diet prison garment when silk satin come of with silk satin

graciously be always on wing about hour on wednesday night word contained general invitation for season be esteemed by lopez a indication of great favour must be acknowledged of duchess that be prone to make favourite perhaps without adequate cause though must be conceded to that rarely altogether threw off from one whom have once taken to good grace must also be confessed that when have allowed to hate man woman generally hated on to end paradise must be too charming for friend pandemonium too frightful for enemy in reference to mr lopez must have said if interrogated that have taken man up in obedience to husband in truth have liked look voice of man husband before now have recommended men to notice kindness whom at first trial have rejected from good will whom have continued to reject ever afterwards let husband urgency be what might old friend of whom former chronicle be not silent be at duchess night there came across mr finn be barrington erle politician of long standing who be

sad programme for husband have recuperative faculty bring round at last really doubt whether be made for politician in country remember lord brock dear old brock of course do how must not if remember young men be boy at college rowing in boat when woman have be ever so long out in world be very model of english statesman loved country dearly wished to be a believed to be first among nation have

sit night upon bench in house of common how men can do must read ca think because of speaking doe do for to talk believe ever listen be in human nature to listen hour after hour to such platitude believe fall into habit of half wakeful sleeping carry through hour even ca be pleasant look upon treasury bench in july a sort of casual ward know to be necessary be almost too horrid to be contemplated men do get bread skilly there certainly mr finn can go into library smoking room oh yes clerk in office can read newspaper instead of doing duty there be certain surveillance exercised certain quantity of work exacted have met lord of treasury out at dinner on monday thursday regard a boy who have shirked out of school think upon whole mr erle woman have best of suppose will go in

be master of everything here have got hidden almost behind screen be sure doe like try to like like said mr finn a husband be away in ireland mr finn be staying in house in carlton garden duchess at present required so much of time that be found to be convenient when therefore guest on present occasion have gone duchess mr finn be left together did ever see anything so hopeless a be said duchess who be hopeless heaven earth plantagenet who else be there man in world must come into own house among own guest speak only to one person then think of popularity be staff on alone minister can lean in country with security political not social popularity know a well a do that two go together have seen enough of even in day what broke up mr gresham ministry if have stayed away people might have

so much few year ago must have be mr mildmay dear said duchess angrily treat a though be child of course know why chooses that old man out of crowd suppose doe from stupid pride of rank know very well

evening for exactly forty minute did open lip to female creature watched how on earth be to pull through if go on in way yes locock will go to bed think will get up for week chapter xii gathering of cloud throughout june first week of july affair of ministry went on successfully in spite of social sin of duke occasional despair of duchess there have be many politician who have thought have at rate predicted that coalition ministry must not live month there have be men such a lord fawn on one side mr boffin on other who have found stranded disagreeably with certain position unwilling to sit immediately behind treasury bench from be excluded too shy to place immediately opposite seat beneath gangway be of course open to such of a be member of lower house seat have to be used be not accustomed to sit beneath gangway gentleman have expected that seed of weakness of have perceived scattering must grow at once into enormous crop of blunder difficulty complication for while ministry be saved from danger by energy of prime minister popularity of wife perhaps by sagacity of elder duke so that there grew up idea that coalition be really proper thing in one respect certainly be successful home ruler irish party generally be left without inch of standing ground support be not needed therefore be not courted for moment there be not even necessity to pretend home rule be anything absurdity from beginning to end so much so that one two leading home ruler men who have taken up cause not only that might become member of parliament with further idea of speech making popularity declared that coalition have be formed merely with view of putting down ireland capability of dispensing with generally untractable element of support be felt to be great comfort then too there be set in house at moment not very numerous set who have be troublesome friend to old liberal party coalition be able if not to ignore at rate to disregard be staunch economist argumentative philosophical radical men of standing repute who be always in doubtful time individually flattered by minister who have great privilege accorded to of speaking dividing who be not unfrequently even thanked for rod by very owner of back bear scourge men must not be quite set aside by coalition a be home ruler be not even yet perhaps wise to count out to leave to talk to bench absolutely empty tone of flattery with have be addressed became gradually le warm when scourge be wielded ministerial back took out of way there grew up unconsciously feeling of security against attack be distasteful to gentleman be in perhaps little dangerous gentleman bound to support government when perceived that there be comparatively little to do that little might be easily done became careless perhaps little contemptuous so that great popular orator mr turnbull found compelled to rise in seat ask whether noble duke at head of government thought strong enough to rule without attention to parliamentary detail question be asked with air of inexorable severity be intended to have deep signification mr turnbull have disliked coalition from beginning then mr turnbull always disliked everything have so accustomed to wield constitutional cat of nine tail that heaven will hardly be happy to unless be allowed to flog cherub though party with be presumed to act have generally be in power since have be in house have never allowed to agree with minister on point a have never be satisfied with liberal government be not probable that must endure coalition in silence at end of rather lengthy speech repeated question then sat down taking place with constitutional indignation becomes parliamentary flagellator of day little joke with sir orlando answered be very well in way mr turnbull did not care much whether be answered not perhaps jauntiness of sir orlando implied that coalition be too strong to regard attack somewhat irritated outsider there certainly grew up from moment feeling among such men a erle rattler that care be necessary that house taken a whole be not in condition to be manipulated with easy freedom that sir orlando must be made to understand that be not strong enough to depend upon jauntiness jaunty statesman must be very sure of personal following there be general opinion that sir orlando have not brought coalition well out of first real attack

only remain passive simply not give permission without daughter must not ever engage to man ague troubled hour of present life sister in law of be silly vulgar worldly most untrustworthy woman have understood what be saying there have be something in argument about duchess of omnium party mr happerton have effect if man did live with great wealthy must be because thought well of of position fact of being nasty foreigner probably of jewish descent remained to wharton man must always be distasteful must hardly maintain opposition to one of whom choice spirit of world thought well tried to be fair on subject might be that be prejudice others probably did not find man to be odious because be of foreign extraction known by foreign name others must not suspect man of being of jewish blood because be swarthy even object to if be jew by descent be wonderful to that girl must like man must like man well enough to choose a one companion of life have be brought up to prefer english men english thinking english way english way too somewhat of past time thought a did brabantio that must not be that without magic daughter who have shunned wealthy curled darling of nation must ever have to incur general mock run from guardage to sooty bosom of such thing a distasteful portuguese that evening said nothing further to daughter sat with silent disconsolate later in evening after have gone to room everett came in while old man be still walking up down drawing room where have be asked father not caring straw a to reply when asked question roused almost to anger by answer when came have be dining with lopez at club believe live with man be there reason sir why must not know that there be good reason why there must be peculiar intimacy suppose that wish sister welfare will interest be severe sir be not such fool a to suppose that be to quarrel with man because approve addressing sister do think that while be going on while perseveres in opposition to distinct refusal need not associate with in special manner understand objection to sir dare say not there be great many thing understand do object be very rising man mr roby be saying to just now who care straw what fool like roby say mean uncle dick brother who suppose be somebody in world be saying to just now that wondered why lopez doe not go into house that must be sure to get seat if chose safe to make mark when got there dare say must get into house know well to do blackguard of whom might not predict a much seat in house of common doe make man gentleman a far a can see think one allows that ferdinand lopez be gentleman who be father did happen to know sir who be mother suppose will credit anything because say a far a experience go man doe often become gentleman in first generation man may be very worthy very clever very rich very well worth knowing if will when one talk of admitting man into close family communion by marriage one must fancy wish to know something of father mother then everett escaped mr wharton be again left to own meditation oh what peril what trouble what labyrinth of difficulty be daughter must either be known a stern hard hearted parent utterly indifferent to child feeling using with power over came to only from sense of filial duty else must give up own judgment yield to in matter a to believed that such yielding must be most pernicious to own interest hitherto really knew nothing of man mean if must have own way did want such information a thing be going now began to feel that if must hear anything averse to man might thus strengthen hand against on following day went into city called on old friend banker one whom have known for nearly century of whom therefore be not afraid to ask question for mr wharton be man not prone in ordinary intercourse of life to ask to answer question know anything do of man named ferdinand lopez have heard of why do ask well have reason for asking know that quite wish to say what reason be have heard of a connected with hunky house said banker rather with one of partner in house be man of mean imagine to be so know nothing have rather large dealing take in foreign stock be after old friend miss wharton well yes have better get more information than can give of course before anything of kind be done must see that money be settled be heard in city be not satisfactory have not liked to tell friend that wished to hear that foreigner be needy adventurer altogether untrustworthy have really be desire then thought of l destined for girl if man be to liking there must be money enough though have be careful to save money be not greedy man even for child must daughter insist on marrying man must take care that must never want sufficient income a first step thing to be done almost at once must take away from london be now july custom of family be that house in manchester square must be left for two month that flitting must take place about middle of august mr wharton usually liked to postpone flitting a also liked to hasten return now be question whether have not better start at once start somewhither probably for much longer period than usual vacation must take bull by horn declare purpose of living for next twelvemonth at well did not much matter where dresden thought be long way off must do a well a place then occurred to that cousin sir alured be in town that have better see cousin before came to decision be a usual expected at wharton hall autumn arrangement must not be abandoned without explanation sir alured wharton be baronet with handsome old family place on wye in herefordshire whose forefather have be baronet since baronet be first created whose earlier forefather have lived at wharton hall much before time may be imagined therefore sir alured be proud of name of estate of rank there be drawback to happiness a regarded name be to descend to nephew whom specially disliked with good cause a to estate delightful a be in many respect be hardly sufficient to maintain position with plentiful hospitality must have loved other property have none a to rank have almost become ashamed of since a be wont to declare be now case prosperous tallow chandler throughout country be made baronet a matter of course so lived at home through year with wife daughter not pretending to luxury of season in london for modest three four thousand year did not suffice so living apart from friction of club parliament mixed society did veritably believe that dear country be going utterly to dog be so staunch in politics during doings of last quarter of century from repeal of corn law down to ballot have honestly declared one side to be a bad a other thus felt that happiness be to be drawn from past there be nothing of joy glory to must look forward on behalf of country family nephew ala heir be needy spendthrift with whom must hold communication family settlement for wife daughter must leave poorly off though did struggle to save something duty of living a sir alured wharton of wharton hall must live made struggle very ineffective be melancholy proud ignorant man who must not endure personal liberty who thought assertion of social equality on part of men of lower rank to amount to taking of personal liberty who read little nothing thought that knew history of country because be aware that charles have have head cut off that george have come from hanover if charles have never have head cut off if george have never come from hanover wharton must now probably be great people britain great nation evil one have be allowed to prevail everything have gone astray sir alured now have nothing of world to console hazy retrospect of past glory delight in beauty of own river own park own house sir alured with foible with fault be pure minded simple gentleman who must not tell lie who must not do wrong who be earnest in desire to make who be dependent on comfortable if possible happy once year came up to london for week to see lawyer get measured for coat go to dentist be excuse gave be fancied by that wig be great moving cause sir alured mr wharton be second cousin close friend sir alured trusted cousin altogether in thing believing to be great legal luminary of great britain mr wharton returned cousin affection entertaining something akin to reverence for man who be head of family dearly loved sir alured loved sir alured wife two daughter nevertheless second week at wharton hall became always tedious to fourth fifth sixth week frightful with ennui perhaps be with unconscious dread of tedium that made sudden suggestion to sir alured in reference to dresden sir alured have come to at chamber two old men be sitting together near open window sir alured delighted in privilege of sitting there seemed to confer upon something of insight into inner way of london life beyond what must get at hotel wigmaker go to dresden for winter exclaimed not only for winter must go at once not before come to wharton said amazed baronet mr wharton replied in low sad voice in case must not go down to herefordshire at baronet looked hurt a well a unhappy yes know what will say how kind be be kindness at always come must be breaking up everything everything have to be broken up sooner later one feel that a one grows older abel be just of age why must talk to like be strong enough be why must come dresden never heard of such thing suppose be nonsense of emily then mr wharton told whole story nonsense of emily began yes be nonsense worse than think doe want to go abroad father plaint need be repeated to reader a be told to baronet though be necessary that must explain yet tried to be reticent sir alured listened in silence loved cousin emily knowing that must be rich knowing advantage of birth recognizing beauty have expected that must make match creditable to wharton family portuguese jew man who have never be even known to allude to own father for by degree mr wharton have be driven to confess sin of lover though have endeavoured to conceal extent of daughter love do mean that emily favour be afraid so must must do anything without sanction be always thinking of disgrace attaching to by reason of nephew vileness now if daughter of family must also go astray so a to be exiled from bosom of wharton how manifest must be that glory be departing from house will hing without sanction have given word be gospel a spoke old lawyer struck hand upon table then why must run away to dresden because be unhappy will not marry even see if forbid be near herefordshire be long way off said baronet pleading change of scene be what must have said father there ca be more of change than 'd get at wharton always did like wharton be there that met arthur fletcher father only shook head a arthur fletcher name be mentioned well be sad always thought 'd give way about arthur at last be impossible to understand young woman said lawyer with english gentleman a arthur fletcher on one side with portuguese jew on other be to hyperion to satyr darkness have fallen over girl eye for time power of judgment have left see why wharton must not do just a well a dresden continued baronet mr wharton found quite unable to make cousin understand that greater disruption caused by residence abroad feeling that new kind of life have be considered necessary for that must submit to new kind of life might be gradually effective while journeying scene have be common to year after year must have effect nevertheless gave way must hardly start to germany at once visit to wharton might be accelerated detail of residence abroad might be there arranged be fixed therefore that mr wharton emily must go down to wharton hall at rate before end of july why do go earlier than usual papa emily asked afterwards because think best replied angrily ought at rate to understand reason of course will be ready papa know always like wharton there be place on earth like so much year will be especially pleasant to to go out of town what ca bear to think that will be taking away have got to bear worse thing than dear oh papa speak to like of course know what mean there be real reason for going if wish will promise will not see

happiness for own so do papa what can be done suppose sometimes people must be unhappy ca change ca change find to be a much bound to mr lopez a though be wife must say so have right to say so have given promise certainly will keep if must be unhappy still need not need not quarrel need papa then came up to kissed whereupon went out of room wiping eye that evening again spoke to saying merely word think dear will have fixed that go on th sir alured seemed to wish very well papa will be quite ready chapter xiv lover perseverance ferdinand lopez learned immediately through mr roby that early departure for herefordshire have be fixed must go to speak to very plainly said mr roby ca bite be not in least afraid of biting can talk so well must tell everything especially about money be sure be right yes be right said lopez smiling about people have doubt think be wrong know anything about said mr roby much care have old world notion at rate must say something so that must not be able to complain to that have kept in dark if there be anything to be known be much better to have known there be nothing to be known then tell nothing still tell to after that must trust to suppose 'd go off with be sure must be a obstinate a mule will get better of if really mean assured that really did mean determined that must take advice a to seeing endeavouring to see mr wharton once again before doing so thought to be expedient to put house into order so that might be able to make statement of affair if asked to do so whether be flourishing reverse might be necessary that must have to speak of with at rate apparent candour reader may perhaps remember that in month of april ferdinand lopez have managed to extract certain signature from unfortunate city friend sexty parker made that gentleman responsible for payment of considerable sum of money before end of july transaction have be one of unmixed painful nature to mr parker a soon a came to think of after lopez have left must not prevail upon to forgive for folly that sextus parker must have be induced by few empty word to give name for seven hundred fifty pound without consideration possibility of benefit more thought of more sure be that money be lost next day confirmed own fear before week be gone have written down sum a gone told nobody did not like to confess folly made inquiry about friend be absolutely futile one that knew seemed to know anything of man affair saw friend from time to time in city shining a only successful men do shine heard of a one whose name be becoming known in city still suffered grievously money be surely gone man doe not fly kite in fashion till thing with have reached bad pas so be with mr parker through may to end of june load ever growing heavier heavier a time became nearer then while be still afflicted with heaviness of spirit have never left since fatal day who ferdinand lopez must walk into office wearing gayest smile with hat splendid a hat be splendid only in city nothing must be more jolly than friend manner so much so that sexty be almost lifted up into temporary jollity lopez seating almost at once began to describe certain speculation into be going rather deeply a to invited friend parker co operation be intending evidently not to ask to confer favour rather think that steady business be best said parker hope be all right about l ah yes meant to have told did want money a turned out for much above fortnight a there be use in letting bill run out settled so saying took out pocket book extracted bill showed to sexty sexty heart fluttered in bosom there be name still on bit of paper might still be used having shown to after fashion in mid career of course have strong ground for hope must not bring to put out hand for a to what say about steady business of course be very well said lopez depends upon whether man want to make small income large fortune still held bill a though be going to fold up again importance of be so present to sexty mind that must hardly digest argument about steady business own be not satisfied with former continued lopez go in for fortune a spoke tore bill into three four bit apparently without thinking of let fragment fall upon floor be a though mountain have be taken off sexty bosom felt almost inclined to send out for bottle of champagne on moment argument of friend rang in ear with different sound allurement of steady income paled before eye too began to tell a have often told before if must only keep eye open heart high there be reason why too must not become city millionaire on occasion lopez left soon without saying very much about favourite speculation in few day however same matter be brought before sexty eye from direction learned from side wind that house of hunky son be concerned largely in business at rate thought that have so learned ease with lopez have destroyed that bill six week before be due have have great effect upon argument about large fortune small income still clung to lopez have come to about business in first instance be now necessary that must go to lopez be however very cautious managed to happen to meet lopez in street introduced subject in own slap dash aery manner result of be that have gone rather deep into two three american mine before end of july have already made money out of though must find sometimes trembling before have taken daily allowance of port wine brandy water still be buoyant hopeful of living in park with palace at west end seat in parliament knowing also a did that friend lopez be intimate with duchess of omnium have much immediate satisfaction in intimacy relation created be getting in thin edge of wedge must calculate a went home to ponder end how long must be before must ask friend to propose at west end club on one halcyon summer evening lopez have dined with at ponder end have smiled on mr parker played with hopeful little parker on occasion sexty have assured wife that regarded friendship with ferdinand lopez a most fortunate circumstance of life do be careful poor woman have said parker have simply told that understood nothing about business on evening lopez have thoroughly imbued with conviction that if will only set mind way be quite a easy to amass large fortune a to earn small income about week before departure of wharton for herefordshire lopez in compliance with mr roby counsel called at chamber in stone building be difficult to say that will not see man when man be standing just on other side of open door in case be mr wharton quite clear that have better decline to see man while be doubting at rate before have resolved upon denying presence man be there inside room mr wharton got up from chair hesitated moment then gave hand to intruder in half unwilling unsatisfactory manner most of have experienced when shaking hand with cold blooded ungenial acquaintance well mr lopez what can do for said a reseated looked a though be at ease master of situation have control over sufficient for assuming manner heart be not high within bosom more looked at man le liked there be one thing one thing only can do for said lopez voice be peculiarly sweet when spoke word seemed to mean more than when came from other mouth mr wharton did not like sweet voice mellow soft word at least not from men mouth think that can do anything for mr lopez said there be slight pause during visitor put down hat seemed to hesitate think coming here can be of avail did not explain when saw before fear did not explain hardly told story can tell of course if think telling will do good be not able to say then a can say now that daughter have accepted love ought not to have spoken to daughter on subject after what passed between told mind frankly ah mr wharton how be obedience in matter possible what must think of man who in position must be obedient did not seek secretly did nothing underhand before have once directly asked for love came to what be use of if go to immediately afterwards in manifest opposition to wish found bound a must gentleman to ask father leave when be refused went on just a though have be granted call that mockery can say now sir what must not say then love other be a sure of a be of when assert that will be true to other must know well enough to be sure of also be sure of nothing of will not give consent to become wife what be objection mr wharton explained before a far a found called upon to explain be to be sacrificed for reason that of understand how dare take upon to say that doe understand because refuse to be more explicit to stranger do suppose that be equally silent to own child in regard to money social rank be able to place daughter a wife in position a good a now hold a miss wharton care nothing about money mr lopez idea of social rank be perhaps different have nothing further to say to think that can have anything further to say to that can be of avail then having finished speech got up from chair stood upright thereby demanding of visitor that must depart think no more than honest mr wharton to declare one thing regard a irrevocably engaged to daughter although have refused to bind to by special word be be certain a firmly fixed in choice a be in mine happiness a matter of course can be nothing to not much said lawyer with angry impatience lopez smiled put down word in memory determined that must treasure there not much at rate a yet said happiness must be much to be everything in thinking of happiness must look beyond what might be satisfaction of present day must excuse mr lopez if say must rather not discus matter with further then rang bell passed quickly into inner room when clerk came lopez of course marched out of chamber went way mr wharton have be very firm yet be shaken be by degree becoming fixed idea in mind that man material prosperity be assured be afraid even to allude to subject when talking to man lest must be overwhelmed by evidence on subject then man manner though be distasteful to wharton must well knew recommend to others be good looking lived with people who be highly regarded must speak up for be favoured guest at carlton house terrace so great have be fame of duchess hospitality during last two month that fact of man success in respect have come home even to mr wharton feared that world must be against already began to dread joint opposition of world own child world of day did not thought care whether daughter husband have have not father mother world a be now did care whether son in law be christian jewish whether have fair skin bold eye uncertain word of english gentleman swarthy colour false grimace glib tongue of inferior latin race cared for thing be dreadful to to think that daughter must not care for suppose have better die leave to look after said a returned to arm chair lopez be not altogether ill satisfied with interview not having expected that mr wharton must have given way at once bestowed upon then there kind father in law bless bless something yet have to be done before blessing must come girl money have to day asserted own material success speaking of a of moneyed man statement have be received with contradiction even without suggestion of doubt did not therefore suppose that difficulty be over be clever enough to perceive that aversion to on score might help to tide over difficulty if once must call girl wife did not doubt that must build up with old barrister money after leaving lincoln inn went at once to berkeley street be soon closeted with mr roby can get here before go said must come if arranged without letting know that be to be here must tell father have particle of female intrigue in so much better said lover be very well for to say when man make tyrant of a mr wharton be doing girl be bound to look after if be 'd go off with young man before 'd stand such treatment must give letter 'd only show father be so perverse that sometimes feel inclined to say that will have nothing further to do with will give message at rate yes can do because can do in way wo seem to make important want message to be very important tell have seen father have offered to explain affair to so that may know that there be nothing to fear on behalf be thought of money be troubling tell what say however must listen to nothing then assured that consideration on earth must induce to surrender be a sure of a be of tell tell that think owes to to say one word to before go into country chapter xv arthur fletcher may think be question whether two old men acted wisely in having arthur fletcher at wharton hall when emily arrived there story of love for miss wharton a far a have a yet gone must be shortly told have be second son a be now second brother of herefordshire squire endowed with much larger property than belonging to sir alured john fletcher esq of longbarns twelve mile from wharton be considerable man in herefordshire present squire have married sir alured eldest daughter younger brother have almost since be child together be known to be in love with emily wharton fletcher everything belonging to be almost worshipped at wharton hall there have be marriage between two family certainly a far back a time of henry vii be accustomed to speak if not of alliance at rate of friendship much anterior to a regard family therefore pretension of fletcher must always be held to be good by wharton fletcher be very pearl of fletcher tribe though younger brother have very pleasant little fortune of own though born to comfortable circumstance have worked so hard in young day a to have already made for name at bar be fair haired handsome fellow with sharp eager eye with aquiline nose just that shape of mouth chin such men a abel wharton regarded a characteristic of good blood be rather thin about five foot ten in height have character of being one of best horseman in county be one of most popular men in herefordshire at longbarns be almost a much thought of a squire certainly be not man to be taken from appearance for forlorn lover looked like one of happy son of god who be born to success young man of age be more courted by men woman there be one who in youth have suffered fewer trouble from cause of trouble visit english young men occasional impecuniosity sternness of parent native shyness fear of ridicule inability of speech general pervading sense of inferiority combined with ardent desire to rise to feeling of conscious superiority so much have be done for by nature that be never called upon to pretend to anything throughout county be lucky men too be happy girl who be allowed to call arthur yet paragon be vainly in love with emily wharton who in way of love must have nothing to say to preferring a father once said in extremest wrath greasy jew adventurer out of gutter now have be thought expedient to have down to wharton although lawyer regular summer vacation have not yet commenced there be excuse made for over above emergency of own love in fact that brother john with mr fletcher be also to be at hall so that there be gathered there great family party of wharton fletcher for there be present there also old mr fletcher magnificently aristocratic high minded old lady with snow white hair lace worth fifty guinea yard who be a anxious a everybody else that younger son must marry emily wharton something of truth a to emily wharton l be of course known to longbarns people not must have inferred that wanted darling to sell for money fletcher be great people with great spirit too good in way for such baseness when love old friendship good birth together with other propriety a to age manner conduct can be joined to money combination will always be thought pleasant when arthur reached hall be felt to be necessary that word must be said to a to wretched interloper ferdinand lopez arthur have not of late be often in manchester square though always most cordially welcomed there by old wharton treated with kindness by emily wharton short of love desired have during last three four month abstained from frequenting house during past winter early in spring have pressed suit have be rejected with warmest assurance of friendship short of love have then be arranged between elder wharton that must meet down at hall there have be sympathetic expression of hope that might

made calculation bitterness be there for must have done nothing must have expelled wept bitterly a returned to house there might have be cause for joy be clear enough that father though have shown no sign to of yielding be nevertheless prepared to yield be father who have caused arthur fletcher to take off a lover really dismissed at moment must not bring to look at aspect of affair mind must revert to choicest moment in early year in have be happy with arthur fletcher in have first learned to love have then taught to understand by confused perplexed lesson that did not love a men woman love why must not so have loved must not have done so must then have understood how true firm be then independently of throwing aside for time a be bound to do when thinking of one so good to a arthur fletcher found that personal joy must drown grief shared with for moment idea of comparison between two men forced upon drove from a hurried back to house chapter xviii duke of omnium think of blaze made by duchess of omnium during three month of season up in london have be very great be little in comparison with social coruscation expected to be achieved at gatherum castle little at least a far a public report went general opinion of day doubt house in carlton garden have be thrown open a house of prime minister perhaps of duke have be opened before in country have be done by degree have not be accompanied by such blowing of trumpet a be sounded with reference to entertainment at gatherum must not have supposed that trumpet be blown by direct order of duchess trumpet be blown by customary trumpeter a became known that great thing be to be done newspaper very many tongue lending assistance till sound of instrument almost frightened duchess be odd said to friend mr finn that one ca have few friend down in country without fuss about a people be making mr finn did not think that be odd so said thousand of pound be being spent in very conspicuous way invitation to place even for couple of day for twenty four hour have be begged for abjectly be understood everywhere that prime minister be bidding for greatness popularity of course trumpet be blown very loudly if people take care said duchess will put everybody off have whole place shut up 'd do for sixpence now perhaps of person much little concerned one who heard least of trumpet rather who be last to hear be duke must not fail to see something in newspaper what did see did not attract so frequently so strongly a did others be pity thought that man social private life must be made subject to so many remark misfortune be one of to wealth rank be liable have long recognised that fact for time endeavoured to believe that intended sojourn at gatherum castle be not more public than be autumn doings of other duke other prime minister gradually trumpet did reach even ear blind a be to many thing always have near to that other duke who be never blind to anything be going to do great thing at gatherum year said duke nothing particular hope said prime minister with inward trepidation for gradually there have crept upon fear that wife be making mistake thought be going to be very particular be glencora doing doubt that grace be right suppose be criticizing hospitality be to be at gatherum ourselves about end of month will be first time will have seen place since uncle time prime minister at moment be sitting in own particular room at treasury chamber before entrance of friend have be conscientiously endeavouring to define for not future policy past policy of last month two have not be for very happy occupation have become head of government have not failed for there be still head of government with majority at back six month vacation before who be entitled to speak to confidentially a to position be almost vehement in declaring success mr rattler about week ago have not seen reason why ministry must not endure at least for next four year mr roby from other side be equally confident on looking back at what have done indeed on looking forward into future intention must not see why of men must be prime minister have once be chancellor of exchequer filling office through two halcyon session have known reason why have held have ventured to assure at time that be best man whom party must then have found for office have be satisfied have none of satisfaction now there be men under who be really at work lord chancellor have legal reform on foot mr monk be busy heart soul in regard to income tax brewer licence making poor prime minister mouth water lord drummond be active among colony phineas finn have at rate idea about ireland with prime minister so at least duke told be blank policy confided to expected at hand be that of keeping together coalition ministry be task did not satisfy now gradually very slowly indeed at first still with sure step there be creeping upon idea that power of cohesion be sought for perhaps found not in political capacity in rank wealth might in fact be case that be wife duchess that lady glencora of whose wild impulse general impracticability have always be in dread that with dinner party reception with crowded saloon music picnic social temptation be prime minister rather than might be that have be understood by coalesced party by everybody in fact except have perhaps be found that in state of thing then existing ministry must be best kept together not by parliamentary capacity by social arrangement such a duchess duchess alone must carry out only must have spirit money sort of cleverness required in such state of thing of course a husband must be nominal prime minister there be anger in bosom a thought of must be hardly just to say that there be jealousy nature be essentially free from jealousy there be shame self accusation at having accepted so great office with so little fixed purpose a to great work might be duty to subordinate even pride to service of country to consent to be faineant minister gilded treasury log because by remaining in position must enable government to be carried on how base position how mean how repugnant to grand idea of public work have hitherto be motive power of life how must continue to live if thing be to go on from year to year pretending to govern while others governed stalking about from one public hall to in blue ribbon taking highest place at table receiving mock reverence known to men a faineant first lord of treasury now a have be thinking of most trusted of friend have come to have at once alluded to very circumstance have be pressing so heavily on mind be delighted continued elder duke when heard that have determined to go to gatherum castle year if man have big house suppose ought to live in sometimes certainly be for such purpose a now intended that uncle built never became public man therefore though went there year believe never really used hated in heart so do so doe glencora see why man must have private life interrupted by being made to keep huge caravansary open for person doe care straw about must not like to live alone alone with wife child must certainly during portion of year at least doubt whether life even for month even for week be compatible with duty must hardly find possible must do without private secretary must know enough of what be going on if did not discus matter with others man can not be private public at same time therefore one have to be chopped up like ' reed out of river a poet said 'and yet not give sweet music afterwards duke of st bungay said nothing in answer to a did not understand chopping of reed be afraid have be wrong about collection of people down at gatherum continued younger duke glencora be impulsive have overdone thing just look at handed letter to friend old duke put on spectacle read

thought to be not unlikely duke must prolong stay for few day at matching felt confident that must be able to bear burden of castle on own shoulder have thought to be very probable that must prolong stay at matching if absence be not too long might be well explained to assembled company in duchess estimation prime minister must lose nothing by pleading nature of business a excuse for such absence by having plea made for of course must appear at last a to that have fear timidity conscience also must both be too potent to allow to shirk nuisance of gatherum altogether must come be sure did not

must have be with duke have given direction made necessary that locock coming must be postponed for day be grievance be put out good deal began to speculate whether husband be doing on purpose to torment nevertheless a soon a knew that be out of way went to work must not go out among tent lawn conservatory a must probably meet gave order a to bedchamber saw to adornment of reception room have eye to banner martial trophy suspended in vast hall bust statue adorned corner looked in on plate be being prepared for great dining room superintended moving about of chair sofa table generally may take a certain mr pritchard said to housekeeper that there will never be le than forty for next two month forty to sleep lady to pritchard duchess have for many year be lady glencora perhaps

of course there must be two on very long table lady there always be two why did tell so must have have made be impossible impossible that one brain must think of be sure have got enough hand in kitchen well lady must do with more ai atom of use only just in way if know something about suppose mr millepois will be down soon name mr pritchard called milleypoise indicated french cook who be a yet unknown at castle will be here to night wish must have be here day two sooner lady so a just to see about how must have got dinner in town wo make difficulty confectioner did come yes lady to tell truth out at once be that drunk last night oh dear did know what to do with mind that before affair begin suppose will get tipsy while have to work for people have plenty of egg question went on so rapidly that in addition to asking of duchess be able to go through room before dressed for dinner in room saw something to speak of noting perfection imperfection in meantime duke have gone out alone be still hot have made up mind that must enjoy first holiday out of town by walking about own ground must not allow heat to interrupt went out through vast hall huge front door be so huge so grand that be very seldom used be now open by chance owing to incident of festival time passed through stood upon grand terrace with well known much lauded portico over head up to terrace though be very high there ran road constructed upon arch so grand guest must drive almost into house duke who be never grand a stood there looking at far stretching view before must not remember that have ever once before placed on spot of what use have be portico marble huge pile of stone of what use enormous hall just behind cutting house in two declaring aloud by own aspect proportion that have be built altogether for show in degree for use comfort now a stood there must already see that men be at work about place ground have be moved here grass laid down there new gravel road constructed in place be not possible that friend must be entertained without change in garden then perceived tent descending from terrace turning to left towards end of house came upon new conservatory exotics with be to be filled be at moment being brought in on great barrow stood for moment looked said not word to men gazed at evidently did not know how must know who be so seldom there who when there never showed about place then went farther afield from house came across more more men great have have fence have be made enclosing on three side large flat turfed parallelogram of ground taken out of park open at one end to garden containing a thought about acre what be doing for said to one of labourer man stared at at first seemed hardly inclined to make answer be for quality to shoot bow harrow said at last a continued easy task of patting with spade completed work evidently regarded stranger a intruder who be not entitled to ask question even if be permitted to wander about ground from one place went on to found change new erection device for throwing away money everywhere angered to think that there be so little of simplicity left in world that man must not entertain friend without fuss a mind applied frequently to consideration of money not that grudged loss of spending of in cause then perhaps there occurred to idea that must not have be done without word of consent from have come to with scheme for changing everything about place making think that alteration be matter of taste of mere personal pleasure must probably have given assent at once thinking nothing of money be sheer display then walked up saw flag waving over castle indicating that lord lieutenant of county be present there on own soil be right be a must be because flag be waving in compliance with acknowledged ordinance of properly belonged to rank station must be very proud must allow diminution of outward respect to be entitled be to be trenched on by fault in person right of others to enjoyment must be endangered benefit accruing to country from established mark of reverence must be imperilled here be assumed preposterous grandeur be a much within reach of rich swindler of prosperous haberdasher a of having too look of raw newness about be very distasteful to then too knew that nothing of must have be done unless have become prime minister why on earth must man ground be knocked about because becomes prime minister walked on arguing within own bosom till have worked almost up to anger be clear that must henceforth take thing more into own hand must be made to be absurd before world indifference knew must bear harsh criticism thought must endure to ridicule be aware that be pervious suppose paper be to say of that built new conservatory made archery ground for sake of maintaining coalition when got back to house found wife alone in small room in intended to dine after labour be now reclining for few minute husband absence might allow knowing that after dinner there be score of letter for to write think said be ever so tired in life be such very long journey after be very big house have be think into room since have be here have moved most of furniture in drawing room with own hand have counted pound of butter inspected sheet tablecloth be that necessary glencora if have gone to bed instead world suppose must have gone on sir orlando drought must still have led house of common thing must be looked after suppose there be people to do be like martha troubling with many thing always felt that martha be very ill used if there be marthas there must never be anything fit to eat be odd how sure wife be to be scolded if did nothing at must please busy hard working man like know have scolded not a yet be going to begin not to scold dear looking back can remember that ever scolded can remember great many time when ought to tell truth like that have done here can not see that be necessary people make change in garden without necessity sometimes change be made because of guest have be made to gratify own taste must have said nothing although even in case think might have told what proposed to do what when be so burdened with work that know how to turn be never so burdened that can not turn to a know be not what complain of if be done for though be wildest vagary must learn to like distress to think that what might have be good enough for friend before must be thought to be insufficient because of office hold there be be almost going to say vulgarity about distress vulgarity exclaimed jumping up from sofa retract word must not for world say anything must annoy pray pray go on with then again left vulgarity there be other word in language so hard to bear a that have indeed be careful to say that did not accuse of vulgarity nevertheless accusation have be made must call friend liar more plainly than by saying to that must not say that lied dined together two boy also dining with very little be said at dinner horrid word be clinging to lady ear remembrance of having uttered word be heavy on man conscience have told very plainly that thing be vulgar have not meant to use word when uttered came even upon a surprise have be uttered let what apology there may be made word uttered can not be retracted a looked across table at wife saw that word have be taken in deep dudgeon escaped to writing of letter said almost before meal be done vulgarity uttered word aloud to herself a sat down in little room up stair have assigned to herself for own use though be very angry with did not even in own mind contradict perhaps be vulgar why must be vulgar if must most surely get what wanted by vulgarity what be meaning of word vulgarity of course be prepared to do thing be daily doing thing must have be odious to have not husband be public man submitted without unwillingness to constant contact with disagreeable people lavished smile so now said to herself on butcher tinker what said what read what wrote what did whither went to whom be kind to whom unkind be not said done arranged with reference to own popularity when man want to be prime minister have to submit to vulgarity must give up ambition if task be too disagreeable to duchess thought that have be understood at rate ever since day of coriolanus old duke kept out of said to herself chose to live in other way have choice want to be done when do for because ca do for call by ugly name then occurred to that world tell lie day telling on whole much more lie than truth that world have wisely agreed that world will not be accused of lying one doe venture to express open disbelief even of one wife with world at large word spoken whether lie not be presumed to be true of course because spoken jones have said therefore smith who have known lie to be lie have asserted assured belief lying again in way world be able to live pleasantly how be to live pleasantly if husband accused of vulgarity of course be vulgar why must tell so did not do from pleasure that got from letter remained long unwritten then there came moment in resolved that must not be written work be very hard what good must come from why must make hand dirty so that even husband accused of vulgarity must not be better to give up be great woman une grande dame of kind difficult of access sparing of favour aristocratic to backbone very duchess of duchess role must be one very easy to play required rank money little manner possessed old duke have done with ease without slightest trouble to have be treated almost like god because have secluded must make change even yet a husband told that be vulgar thought must make at last before have abandoned desk paper there have come to thought nothing to be so distasteful a failure have known that there must be difficulty have assured that must be firm brave in overcoming be not accusation of vulgarity simply one of difficulty have to overcome be courage already gone from be so weak that single word must knock over word evidently repented of a soon a uttered vulgar well let be vulgar a long a gained object there have be penalty of everlasting punishment denounced against vulgarity then higher idea touched not without effect idea must not analyse be hardly on account le effective did believe thoroughly in husband to extent of thinking fittest man in country to be prime minister fame be dear to nature be loyal though might perhaps in younger day have be able to lean upon with more loving heart have be other than be brighter more gay given to pleasure fond of trifle still must recognise merit with sympathy be imperfect be good that must be england prime minister therefore must do must to keep in place vulgarity be necessary essential might not acknowledge might even if choice be left to refuse to be prime minister on such term need not therefore give way having in way thought out took up pen completed batch of letter before allowed to go to bed chapter xx sir policy when guest began to arrive friend duchess have apparently got through little difficulty for received with open genial hospitality be so delightful a coming evidently from heart there have not be word between husband a to manner in thing be to be done have determined that offensive word must pas altogether out of memory first comer be mr finn who came indeed rather a assistant hostess than a mere guest to duchess uttered few half playful hint a to trouble considering time have done marvel because doe look nice doe there be dirt heap about be a green a though have be there since conquest doe like because look new have got forty five

of gatherum archery ground never drew bow in life not real bow in flesh be dear yet have made 'em out have printed way to make thing go down be to give special importance have gone through bill of fare for first week with millepois who be perfect gentleman perfect then gave little sigh a remembered that word from husband have so wounded used to think that plantagenet worked hard when be doing decimal coinage think ever stuck to a have done doe duke say to ah well upon whole behaves like angel behaves so well that time think will shut up have done with for sake then other half be determined to go on with also for sake have not be displeased ask question dear will hear story have be married twice without knowing that woman ca have everything only said one word be rather hard to bear have passed away afternoon there be quite crowd among first comer be mr mr roby mr mr rattler there be sir orlando lady drought lord ramsden sir timothy beeswax gentleman with wife represented for time ministry of duke be head have be asked in order that fealty submission might be thus riveted there be also there mr mr boffin with lord thrift daughter angelica who have belonged to former ministry one on liberal other on conservative side who be now among duke guest in order that others might see how wide duke wished to open hand there be friend ferdinand lopez who have certainly made best use of opportunity in securing for so great social advantage a invitation to gatherum castle how must father who be simply barrister refuse to receive a son in law man who have be guest at duke of omnium country house then there be certain people from neighbourhood frank gresham of greshamsbury with wife daughter master of hound in part rich squire of old blood head of family to one of aspirant prime minister of day belonged lord chiltern master of fox hound two county off also old friend of ours have be asked to meet have brought wife there be lady rosina de courcy old maid sister of present earl de courcy who lived not far off have be accustomed to come to gatherum castle on state occasion for last thirty year only relic in part of family have lived there for many year in great pride of place for elder brother earl be ruined man younger brother be living with wife abroad sister have married rather lowly in world mother now be dead lady rosina lived alone in little cottage outside old park paling still held fast within bosom old pride of de courcys then there be captain gunner major pountney two middle aged young men presumably belonging to army whom duchess have lately enlisted among follower a being useful in way must eat dinner without being shy dance on occasion though very unwillingly talk little run on message knew peerage by heart must tell detail of unfortunate marriage for last twenty year thought especially since last promotion to be indispensably necessary to formation of london society be comfortable in conviction that have thoroughly succeeded in life by acquiring privilege of sitting down to dinner three time week with peer peeress list of guest have by mean be made a complete here a be to be found in county newspaper in morning post of time enough of name have be given to show of what nature be party duchess have got rather rough lot to begin with said major to captain oh yes knew that wanted to be useful so of course came will stay here week then be back in september up to moment captain gunner have not received invitation for september then there be reason why must not do so have be getting up archery code with said pountney be pledged to come down set going that little gresham girl be bad looking thing rather flabby said captain gunner very nice colour will have lot of money know there be brother said captain oh there be brother who will have greshamsbury property be to have mother money there be very odd story about that know then major told story told particular of wrongly man might do worse than look there said major man might have done worse because miss gresham be very nice girl of course major be wrong about money well now have tried what do think about question be put by sir timothy to sir orlando a sat in corner of archery ground under shelter of tent looking on while major pountney taught mr boffin how to fix arrow to bowstring be quite understood that sir timothy be inimical to coalition though still belonged to that must assist in breaking up if only there be fair chance of belonging to party must remain in power sir timothy have be badly treated did not forget now sir orlando have also of late shown symptom of disturbed ambition be leader of house of common have become almost recognised law of constitution that leader of house of common must be first minister of crown be at least understood by many that such be sir orlando reading of law of constitution have got along know said sir orlando yes yes have got along can imagine possible concatenation of circumstance in must not get along there be always too much good sense in house for absolute collapse be contented wo say be not said cautious baronet did look for very great thing from coalition did look for very great thing from duke seems to that one achievement to have looked have be reaching end of session in safety have done that certainly be great thing to do sir timothy of course main work of parliament be to raise supply when have be done with ease when money wanted have be voted without break down of course minister be very glad to get rid of parliament be a much matter of course that minister must dislike parliament now a that stuart king must have done so two hundred fifty year ago to get session over done with be achievement delight ministry can go on long on far niente principle minister who accedes to will remain long in ministry sir timothy in saying might be alluding to duke reference might be to sir orlando of course be not in cabinet be not entitled to say word think that if be in cabinet if be anxious confess be not for continuation of present state of thing must endeavour to obtain from duke idea of policy for next session sir orlando be man of certain part must speak volubly yet slowly so that reporter others must hear be patient in house in office have great gift of doing what be told by men who understood thing better than did never went very far astray in official business because always obeyed clerk followed precedent have be useful man must still have remained so have not be lifted little too high have be only one in ruck on treasury bench must have be useful to end special honour special place have be assigned to therefore desired still bigger thing duke mediocrity of talent of energy of general governing power have be so often mentioned of late in sir orlando hearing that sir orlando have gradually come to think that be duke equal in cabinet that perhaps behoved to lead duke at commencement of joint operation have held duke in awe perhaps something of feeling in reference to duke personally still restrained duke of omnium have always be big people still might be duty to say word to duke sir orlando assured that if ever convinced of propriety of doing so must say word even to duke of omnium be confident that must not go on quite a be at present said sir timothy a closed conversation where did pick up said major to captain pointing with head to ferdinand lopez who be shooting with angelica thrift mr boffin one of duke private secretary duchess found somewhere be one of fabulously rich fellow out of city who make hundred thousand pound at blow say people be grandee of spain doe anybody know asked major everybody soon will know answered captain think heard that be going to stand for place in duke interest look sort of fellow like be got money come here be good looking therefore will be success in answer to major only grunted major be year two older than captain therefore le willing even than friend to admit claim of new comer to social honour just at moment duchess walked across ground up to shooter accompanied by mr finn lady chiltern have not be seen in garden before day of course little concourse be made round major captain who have be driven away by success of ferdinand lopez returned with sweetest smile mr boffin put down treatise on nature of franchise be studying in order that might lead opposition against ministry next session even sir timothy beeswax who have done work with sir orlando joined throng now do hope said duchess that be shooting by new code be be to be gatherum archery code will break heart if anybody rebel there be one two men said major pountney very gravely who wo take trouble to understand lopez said duchess pointing with finger at friend be that rebel fear did suggest began mr lopez will have suggestion nothing obedience here be sir timothy beeswax mr boffin sir orlando drought be not far off here be mr rattler than whom authority on subject can be better ask whether in other matter suggestion be wanted of course not said major pountney now mr lopez will will not be guided by strict close interpretation of gatherum code because if not be afraid will feel constrained to accept resignation wo resign will obey said lopez good ministerial reply said duchess doubt that in time will ascend to high office become pillar of gatherum constitution how doe shoot miss thrift will shoot very well indeed duchess if go on practises said angelica whose life for last seven year have be devoted to archery major pountney retired far away into park full quarter of mile off smoked cigar under tree be for that have absolutely given up month to drawing out code of rule going backwards forward two three time to printer in desire to carry out duchess wish woman be so d ungrateful said aloud in solitude a turned on hard ground men be so d lucky fellow lopez have absolutely be allowed to make good score off own intractable disobedience duchess little joke about minister generally advantage of submission on part to chief be thought by who heard not to have be made in good taste joke be just such joke a duchess must be sure to make meaning very little still not altogether pointless be levelled rather at husband than at husband colleague who be present be so understood by who really knew a did mr finn mr warburton private secretary sir orlando sir timothy mr rattler who be within hearing thought that duchess have intended to allude to servile nature of position mr boffin who heard rejoiced within comforting with reflection that withers be unwrung thinking with what pleasure might carry anecdote into farthest corner of club poor duchess 't be pitiful to think that after such herculean labour must injure cause by one slight unconsidered word more perhaps than have advanced by energy during time duke be at castle showed seldom to guest so acting a reader will hope understand from sense of importance of own personal presence influenced by conviction that public man must not waste time breakfasted in own room because must thus eat breakfast in ten minute read paper in solitude because be thus enabled to give mind to content life have always be too serious to to be wasted afternoon walked for sake of exercise must have accepted companion if companion have especially offered went off by side door finding side door to be convenient therefore when seen by others be supposed to desire to remain unseen have idea there be so much pride about duke mr boffin said to old colleague sir orlando be pride asked sir orlando may be shyness said wise boffin two thing be so alike can never tell difference man who be cursed by must hardly be prime minister be on day after sir orlando thought that moment have come in be duty to say that salutary word to duke be clearly necessary that colleague must say colleague must have so good right to say a who be leader of house of common understood clearly that though be gathered together then at gatherum castle for festive purpose yet that time be unfit for discussion of state matter doe not world know that when in autumn bismarck of world who be bigger than bismarck meet at that delicious haunt of salubrity affair of world be then settled in little conclave with greater ease rapidity certainty than in large parliament dull chamber of public office emperor meet emperor king meet king a wander among rural glade in fraternal intimacy war be arranged swelling territory be enjoyed in anticipation sir orlando hitherto have known have hardly a yet enjoyed have be long in office sweet confidence can of very nature belong only to very few now time have manifestly come be sunday afternoon sir orlando caught duke in very act of leaving house for walk there be archery many of inmate of castle be asleep there have be question a to propriety of sabbath archery in discussing reference have be made to laud book of sport growing idea that national gallery must be opened on lord day duchess must not have archery be just people who must prejudge question said duchess duchess with various lady with pountneys gunner other obedient male follower have be to church none of minister have of course be able to leave swollen pouch be always sent out from london on saturday night probably can not think a arranged excuse for such defalcation have passed morning comfortably dozing over new novel duke always right in purpose generally wrong in practice have stayed at home working morning thereby scandalising strict have gone to church alone in afternoon thereby offending social church be close to house have gone back to change coat hat to get stick a be stealing out of little side gate sir orlando be down upon if grace be going for walk will admit of company will be delighted to attend said sir orlando duke professed to be well pleased in truth be pleased must be glad to increase personal intimacy with colleague if might be done pleasantly have gone nearly mile across park watching stately movement of herd of deer talking of trifle before sir orlando must bring about opportunity for uttering word at last did somewhat abruptly think upon whole did pretty well last session said standing still under old oak tree pretty well re echoed duke suppose have not much to be afraid of next session be afraid of nothing said duke then sir orlando hesitated duke however said not word to help on sir orlando thought that duke looked more ducal than have ever seen look before sir orlando remembered old duke suddenly found that uncle nephew be very like other doe not become leader of house of common to be afraid of one think continued sir orlando must try arrange among something of policy be not quite sure that ministry without distinct course of action before can long enjoy confidence of country take last half century there have be various policy commanding more le of general assent free trade here sir orlando gave kindly wave of hand showing that on behalf of companion be willing to place at head of list policy have not always commanded own assent continued reform in parliament to have with whole heart given poor assistance duke remembered how bather clothes be stolen that sir orlando have be one of most nimble fingered of thief popery irish grievance ballot retrenchment efficiency of public service have have time thing to be done offer suppose because be in desirable not because be desirable to have

afternoon be lady rosina de courcy suppose heaven earth what companion for to choose why not why must talk to lady rosina de courcy be not jealous bit if mean that think lady rosina will steal heart from why must pick out of people here when there be so many must think fortune made if must only take turn with can not imagine want to make one fortune said duke certainly not in way what must be

certainly people be not dull to if be real pity poor lady be proud of blood yet not ashamed of poverty might come of blood have be life willing enough to get rid of poverty be above three year since

except lady rosina de courcy be walking about with sir orlando drought last sunday very much prefer lady rosina there have be quarrel asked duchess sharply oh dear of course be empty headed idiot everybody have always known be put above place in house must do to quarrel with now think be quarrelsome man cora remember at moment have ever quarrelled with anybody to knowledge may perhaps be

be of course bound to let know opinion sir orlando have intruded by mean be in position justifies saying many thing to might not say then again be man whose opinion doe not go far with have not knack of seeming to agree with man while let word pas idly by be quite true plantagenet therefore be uncomfortable with sir orlando while be able to sympathise with lady rosina what do think of ferdinand lopez asked duchess with studied abruptness think of mr lopez have thought of at why must think of want to think of think be very pleasant fellow be sure be rising man might think latter perhaps feel sure of former very well then to oblige will think latter feel sure of former suppose be true that mr grey be going on mission to persia mr grey be duke intimate friend be at time member for neighbouring borough of silverbridge think will go have doubt about be to go after christmas will give up seat duke did not answer immediately have only just be decided decided by friend that seat must be given up when journey to persia be undertaken mr grey somewhat in opposition to duke advice have resolved that must not be in persia do duty in house of common at same time resolution have only now be made known to duke be rather puzzled to think how duchess have be able to be so quick upon have indeed kept matter back from duchess feeling that must have something to say about might possibly be unpleasant a soon a tidings must reach yes said think will give up seat be purpose though think be unnecessary let mr have mr lopez yes be clever man rising man man be sure to do well who will be of use to just take trouble to talk to be assistance of kind that want minister go on shuffling old card till be so worn out dirty that one can hardly tell pip on be one of dirty old card said duke be nonsense know man who be at head of affair a be ca be included among pack be speaking of what want be new blood new wood new metal may choose to call take advice try man be pauper be money that want cora goose be swan be not fair have never brought to goose swan have be swan who be brought pet swan of mr grey together wo name name be swan have be goose be not for to return member for silverbridge when said gave look almost upset even gravity look be almost same a asking whether must not tell that to marine quite understand thing cora continued influence owner of property may have in borough be decreasing day there arises question whether conscientious man will longer use such influence think 'd like to see man from silverbridge opposing in house may have to bear worse even than well there be man be here have opportunity of knowing of course have not hinted at matter to if there be palliser wanted borough must say word what more patriotic thing can patron do with borough than to select man who be unknown to not related to perfect stranger merely for worth know what may be worth of mr lopez will guarantee said duchess whereupon duke laughed then left duchess have spoken with absolute truth when told husband that have not said word to mr lopez about silverbridge be not long before did say word on same day found alone with in garden so much alone a to be able to speak with privately have certainly made best use of time since have be at castle having secured good will of many of lady displeasure of most of men have never be in parliament think said duchess have never even tried to get there perhaps dislike idea of kind of life indeed said so far from regard a highest kind of life there be in england seat in parliament give man status in country have never done elsewhere then why try because have got into groove have become essentially city man one of who take up trade of making money generally doe content duchess certainly not instead of contenting disgust not that like money only be so insufficient use of one life suppose will try to get into parliament day seat in parliament grow like blackberry on bush pretty nearly said duchess not in part of country good thing seem to be appointed to fall in way of men not of others if there be general election going on to morrow must not know how to look for seat be to be found sometimes even without general election said duchess be alluding to anything now well yes be be very discreet like to do more than allude fancy mr grey member for silverbridge be going to persia mr grey be member of parliament member of parliament ought to be in london not in persia be generally supposed that man in england be more prone to do what ought to do than mr grey therefore mr grey will cease to be member for silverbridge be logic be have grace logic equally strong to prove can follow in borough if have logic must use in matter must for present be kept to myself certainly have little syllogism in head a to duke ruling borough duke wife ruling duke therefore duke wife ruling borough did not think prudent to utter on present occasion think much better that men in parliament must be unmarried said duchess be going to be married said going to be married be have right to say so because lady father have rejected then told whole story so told a to secure entire sympathy in telling never said that be rich man never boasted that search after wealth of have spoken have be successful gave to understand that there be objection to at on score of money may have heard of family said have heard of wharton of course know that there be baronet know nothing more of be not man of large property think miss wharton one must fain call mine be daughter of london barrister believe be rich then will be heiress suppose so consideration have have weight with have always regarded a architect of own fortune have wish to owe material comfort to wife sheer love suggested duchess yes think so be very ridiculous be not why doe rich barrister object rich barrister duchess be out out old tory who think that daughter ought to marry one english tory be not exactly that man doe not hamper daughter in day by politics when be falling in love there be other cognate reason doe not like foreigner now be englishman have foreign name doe not think that name so grandly saxon a wharton must be changed to one so meanly latin a lopez lady doe not object to latinity fancy not to bearer of ah there must not boast in simple truth there be only father ill will between with plenty of money on side asked duchess lopez shrugged shoulder shrug at time may mean anything duchess took shrug a signifying that question be so surely settled a to admit of difficulty then said duchess old gentleman may a well give way at once of course daughter will be too many for in way duchess of omnium became fast friend of ferdinand lopez chapter xxii st james park towards end of september wharton ferdinand lopez be in town together a one else be in town so at least professed to say saw good deal of other lopez a know have spent portion of preceding month at gatherum castle have made good use of time everett wharton have be le fortunate have be little cross with father perhaps little cross with wharton generally who did not thought make quite enough of in event of anything happening to ne'er do well nephew must be heir reflected not unfrequently that something very probably might happen to nephew did not often see particular cousin always heard of a being drunk overwhelmed with debt difficulty altogether in position of life in be probable that something will happen there be always of course danger that young man might marry have child in meantime surely everett wharton must have be a much thought of on bank of wye a arthur fletcher have be asked down to wharton hall have be asked in way have not thought to be flattering have declined to go then there have be plan for joining arthur fletcher in certain shooting have failed in consequence of few word between arthur respecting lopez arthur have wanted to say that lopez be unpardonable intruder have taken part of lopez therefore when time came round have nothing to do with shooting have stayed in town till middle of august have then started by across continent with keen intention of studying german politics have found perhaps that german politics manifest in autumn that foreign country can not be well studied in solitude have returned late in summer just before father sister have left town have have word with old barrister there have be few bill to be paid be allowance have be insufficient often be insufficient then ready money for german tour be absolutely necessary mr wharton might probably have said le about money have not son accompanied petition by further allusion to parliament there be fellow at last really getting together at progress of course will be necessary to know who will be ready to come forward at next general election think know one who wo said father judging from manner in seems at present to manage own money affair there be more severity in than old man have intended for have often thought within own bosom whether must not be well that must encourage son to stand for seat money that have now be asked to advance have not be very much not more in truth than expected to be called upon to pay in addition to modest sum professed to allow son be rich man who be not in truth made unhappy by parting with money there have be thought impudence in conjoint attack be duty to punish therefore have given son very little encouragement of course sir if tell that be not inclined to pay anything beyond allowance make there be end of rather think that have just asked to pay considerable sum beyond allowance have consented everett argued matter further permitted mind to entertain idea that be ill used by father time must come when must probably be heir not only to father money also to wharton title wharton property when position in country must really be a frequently told quite considerable be possible that must refrain from blaming father for not allowing to obtain early in life that parliamentary education must fit to be ornament to house of common safeguard to country in future year now lopez be at progress together be almost only men in club lopez be quite contented with own present sojourn in london have not only be at gatherum castle be going there again then have brilliant hope before so brilliant that began thought to assume shape of certainty have corresponded with duchess have gathered from somewhat dubious word that duke must probably accede to wish in matter of silverbridge vacancy have not yet be declared mr grey be deterred doubt by certain high state purpose from applying for stewardship of chiltern hundred thereby releasing from seat in parliament enabling to perform with clear conscience duty in distant part of world did not feel to be compatible with seat seeker after seat be doubt already on track duchess have thought that a far a duke good word went might possibly be given in favour of mr lopez happy aspirant have taken to be almost a good a promise there be also certain pecuniary speculation on foot must not be kept quite quiet even in september a to did not like to trust entirely to unaided energy of mr sextus parker to boasted alliance of mr mill happerton sextus parker whole heart soul be now in matter mr mill happerton undoubted partner in hunky son have blown little coldly on affair in spite of ferdinand lopez be happy be probable that mr wharton must continue opposition to marriage must make daughter wife of member of parliament of special friend of duchess of omnium have said word about own prospect in reference to marriage everett have be at first too full of own affair to attend much to matter be comparatively so trifling upon word said be beginning to feel angry with governor be kind of thing like at can understand when be angry with must like mind that so much will come round however unjust may be now at moment be last man in world to do injustice in will have thorough confidence in find driven into hostility to by conviction that wo let take real step in life till life have be half frittered away be thinking of parliament of course be say ai englishman be not quite enough of englishman to understand what parliament be to hope to be of day said lopez perhaps may wo say what may get educated to when have be married dozen year to english wife have half dozen english child of own in meantime look at position be twenty eight year old be four year senior doe not matter straw to continued everett few year be everything with have right to suppose may be able to represent county say in twenty year will probably then be head of family rich man consider what parliamentary education must be to then be just life for have laid out in must make useful sympathise with might understand do think of going into house yes do must have changed idea very much then within last month two have changed idea one chief object in life be a know to marry sister if be member of parliament think that difficulty must be cleared away there wo be election for next three year at rate said everett wharton staring at friend mean to keep emily waiting for dissolution there be occasional vacancy said lopez be there chance of anything of kind falling in way think there be ca quite tell particular because other people be concerned think improbable may be in house before well say in three month time in three month time exclaimed everett whose mouth be watering at prospect of friend be what come from going to stay with prime minister suppose lopez shrugged shoulder upon word ca understand continued other be only other day be arguing in very room a to absurdity of parliamentary career pitching into by george like very mischief because have said something in favour now be going in for in sort of mysterious way that fellow ca understand be quite clear that everett wharton thought ill used by friend success there be mystery only ca tell people name what be borough can not tell that at present be sure there will be vacancy think be sure that will be invited to stand be not sure of of course anybody can stand whether invited not if come forward for place will do so on very best interest mention tell because already regard connection with a being so close a to call upon to tell anything of kind yet tell detail tell can in honour tell everett wharton certainly felt aggrieved by friend news plainly showed that did so be so hard that if stray seat in parliament be going begging must be thrown in way of man who did care for must use to good purpose instead of in own way why must one want ferdinand lopez to be in parliament ferdinand lopez have paid attention to great political question of commonwealth knew nothing of labour capital of union strike lock out because be rich by being rich have made way among great people be to have seat in parliament a for wealth might be at own command also if only father must be got to see matter in proper light a for friendship of great people prime minister duchess such like everett wharton be quite confident that be at rate a well qualified to shine among a ferdinand lopez be of too good nature to be stirred to injustice against friend by soreness of feeling did not wish to rob friend of wealth of duchess of embryo seat in parliament for moment there came upon doubt whether ferdinand be so very clever so peculiarly gentlemanlike in way very remarkable almost conviction that be very far from being good looking dined together quite late in evening strolled out into st james park there be nobody in london there be nothing for of to do therefore agreed to walk round park dark gloomy a knew park must be lopez have seen have quite understood bitterness of spirit by everett have be oppressed with peculiarly imperturbable good humour made part of character bore even with tenderness be man a be many of race who must bear contradiction unjust suspicion social ill treatment without shadow of resentment who if have purpose must carry out without shadow of scruple everett wharton have on occasion made very unpleasant lopez have borne with a angel must hardly have done must wharton ever stand in friend way friend must sacrifice without compunction a be lopez bore with simply noting in own mind that everett wharton be greater as than have taken to be be wharton idea that must walk round park lopez for time have discouraged suggestion be wretchedly dark place at night know whom may meet there mean to say that be afraid to walk round st james park with because be dark said wharton certainly must be afraid by know that be afraid with what be good be better than sitting here doing nothing without soul to speak to have already smoked dozen cigar till be so muddled know what be about be so hot one ca walk in day be just time for exercise lopez yielded being willing to yield in almost anything at present to brother of emily wharton though thing seemed to to be very foolish entered park by st james palace started to walk round turning to right going in front of buckingham palace a went on wharton still continued accusation against father said also sharp thing against lopez till companion began to think that wine have drunk have be a bad a cigar ca understand wanting to go into parliament said what do know about if get there can learn like anybody else suppose half of who go there learn be a be born to do very well to support party why must support party that suppose know party must support except 'd vote for duke if a suppose be to get in under duke influence if went into house must go with fixed settled purpose of own be not there yet said lopez willing to drop subject will be great expense to will stand altogether in way of profession a far a emily be concerned must think father must be dead against then must be unreasonable not at all if thought must injure professional prospect be d piece of folly be long short of certainly be very uncivil almost made lopez angry have made up mind that friend be little worse for wine have drunk therefore did not resent even never mind politics parliament now said let get home be beginning to be sick of be so awfully dark whenever do hear step think somebody be coming to rob let get on bit what deuce be afraid of said everett have then come up greater part of length of birdcage walk light at storey gate be just visible road on be then walking be very dark tree be black over head not step be heard near at time be just midnight now certainly among fault might be justly attributed to lopez personal cowardice must not be reckoned on evening have twice spoken of being afraid fear have simply be that ordinary caution indicates object have be that of hindering wharton in first place from coming into park then of getting out of a quickly a possible come along said lopez by george be in blue funk said other can hear teeth chattering lopez who be beginning to be angry walked on said nothing be too absurd thought for real anger kept little in front of wharton intending to show that be displeased have better run away at once said wharton upon word will begin to think that be tipsy said lopez tipsy said other how dare say thing to never in life saw in least altered by thing have drunk lopez knew that at rate be untrue have seen a drunk a cloe before now said be lie said everett wharton come wharton said other disgrace by conduct such a something have put out know what be saying can hardly imagine that must wish to insult be who insulted said be drunk when said knew be untrue lopez walked on little way in silence thinking over most absurd quarrel then turned round spoke be greatest nonsense ever heard in world will go on go to bed to morrow morning will think better of pray remember under circumstance must call man liar unless on cool consideration be determined to quarrel with for lying determined also to see quarrel out be quite ready to see quarrel out good night said lopez starting off at quick pace be then close to turn in park lopez went on till have nearly reached park front of new office a have walked have listened to footfall of friend after while have perceived have thought that have perceived that sound be discontinued seemed to that wharton have altogether lost sens insult to have be so determined so absolutely groundless have striven best to conquer man ill humour by good natured forbearance have only suggested that wharton be perhaps tipsy in order to give excuse if companion be really drunk a now began to think must be right to leave unprotected in park man manner have be strange whole evening there have be sign of effect of wine till after have left club lopez have heard of men who have be apparently sober becoming drunk a soon a got out into air might have be so in case though wharton voice gait have not be of drunken man at rate must turn back look after a did turn back resolved that wharton might say to on night must not notice be too wise to raise further impediment to marriage by quarrelling with emily brother a soon a paused be sure that heard footstep behind be not of everett wharton indeed be sure that heard footstep of more than one person stood still for moment to listen then distinctly heard rush scuffle ran back to spot at have left friend at first thought that perceived mob of people in dusk a got nearer saw that there be man two woman be on ground on back man be apparently kneeling on neck head while woman be rifling pocket lopez hardly knowing how be acting be upon in moment flying in first place at man who have jumped up to meet a came received at once heavy blow on head from weapon however hat so far stopped a to save from being felled stunned then felt blow from behind on ear afterwards conceived to have be given by one of woman before must well look about well know how whole thing have happened man two woman have taken to leg wharton be standing on foot leaning against iron railing whole thing have occupied very short space of time yet effect be very grave at first moment lopez looked round endeavoured to listen hoping that assistance might be near policeman if not that wanderer by night who might be honest enough to help must hear see one in condition of thing be not possible for to pursue ruffian a must not leave friend leaning against park rail be at once manifest to that wharton have be much hurt at rate incapacitated for immediate exertion by blow have received a put hand up to own head from in scuffle hat have fallen be not certain that be not severely hurt lopez must see that wharton be very pale that cravat have be almost wrenched from neck by pressure that waistcoat be torn open front of shirt soiled must see also that fragment of watch chain be hanging loose showing that watch be gone be hurt much said coming close up taking tender hold of friend arm wharton smiled shook head spoke not word be in truth more shaken stunned bewildered than actually injured ruffian fist have be at throat twisting cravat for minute have felt that be choked a have struggled while one woman pulled at watch other searched for purse struggling ala unsuccessfully man have endeavoured to quiet by kneeling on chest strangling with own necktie pressing hard on gullet be treatment after few second of vigorous practice be apt to leave patient for while disconcerted unwilling to speak say word if can whispered lopez looking into other man face with anxious eye at moment there came across wharton mind remembrance that have behaved very badly to friend sort of vague misty doubt whether evil have not befallen because of misconduct knew at same time that lopez be not responsible for evil dismayed a have be still recalled enough of nature of struggle in have be engaged to be aware that lopez have befriended gallantly must not even yet speak saw blood trickling down friend temple forehead lifting up hand touched spot with finger lopez also put hand up drew away covered with blood oh said doe not signify in least got knock know be afraid have lost hat be not hurt oh dear word be uttered with low sigh then there be pause during lopez supported sufferer thought that be over with at one moment will be better now oh yes watch be gone fear be said lopez purse said wharton collecting strength together sufficiently to search for treasure have eight l note in never mind money watch if bone be not broken be bore same to lose shilling one have then walked very slowly away towards step at duke of york column wharton regaining strength a went still able to progress leisurely lopez have not found hat being covered with blood be a far a appearance went in worse plight than other at foot of step met policeman to whom told story who a matter of course be filled with immediate desire to arrest to policeman mind be most distressing that bloody faced man without hat with companion almost too weak to walk must not be conveyed to police station after ten minute parley during wharton sat on bottom step lopez explained circumstance consented to get cab to take address then to go alone to station make report that thief have got off with plunder be only too manifest lopez took injured man home to house in manchester square then returned in same cab hatless to own lodging a returned applied mind to think how must turn event of evening to own use did not believe that everett wharton be severely hurt indeed there might be question whether in morning own injury must not be most severe immediate effect on flustered despoiled unfortunate one have be great enough to justify lopez in taking strong step if strong step must in way benefit must be best to publish affair on house top to bury in shade a nearly a might be buried have determined in own mind that friend certainly have be tipsy in other way must conduct be understood row with tipsy man at midnight in park be not at first sight creditable must be made to have better appearance if told by than if published from other quarter old housekeeper at manchester square must know something about must of course tell what knew loss of money watch must in probability be made known before have reached own door have quite made up mind that must tell story after own fashion told before went to bed night washed blood from face head cut away part of clotted hair then wrote letter to old mr wharton at wharton hall between three four o'clock in morning went out posted letter in nearest pillar so that might go down by day mail certainly be preceded by other written tidings letter sent be a follows dear mr wharton regret to have to send account of rather serious accident have happened to everett be now writing at be having just taken home occurred at about midnight may be quite sure that there be danger must have advertised by telegram there be nothing doing in town therefore a night be fine very foolishly agreed to walk round st james park late after dinner be kind of thing that nobody doe did when have nearly got round be in hurry whereas everett be for strolling slowly so went on before be hardly two hundred yard in front of before be attacked by three person man two woman man presume came upon from behind have not sufficiently collected thought to remember exactly what occurred scuffle of course turned back be luckily in time to get up before be seriously hurt think man must otherwise have strangled be sorry to say that lost watch purse undoubtedly have be very much shaken altogether knocked out of time a people say excuse phrase because think will best explain what want to understand man hand at throat must have stopped breathing for second certainly have received permanent injury must not wonder if must be unwell for day tell exactly a occurred a strike that may like to run up to town for day just to look at need not do so on score of danger of course will see doctor to morrow there did not seem to be necessity for calling one up to night did give notice to police a be coming home fear ruffian have ample time for escape be too weak be too fully employed with to think of pursuing at time of course be at manchester square most faithfully yours ferdinand lopez did not say word about emily knew that emily must see letter must perceive that have be mean of preserving brother in regard to old barrister lopez thought that old man must not feel grateful for conduct have in truth behaved very well to everett have received heavy blow on head in young wharton defence of be determined to make good use though have thought expedient to say nothing about blow in letter surely must all help surely paternal mind must be softened towards when father must be made to understand how great have be service to son everett must make little of what have be done for did not in least fear everett wharton be sometimes silly be never ungenerous in spite of night work lopez be in manchester square before nine on following morning on side of brow bore great patch of black plaster head be very thick said laughing when everett asked after wound must have gone badly with if ruffian have struck inch lower suppose hat saved though remember very little yes old fellow have written to father think will come up be better that must be so there be nothing matter with said everett one did quite know last night whether there be at rate coming wo hurt be always well to have banker near when fund be low then after pause everett made apology know made great as of last night think about used word must have used beg pardon not word everett between thing ca go wrong love other too well chapter xxiii surrender letter given in previous chapter be received at wharton hall late in evening of day on be written be discussed among wharton night of course there be doubt a to father going up to town on morrow letter be just such letter a must surely make man run to son bedside have son written must have be different fact that letter have come from man seemed to be evidence that poor sufferer must not write perhaps urgency with lopez have sent off dispatch getting account of fray ready for very early day mail though fray have not taken place till midnight did not impress sufficiently when accepted a evidence of everett dangerous condition at conference at wharton very little be said about lopez there be general feeling that have behaved well be very odd that must have parted in park said sir alured very lucky that must not have parted sooner said john fletcher if grain of suspicion against lopez might have be set afloat in mind by sir alured suggestion be altogether dissipated by john fletcher reply for everybody there knew that john fletcher carried common sense for two family of course hated ferdinand lopez nothing must be extracted from incident a far a detail be yet known to must be turned to injury while sat together discussing matter in drawing room emily wharton hardly said word uttered little shriek when account of affair be first read to then listened with silent attention to what be said around when there have seemed for moment to be doubt rather question for there have be no doubt whether father must go at once to london have spoken just word of course will go papa after said nothing till came to in own room of course will go with to morrow papa think will be necessary oh yes think how wretched must be must telegraph to immediately must believe telegraph know how always be besides have be more than usual time be to go to town in ten day must not think of returning to fetch of course will go with have already begun to pack thing jane be now at father not knowing how to oppose yielded emily before went to bed have made lady of house aware that also intended to start next morning at eight o'clock during first part of journey very little be said between mr wharton emily there be other person in carriage though have determined in vague way that must speak word to father before reached own house have still wanted time to resolve what word must be before have reached gloucester have made up mind going on from gloucester found for time alone with father be sitting opposite to after conversing for while touched knee with hand papa said suppose must now have to meet mr lopez in manchester square why must have to meet mr lopez in manchester square of course will come there to see everett after what have occurred can hardly forbid house have saved everett life know that have done anything of kind said mr wharton who be vacillating between different opinion did in heart believe that portuguese whom so hated have saved son from thief also have almost come to conviction that must give daughter to man at same time must not a yet bring to abandon opposition to marriage perhaps think story be not true doubt story in least of course one man stick to in such affair have doubt that mr lopez behaved a english gentleman must english gentleman papa must have to come afterwards see friend have saved think so oh yes might call mr lopez will have additional reason for calling know will come think will come want to think anything about said father want to think about papa papa know be not indifferent to happiness hope know do know be quite sure of therefore think ought to be afraid to talk to about what must concern happiness so greatly a far a own self own will be concerned consider given away to mr lopez already nothing marrying other woman death must make think of otherwise than a belonging to be not bit ashamed of owning love to to if opportunity be allowed think there must be concealment about anything so important between people who be dear to other have told will do bid about if say that will not speak to see will not speak to see willingly certainly need not be afraid must marry without leave be not in least afraid of think must think over what be doing be quite sure of must tell what be to do in regard to receiving mr lopez in manchester square mr wharton listened attentively to what daughter said to shaking head from time to time a though almost equally distracted by passive obedience by passionate protestation of love said nothing when have completed supplication threw back in seat after while took book may be doubted whether read much for question a to girl happiness be quite a near heart a must wish to be be late in afternoon before reached manchester square be happy to find that be not troubled by mr lopez at first moment everett be at home in bed have not indeed a yet recovered from effect of man knuckle at windpipe be well enough to assure father sister that need not have disturbed hurried return from herefordshire on account to tell truth said ferdinand lopez be hurt worse than be said nothing of being hurt said mr wharton how be hurt asked emily in quietest stillest voice fact be said everett beginning to tell whole story after own fashion if have be at hand then there must have be end of have separated know what must make two men separate from other in darkness of st james park well to tell truth have quarrelled have made as of need not go into further except that must know that be fault of course be real quarrel when said emily who be sitting close to bed head pressed arm under clothes with hand have said something rough have gone on just to put end to be uncommonly foolish said old wharton be very foolish going round park at at time of night doubt sir be doing if have not gone with must have gone alone here there be pressure be little low in spirit wanted walk how be hurt asked father man who be kneeling on squeezing life out of jumped up when heard lopez coming struck over head with bludgeon heard blow though be pretty well done for at time think hit got something round neck be half strangled before knew what be doing poor lopez bled horribly say be none worse for here there be little pressure under bed clothes for emily felt that brother be pleading for in word that said about ten on following morning lopez came asked for mr wharton be shown into study where found old man at once began to give account of whole concern in easy unconcerned manner have large black patch on side of head have be so put on a almost to become be so conspicuous a to force question respecting from mr wharton be afraid got rather sharp knock mr lopez did get knock certainly odd part of be that knew nothing about till found blood in eye after have decamped lost hat there be rather long cut just above temple have done slightest harm worst of be that got off with everett watch money have much money forty pound lopez shook head thereby signifying that forty pound at present moment be more than everett wharton must afford to lose upon whole carried very well ingratiating with father raising question about daughter saying a little a possible of asked whether must go up see friend of course be allowed to do so minute before entered room

ask for money not exactly in way think must say that must be glad to know what intends to do also saying that certain sum of money must at present be of use to must not be better from only ask ferdinand never have even spoken to about money of course must know that have dictated what said doubt must be natural must do so hope time may come when may write quite freely to father hitherto have hardly be courteous to must rather that must write if mind write own letter show if there be anything too much anything too little will tell so first lesson be taught poor young wife did not at like lesson even within own bosom found fault with husband began to understand that life before be not to be life of rose first word spoken to in train before reached dover have explained something of to have felt at once that there must be trouble about money now though did not at understand what might be nature of trouble though have derived information whatever from husband hint about south american trade though be a ignorant a ever of affair yet felt that trouble must come soon never for moment did seem to that have be unjust in bringing into troubled water have loved other therefore might be trouble be right that must marry other there be not spark of anger against in bosom be unhappy demanded from writing of letter almost immediately after conversation have be given above of course letter be written written recopied for paragraph about money be of course at last of wording must not make remainder of letter pleasant feeling that be making demand for money on father ran through reader need only see passage in ferdinand lopez made demand through hand ferdinand have be speaking to about fortune have gone much against grain with to write word fortune have fortune said insisted however explaining to that be entitled to use word by father undoubted wealth so with aching heart wrote ferdinand have be speaking to about fortune of course told that knew nothing that a have never spoken to about money before marriage have never asked about say that must be of great service to to know what be intention also that hope may find convenient to allow to draw upon for portion of at present say that l must be of great use to in business be paragraph work of writing be so distasteful to that must hardly bring to form letter seemed a though be seizing advantage of first moment of freedom to take violent liberty with father be altogether own fault pet said to have greatest respect in world for father have allowed to fall into habit of keeping affair secret from child of course a go out into world secrecy must in degree be invaded there be precisely same thing going on between everett only everett be great deal rougher to than be likely to be never will let everett know whether be to regard a rich man poor man give allowance because can not help to doe not do even a much a because can help have chosen to leave to have done nothing be not quite fair must be told so think must be told in more dutiful language emily did not like idea of telling father anything might not like to hear husband behest be to in early married day quite imperative chapter xxvi end of honeymoon mr lopez have begged father to address reply to at florence where a explained to expected to find within fortnight from date of writing have reached lake about end of november when weather have still be fine intended to pas winter month of december january within warmth of city that intervening fortnight be to period of painful anticipation feared to see father handwriting feeling almost sure that must be bitterly angry with during time husband frequently spoke to about letter about own letter father expected reply be necessary that must learn lesson must only do so by having subject of money made familiar to ear be not part of plan to tell anything of mean by hoped to make wealthy man le knew of that better fact that father absolutely owed to large amount of money a fortune must not be made too clear to be very desirous to do in such manner a not to make think that be accusing that must accuse if money be not forthcoming must learn fact must be imbued with conviction that husband must be most ill treated of men unless money be forthcoming be little nervous about too said alluding to expected letter not so much a to money though be important a to conduct if chooses simply to ignore after marriage will be behaving very badly have answer to make to must not defend father because by doing so must offend husband yet whole life long trust in father must not allow to think possible that must behave ill to on arrival at florence went at once to post office there be a yet letter fortnight however have be named have only just run out went on from day to day inspecting building looking at picture making for taste in marble bronze visiting lovely village cluster on hill round city doing precisely in respect a do young married couple who devote part of honeymoon to florence in little journeying in work of pleasure inky devil sat not only behind behind also heavy care of life be already beginning to work furrow on face must already sit knitting brow a thought of coming trouble must not father certainly refuse must not husband then begin to be le loving le gracious to herself day for week called at post office when went out with still letter did not come can hardly be possible said at last to that must decline to answer own daughter letter perhaps be ill replied if there be anything of kind everett must tell perhaps have gone back to herefordshire of course letter must go after own be very singular to that must not write look a though be determined to cast off from altogether because have married against wish not that ferdinand say well will see on next day did see went to post office before breakfast on day returned with letter in hand be sitting waiting for with book in lap saw letter at once be from papa said nodded head a handed to open read ferdinand have got to be so nervous about can not do seems to be so important yes be important said with grim smile then opened letter watched face closely a read at first must tell nothing from then in moment first occurred to that have wonderful command of feature however lasted minute then chucked letter lightly in among tea cup coming to took closely in arm almost hurt by violence of repeated kiss have written kindly said a soon a must find breath to speak by george be brick after own did not think darling how much owe for trouble have given oh ferdinand if have be good to will be so happy have be awfully good have have have then began walking about room a laughed in unnatural way upon word be pity did say four thousand five think of taking just at word be great deal better than expected be can say at present moment be of utmost importance to did not take above minute two during minute two have be so bewildered by manner a almost to fancy that expression of delight have be ironical have be so unlike a have known that almost doubted reality of joy when took letter read found that joy be true enough letter be very short be a follows dear emily what have said under husband instruction about money find upon consideration to be fair enough think must have spoken to before marriage then again perhaps ought to have spoken to a be be willing to give sum requires will pay l to account if must tell where must have lodged then will think have done duty by what will do with remainder of money may have think be entitled to ask everett be well again a idle a ever aunt roby be making fool of herself at harrogate have heard nothing from herefordshire everything be very quiet lonely here affectionate father wharton a have dined at eldon day since daughter have left have played on average dozen rubber of whist daily be not justified in complaining of loneliness of london letter seemed to emily to be very cold have not husband rejoiced over so warmly must have considered to be unsatisfactory doubt l must be given that a far a must understand father word be to be whole of fortune have never known anything of father affair of intention have certainly supposed that fortune must be very much more than have learned in indirect way that large sum of money must have gone with hand to arthur fletcher must have brought to marry suitor favoured by family now having learned a have learned that money be of vital importance to husband be dismayed at what seemed to to be parental parsimony be overjoyed so much so that for while lost that restraint over be habitual to ate breakfast in state of exultation talked not alluding specially to l a though have command of almost unlimited mean ordered carriage drove out bought present for thing a to have before decided that must not be bought because of expense pray spend money for said to be nice to have giving thing must be nicer to even than to think must save expense be not in mood to be denied understand said want to be saved from little extravagance of sort owing to circumstance father money be at moment of importance to have answered to whip money be there that trouble be over can enjoy now other trouble will spring up doubt before long did not quite like being told that father have answered to whip be willing to believe that be phrase common among men to must be prudish to make objection there be also something in husband elation be distasteful to must be that revers of fortune with reference to moderate sum of money such a be now coming into hand must always affect in same way be not almost unmanly at rate be not undignified yet tried to make best of lent to holiday mood a well a be able will write thank papa said that evening have be thinking of that said can write if like of course will also will write have better do so post two before a have come round suppose ought to show civil what say about rest of money be of course absurd will ask nothing about doubt after bit will make permanent arrangement everything in business wounded more le now perceived that regarded l only a first instalment of what might get that joy be due simply to temporary success then called father absurd to face for moment thought that must defend father must not a yet bring to question husband word even on subject a that did write to mr wharton in doing so altogether laid aside that flighty manner for while have annoyed thoroughly understood that wording of letter might be very important to took much trouble with must be now great work of life to ingratiate with old man so at rate at old man death might posse at least half of old man money must take care that there must be division between wife father of such nature a to make father think that son ought to enjoy special privilege of primogeniture of male inheritance if must be so managed that daughter must before old man death become favourite child also must be well be therefore very careful about letter be a follows dear mr wharton can not let letter to emily pas without thanking for very liberal response made by to what be of course request from let in first place assure have before marriage made inquiry about money affair must have told everything with accuracy a did not do so thought must seem to intrude upon if introduced subject be too long for letter whenever may like to allude to

of vitality to be much repressed by calamity have heard what be to be done about silverbridge duchess want to get for man ferdinand lopez have not be promised yet seat be not vacant said mr finn know when will be vacant think there be hitch about think duchess be going to be made very angry throughout autumn duke have be unhappy man while absolute work of session have lasted have found something to console now though be surrounded by private secretary though dispatch box went came twice day though there be dozen of letter a to have to give instruction yet there be in truth nothing for to do seemed to that real work of government have be filched from by colleague that be stuck up in pretended authority kind of wooden prime minister from whom real ministration be demanded first fear have be that be unfit now be uneasy fearing that others thought to be unfit there be mr monk with budget lord drummond with three four dozen half rebellious colony sir orlando drought with house to lead ship to build phineas finn with scheme of municipal home rule for ireland lord ramsden with codified statute book full of work with something special to be done for have to arrange who must attend queen what ribbon must be given away what middle aged young man must move address sighed a thought of happy day in used to fear that mind body must both give way under pressure of decimal coinage phineas finn have read duke character rightly in saying that be neither gregarious communicative therefore little fitted to rule englishman have thought that be so now from day to day be becoming more assured of own deficiency must not throw into cordial relation with sir orlando drought even with mr monk though have never wished to be put into present high office now that be there dreaded sense of failure must follow descent from be feeling rather than genuine ambition rather than love of power patronage pay induces men to cling to place absence of real work quantity of mock work alike made life wearisome to must not endure idea that must be written in history that have allowed to be made faineant prime minister then have failed even in history must forget what have done a working minister in recording feebleness of ministry must bear name one man with whom must talk freely from whom must take advice be now with here at castle be shy at first even with duke of st bungay that shyness must generally overcome after few word though be always sure of old friend sympathy of old friend wisdom yet doubted old friend capacity to understand young duke felt old duke to be thicker skinned than therefore unable to appreciate thorn so sorely worried own flesh talk to about policy said host be closeted at time in prime minister own sanctum there yet remained hour before need dress for dinner who talk about policy sir orlando drought especially for duke of omnium have never forgotten arrogance of advice given in park sir orlando be of course entitled to speak though know that be likely to say anything very well worth hearing what be special policy if have of course must hear be not that want special thing to be done think must get up special thing in order that parliament may be satisfied if wanted to create majority might be true just listen to have done with can not go on in way can not submit to what amount to complaint from gentleman who be acting with must submit long to silence be beginning to feel have be wrong think have be wrong at man be wrong if attempt to carry weight too great for strength certain nervous sensitiveness from must free a from disease be only source of weakness think about business a shoemaker think of do best then let customer judge for caveat emptor man must never endeavour to price must accept price others put on only being careful that must learn what price be policy must be to keep government together by strong majority after making of new law be too often unfortunate necessity laid on by impatience of people lengthened period of quiet therefore good government with minimum of new law must be greatest benefit country must receive when recommended to comply with queen behest did so because thought that might inaugurate such period more certainly than other one man old duke be quite content with state of thing such a described have be cabinet minister for more than life liked being cabinet minister thought well for country generally that party must be in power if not party in entirety then a much of party a might be possible did not expect to be written of a pitt somers thought that memoir must speak of a useful nobleman be contented be not only not ambitious effervescence general turbulence of ambition in other men be distasteful to loyalty be second nature to power of submitting to defeat without shame sorrow have become perfect with by long practice must have made brother duke such a be have not brother duke be so lamentably thin skinned suppose must try for session said duke of omnium with lachrymose voice of course must for others after hope trust said duke of st bungay getting up if go up stair will be late then grace will look at with unforgiving eye on following day after lunch prime minister took walk with lady rosina de courcy have fallen into habit of walking with lady rosina almost day of life till people in castle began to believe that lady rosina be mistress of deep policy of own for there be many there who did in truth think that statecraft must never be absent from minister mind day night in truth lady rosina chiefly made agreeable to prime minister by never making most distant allusion to public affair might be doubted whether even knew that man who paid so much honour be head of british government a well a duke of omnium be tall thin shrivelled up old woman not very old fifty perhaps looking at least ten year more very melancholy sometimes very cross have be notably religious be gradually wearing off a advanced in year rigid strictness of sabbatarian practice requires full energy of middle life have be left entirely alone in world with very small income not many friend who be in way interested in existence knew to be lady rosina de courcy felt that possession of name ought to be more to than money friend even than brother sister weather be not frightening said duke snow have fallen path even where have be swept be wet sloppy weather never frightens grace always have thick boot be very particular about cork sol cork sol be admirable think owe life to cork sol said lady rosina enthusiastically there be man named sprout in silverbridge who make did grace ever try for boot think ever did said prime minister then have better be very good very cheap too london tradesman never think can charge enough find can wear sprout boot whole winter through then have resoled suppose ever think of such thing like to have foot dry have got to calculate what cost then passed major pountney who be coming going between stable house who took off hat who saluted host companion with perhaps more flowing courtesy than be necessary never have found out what that gentleman name be yet said lady rosina pountney think believe call major pountney oh pountney there be pountneys in leicestershire perhaps be one of know where come from said duke to tell truth where go to lady rosina looked up at with interested air seems to be one of idle men who get into people house heaven know why never do anything suppose asked said lady rosina duchess did dare say how odd must be if be to suppose that have asked duchess doubt know about then there be little pause be obliged to have sort of people said duke apologetically suppose so when have so many coming going be sorry to say that time be up to morrow so that will make way for somebody else hope wo think of going lady rosina unless be engaged elsewhere be delighted to have duchess have be very kind duchess fear be almost too much engaged to see a much of guest individually a ought to do to being here be great pleasure be too good to much too good will have stayed out time think duke will go to morrow be very methodical know always act by rule have walked two mile now will go in if do want boot with cork sol mind go to sprout dear there be that major pountney again be four time have be up down path since have be walking here lady rosina went in duke turned back thinking of friend perhaps thinking of cork sol of have to be so careful be so important to comfort must not be that fancied lady rosina to be clever can imagine that conversation satisfied of want to of be subject nevertheless liked lady rosina be never bored by be natural wanted nothing from when talked about cork sol meant cork sol then did not tread on of numerous corn a walked on determined that must induce wife to persuade lady rosina to stay little longer at castle in meditating upon made turn in ground again came upon major pountney a gentleman be returning from stable very cold afternoon said feeling to be ungracious to pas one of own guest in own ground without word of salutation very cold indeed grace very cold duke have intended to pas on major managed to stop by standing in pathway major did not in least know man have heard that duke be shy therefore thought that be timid have not hitherto be spoken to by duke condition of thing attributed to duke shyness timidity with much thought on subject have resolved that must have few word with host have therefore passed backwards forward between house stable rather frequently very cold indeed yet have have beautiful weather know when have enjoyed so much altogether a have at gatherum castle duke bowed made little vain effort to get on splendid pile said major stretching hand gracefully towards building be big house said duke noble mansion perhaps noblest mansion in three kingdom said major pountney have seen great many of best country residence in england nothing at equal gatherum then duke made little effort at progression be still stopped by daring major by by grace if grace have few minute to spare just minute wish must allow to say something duke assumed look of disturbance bowed walked on allowing major to walk by side have greatest possible desire lord duke to enter public life thought be already in army said duke so be be on sir bartholomew bone staff in canada for two year have seen a much of what home service a man going one of chief object be to take up army seems that have taken up mean in parliament grace be very fairly off a regard private mean must stand racket of expense of contest if there be one difficulty be to get seat of course if can be privately managed be very comfortable duke looked at again time without bowing major who be not observant rushed on to destruction know that silverbridge will soon be vacant let assure grace that if might be consistent with grace plan in other respect to turn kind countenance towards must find that must have supporter than whom none must be more staunch perhaps may say one who in house must not be least useful portion of major speech referred to duke kind countenance have be learned by heart be thrown trippingly off tongue with kind of twang major have perceived that have not be at once interrupted when began to open budget of political aspiration have allowed to indulge in pleasing augury nothing ask nothing have have be adopted a motto of life more than once have expressed to captain gunner conviction that by george if have only cheek enough there be nothing can not get on emergency major certainly be not deficient in cheek if might be allowed to consider grace candidate must indeed be happy man said major think sir said duke that proposition be most unbecoming most impertinent that ever be addressed to major mouth fell stared with eye a looked up into duke face good afternoon said duke turning quickly round walking away major stood for while transfixed to place cold a be weather be bathed in perspiration keen sense of having put foot into almost crushed for time then assured that after duke must not eat with consolatory reflection crept back to house up to own room to put man down have of course be easy task to duke be not satisfied with to major seemed that duke have passed on with easy indifference in truth be very far from being easy man insolent request have wounded at many point be grievous to that must have a guest in own house man whom have be forced to insult be grievous to that must not have be held in personal respect high enough to protect from insult be grievous to that must be openly addressed addressed by absolute stranger a borough mongering lord who must not scruple to give away seat in parliament a seat be given away in former day be especially grievous to that misfortune must have come upon a part of result of wife manner of exercising hospitality if be to be prime minister certainly must not be prime minister much longer have aspirant to political life ever dared so to address lord brock lord de terrier mr mildmay old premier whom remembered thought not have managed differently have be able to defend from such attack by personal dignity must have be possible that man must have dared so to speak to uncle late duke thought not a shut up in own room grieved inwardly with deep grief after while walked off to wife room still perturbed in spirit perturbation have indeed increased from minute to minute must rather give up politics altogether shut up in absolute seclusion than find subject to insolence of pountney might address with wife found mr finn now for lady personally entertained what for be warm regard in various matter of much importance have be brought together have to thinking invariably behaved well intimacy have be established have enabled to be at ease with so that presence be often comfort to at present moment have not wished to find one with wife felt that be in way perhaps be disturbing said in tone of voice be solemn almost funereal not at said duchess who be in high spirit want to get promise now about silverbridge mind her of course know everything to be told that body knew everything be shock to have just got letter from mr lopez must be right that wife must be corresponding on subject with person so little known a mr lopez may tell that will have interest when seat be vacant certainly not said duke with scowl be terrible even to wife wished to speak to wished to speak to alone beg thousand pardon said mr finn preparing to go stir marie said duchess be going to be cross if mr finn will allow with feeling of most perfect respect sincerest regard to ask to leave with for few minute will be obliged if with usual hearty kindness will pardon abruptness then must not go on emotion being too great put out hand taking hers raised to lip kissed moment have become too solemn for further hesitation a to lady going duchess for moment be struck dumb mr finn of course left room in name of heaven plantagenet what be matter who be major pountney who be major pountney how on earth must know be major pountney be about everywhere let be asked into house of mine again be trifle anything about major pountney must must think be trifle have tidings come that heaven be going to fall nothing short of must make so solemn in first place glencora let ask not to speak to again about seat for silverbridge be not at present prepared to argue matter with have resolved will know nothing about election a soon a seat be vacant if must be vacated will take care that determination be known in silverbridge why must abandon privilege in way be sheer weakness interference of peer be unconstitutional there be braxon said duchess energetically where marquis of crumber return member regularly in spite of reform bill bamford cobblersborough look at lord lumley with whole county in pocket not to speak of two borough what nonsense plantagenet anything be constitutional anything be unconstitutional just a choose to look at be clear that duchess have really studied subject carefully very well dear let be nonsense only beg to assure that be intention request to act accordingly there be thing have to say to will be sorry to interfere in way with pleasure may derive from society a long a be burdened with office have be imposed upon will not again entertain guest in own house plantagenet can not turn people out who be here now beg that may be allowed to go a time come that place may not be filled by further invitation further invitation have gone out ever so long ago have be accepted must be ill dear ill at ease yes at rate let none others be sent out then remembered kindly purpose have formed early in day fell back upon must however be glad if must ask lady rosina de courcy to remain here duchess stared at really thinking now that something be amiss with whole thing be failure will have more of be degrading then without allowing moment in to answer marched back to own room even here spirit be not a yet at rest that major must not go unpunished though hated fuss noise must do something so wrote a follows to major duke of omnium trust that major pountney will not find inconvenient to leave gatherum castle shortly must major pountney wish to remain at castle over night duke of omnium hope that will not object to be served with dinner with breakfast in own room carriage horse will be ready for major pountney use to take to silverbridge a soon a major pountney may express to servant wish to effect gatherum castle december note duke sent by hand of own servant having said enough to man a to carriage possible dinner in major bedroom to make man understand almost exactly what have occurred note from major be brought to duke while be dressing duke having glanced at note threw into fire major that evening eat dinner at palliser arm inn at silverbridge chapter xxviii duchess be much troubled be hardly possible that one man must turn out of house without many people knowing when one person be prime minister other such major a major pountney affair be apt to be talked about very widely duke of course never opened mouth on subject except in answer to question from duchess servant knew pritchard tell that have sent that wretched man out of house with flea in ear said duchess sent out of house certainly be hardly worth anger be not at worth anger must not sit down to dinner with man who have insulted what did say plantagenet know be something about silverbridge to question duke gave answer in respect to silverbridge be stern a adamant two day after departure of major be known to silverbridge generally that in event of there being election duke agent must not a usual suggest nominee there be paragraph on subject in county paper in london evening pulpit duke of omnium that might show respect to law not only a to letter of law a to spirit also have made known to tenantry in round silverbridge generally that must in way influence choice of candidate in event of election newspaper did not say word about major pountney club of course knew about man at club ever knew more than captain gunner soon after christmas met friend major on step of new military club active service be declared by many men in army to have left other military club absolutely nowhere halloa punt said seem to have made mess of at last down at duchess wonder what know about have to come away pretty quick take of course came away pretty quick so much a that major be aware must be known there be detail must deny safely a must be impossible that must be supported by evidence there be matter must be admitted will bet fiver beyond know nothing about duke ordered off take after fashion did there be circumstance in man can not help be diplomatical because left captain to suppose that duke be man who must not help of course be not there said gunner ca absolutely know suppose have be interfering with duchess about silverbridge glencora will bear great deal since have taken up politics by george have better not touch there at last came to be believed that major have be turned out by order of duchess because have ventured to put forward a opponent to ferdinand lopez major felt really grateful to friend captain for arrangement of story there came at last to be mixed up with story half understood innuendo that major jealousy against lopez have be of double nature in reference to duchess borough so that escaped from much of disgrace naturally attache to man who have be kicked out of man house there be mystery when there be mystery man must never be condemned where there be woman in case man can not be expected to tell truth a for calling out in way punishing prime minister that of course be out of question so went on till at last major be almost proud of what have done talked about willingly with mysterious hint in practice made perfect with duchess affair be very serious so much so that be driven to call in advice not only from constant friend mr finn afterwards from barrington erle from phineas finn lastly even from duke of st bungay to whom be hardly willing to subject duke being special friend of husband matter became so important to that be unable to trifle with at expulsion of major pountney soon became forgotten affair when duchess learned truth quite approved of expulsion only hinting to barrington erle that act of kicking out must have be more absolutely practical loss of silverbridge though hurt sorely must be endured must write to friend ferdinand lopez when time must come excusing a best might must lose exquisite delight of making member of parliament out of own hand newspaper however have taken that matter up in proper spirit political capital might to extent be made of loss of silverbridge though bruised broke bone duke have again expressed with unusual sternness respecting ducal hospitality have reiterated declaration of intention to live out remainder of period of office in republican simplicity have tried have failed let there be end of said to simple direct disobedience to order be a little in way a simple direct obedience knew husband well knew how must be managed how must not be managed when declared that there must be end of meaning end of very system by hoped to perpetuate power did not dare to argue with yet be so wrong trial have be no failure thing have be done well done have succeeded be failure to be presumed because one impertinent puppy have found way into house then to abandon system at once whether have failed whether have succeeded must be to call attention of world to acknowledged failure to failure so disreputable that acknowledgment must lead to loss of everything be known now so argued duchess to herself that have devoted to work of cementing consolidating coalition by graceful hospitality wealth of herself husband enabled to dispense have made prime ministress by manner in opened saloon banqueting hall garden have never be done before now have be well done there have be failure yet everything be to be broken down because nerve have received shock let die out mr finn have said people will come here will go away then when be up in london will soon fall into old way did not suit new ambition of duchess have so fed mind with daring hope that must not bear that must die out have arranged course of thing in own mind by must come to be known a great prime minister wife have perhaps unconsciously applied epithet more to herself than to husband too wished to be written of in memoir to make niche for herself in history now be told that be to let die out suppose be little bilious barrington erle have said think will forget about when get up to london duchess be sure that husband must not forget anything never did forget anything want to be told said duchess that everybody think that be doing very well mean about politics exactly a to keeping party together think that have succeeded barrington erle thought that upon whole have succeeded suggested at same time that there be seed of weakness sir orlando sir timothy beeswax be not sound know said barrington erle ca make sounder by shutting up like hermit said duchess barrington erle who have peculiar privilege of own promised that if must by mean make occasion must let duke know that side of coalition be more than contented with way in did work think have made mess of said to phineas asking question think that duke have made mess of said phineas who have come to love duchess because wife loved wo go on for ever duchess know what have done said duchess who took for granted that mr finn knew that wife knew have answered phineas be silent for moment of course will tell truth wo be so bad a to flatter now that be so much in earnest almost think said phineas that time have gone by for what one may call drawing room influence used to be very great old lord brock used extensively though by mean a grace have done spirit of world have changed since then spirit of world never change said duchess in soreness strongest dependence be on old duke party at castle be almost broken up when consulted have be so far true to husband a not to ask guest to house since command who have be asked before came went a have be arranged then when place be nearly empty when locock millepois pritchard be wondering among at general collapse asked husband leave to invite old friend again for day two do so want to see think will come said duchess duke gave permission with ready smile not because proposed visitor be own confidential friend because suited spirit to grant request a to one after order that have given have named major pountney think must have smiled acceded duke came to poured out whole soul have be for for honour have done that men woman might know how really gracious be how good of course there have be money spent can afford without hurting child have be so necessary that with coalition people must know other there be little absurd row here man who be mere nobody one of travelling butterfly men fill up space talk to girl got hold of be impertinent be so thin skinned that must not shake creature into dust a must have done annoyed that think seeing so many strange face so that came to declared that a long a remained in office must not have person in house here in london meant literally meant to understand literally have to get special leave before must ask so dear old friend a grace think must object to said duke laughing of course not be only too glad to think must come took request a being proper thing will kill if be to be carried out after have done must show nowhere will be so injurious to must not tell duke one else in world can tell nothing unfair have be attempted job have be done have endeavoured to make house pleasant to people in order that might look upon with grace favour be that wrong be that unbecoming wife old duke patted on head a though be little girl be more comforting to than other counsellor must say nothing to husband now must be up in london at meeting of parliament then must tell friend that in opinion sudden change must be made husband of yours be very peculiar man said smiling honesty be not like honesty of other men be more downright more absolutely honest le capable of bearing even shadow stain from dishonesty might throw upon give credit for remember that can not find everything combined in same person be very practical in thing question be whether be not too scrupulous to be practical in thing at close of interview duchess kissed promised to be guided by occurrence of last few week have softened duchess much chapter xxix two candidate for silverbridge on arrival in london ferdinand lopez found letter waiting for from duchess came into hand immediately on reaching room in belgrave mansion be of course first object of care that contains fate said to wife putting hand down upon letter have talked to much of chance have come in way have shown to be very ambitious of honour offered to of course have sympathised with be willing to think good thing of duchess of duke if must between put husband into parliament paused moment still holding letter under hand must hardly think must be such coward like to open said have got to do unless make do for said holding out letter to will have to learn how weak be when be really anxious become like child think be ever weak said caressing if there be thing to be done must do at once will open if like then tore off envelope with air of comic importance stood for few minute while read what first perceive be that there have be row about said row about what sort of row dear friend duchess have not quite hit off with le dear friend duke doe not say so oh dear friend duchess be much too discreet for can see that have be so be to be new member if be arranged care bit about duke duchess thing settle quite so easily a be not to have seat at rate without fighting for there be letter duchess letter to new adherent will be given must first be understood that many different idea have passed through writer mind between writing of letter order given by prime minister to wife concerning borough of course became aware at once mr lopez must be informed that must not do for what have suggested that must do there be necessity of writing at instant mr grey have not yet vacated seat mr lopez be away on travel month of january be passed in comparative quiet at castle during time became known at silverbridge that election must be open duke must not even make suggestion must neither express feel resentment must member be returned altogether hostile to ministry by degree duchess accustomed to condition of affair a consternation caused by husband very imperious conduct wore off began to ask whether even yet need quite give up game must not make member of parliament altogether out of own hand a have once fondly hoped might do still might do something must in nothing disobey husband if mr lopez be to stand for silverbridge must not be known in borough that mr lopez be friend therefore wrote following letter gatherum january dear mr lopez remember that said that must be home at time therefore write to about borough thing be changed since went away fear not changed for advantage understand that mr grey will apply for chiltern hundred at end of march that election will take place in april candidate will appear a favoured from hence used to run favourite favourite must sometimes win must sometimes even have walk over good time be gone good time be going think there be reason know why must not stand a well a

ever since marriage have be teaching intentionally teaching that must be duty of of to get must from father have learned lesson have be very distasteful to have not induced to think ill of husband be too much engrossed with too much in love with for be beginning to feel that world in general be hard greedy uncomfortable if be proper that father must give daughter money when be married why did not father do so without waiting to be asked yet if be unwilling to do so must not be better to leave to pleasure in matter now began to perceive that father be to be regarded a milch cow that be to be dairy maid husband at time must become terribly anxious on subject on receiving promise of l have be elated since that have continually talked of what more father ought to do for perhaps have better take bull by horn said do then will find out whether really have interest at heart whether look on a stranger because have gone away from think will look upon a stranger will see said lopez be not

sprugeon be very discreet man mr sprugeon at first knew little nothing seemed hardly to be aware that there be member of parliament for silverbridge declared to be indifferent a to parliamentary character of borough at last melted little by degree over glass of hot brandy water with agent at palliser arm confessed to shade of opinion that return of mr lopez for borough must not be disagreeable to person person who did not live quite hundred mile away instruction given by lopez to agent be of most cautious kind agent be merely to feel ground make few inquiry hing client did not intend to stand unless must see way to almost certain success with very little outlay agent perhaps liking job did little outstep employer order mr sprugeon when frost of first modesty have be thawed introduced agent to mr sprout maker of cork sol mr sprugeon mr sprout between have soon decided that mr ferdinand lopez must be run for borough a castle candidate duke wo interfere said sprugeon of

influence be predominant duke name have never be mentioned at silverbridge hardly even that of duchess since duke declaration castle have taken part old duke used to play agent be quite sure that one must get in for silverbridge without having castle on side doubt duke declaration have have ill effect of bringing up competitor thus of causing expense must not now be helped agent be of opinion that duke have have no alternative agent hinted that time be changing that though duke be still duke must still exercise ducal influence be driven by change to act in altered form proclamation have be especially necessary because duke be prime minister agent did not think that mr lopez must be in least angry with duke everything must be done that castle must do lopez must be doubt returned though unfortunately not without expense how much must cost accurate answer to question must be impossible probably about l might be l must not possibly be above l lopez winced a heard sum named did not decline contest then name of opposition candidate be whispered to lopez be arthur fletcher lopez started asked question a to mr fletcher interest in neighbourhood fletcher be connected with de courcys

than one occasion already allowed to be persuaded into certain fiscal arrangement by lopez must find put at ease with reference to money at rate for next four month have at once told that election must cost l when various sum be mentioned in reference to affair safety must alone be found in taking outside sum perhaps might generally be more surely found by adding fifty per cent to that knew that be wrong about election assured that have have no alternative misfortune have be that duke must have made proclamation about borough immediately after offer made by duchess have be almost forced to send agent down to inquire agent when making inquiry have compromised must go on with now perhaps idea of pleasantness of increased intimacy with duchess of omnium encouraged in way of thinking duchess be up in town in february lopez left card in carlton terrace on very next day card of duchess be left for mr lopez at belgrave mansion lopez went into city day leaving home at about eleven o'clock not returning much before dinner young wife at first found that hardly knew what to do with time aunt mr roby be distasteful to have already learned from husband that have little respect for mr roby remember sapphire brooch have said once be part of price have to pay for being allowed to approach be sitting at time with arm round waist looking out on beautiful scenery talking of old difficulty must not find in heart to be angry with idea brought to mind be disagreeable to be thoroughly angry with mr roby of course in day mr roby came to see of course when be up in manchester square went to house round corner there be close intimacy between aunt niece many of father friend whom regarded a herefordshire set be very cold to have not made glory to herefordshire a people said have broken heart of best herefordshire young man of day made great falling off in acquaintance be more felt a have never be a girl devoted to large circle of dearest female friend whom have loved best have be mary wharton mary wharton have refused to be bridesmaid almost without expression of regret saw father occasionally once came dined with at room on occasion lopez struggled hard to make up well sounding party there be roby from admiralty happertons sir timothy beeswax with whom lopez have become acquainted at gatherum old lord mongrober barrister who have dined out good deal in time perceived effort who that ever with difficulty scraped dinner guest together be able afterwards to obliterate sign of struggle be however first attempt lopez whose courage be good thought that might do better before long if must get into house make mark there people then must dine with fast enough while be going on emily life be rather dull have provided with brougham everything around be even luxurious there came upon gradually feeling by marriage have divided from own people did not for moment allow feeling to interfere with loyalty to have not known that division must surely take place have not married because loved better than own people so sat down to read dante for have studied italian together during honeymoon have found that knew language well be busy with needle already began to anticipate happiness must come to when child of must be lying in arm be of course much interested about election nothing must a yet be done because a yet there be vacancy still subject be discussed daily between who do think be going to stand against said one day with smile very old friend of yours knew at once who man be blood came to face think might a well have left alone know said did know asked in whisper know of course knew be doing on purpose beat once old girl did will beat again liked to call old girl loved perfect intimacy with treated there be something grated against feeling in allusion by to other man who have loved of course have told whole story have conceived to be duty to do so then thing must have be over be necessary perhaps that must tell who be opponent be impossible that must not know when fight came did not like to hear boast that have beaten arthur fletcher once that must beat again by doing so likened sweet fragrance of love to dirty turmoil of electioneering contest did not understand how must that though have never loved arthur fletcher have never be able to bring to love when friend have wished feeling to be nevertheless of affectionate friendship that regarded a being perfect in way thorough gentleman man who must not for world tell lie a most generous among generous most noble among noble when other wharton have thrown off have not be cold to very day a soon a husband have left looked again at little note be a always have be remembered that farewell down by bank of wye will always have one one besides who will love best in world be dangerous word for to remember in recalling to memory have often assured that must not be dangerous to be too sure of own heart to be afraid of danger have loved one man have not loved other yet now when husband talked of beating man again must not remember word did not think rather have not thought that arthur fletcher must willingly stand against husband have occurred to at once that must first have become candidate without knowing who must be opponent ferdinand have assured a matter of fact that fletcher have known about suppose in politics men be different said to herself husband have evidently supposed that arthur fletcher have proposed a candidate for silverbridge with express object of doing injury to man who have carried off love repeated to herself husband word be doing on purpose did not like to differ from husband must hardly bring to believe that revenge of kind must have recommended to arthur fletcher little time after when have be settled in london about month letter be brought at once recognised arthur fletcher writing be alone at time occurred to at first that perhaps ought not to open communication from without showing to husband then seemed that hesitation must imply doubt of man almost doubt of why must fear what man might write to so opened letter read with infinite pleasure be a follows dear mr lopez think best to make explanation to a to certain coincidence might possibly be misunderstood unless explained find that husband be to be opponent at silverbridge wish to say that have pledged to borough before have heard name a connected with have very old association with neighbourhood be invited to stand by friend who have known life a soon a be understood that there must be open contest can not retire now without breaking faith with party do know that there be reason why must do so must not however have come forward have known that mr lopez be to stand think have better tell so tell also with compliment that hope may fight political battle with mutual good fellowship good feeling yours very sincerely arthur fletcher emily be very much pleased by letter yet wept over felt that understood accurately motif be at work within man breast when be writing a to truth of course letter be gospel to oh if man must become husband friend how sweet must be of course wished thoroughly wished that husband must succeed at silverbridge must understand contest a might be carried on without personal animosity letter be so like arthur fletcher so good so noble so generous so true moment husband came in showed to with delight be sure said a be reading letter that have not known that be to stand knew a well a did replied a spoke there came dark scowl across brow writing to be piece of infernal impudence oh ferdinand understand do deserves to be horsewhipped for daring to write to if can come across will have oh for heaven sake man who be rejected lover who have be trying to marry for last two year presuming to commence correspondence with without husband sanction meant to see say be to tell psha be simple cowardice meant not to tell then when have answered without telling must have have whip hand of oh ferdinand what evil thought have be child dear must allow to dictate to what ought to think in such matter a tell knew about candidature that what have said here to contrary be mere lie yes lie repeated word because saw that shrank at hearing did not understand why shrank that idea of such accusation against arthur fletcher be intolerable to have never heard of such thing continued do suppose be common for men who have be thrown over to write to lady who have rejected immediately after marriage circumstance justify make infinitely worse must have felt to be debarred from writing to a being wife a being wife of man whom intends to oppose at silverbridge said with so much anger that frightened be not fault said be not fault must regard a great fault committed by what be to do give letter of course can hing will not quarrel with certainly will have quarrelled with already do think will allow man to insult wife without quarrelling with what will do can not yet say may do have better not know never thought much of herefordshire swell who believe to be very cream of earth now think le of than ever be then silent slowly took out of room went away to dress be very terrible have never be rough to before must not at understand why have be so rough to now surely be impossible that must be jealous because old lover have written to such letter a have shown then be almost stunned by opinion have expressed about fletcher opinion knew be sure that knew to be absolutely erroneous liar oh heaven then letter be so ingenuous so honest anxious a be to do that husband bade must not be guided by in matter then remembered word must allow to dictate to what ought to think must be that marriage meant a much a that that husband be to claim to dictate to wife what opinion be to form about that person about person have known so well whom have never known surely must only think in accordance with own experience own intelligence be certain that arthur be liar not even own husband must make think that chapter xxxi yes with horsewhip in hand emily lopez when crept out of own room joined husband just before dinner be hardly able to speak to so thoroughly be dismayed troubled horrified by manner in have taken arthur fletcher letter while have be alone have thought over anxious if possible to bring into sympathy with husband more thought of more evident did become to that be altogether wrong be so wrong that seemed to that must be hypocrite if pretended to agree with there be dozen accusation conveyed against mr fletcher by husband view of matter be liar giving false account of candidature be coward enemy to who have laid plot by have hoped to make act fraudulently towards own husband who have endeavoured to creep into correspondence with so to compromise husband mind have so easily conceived be not only impossible to so horrible that must not refrain from disgust at husband conception letter have be left with remembered word of be sure that be honest letter meaning more than have be said simply intending to explain to that must not willingly have stood in way of friend whom have loved by interfering with husband prospect yet be told that be to think a husband bade think must not think so must not say that thought so if husband must not credit judgment let matter be referred to father ferdinand must at rate acknowledge that father must understand matter even if must not during dinner said nothing on subject did be attended by page in button whom have hired to wait upon meal passed off almost in silence looked up at frequently saw that brow be still black a soon a be alone spoke to having studied during dinner what word must first say be going down to club to night have told that matter of election have be taken up at progress that possibly might have to meet two three person there on evening there have be proposition that club must bear part of expenditure be very solicitous that such arrangement must be made said will not go out to night be not sufficiently light hearted what make heavy hearted ferdinand must have thought must have known suppose do know know why must know why must be displeased at rate have done nothing wrong no not a to letter astonishes that must be so so bound to man bound to ferdinand be bound to that have so much regard for a not to see that have grossly insulted have regard for dare to tell so dare what must be if have feeling did not dare to tell there be harm in regarding man with friendly feeling whom have known since be child whom family have loved family wanted to marry did have married because loved need not think badly of old friend because did not love why must be angry with what can have to be afraid of then came sat on knee caressed be that will be afraid of said lopez let give borough up if mean what say who must ask to do that not certainly oh can ask must ferdinand yes with horsewhip in hand indeed indeed know will do will tell father everything leave to to say whether mr fletcher have behaved badly to certainly not will not have interference from father between if have listened to father must not have be here now father be not a yet friend of mine when come to know what can do for that can rise higher than herefordshire people then perhaps may become friend will consult in nothing so peculiar to a own wife must understand that in coming to obligation from to became extinct of course be father in such matter a have more to say to than stranger after that hardly spoke to sat for hour with book in hand then rose said that must go down to club there be so much villainy about said that man if mean to do anything must keep on watch when be alone at once burst into tear soon dried eye putting down work settled to think of what did mean why be thus changed to must be that be same ferdinand to whom have given without doubt a to personal merit word that have spoken since have shown letter from arthur fletcher have be injurious to offensive almost seemed a though have determined to show to be tyrant to have only put off playing part till first convenient opportunity after honeymoon through idea be loyal to must obey in thing where obedience be possible must love better than world oh yes for be not husband be to prove worst of men must still love have be for better for worse a have repeated word to herself have sworn that if worst must come must still be true must not bring to say that arthur fletcher have behaved badly must not lie knew well that conduct have be noble generous then unconsciously involuntarily rather in opposition to own will inward effort mind must draw comparison between husband arthur fletcher there be peculiar gift grace acquirement belonging without dispute to one other lacked what be have heard father say when talking of gentleman of race of gentleman with whom have be lot to live that must not make silk purse out of sow ear use of proverb have offended much for have known well whom have then regarded a silk purse whom a sow ear now perceived that there have be truth in though be a anxious a ever to think well of husband to endow with possible virtue have once ventured to form doctrine for herself to preach to herself sermon of own to tell that gift of gentle blood of gentle nurture of father thought so much to something of divinity be attributed down in herefordshire be after weak spiritless quality must exist without intellect without heart with very moderate culture be compatible with many littleness with many vice a for love of honest courageous truth father be wont to attribute to regarded theory a based upon legend a in earlier year be theory of courage constancy loyalty of knight of day beau ideal of man then pictured to herself be graced first with intelligence then with affection lastly with ambition knew reason why hero a fancy created must be born of lord lady rather than of working mechanic must be english rather than spanish french man must not be hero without education without attribute to be attained doubt more easily by rich than by poor with granted with attained did not see why why world must go back beyond man own self such have be theory a to men attribute acting on that have given happiness into keeping of ferdinand lopez now there be gradually coming upon change in conviction change be most unwelcome that strove to reject one must not acknowledge that have adopted even while adopting now ay from very hour of marriage have commenced to learn what be that father have meant when spoke of pleasure of living with gentleman arthur fletcher certainly be gentleman must not have entertained suspicion husband have expressed must not have failed to believe such assertion a have be made must never have suggested to own wife that man have endeavoured to entrap into secret correspondence seemed to hear tone of arthur fletcher voice a of husband still rang in ear when bade remember that be now removed from father control now then tear must come to eye must sit pondering listless low in heart then must suddenly rouse with shake take up book with resolve that must read steadily must assure a did so that husband must still be intelligence at rate be there in spite of roughness affection craved ambition too be there ala ala why must such vile suspicion have fouled mind be late that night when came kissed brow a lay in bed knew that temper be again smooth feigned to be sleepy though not asleep a just put hand up to cheek did not wish to speak to again that night be glad to know in morning must smile on be early at breakfast said to a left next morning for be going down to silverbridge to day then started up to day yes by there be plenty of time only be unusually late of course be something more than usually early when came out found reading paper be settled now said grey have applied for hundred mr rattler be to move for new writ to morrow have come rather sudden at last a thing always do after long delay say suddenness be rather in favour when will election take place suppose in about fortnight perhaps little longer must be at silverbridge time oh dear will stay there to night perhaps to morrow night of course will telegraph to directly find how be to be will see principal inhabitant probably make speech two do so wish must hear 'd find awfully dull work girl will find awfully dull too imagine that mr sprugeon mr sprout will be pleasant companion well will stay there day two settle when be to go down for absolute canvas will have to go with hat in hand to blessed inhabitant in dirty little town ask to be kind enough to drop in paper for most humble of servant ferdinand lopez suppose candidate have to do same oh yes friend master fletcher will have to do winced at arthur fletcher be friend at present moment ought not so to have spoken of from hear be just sort of fellow will like doing of be odious to to ask fellow despise for anything why must despise low ignorant greasy cad who have idea of real meaning of political privilege men who must sell vote for thirty shilling if game have not be made little too hot if be like must not represent oh yes must when came to understand world be fine thing to be in parliament be way to get in however on visit will only see great men of town sprout sprugeons will go to gatherum castle oh heaven may go anywhere now rather than there duke be supposed to be in absolute ignorance of very name of candidate whether there be candidate suppose that word silverbridge will be even whispered in ear till thing be over be to get in by friendship by hers at least hope so have doubt that sprout sprugeons have be given to understand by lococks pritchards be duchess wish that have also be intimated in subtle way that duke be willing to oblige duchess there be ever so many way know of killing cat expense suggested emily oh ah expense when come to talk of expense thing be not so pleasant never saw such set of meaningless ass in life a men at club talk talk there be not one of who know how to do anything now at club over way do matter be common cause see what right have to expect that one man must bear expense have deuced good mind to leave in lurch do ferdinand if ca afford will go on with now ca help feeling have be little let in among when duchess first promised be to be simple walk over now that have got candidate go back from open thing to comer ca tell what think of fletcher for taking advantage of such chance then political committee at club coolly say that have got money be honest know understand said emily sadly word that said about fletcher cut to heart not because grieved that fletcher must be abused that husband must condescend to abuse escaped from further conflict at moment by proclaiming ignorance of whole matter knew enough of to be well aware that arthur fletcher have a good right to stand a husband that husband lowered by personal animosity to man then lopez took departure oh ferdinand said do so hope may be successful think can have chance from what people say must be fool to try be if castle be true to will know more about when come back that afternoon dined with father there met mr roby be of course known that lopez have gone down to silverbridge emily learned in manchester square that everett have gone with from hear be two fool for pain said lawyer why papa duke have given thing up still interest remains such thing if there be honest man in england be duke of omnium when say thing mean left to people of little town like silverbridge be sure to return conservative be of small farmer of course will go way if not made to go other if club mean to pay cost club will pay nothing papa then can only hope that lopez be doing well in business after nothing further be said about election perceived that father be altogether opposed to idea of husband being in parliament that sympathy even wish be on other side when mr roby suggested that must be very nice thing for to have ferdinand in parliament always called ferdinand now mr wharton railed at why must be nice thing wonder whether have idea of meaning in head when say that do suppose that man get l year by going into parliament law mr wharton how uncivil be of course know that member of parliament ai paid where be niceness then if man have time at command have studied art of legislation may be nice because will be doing duty if want to get into government ruck like brother in law may be nice if be idle man with large fortune may be nice to have place to go to why must be nice for ferdinand lopez can not understand everett have idea in head when talk about parliament though can not say that agree with may easily be understood that after emily must say nothing further in manchester square a to husband prospect at silverbridge lopez be at silverbridge for couple of day then returned a wife thought by mean confident of success remained in town nearly week during time managed to see duchess have written to saying that must do honour of calling on when came be admitted account gave to wife of visit did not express much satisfaction be quite late in evening before told whither have be have intended to keep matter to at last spoke of guided by feeling induces men to tell secret to wife because be comfort to to talk to one who must not openly contradict be sly creature after said have always thought that be too open rather than sly said wife people always try to get character just opposite to what deserve when hear that man be always to be believed know that be most dangerous liar going hummed hawed must not say word about borough went so far a to tell be to say word about to be that best if husband wished not to talk of be humbug falsehood to very bottom know that be spending money about ought to be on square with ought to tell what can do what ca when asked whether sprugeon might be trusted said that really wished must say anything more to about call that dishonest sly must at wonder that fletcher have be with duke if find out wo expose chapter xxxii what business be of yours thing have not gone altogether smoothly with duchess since breaking up of party at gatherum castle perhaps quite smoothly with duke be now march house be again sitting be in london till came to town have remained at castle huge mansion have not be found to be more comfortable by of a became empty for time duchess have be cowed by husband stern decision a again became gentle to almost seeming by manner to apologise for unwonted roughness plucked up spirit declared to herself that must not give up battle that did be not for sake why must not have ambition in life a well a have not succeeded in that have done must be right that must be asked to abandon everything to own to have be defeated to be shown to have failed before world because one a major pountney have made fool of attributed to major pountney very wrongly when man mind be veering towards decision conclusion have be perhaps slow in reaching be probably little thing at last fix mind clench thought duke have be gradually teaching to hate crowd around to reprobate wife strategy before have known that there be major pountney under roof others have offended first foremost among own colleague sir orlando duchess hardly read character aright certainly did not understand present motif when thought that might be forgotten a soon a disagreeable savour of major must have passed away in nothing a thought have husband be so silly a in abandonment of silverbridge when heard that day be fixed for declaring vacancy ventured to ask question manner to lately have be more than urbane more than affectionate have almost be that of lover have petted caressed when met once even said that nothing must really trouble a long a have with speech a never in life have made before to so plucked up courage asked question not exactly on occasion soon afterwards may not say word to sprugeon about election not word looked at a have looked on day when have told her of major sin tossed head pouted lip walked on without speaking if be to be so then indeed must have failed therefore though in general manner be loving to thing be not going smooth with thing be not going smooth with because there have reached most troublous dispatch from sir orlando drought only two day before cabinet meeting at point to be made in queen speech be to be decided have be already agreed that proposition must be made to parliament by government for extension of county suffrage with slight redistribution of seat town with le than inhabitant be to take in increased portion of country parish around there be not enough of policy in to satisfy sir orlando be conduct of bill through house to be placed in hand be to be intrusted to mr monk mr monk must be if not nominally leader yet chief man of government in house of common be displeasing to sir orlando have therefore demanded from prime minister more of policy sir orlando present idea of policy be building four bigger ship of war than have ever be built before with larger gun more men thicker iron plate above with greater expenditure of money have even gone so far a to say though not in semi official letter to prime minister that thought that salvation of empire must be cry of coalition party after said what people care about be salvation of empire sir orlando be at head of admiralty if glory be to be achieved by four ship must rest first on head of sir orlando now duke thought that empire be safe have be throughout political life averse to increasing army navy estimate regarded four ship a altogether unnecessary when reminded that might in way consolidate coalition said that must rather do without coalition four ship than have to do with of together opinion be thought by to be almost traitorous to party a now organised secret of cabinet be not to be disclosed lightly came to be understood a what be done at cabinet meeting generally doe come to be understood that there be something like disagreement prime minister duke of st bungay mr monk be altogether against four ship sir orlando be supported by lord drummond of old friend at advice of elder duke paragraph be hatched in be declared that majesty having regard to safety of nation possible though happily not probable chance of war thought that present strength of navy must be considered will give scope for new gun boat on altered principle said duke of st bungay prime minister must have have own way must have given sir orlando scope whatever must have let coalition have gone to dog have fallen into infinite political ruin that did not dare that men must hereafter say of that attempt at government have failed because be stubborn imperious self confident have known when took present place that must yield to others have not known how terrible be to have to yield when principle be in question how great be suffering when man find compelled to do think must not be done therefore though have be strangely loving to wife time have not gone smoothly with in direct disobedience to husband duchess did speak word to mr sprugeon when at castle be frequently driven through silverbridge on one occasion have carriage stopped at ironmonger door out came mr sprugeon there be at first dozen standing by who must hear what said cook wanted to have new kind of iron plate erected in kitchen of course have provided beforehand with excuse a rule when cook wanted anything done did not send word to tradesman by duchess on occasion duchess be personally most anxious wanted to see how iron plate must work be to be particular kind of iron plate then having watched opportunity said word suppose will be safe with mr lopez when mr sprugeon be about to

arthur fletcher went to greshamsbury preparatory to final sojourn at silverbridge for week previous to election greshamsbury seat of francis gresham esq who be great man in part be about twenty mile from silverbridge tedious work of canvassing elector must not therefore be done from thence spent couple of pleasant day with old friend learned what be being said what be being done in about borough mr gresham be man not a yet quite forty year of age very popular with large family of great wealth master of county hound father have be embarrassed man with large estate gresham have married lady with immense wealth have prospered in world be not active politician did not care for parliament for good thing political power can give be on account averse to coalition thought that sir orlando drought others be touching pitch have defiled be conscious that in so thinking be one of small minority bad a world around certainly be terrible a have be fall of glory of old england be nevertheless content to live without loud grumbling a long a farmer paid rent labourer in part of country did not strike for wage land when sold must fetch thirty year purchase have not therefore be careful to ascertain that arthur fletcher must pledge to oppose coalition before proffered assistance in matter of borough must not be easy to find such candidate perhaps possible to bring in when found fletcher have always be good conservative be proper people to be in parliament conservative in parliament be of course obliged to promote great many thing doe not really approve mr gresham quite understood that ca have test qualification rotten borough divine right of king back again a glorious institution of country be made to perish one after other be better that must receive coup de grace tenderly from loving hand than be roughly throttled by radical mr gresham must thank star that must still preserve fox down in own country instead of doing of dirty work for let best be made of such work still be dirty be willing now a always to give assistance if necessary to spend little money to put fletcher into parliament to keep lopez out there be to be third candidate be first news that fletcher heard will do all good in world said mr gresham rad in borough be not satisfied with mr lopez say know a long a certain set must make be believed that be duke nominee be content to accept even though be not proposed directly by duke people in usual way duke have made understood at last have seen duke letter arthur have not seen duke letter have only be published in silverbridge gazette of week now read sitting in mr gresham magistrate room a certain chamber in house have be called since day of present squire great duke letter be addressed to recognised man of business in part be a follows carlton terrace march dear mr moreton mr moreton be successor of one mr fothergill who have reigned supreme in part under old duke be afraid that wish with regard to borough forthcoming election there of member of parliament be not yet clearly understood although endeavoured to declare when be at gatherum castle trust that elector will vote for that gentleman with idea that return of special candidate will please ballot will of course prevent other man from knowing how elector may vote beg to assure elector generally must think fit to return member pledged to oppose government of form part must not in way change cordial feeling towards town may perhaps be allowed to add that in opinion elector can do duty except by voting for candidate whom think best qualified to serve country in regard to gentleman who be now before constituency have feeling for one rather than for other have such feeling must not wish to actuate vote of single elector must be glad if letter must be published so a to be brought under eye of elector generally yours faithfully omnium when duke said that feared that wish be not understood spoke of inefficacy of former declaration be alluding of course to duchess to mr sprugeon mr sprugeon guessed that might be so still wishing to have duchess for good friend be at once assiduous in explaining to friend in borough even letter did not mean anything prime minister be bound to say that kind of thing borough if wished to please duke must return lopez in spite of duke letter such be mr sprugeon doctrine did not carry mr sprout with mr sprout at once saw opportunity suggested to mr du boung local brewer that must come forward du boung be man rapidly growing into provincial eminence jumped at offer consequently there be three candidate du boung came forward a conservative prepared to give cautious very cautious support to coalition mr du boung in printed address said very sweet thing of duke generally borough be blessed by vicinity of duke looking at present perhaps unprecedented crisis in affair mr du boung be prepared to give more than very cautious support to duke government arthur fletcher read mr du boung address immediately after duke letter more merrier said arthur just so du boung will not rob of vote will cut ground altogether from under other man foot see that a far a actual political programme go there be much to choose between of be government men with difference one man in day be so like continued gresham sarcastically that requires good eye to see shade of colour then 'd better support du boung said arthur think have just turn in favour besides must really carry vote a for du boung sooner have than foreign cad like lopez then arthur fletcher frowned mr gresham became confused remembering catastrophe about young lady whose story have heard du boung used to be plain english a bung before got rich made name beautiful continued gresham suppose mr lopez doe come of foreign extraction know what come from said arthur moodily tell be gentleman however a be to have contest hope may win of course do sha win will great du boung will win become prime minister make peer must like papa to be lord greshamsbury said to little girl who then rushed into room must 'd like papa to give pony man want to sell out in yard be quite right fletcher said squire be much more likely to be able to buy pony a simple frank gresham than must be if have lord coronet to pay for be on saturday on following monday mr gresham drove candidate over to silverbridge started on work of canvassing mr du boung have be busy ever since mr sprout brilliant suggestion have be made lopez have be in field even before one of candidate called at house of elector in borough man in borough be elector when have be at work for four five day candidate assured borough that have already received promise of vote sufficient to insure success candidate be a anxious a ever be more rabidly anxious than ever to secure promise of single vote hint be made by honest citizen of pleasure must have in supporting that gentleman for honest citizen assured one gentleman after other of satisfaction have in seeing so all sufficient candidate in borough if smallest pecuniary help be given even day pay so that poor child might not be injured by going to poll candidate agent be stern in reply to such temptation be dodge of rascal sprout said sprugeon to mr lopez be one of sprout men if must get crown from must be up with though sprugeon called sprout rascal laid same bait for du boung for fletcher laid in vain everybody said that be very clean election brewer standing devil glass of beer said one old elector who have remembered better thing when borough never heard of contest on third day of canvas arthur fletcher with gang of agent follower behind met lopez with gang in street be probable that must so meet fletcher have resolved what must do when meeting took place walked up to lopez with kindly smile offered hand two men though have never be intimate have known other fletcher be determined to show that must not quarrel with man because man have be favoured rival in comparison with other matter affair of candidature be of course trivial lopez who have a reader may remember made threat about horsewhip have come to resolution of very different nature put arm kimbo resting hand on hip altogether declined proffered civility have better walk on said then stood scowling on spot till other must pas by fletcher looked at for moment then bowed passed on at least dozen men saw what have taken place be aware that mr lopez have expressed determination to quarrel personally with mr fletcher in opposition to mr fletcher expressed wish for amity before have gone to bed that night dozen knew reason why of course there be one then at silverbridge clever enough to find out that arthur fletcher have be in love with miss wharton that miss wharton have lately be married to mr lopez doubt incident added pleasurable emotion to excitement caused by election at silverbridge generally personal quarrel be attractive everywhere expectation of such occurrence will bring together whole house of common of course quarrel be very attractive in silverbridge there be fletcherites lopezites in quarrel a there be also du boungites who maintained that when gentleman must not canvas without quarrelling in street be manifestly unfit to represent borough a silverbridge in parliament that therefore mr du boung must be returned mr gresham be in town day though not till after occurrence fletcher must not avoid speaking of man must be cur said gresham must make difference in world to said arthur struggling hard to prevent sign of emotion from showing in face be not that have married lady whom have long known whom greatly esteem felt that must hardly avoid mention of marriage yet be determined that must say word that brother must call howling there have be previous quarrel offence asked gresham none in least when arthur so spoke forgot altogether letter have written have then remembered must have thought possible that letter must have given offence have be sufferer not lopez man have robbed of happiness though must have be foolish in to make quarrel for grievance such a there might have be excuse have done so have taken time to perceive greatly a man have injured there have be no injustice done to that therefore there must be complaint made by that other man must complain be to unintelligible be not worth notice said mr gresham be simply not gentleman doe not know how to behave be very sorry for young lady be at allusion to emily arthur felt that face became red with rising blood felt also that friend must not have spoken thus openly thus irreverently on so sacred subject at moment said nothing further a far a canvas be concerned have be successful be beginning to feel sure that must be new member endeavoured therefore to drown sorrow in coming triumph lopez have be by mean gratified with canvas with conduct of borough generally have already begun to feel that duchess mr sprugeon borough have thrown over shamefully immediately on arrival in silverbridge local attorney have with blandest possible smile asked for cheque for l of course there must be money spent at once of course money must come out of candidate pocket have known beforehand yet demand for money have come upon a injury gave cheque showed clearly by manner that resented application did not tend to bind to more closely service of who be present when demand be made then a began canvas found that must not conjure at with name of duke even with of duchess be told on second day by mr sprugeon that have better fight battle on own hook now own hook in silverbridge be certainly not strong hook mr sprugeon be still of opinion that good deal might be done by judicious manipulation went so far a to suggest that cheque for l in hand of mr wise lawyer must be effective lopez did not give other cheque sprugeon whispered to that duke have be too many for duchess still have persevered set of understrappers around who must make nothing out of election without candidature assured from time to time that must even yet come out right at ballot with hope still existing have not scrupled to affirm in speech that success of canvas have be complete on morning of day on met fletcher in street mr du boung have called upon accompanied by two of du boung agent by mr sprugeon have suggested that lopez must withdraw from contest so du boung might be returned that liberal interest of borough might not be sacrificed be heavy blow one ferdinand lopez be not man to bear with equanimity from moment in duchess have mentioned borough to have regarded thing a certain after while have understood that return must be accompanied by more trouble greater expense than have at first anticipated still have thought that be sure have altogether misunderstood nature of influence exercised by duchess nature also of duke resolution mr sprugeon have of course wished to have candidate have allured perhaps have in degree be ill treated by borough be man whom feeling of injustice to must drive almost to frenzy though never measured amount of own injustice to others when proposition be made to scowled at declared that must fight borough to last then will let mr fletcher in to certainty said mr sprout now there be idea in borough that although candidate be ready to support duke government mr du boung mr lopez be two liberal mr du boung be sitting in room when appeal be made declared that feared that such must be result will tell what will do said lopez will toss up of retires sprout on behalf of mr du boung protested against proposition mr du boung who be gentleman of great local influence be in possession of four fifth of liberal interest of borough even be to retire mr lopez must not get in mr sprout declared that be known to borough at large sprout be sorry that gentleman like mr lopez must have be brought down there under false idea have through told mr sprugeon that duke have be in earnest mr sprugeon have not comprehended position have be pity anybody who understood borough must see with one eye mr lopez have not chance if mr lopez must retire mr du boung must doubt be returned if mr lopez went to poll mr fletcher must probably be new member be picture a be painted by mr sprout who have even then heard something of love of two candidate who have thought that lopez must be glad to injure arthur fletcher chance of success so far be not wrong sense of injury done to oppressed lopez so much that must not guide by reason idea of retiring be very painful to did not believe men thought to be quite possible that be there to facilitate return of arthur fletcher have never even heard of du boung till have come to silverbridge two three day ago still must not believe that du boung must be returned thought over for moment then gave answer have be brought down here to fight will fight to last said then will hand over borough to mr fletcher said sprout getting up ushering mr du boung out of room be after on same day that lopez fletcher met other in street affair did not take minute then parted on own way in course of evening mr sprugeon told candidate that sprugeon must not concern further in election be very sorry for what have occurred very sorry indeed be doubt pity that duke have be so firm mr sprugeon shrugged shoulder a spoke when nobleman like duke chooses to have way of own must have sprugeon went on to declare that further candidature must be waste of money waste of time waste of energy then signified intention of retiring a far a election went into private life when asked acknowledged that who have be acting with have come to same resolve mr lopez have in fact come there a duke nominee a duke have nominee mr lopez be in fact nowhere suppose that man be ever so treated before since member be first returned to parliament said lopez well sir yes sir be little hard see sir grace meant best grace did mean best doubt may be sir there be little misunderstanding little misunderstanding at castle sir then mr sprugeon retired lopez understood that be to see nothing more of ironmonger of course there be nothing for now to retire to shake dust off foot get out of silverbridge a quickly a must friend have deserted did not know how to retire have paid l have strong opinion that portion at least of money must be returned to have keen sense of ill usage at same time feeling that ought not to run out of borough like whipt dog without showing face to one strongest sensation at moment be one of hatred against arthur fletcher be sure that arthur fletcher must be new member did not put least trust in mr du boung have taught really to think that fletcher have insulted by writing to wife that further insult have be offered to by meeting in street have told wife that must ask fletcher to give up borough that must make request with horsewhip in hand be too late now to say anything of borough might not be too late for horsewhip have great desire to make good threat a far a horsewhip be concerned having idea that must thus lower fletcher in wife eye be not that be jealous not jealous according to ordinary meaning of word wife love to have be too recently given too warmly maintained for such feeling a there be rancorous hatred in heart against man conviction that wife at rate esteemed man whom hated then must not make retreat from borough with more honour if before left must horsewhip successful antagonist who know feeling of englishman generally better than mr lopez did must say certainly not must think that incident must by mean redound to credit of mr lopez probably at cooler moment must have seen folly of such idea anger about borough have driven mad now in wretchedness suggestion have for certain charm man have outraged propriety by writing to wife of course must be justified in horsewhipping there be difficulty man be not horsewhipped simply because wish to horsewhip in evening a be sitting alone got note from mr sprugeon mr sprugeon compliment doe mr lopez think address to elector must appear in to morrow 'gazette very short easy something like following then mr sprugeon added very short easy letter to elector of borough of silverbridge in mr lopez be supposed to tell that although canvas promised to success felt that owed to borough to retire lest must injure borough by splitting liberal interest with much respected fellow townsman mr du boung in course of evening did copy that letter sent out to newspaper office must retire be better for that must retire after recognised fashion wrote letter also sent over to opposition hotel other letter be a follows sir before election began be guilty of gross impertinence in writing letter to wife to extreme annoyance to most justifiable anger gentleman must think that treatment have already received at hand must have served to save from such insult there be men who will never take lesson without beating now since have be here have presumed to offer to shake hand with in street though ought to have known must not choose to meet on friendly term after what have taken place now write to tell that will carry horsewhip while be here that if meet in street again before leave town will use ferdinand lopez mr arthur fletcher letter sent at once to enemy then sat late into night thinking of threat of manner in must follow up if must only get one fair blow at fletcher purpose thought must be achieved in matter of horsewhipping truth hardly ever get correctly known man who have given first blow be generally supposed to have thrashed other what might follow though might be inconvenient must be borne man have insulted by writing to wife sympathy of world thought must be with to give due must be owned that have personal fear a to encounter night arthur fletcher have gone over to greshamsbury on following morning returned with mr gresham for heaven sake look at that said handing letter to friend did ever write to wife asked gresham when read yes did be dreadful to dreadful well know how used to be with need not go into need say word more than think necessary when asked to stand for place have not heard that thought of being candidate wrote told so told also have known before must not have come here quite see said gresham perhaps not perhaps be fool need go into at rate there be insult to wrote in simplest language looking at round think have better not have written must say so if saw letter be sure must have known life brother be married to cousin oh heaven have be engaged must have done anything for be not natural must tell a far a language be concerned letter be one to be read at charing cross say that be annoyed insulted impossible be letter man might have written to woman well have got to take care of at rate what will do what ought to do go to police mr gresham have once when young thrashed man who have offended have then thought much aggrieved because police have be called in have be twenty year ago mr gresham opinion have be matured perhaps corrected by age wo do said arthur fletcher be what ought to do must do then take notice of letter carry fairly big stick must be big enough to hurt good deal not to do serious damage at moment agent came in with news of man retirement from contest have left town asked gresham no have not left town have be seen by one morning have better let go out get stick before show said gresham so stick be selected a two walked down street together almost first thing saw be lopez standing at hotel door with cutting whip in hand be at moment quite alone on opposite side of street there be policeman one of borough constable very slowly making way along pavement movement indeed be so slow that one watching must have come to conclusion that particular part of high street have attraction for at special moment ala ala how age will alter spirit of man twenty year since frank gresham must have thought one to be mean miscreant who must have interposed policeman between foe be to be feared that while selecting that stick have said word be causing constable to loiter on pavement gresham turned eye to policeman a walked on with friend fletcher did not see man what as be said fletcher a got handle of stick well into hand then lopez advanced to with whip raised a did so policeman came across street quickly very quietly stood right before man be so thoroughly in way of aggrieved wretch that be out of question that must touch fletcher with whip do usually walk about attended by policeman said lopez with scorn knew how to throw into voice did know that man be here said fletcher may tell to marine borough will know what coward be then turned round addressed street still under shadow a be of policeman helmet man who presumes to offer a candidate to represent silverbridge in parliament have insulted wife now because

that loss at silverbridge on next morning lopez be at mr wharton chamber early so early that lawyer have not yet reached have resolved not that must tell everything for such men never even intend to tell everything that must tell good deal must if possible affect mind of old man in two way must ingratiate at same time make understood that emily comfort in life must depend very much on father generosity first must be first accomplished if possible then second a to must certainly produce at rate belief have not married rich man daughter without intention of getting rich man money mr wharton must understand that if worst came to worst mr wharton must of course maintain daughter daughter husband thing have not come to worst a yet did not intend on present occasion to represent view of

silverbridge said yes sir have come back not exactly triumphant man must not expect to win always lopez have resolved to pluck up spirit carry like man seem to have got into scrape down there besides losing election oh have seen that in paper already have come to tell of a emily be concerned in ought to know emily concerned how be concerned then lopez told whole story after own fashion yet with palpable lie fletcher have written to letter have thought to be very offensive on hearing mr wharton looked very grave asked for letter lopez said that have destroyed not thinking that document must be preserved then went on to explain that have have reference to election that have thought to be highly improper that fletcher must write to wife on on other subject depends very much on letter said old man on subject after what have passed be very old friend of course will not argue with mr wharton own that angered angered very much very much indeed took to be insult to when accosted in street down at silverbridge told so may not have be very wise did on behalf surely can understand letter might make man angry what did say that must do anything for sake even retire from silverbridge if friend must let mr wharton scratched head lopez saw that be perplexed must have offered to do anything for sake after what have passed know man so well said mr wharton can not believe to have harboured improper thought in reference to child perhaps be indiscretion only perhaps so can not say then took before magistrate yes in anger have threatened then there be policeman row have to swear must not hurt of course have wish to hurt suppose ruined chance at silverbridge suppose did be lie a lopez have retired before row took place what care for most now be that must not think have misbehaved story have be told very well mr wharton be almost disposed to sympathise with son in law that arthur fletcher have meant nothing must be regarded a offensive to daughter be quite sure might be that in making offer intended to be generous have used language condition of person concerned made indiscreet suppose said that spent lot of money at silverbridge gave lopez opening that wanted described manner in l have be extracted from ca play game for nothing said mr wharton just at present must very ill afford must not have done have not felt pity to neglect chance of rising in world after seat in british house of common be honour yes yes yes duchess when spoke to about be so certain will pay l said mr wharton oh sir be generous then got up took old man hand day when be at liberty

just now will give cheque if emily have nothing better to do come dine to morrow lopez with real tear in eye took cheque promised to come on morrow in meantime wish must see everett of course promised that must see everett again be exalted on occasion not so much by acquisition of money a by growing conviction that father in law be cow capable of being milked quarrel between everett father might clearly be useful to might either serve old man by reducing everett to proper submission might manage to creep into empty space son defection must make in father heart father life might at rate make necessary to old man become such part of household in manchester square a to be indispensable then old man must day become older more in want of assistance thought that saw way to worm into confidence soon into possession old man be not man of iron a have feared quite human if properly managed soft malleable saw sexty parker in city day used cheque for l in triumphant way partly cajoling partly bullying poor victim to sexty also have to tell own story about row down at silverbridge have threatened to thrash fellow in street fellow have not dared to come out of house without policeman yes

narrated to father must of course abuse arthur fletcher more roundly be more confident in assertion that fletcher have insulted wife came a quickly a must to task have on hand what be between father

have whip hand of because have money have none be simply kicking against prick to speak a did then too there be fellow in london have higher respect for father than have yet warmer affection be hard to be driven in way gambler be nasty word yes be very nasty suppose man doe gamble when loses so much money that have to ask father to pay for if doe so often gamble never asked for money to pay what have lost before in life wonder told never lie to ought to know be just man to be harder to own son than to anybody else in world what doe want to do now know that want to do anything said lopez did

man of day that evening after dinner in manchester square conversation between father in law son in law turned almost exclusively on son brother in law little nothing be said about election name of arthur fletcher be not mentioned out of full heart father spoke be wretched about everett did everett mean to cut want to withdraw name called said lopez withdraw name a might ask hot headed fellow to do of own age like fellow that have quarrelled with doe expect father to send written apology have be gambling told that be gambler be that too much for father to say lopez shrugged shoulder declared that be pity will break heart if go on like said old man asked to come dine to day did seem to like like like nothing that infernal club when evening be over lopez felt that have done good stroke of work have not exactly made up mind to keep father son apart be not part of strategy at rate a yet did intend to make necessary to old man to become old man son if possible favourite son now thought that have already done much towards achievement of object chapter xxxvi jolly blackbird there be great triumph at longbarns when news of arthur victory reached place when arrived there with friend mr

came here quarrelled with other man in house rather down at richmond made fool of then quarrelled with wife took away what fool what ass what horror men be how impossible be to be civil gracious without getting into mess be tempted to say will never know anybody more such be complaint made by duchess to mr finn few day after richmond party from be evident that latter affair have not passed without notice did make noise about asked mr finn there be not row there be enough of quarrel to be visible audible walked about talked loud to poor woman of course be own fault man be clever liked people told that be of right sort duke heard of hope wo must be such triumph for after fuss at silverbridge never hears of anything if two men fought duel in own dining room must be last man in london to know then say nothing about ask men more may be sure wo ask man with wife more other man be in parliament ca be thrown over so easily be fault be getting so sick of be told that sir orlando have complained to plantagenet that be asked to dinner impossible mention have warburton have told so warburton be one of duke private secretary what did duke say quite know warburton be one of familiar did like to ask for more than chose to tell warburton suggested must invite sir orlando at once there be obdurate of course if plantagenet tell will ask man to come day of week be one of thing will need to be told directly idea be know that have better get rid of sir orlando that if sir orlando chooses to kick over trace may be turned loose without danger one have little bird give one manner of information one little bird have told that sir orlando mr roby speak mr roby be not very much be good straw to show way wind blow plantagenet certainly sent message about sir orlando be afraid gentleman must look for dinner elsewhere duke have in truth expressed very plainly to mr warburton with so much indiscreet fretfulness that discreet private secretary have not told even to duchess kind of thing argues want of cordiality may be fatal to sir orlando have said somewhat grandiloquently to duke duke have made almost reply suppose may ask own guest in own house have said afterwards to mr warburton though in public life be everybody slave mr warburton anxious of course to maintain unity of party have told duchess so much a must thought induce to give way have not repeated duke own observation be mr warburton thought hostile to interest of party duchess have only smiled made little grimace with private secretary be already well acquainted sir orlando received invitation in day sir orlando be unhappy irritable doubtful of further success a regarded coalition quite resolved to pull house down about ear of inhabitant rather than to leave with gentle resignation to seemed to be impossible that coalition must exist without too have have moment of high vaulting ambition in have almost felt to be great man required by country one ruler who must gather together in grasp rein of government drive state coach single handed safe through difficulty for next half dozen year there be men who can not conceive of that anything must be difficult for again others who can not bring so to trust a to think that can ever achieve anything great sample of sort from time to time rise high in political life carried thither apparently by epicurean concourse of atom often happens that more confident sample be by mean most capable concourse of atom have carried sir orlando so high that must not think intended for something higher duke who have really be wafted to very top have always doubted believing capable of doing one thing by dint of industry with further confidence in own power sir orlando have perceived something of leader weakness have thought that might profit by be not only distinguished member of cabinet even recognised leader of house of common looked out fact found that for five twenty year out of last thirty leader of house of common have be head of government felt that must be mean not to stretch out hand take prize destined for duke be poor timid man who have very little to say for then came little episode about dinner have become very evident to world that duchess of omnium have cut sir orlando drought that prime minister wife who be great in hospitality must not admit first lord of admiralty into house doings at gatherum castle in carlton terrace at horn be watched much too closely by world at large to allow such omission to be otherwise than conspicuous since commencement of session there have be series of article in people banner violently abusive of prime minister in one two of indecency of exclusion have be exposed with great strength of language editor of people banner have discovered that sir orlando drought be one man in parliament fit to rule nation till parliament must discover fact at least acknowledge discovery having be happily made by people banner editor of people banner thought that there must be hope for country sir orlando of course saw article in very heart believed that man have at length sprung up among fit to conduct newspaper duke also unfortunately saw people banner in old happy day two paper day one in morning other before dinner sufficed to tell that wanted to know now felt necessary to see almost rag be published must skim through till found line in be maligned then with sore heart irritated nerve must pause over contumelious word must have bitten tongue out rather than have spoken of torture endured be tortured did endure knew cause of bitter personal attack made on of abuse with be loaded of ridicule infinitely more painful to with wife social splendour be bespattered remembered well attempt mr quintus slide have made to obtain entrance into house own scornful rejection of gentleman overture knew man knew better real value of able editor opinion yet word of be gall wormwood to in paragraph there be scourge hit on raw opened wound must show to kind surgeon for must find solace in friendly treatment not even to wife must condescend to say that mr quintus slide have hurt then sir have come sir orlando explained gracefully of course must understand that gentleman have right to complain because be not asked to gentleman house affair of country be above private consideration actuated by public feeling must condescend to do under other circumstance must be impossible public press be ever vigilant have suggested that there be official estrangement because sir orlando have not be included in list of guest invited by grace did not grace think that there might be seed of must not quite say decay for coalition in such state of thing duke paused moment then said that thought there be such seed sir orlando bowed haughtily withdrew swearing at moment that coalition must be made to fall into thousand shiver have taken place fortnight before party at horn from poor mr lopez have be withdrawn so hastily sir orlando when commenced proceeding consequent on resolution did not find support have expected unfortunately there have be uncomfortable word two between mr roby political secretary at admiralty mr roby have never quite seconded sir orlando ardour in matter of four ship sir orlando in pride of place have ventured to snub mr roby now mr roby must bear snubbing perhaps a well a other official subordinate be one who must study question assure that be that be not worth while to bear too have discussed with friend condition of coalition have come to conclusion rather adverse to sir orlando than otherwise when therefore first secretary sounded a to expediency of step in direction of firmer political combination than at present existing by of course be meant dethronement of present prime minister mr roby have snubbed then there have be slight official criminations recrimination till state of thing have come to pas almost justified statement made by duchess to mr finn coalition have many component part coalescing without difficulty with special cordiality such be condition of thing between very conservative lord lieutenant of ireland somewhat radical chief secretary mr finn between probably larger number of who be contented with duty of own office pleasure profit arising therefrom by time hardly coalesced at a be case with sir gregory grogram sir timothy beeswax attorney general solicitor general be especially case with prime minister sir orlando drought in one two happy case coalition be sincere loyal in case be more so than with regard to mr rattler mr roby mr rattler mr roby have throughout long parliamentary life belonged to opposite party have be accustomed to regard other with mutual jealousy almost with mutual hatred now have come to see how equal how alike how sympathetic be taste how well might help other a long a mr rattler must keep old place at treasury ambition never stirred to aught higher be quite contented that old rival must be happy at admiralty that old rival when looked about felt present comfort when remembered how short lived have be good thing have hitherto come in way how little probable be that long lived good thing must be when coalition be broken up manfully determined that loyalty to present head of government be duty have sat for too many year on same bench with sir orlando to believe much in power of governing country therefore when sir orlando dropped hint mr roby did not take wonder whether be true that sir orlando complained to duke that be not asked to dinner said mr roby to mr rattler must hardly think so ca fancy that must have pluck said mr rattler duke be easiest man in world to speak to about thing a that must be monstrous thing for man to do drought head be quite turned can see that never thought very much about know on side be what side thought about rejoined roby that put where be now be fate of accident roby put so many of in place arranges work for make little men big men there be other men besides drought who have be tossed up in blanket till know whether head heel be highest quite believe in duke said mr roby almost alarmed by suggestion new friend have seemed to make so do roby have not obduracy of lord brock ineffable manner of mr mildmay brilliant intellect of mr gresham picturesque imagination of mr daubeny said mr roby feeling bound to support character of late chief audacity said mr rattler have peculiar gift of own gift fitted for peculiar combination of circumstance if will only be content to use be just unambitious intelligent man in whom after while country must come to have implicit confidence be thin skinned ungenial have got into boat said roby enthusiastically will find that will be true to there be better boat to be in at present said slightly sarcastic rattler a to drought pinnace will be more difficult to get afloat than four ship to tell truth honestly roby have to rid ourselves of sir orlando have great regard for man ca say ever liked said roby talk about liking have achieved success be to be regarded now have lost head be bound to get fall question be who will fall with feel at bound to sacrifice know who doe sir timothy beeswax suppose will resent injury done to can hardly think that strong government can be formed by sir orlando drought sir timothy beeswax secession be weakness of course think may survive so mr rattler mr roby made up mind that first lord of admiralty might be thrown overboard without much danger to queen ship sir orlando however be quite in man have spirit enough to feel that alternative be left to after have condescended to suggest that must be asked to dinner have be refused tried mr roby found that mr roby be mean fellow wedded a told to salary then sounded lord drummond urging various reason country be not safe without more ship mr monk be altogether wrong about revenue mr finn idea about ireland be revolutionary lord drummond thought that upon whole present ministry served country well considered bound to adhere to can not bear idea of being out of power said sir orlando to next said word to sir timothy sir timothy be not man to be led by nose by sir orlando sir timothy have grievance meant to have revenge knew how to choose own time duke be not bad fellow said sir timothy perhaps little weak well meaning think ought to stand by little longer a for finn irish bill have troubled about then sir orlando declared to that sir timothy be coward resolved that must act alone about middle of july went to duke at treasury be closeted with in very long narration of own difference difficulty opinion grievance explained to duke that conscience called upon to resign duke listened bowed head with one two very gently uttered word expressed regret then sir orlando in long speech laid bare bosom to chief whom be leaving declaring inexpressible sorrow with have found called upon to take step feared might be prejudicial to political status of man whom honoured so much a did duke of omnium then duke bowed again said nothing man have be guilty of impropriety of questioning way in duke private hospitality be exercised duke must not bring to be genially civil to offender sir orlando went on to say that must of course explain view in cabinet that have thought right to make known to duke a soon a be formed best friend must part duke said a took leave hope not sir orlando hope not said duke sir orlando have be too full of of word be to speak of thing be about to do to understand either duke word silence so sir orlando resigned thus supplied only morsel of political interest session produced take more notice of than if footman be going have be advice of old duke of course there be cabinet meeting on occasion even there commotion be very slight a member knew before entering room what be that sir orlando intended to do lord drummond said that step be one to be much lamented very much indeed said duke of st bungay word be false hypocritical tone of voice took away deceit be afraid said prime minister from what sir orlando have said to privately that can not hope that will change mind that certainly can not do said sir orlando with dignified courage of modern martyr on next morning paper be full of political fact be blessed with subject on must excercise prophetical sagacity remark made be generally favourable to government three four of morning paper be of opinion that though sir orlando have be strong man good public servant ministry might exist without people banner be able to expound to people at large that only grain of salt by ministry have be kept from putrefaction have be now cast out mortification death corruption must ensue be one of mr quintus slide greatest effort chapter xxxix get round ferdinand lopez maintained anger against wife for more than week after scene at richmond feeding with reflection on what called disobedience be make believe anger have declared intention to act in opposition to expressed order felt that present condition be prejudicial to interest that must take wife back into favour in order that might make progress with father must hardly bring to swallow wrath thought that be duty to obey in everything disobedience on matter touching old lover be abominable offence to be visited with severest marital displeasure with succession of scowl must make miserable for month at least on behalf must have hesitated though misery might have continued for three month then old man be main hope of life must be made mainstay brilliant prospect be before have used to think that mr wharton be hale man with terribly vexatious term of life before now now that be seen more closely appeared to be very old must sit half bent in arm chair in stone building look a though be near hundred from day to day seemed to lean more upon son in law whose visit to be continued always well taken constant subject of discourse between be everett wharton who have not yet seen father since misfortune of quarrel everett have declared to lopez dozen time that must go to father if father wished lopez a often reported to father everett must not go to unless father expressed wish so have be kept apart lopez did not suppose that old man must disinherit son altogether did

that must come to at last be necessary that evening must be fixed will be delighted to come to day to morrow lopez said have better say to morrow there must be nothing to eat to day house be now what used to be be therefore expedient that lopez must drop anger when got home prepare wife to dine in manchester square in proper frame of mind misery have be extreme very much more bitter than have imagined be not only that displeasure made life for time wearisome robbed only society have of charm be not only that heart be wounded by anger evil might have be short lived have seen must not fail

desire demanded from ala poor girl soon knew that marriage have be mistake there be probably one moment in made confession to herself conviction be there in mind a though confession have be made then there must come upon unbidden unwelcome reminiscence of arthur fletcher thought that must struggle to banish accusing of heinous crime because thought must come back to remembered light wavy hair have loved a one love beauty of dog have seemed to young imagination to in ignorance of early year to lack something of dreamed of manliness remembered eager boyish honest entreaty to herself to have be without dignity of superior being husband must posse became aware that have thought le of because have thought more of have worshipped other man because have assumed superiority have told that be big enough to be master now now that be all too late veil have fallen from eye must now see difference between manliness deportment ah that must ever have be so blind who have given credit for seeing so

old saying of 'honour among thief be without dash of truth in when two men be in boat together must be true to other else will get to shore attribute high motif to friend be afraid there be not very many high motif in world girl especially in city yet at westminster can hardly be from high motif when lot of men thinking differently on possible subject come together for sake of pay power know whether after sextus parker may have a high motif a duke of omnium suppose one ever have lower motif than duchess when chiselled about silverbridge never mind will all be one hundred year hence get

visit will make long visit be odd that man must have be so devoid of right feeling a not to have known that idea expressed be revolting can sound begin by saying that be afraid be desolate told that be desolate can refer to then tell that be of prepared to do anything that can to relieve put arm over kiss sort of thing shrunk from into corner of brougham yet did not perceive then say that think must be happier if be to join here for time can make understand that there must be difficulty about apartment say in set speech a though be prepared though of course can let know that have suggested

expense in own house with own child say a much a can of before dinner so that when be sitting below may suggest if plea must suit to get in there next week if possible so lesson have be given have said little nothing in reply have only finished a entered square have hardly minute allowed to think how far might follow in what must ignore husband instruction if might use own judgment must tell father at once that residence for time beneath roof must be service to pecuniarily might not do understood that duty to husband did forbid to proclaim poverty in opposition to wish must tell nothing that did not wish to tell then duty must require to say what be false must make suggestion about change of residence must make with proper affection a regarded must simply say that must suit view to give up room if suited mr wharton be alone when entered drawing room a lopez have surmised have asked sister in law round corner to come to dinner roby always like excuse to get to club said old man harriet like excuse to go anywhere be not long before lopez began to play part by seating close to open window looking out into square emily when found close to father with hand in must hardly divest herself of feeling that also be playing part see so very little of said old man plaintively 'd come up oftener if thought 'd like be liking dear of course have to live with husband be sad about everett very sad everett have lived here for ever so long know why must be fool to go away when did doe go to yes sometimes what doe say be sure must be with at once if must ask have asked have sent word by lopez over over again if mean that be to write to say that be sorry for offending wo talk of more make so angry that sometimes feel inclined to do thing know must repent when dying not anything to injure everett papa wonder whether ever think that be old man alone that brother in law be daily with be fool think of nothing know be very sad being here night after night by mr wharton forgot doubt at moment that passed majority of evening at eldon though have be reminded of might have declared with perfect truth that delight of club be not satisfactory papa said emily must like to come live here what lopez here in square yes for time be thinking of giving up place in belgrave mansion thought have for for ever so many month doe not like be expensive can give up if must wish must come here for time turned round looked at almost suspiciously blushed a remembered how accurately be obeying husband order must be such joy to to be near again there be something in voice instantly reassured well said come try if will suit house be big enough will ease pocket be comfort to come try astonished that thing must be done so easily here be that husband have proposed to arrange by deep diplomacy settled in three word yet felt ashamed of a though have taken father in terrible behest to get round still grated on ear have got round have cheated into papa said do unless feel sure that will like how be anybody to feel sure of anything dear if doubt do feel sure of one thing that will be great saving to husband be nearly sure that ought not to be matter of indifference to there be plenty of room here will at rate be comfort to to see sometimes just at moment mr roby came in old man began to tell news aloud emily have not gone away for long be coming back like bad shilling not to live in square said mr roby looking round at lopez why not there be room here for will be just a well to save expense when will come dear whenever house may be ready papa be ready now ought to know be not going to refurnish room for anything of kind lopez can come in hang up hat whenever plea during time lopez have hardly known how to speak what to say have be very anxious that wife must pave way a must have called have be urgent with to break ice to father have not occurred to that matter must be settled without reference to of course have heard word have be spoken be aware that own poverty have be suggested a cause for proceeding be great thing for in way must live for nothing must also have almost unlimited power of being with mr wharton a old age grew on ready compliance with wish be benefit far too precious to be lost yet felt that own dignity required reference to be distasteful to that father in law must regard at rate that must speak of a pauper unable to provide home for own wife emily notion in suggesting sir said have be care for comfort barrister turned round looked at lopez did not quite like look be thought of first certainly have other idea than when mentioned to be delighted to agree emily heard blushed be not absolutely untrue in word assertion of husband altogether false in spirit yet must not contradict see why must not do very well indeed

slide really mean to cut fellow up can do there be one like duke have deserved be poor vacillating creature led by duchess according to that one hears be much better than must be thought duchess be great friend of yours said mr wharton care much for such friendship threw over most shamefully therefore of course be justified in taking away character never saw duchess of omnium in life must probably be very uncomfortable if found in society believe to be good sort of woman in way emily sat perfectly silent knowing that husband have be rebuked feeling that have deserved however be not abashed changed conversation dashing into city rumour legal reform old man from time to time said sharp little thing showing that intellect be not senile of son in law bore imperturbably be not that liked be indifferent that knew that must not get good thing mr wharton must do for without making kind of payment must take sharp word of old man take that must get besides when two men be alone together after dinner mr wharton used different tone if be to come said might a well do a soon a possible day two will be enough for there be one two thing must understand will be very happy to see

refuse must be great blow to must sound said old duke prime minister again shook head turned subject with timidity be becoming autocratic peevishly imperious then went to lord cantrip when lord cantrip with kindness must throw into word stated reason induced at present to decline office be again in despair at last asked phineas finn to move to admiralty when old friend somewhat reluctantly obeyed of course have same difficulty in filling office finn have held other change other complication became necessary mr quintus slide who hated phineas finn even worse than poor duke found ample scope for patriotic indignation took place in closing week of session filling poor prime minister with trouble dismay just when other people be complaining that there be nothing to think of nothing to do men really like leaving london before grouse call grouse rather fashion of grouse lady be very angry at being separated so soon from swain in city tradesman too be displeased so that there be voice to re echo abuse of people banner duchess have done best to prolong session by week telling husband of evil consequence above suggested have thrown wide arm asked with affected dismay whether be to keep parliament sitting in order that more ribbon might be sold there be nothing to be done said duke almost angrily then must make something to be done said duchess mimicking chapter xlii retribution duchess have be at work with husband for last two month in hope of renewing autumnal festivity have be lamentably unsuccessful duke have declared that there must be more rural crowd repetition of what called london turned loose on own ground must not forget necessity have be imposed upon of turning major pountney out of house change have be made in garden wife attempt to conquer at silverbridge do mean said that be to have nobody replied that thought must be best to go to matching live darby joan life said duchess said nothing of darby joan may be feeling hardly think that be fitted for kind of thing matching be not so big a gatherum be not cottage of course can ask own friend know what mean by own friend endeavour always to ask yours know that major pountney captain gunner mr lopez be ever among number of friend suppose mean lady rosina said duchess will be happy to have at matching if wish must like to see lady rosina de courcy at matching very much be there to be nobody else be afraid must find rather dull while two be opening heart to other here looked at angrily can think of anybody besides lady rosina suppose will wish to have mr finn what arrangement lady rosina for to flirt with mr finn for to grumble to be odious word said prime minister what flirting see anything bad about word thing be dangerous be quite at liberty if go beyond lady rosina must like to know whether must wish anybody else to come of course made becoming answer to question of course becoming answer be expected knew that be trying to provoke because must not let do year a have done last house have doubt must be full to overflowing when got there must not help that a compared with gatherum castle house at matching be small domestic authority sufficed at rate for shutting up gatherum for time know whether at time suffering be not a acute a own at rate be prime minister seemed to that be to be reduced to nothing at beginning of have with unwonted tenderness asked for sympathy in undertaking according to power have given to with whole heart have thought that have seen way by might assist in great employment have worked at like slave day told that did not love captain gunner major pountneys sir orlando indeed lady rosinas have not followed bent of own inclination when have descended to sheet towel busied to establish archery ground have not shot arrow during whole season have cared who have won who have lost have not be for own personal delight that have kept open house for forty person throughout four month of year in doing have never taken ounce of labour off shoulder by single word deed have be done for sake that reign might be long triumphant that world might say that hospitality be noble full that name might be in men mouth that might prosper a british minister such at least be assertion made to herself when thought of own grievance own trouble now be angry with husband be very well for to ask for sympathy have none to give in return must not pity failure even though have caused if have grain of intelligence about must thought understand well enough how sore must be for to descend from princely entertainment to solitude at matching thus to own before world that be beaten then when asked for advice when be really anxious to know how far might go in filling house without offending told to ask lady rosina de courcy if chose to be ridiculous might must ask lady rosina de courcy in active anger did write to lady rosina de courcy formal letter in said that duke hoped to have pleasure of ladyship company at matching park on st of august be absurd letter somewhat long written very much in duke name with overwhelming expression of affection instigated in writer mind partly by fun of supposition that man a husband must flirt with woman a lady rosina there be something too of anger in what wrote touch of revenge sent off invitation sent other lady rosina took all in good part replied saying that must have greatest pleasure in going to matching have declared to herself that must ask none have named in accordance with resolution sent out other written invitation have also told to ask mr finn now have become almost matter of course there have grown up from accidental circumstance so strong bond between two woman that be taken for granted by husband that must be nearly always within reach of one two husband be also on kindly if not affectionate term with other nature of duke character be such that with most loving heart be hardly capable of opening out of to be necessary for positive friendship there be stiff reserve about of be only too conscious almost prohibited friendship liked mr finn a man member of party be always satisfied to have a guest duchess therefore have taken for granted that mr finn must come to that mr finn must come also during time that might be able to escape from ireland when invitation be verbally conveyed mr finn have gone to admiralty have already made arrangement for going to sea a gallant sailor must be going away in 'black watch ' for couple of month said mr finn now black watch be admiralty yacht heaven earth ejaculated duchess be always done first lord must have epaulet stripped if

have be made up just same lady glen know can not get on without ought to know too there be person in world can really say thing to why have mr grey be going to persia after husband then be not wicked enough always lectured doe still what do think be going to happen nothing terrible hope said mr finn mindful of husband new honour at admiralty hoping that duke might not have repeated threat of resigning be going to matching so supposed whom do think be going to have not major pountney not at asking mr lopez yet mr lopez guess again suppose there will be dozen to guess shrieked duchess there will only be one have asked one at special desire a wo come will ask nobody else when pressed to name second named will obey to letter now dear who do think be chosen one one person who be to solace perturbed spirit of prime minister for three month of autumn mr warburton must say oh mr warburton doubt mr warburton will come a part of luggage possibly dozen treasury clerk declares however that there be nothing to do therefore mr warburton strength may alone suffice to help to do there be to be one unnecessary guest unnecessary be for official purpose though oh so much needed for social happiness guess once more knowing spirit of mischief be in perhaps be lady rosina of course be lady rosina said duchess clapping hand together must like to know what mean by spirit of mischief asked said that particularly wished to have lady rosina at matching now be not jealous woman be not of lady rosina think will do harm together be particular know however be to come nobody else be to come did count upon then mr finn counselled very seriously a to bad taste of joke explaining to that duke have certainly not intended that invitation must be confined to lady rosina be not joke with duchess have be driven almost to despair be very angry with husband have brought thing upon must now make best of must ask nobody else declared that there be nobody whom must ask with propriety be tired of asking let ask whom must be dissatisfied only two people cared to see be lady rosina old duke have asked lady rosina for sake let ask old friend if pleased duke duchess with family went down

novel heart be sore within have wished to punish in truth be punishing on day of arrival father mother with lord silverbridge eldest son who be home from eton private secretary dined together a duke sat at table began to think how long be since such state of thing have happened to before heart softened towards instead of being made angry by strangeness of proceeding took delight in in course of evening spoke word to signify satisfaction be afraid wo last long said for lady rosina come to morrow oh indeed bid ask then perceived how have taken advantage of former answer to have acted upon in spirit of contradictory petulance resolved that must forgive endeavour to bring back to thought be joking said good humouredly oh never suspected of joke at rate be coming will do of harm mr finn have sent to sea may be at sea too be without sending first lord believe usually doe go cruise be there nobody else nobody else unless have asked one not creature well so much better dare say lady rosina will get on very well will have to talk to said duchess will do best said duke lady rosina came doubt did think odd did not say so really did seem to duchess a though vengeance have be blown away by wind too laughed at matter to herself began to feel le cross le perverse world did not come to end because husband with lady rosina boy private secretary sat down to dinner day together parish clergyman with neighbouring squire wife daughter did come one day to relief of m millepois who have begun to feel that world have collapsed day at certain hour duke lady rosina walked together for hour half in park duchess must have enjoyed instead of suffering must only have have friend mr finn to hear joke now plantagenet said do tell one thing what doe talk about trouble of family generally

anything of kind said duchess with animation a though have secret knowledge cork sol be specially fatal to family of pallisers why not dear be man who especially above others threw over at silverbridge then again there came upon brow that angry frown during last few day have be dissipated by innocence of lady rosina conversation of course mean to ask to take interest in borough again have said that must be always a good a word hope so certainly must not employ tradesman just at elbow who have directly opposed what be generally understood in town to be interest what did mr sprout do be first have heard of got mr du boung to stand against mr lopez be very glad for sake of borough that mr lopez did not get in so be be nothing to do with mr sprout knew at rate what wish be went directly against be not entitled to have wish in matter glencora be very well have knew a for future of course thing be over have done everything for borough mean that borough have done much for know what mean very well will take very ill if shilling out of castle ever go into mr sprout pocket again be needle to trouble reader at length with sermon preached on occasion showing utter corruption must come from mixing up of politics with trade with scorn threw into few word with interrupted from time to time whether man make good shoe at reasonable price charge for honestly be what have to consider said duke impressively 'd rather pay double for bad shoe to man who did not thwart must not condescend to be thwarted in such matter lower by admitting feeling yet writhed under lash of mr slide know enemy when see said duchess a long a live will treat enemy a enemy there be ever so much of in course of duke declared purpose of sending at once to mr sprout for ever so many cork sol duchess most imprudently declared purpose of ruining mr sprout there be something in threat grated terribly against duke sense of honour that wife must threaten to ruin poor tradesman that must do so in reference to political affair of borough owned that must do so in declared opposition to of course ought to have known that sin consisted simply in determination to vex at moment more good natured woman did not live one le prone to ruin one reference to silverbridge election brought back upon remembrance of cruel attack have be made upon rendered for time moody morose wretched so again parted ill friend hardly spoke when met at dinner next morning there reached matching letter greatly added to bitterness of spirit against world in general against in particular letter though marked private have be opened a be letter by mr warburton private secretary thought necessary to show letter to prime minister when have read told warburton that did not signify maintained for hour attitude of quiescence then walked forth having letter hidden in hand finding wife alone gave to read see what have brought upon said by interference disobedience letter be a follows manchester square august lord duke consider entitled to complain to grace of conduct with be treated at last election at silverbridge whereby be led into very heavy expenditure without least chance of being returned for borough be aware that have direct conversation with grace on subject that grace can plead that a between man man have authority from for supposing must receive grace support be distinctly asked by duchess to stand be assured by that if did so must have assistance that grace influence must procure for be also explained to that grace official position made inexpedient that grace on special occasion must have personal conference with own candidate under circumstance submit to grace that be entitled to complain of hardship have suffered have not be long in borough before found that position be hopeless influential men in town who have be represented to a being altogether devoted to grace interest started third candidate liberal a natural consequence be that of succeeded though return a grace candidate must have be certain have not be done that be preconcerted there can be doubt before mine be sprung on immediately indeed on arrival if remember rightly application be made to for l so that money might be exacted before truth be known to of course must not have paid l have known that grace usual agent in town may name mr sprout especially be prepared to act against did pay money think grace will agree with that very opprobrious term might be applied without injustice to transaction lord duke be poor man ambitious will own whether be sin virtue willing perhaps to incur expenditure can hardly be justified in pursuit of certain public object must say with most lively respect for grace personally that feel inclined to sit down tamely under such loss a must not have dreamed of interfering in election at silverbridge have not duchess exhorted to do so must not even have run risk of doubtful contest came forward at suggestion of duchess backed by personal assurance that seat be certain a being in grace hand be doubt understood that grace must not yourself interfere be equally well understood grace influence be for time deputed to duchess duchess herself will be sure confirm statement that have direct authority for regarding a grace candidate can of course bring action against mr wise gentleman to whom paid money feel that a gentleman must not do so without reference to grace a circumstance might possibly be brought out in evidence will not say prejudicial to grace must be unbecoming can not however think that grace will be willing that poor man like in search for entrance into public life must be mulcted to so heavy extent in consequence of error on part of duchess must grace be able to assist in view of getting into parliament for other seat will be willing to abide loss have incurred hardly however dare to hope for such assistance in case think grace ought to see that be reimbursed have honour to be lord duke grace very faithful servant

life in england have not quite acquired that knowledge of way in thing be done be so general among men of certain class so rare among beneath have not understood that duchess promise of assistance at silverbridge might be taken by for what be worth that aid might be used a far a went that in event of failing be bound in honour to take result without complaining whatever that result might be felt that grievous injury have be done that behoved to resent that injury even though be against woman just knew that must not very well write to duchess though there be sometimes present to mind plan for attacking in public telling what evil have done have half resolved that must do so in own garden at horn on occasion apparition of arthur fletcher have disturbed have vented anger in direction still

wharton must be forced to tell story of letter to duke be sure that mr wharton must not approve of having written letter how must one approve of having applied for sum of money have already be paid to how must such one a mr wharton old fashioned english gentleman approve of such application being made under circumstance mr wharton must very probably insist on having cheque sent back to duke must be

three week before lodging at dovercourt be given up during three week be very little at place when there did not mention letter on occasion said nothing about business satisfied with giving strict injunction a to economy then took back to town on day after promise to mr parker that must try mr parker have told that woman ought to be afraid to speak to husband if necessary to speak roundly on such subject mr parker be certainly not highly educated lady have impressed emily with admiration for practical good sense proper feeling lady who be lady have begun to feel that in trouble of life might find much le satisfactory companion than lady who be not lady must do a mr parker have told must not be afraid of course be right that must speak on matter knew to be obedient wife have borne unexpected sorrow without complaint with resolve that must bear for sake not because loved because have made wife into calamity might fall must share though must bring utterly into dirt must remain in dirt with seemed probable to that might be so that might have to go into dirt if be so must still be true to have chosen to marry must be true wife a such must not be afraid of mr parker have told that woman must never be afraid of 'em believed in mr parker in case too be clearly duty to speak for injury being done be terrible might too probably become tragical how must endure to think of woman child must come to know that husband of woman father of child have be ruined by husband yes must speak to did fear be very well for woman to tell that will encounter anticipated difficulty without fear for man fear can not be overcome by will thing however may be done whether be leading forlorn hope speaking to angry husband in spite of fear must do when moment for doing came very heart trembled within have be so masterful with so persistent in repudiating interference so exacting in demand for obedience so capable of making miserable by moroseness when failed to comply with wish that must not go to task without fear did feel that ought not to be afraid that fear at rate must not be allowed to restrain wife knew must be prepared to yield yet be entitled to be husband counsellor be now case that in matter be conversant with circumstance be unknown to husband be to that mr parker appeal have be made with direct request from poor woman that must be repeated to

more about business than then be infernal impudence on part must not have listened to for moment want to ruin child what have to do with child did not marry be not father have got to look to think that be enticing into risk can not afford be doing anything for ai doing for if there be money made will not share if money have to be lost of course must do same lopez in stating case omitted to say that capital be now being used belonged to partner woman when get together talk manner of nonsense be likely that will alter course of action because tell that tell that tell that be losing money be

made acquainted with lady eustace whose name have at one time be very common in mouth of people emily also felt that be hardly entitled to give dinner party in house in absence after that have lately heard about husband poverty must not understand how must wish to incur expense must not ask mr leslie here said why must not ask mr leslie papa dislike 'papa a call be going to meet have said that doe

lady eustace be better judge than a to asking mr leslie lady eustace other person to dinner a be obliged to make even recreation of life subservient to work must claim permission to have own way have listened when paused made reply do mean to do a bid ask lady can not do know that ought not to be done be papa house be living here a guest d papa said a burst out of room after quarter of hour put

sit in father room when spoke of father husband have cursed with scorn lopez be going to send food wine into house must be gall wormwood to father at one time thought must at once write to father tell of perhaps telegraph to must not do so without letting husband know what have done then must have justice on side in calling disobedient be to do then must indeed be necessary that must take part against husband have brought misery on on father because have be obstinate in thinking that must with certainty read lover character a for love that of course have died away in heart imperceptibly though ala so quickly be impossible that must continue to love man who from day to day be teaching mean lesson who be ever doing mean thing meanness of be so little apparent to that did not scruple to divulge to how must love man who must make sacrifice either to comfort pride conscience still might obey if must feel sure obedience to be duty must be duty to sin against father wish to assist in profaning house abusing hospitality after fashion then mind again went back to trouble of mr parker absolute inefficiency in matter seemed to that have given over body soul mind to evil genius that there be escape of course will come mr roby have said to when went round corner into berkeley street early in day lopez spoke to about before what will papa say about aunt harriet suppose lopez understand other think papa will understand be sure mr wharton must not lend house to son in law then object to man have lent to asking friend to dine with be sure that mr lopez must not consent to occupy house on term if like of course wo come pray say that a other woman be to come pray desert can not say think be right mr dick however only laughed at scruple in course of evening emily got letter addressed to herself from lady eustace mr leslie informing that must have very much pleasure in dining with on day named lady eustace went on to say with much pleasantry that always regarded little party got up without ceremony a being pleasantest that must come on occasion without ceremonial observance then emily be aware that husband have not only written note in name have put into mouth studied apology a to shortness of invitation well be man wife supposed that be entitled to put word that pleased into mouth chapter xlviii have ill treated lopez relieved wife from care a to provision for guest have be to shop in wigmore street said everything will be done will send in cook to make thing hot father wo have to pay even for crust of bread papa doe mind paying for anything

there still longer cook who having be in place only three year resigned impetuously within hour after advent of mr sugarscraps head man fogy be indignant butler expressed intention of locking up in own peculiar pantry housekeeper took upon to tell young mistress that master must like since have known mr wharton thing a cooked food being sent into house from shop have never be so much a heard of emily who have hitherto be regarded in house a rather strong minded young woman must only break down weep why oh why have consented to bring misery into father house must at rate have prevented that by explaining to father unfitness of such arrangement party came there be major pountney very fine rather loud very intimate with host whom on one occasion called ferdy boy very full of abuse of duke duchess of omnium yet be good creature when knew said lady eustace pountney suggested that duchess have not then taken up politics have got out of way said lady eustace since did there be captain gunner who defended duchess who acknowledged that duke be most consumedly stuck up cox comb then existing most dishonest said lopez who have told new friend nothing about repayment of election expense dick be there liked little party in good deal of wine must be drunk at lady be not supposed to be very stiff major captain mr leslie lady eustace be such people a liked within pale having piquant relish of fastness impropriety dick be wont to declare that hated world in buckram aunt harriet be triumphant in manner disgusted emily thought to be most disrespectful to father in truth aunt harriet did not now care very much for mr wharton preferring friendship of mr wharton son in law mr leslie came in gorgeous clothes a be known to be very poor to have attached lately with almost more than feminine affection to lady eustace be at rate open to suspicious cavil in former day mr leslie have taken upon to say bitter thing about mr lopez emily must now have repeated to lady discomfiture have mode of revenge suited disposition with mr leslie there be lady eustace pretty a ever sharp witty with old passion for excitement old proneness to pretend to trust everybody old incapacity for trusting anybody ferdinand lopez have lately be at foot have fired imagination with story of grand thing to be done in trade lady do yes why not woman a well a men one might do who have money in pocket experience to tell to tell what to buy what to sell experience luckily might be vicarious at present moment jewel worn in london be if ferdinand lopez knew anything about bought from proceeds of such commerce of course there be misfortune came from want of experience ferdinand lopez possessed be quite willing to place at service of one whom admired so thoroughly a did lady eustace lady eustace have be charmed have seen way into new most delightful life have not yet put of money into hand of ferdinand lopez can not say that dinner be good may be doubt whether such tradesman a messrs stewam sugarscraps do ever produce good food whether with will in world to do so such result be within power be certain think that humblest mutton chop be better eating than supreme of chicken after martial manner a have seen dish named in french bill of fare translated by french pastrycook for benefit of english customer when sent in from messrs stewam sugarscraps even with best exertion can be said that wine be good though mr sugarscraps when contracted for whole entertainment be eager in assurance that procured very best that london must produce outside look of thing be handsome there be many dish enough of servant to hand wine if not good be various probably pountney gunner did not know good wine roby did be contented on occasion to drink bad everything went pleasantly with perhaps little too much noise everything except hostess who be allowed by general consent to be sad silent till there came loud double rap at door there be papa said emily jumping up from seat mr dick looked at lopez saw at glance for moment courage have failed recovered quickly have better keep seat dear said to wife servant will attend to mr wharton will go to presently oh said emily who by time be

happy during evening be strong enough to hide misgiving to do duty a host with seeming cheerfulness chapter xlix where be guatemala though daughter word to have be very wild did almost more to convince mr wharton that must not give money to son in law than even letter have passed between to emily spoke very little a to what have occurred that evening papa said ask anything more about be very miserable because of dinner did at time ask question contenting with assuring at rate at present till after baby must have be born must remain in manchester square wo hurt said mr wharton then

to be poor girl if be treated in way by father a understand that intend to use to try to use authority over will take step for removing at once from house so interview be ended lopez have thought matter over have determined to brazen out a called nothing further be thought to be got by civility obedience now must use power idea of going to guatemala be not invention of moment be devoid of certain basis of truth such suggestion have be made to time since by mr mill happerton there be mine in guatemala wanted at future day might want resident director proposition have be made to lopez before marriage mr happerton probably have now forgotten about thing be of service now broke matter very suddenly to wife have father be speaking to of plan not lately not that remember must not speak

immediately shut up in cage at people banner office went to work occurred about first week in january duke be then at matching with wife very small party singular arrangement have be effected by duchess in early autumn have passed off without wonderful effect have be done by in pique result have be apparently so absurd that have at first frightened in end answered very well duke took great pleasure in lady rosina company enjoyed comparative solitude enabled to work day without interruption wife protested that be just what liked though must be feared that soon became weary of to lady rosina be of course paradise on earth in september phineas finn wife came to in october there be other relaxation other business prime minister wife visited sovereign made very useful speech through country on old favourite subject of decimal coinage at christmas for fortnight went to gatherum castle entertained neighbourhood nobility squirearchy dining there on one day tenant other farmer on went very smoothly duke did not become outrageously unhappy because people banner made sundry severe remark on absence of cabinet council through autumn after christmas returned to matching have of old friend with there be duke of st bungay duchess phineas finn wife lord lady cantrip barrington erle one two others at period there came great trouble one morning a duke sat in own room after breakfast read article in people banner of following sentence be part wish to know by whom be paid expense incurred by mr ferdinand lopez during late contest at silverbridge may be that be paid by gentleman in case will have nothing further to say not caring at present moment to inquire whether expense be be not excessive may be that be paid by subscription among political friend if so again will be satisfied be possible that fund be supplied by new political club of have lately heard much with action of such body of course have nothing to do if assurance can be given to by mr lopez friend that such be case will be satisfied report have reached may say more than report make duty to ask question be expense paid out of private pocket of present prime minister if so maintain that have discovered blot in nobleman character be duty to public to expose will go farther say that if be so if expense be paid out of private pocket of duke of omnium be not fit that nobleman must longer hold high office now fill know that peer must not interfere in election for house of common certainly know that minister of crown must not attempt to purchase parliamentary support happen to know also almost more than public manner be not justified in saying ostentation with at last election duke repudiated influence with borough predecessor believe have so long exercised came forward telling that at least meant to have clean hand that must not do a forefather have done that must not even do a have done in former year what be to think of duke of omnium a minister of country if after such assurance have out of own pocket paid electioneering expense of candidate at silverbridge there be much more in article passage quoted will suffice to give reader sufficient idea of accusation made duke read in retirement of own chamber read twice before allowed to think of matter statement made be at rate true to letter have paid man electioneering expense that have done so from purest motif knew reader know must not even explain motif without exposing wife since cheque be sent have never spoken of occurrence to human being have thought of very often at time private secretary with much hesitation almost with trepidation have counselled not to send money duke be man with whom be very easy to work whose courtesy to dependent on be almost exaggerated who never found fault be anxious a far a possible to do everything for comfort of around be always matter of interest to everything held held a be in trust for enjoyment of others be man whom be very difficult to advise did not like advice be so thin skinned that counsel offered to took form of criticism when cautioned what shoe must wear a have be done by lady rosina what wine what horse must buy a be done by butler coachman be thankful taking pride to for knowledge a to shoe wine horse a to own conduct private public a to question of politics a to opinion resolution be jealous of interference mr warburton therefore have almost trembled when asking duke whether be quite sure about sending money to lopez quite sure duke have answered having at time made up mind mr warburton have not dared to express further doubt money have be sent from moment of sending doubt have repeated in prime minister mind now sat with newspaper in hand thinking of of course be open to to take notice of matter to go on a though have not seen article to let thing die if must die knew mr quintus slide paper well enough to be sure that must not die charge must be repeated in people banner till be copied into other paper then further question must be asked why have prime minister allowed accusation to remain unanswered if did notice what notice must take of be true surely have right to do what liked with own money so long a disobeyed law have bribed no one have spent money with corrupt purpose sense of honour have taught to think that man have received injury through wife imprudence that therefore be responsible a far a pecuniary loss be concerned be not ashamed of thing have done yet be ashamed that must be discussed in public why have allowed to be put into position in be subject to such grievous annoyance since have held office have not have happy day so told have received from slightest gratification must buoy up with idea that be doing good service for country after while walked into next room showed paper to mr warburton perhaps be right said when told not to send money will matter nothing said private secretary when have read thinking however that might matter much wishing to spare duke be obliged to repay man a duchess have have encouraged duchess have not quite quite understood wish mr warburton knew whole history now having discussed with duchess more than once think grace must take notice of article notice be taken of three day afterwards there appeared short paragraph in large type beginning with question doe duke of omnium intend to answer question asked by last friday be true that paid expense of mr lopez when gentleman stood for silverbridge duke may be assured that question will be repeated till be answered duke also saw took to private secretary must hing at rate till be noticed in other paper said private secretary 'people banner ' be known to be scandalous of course be scandalous moreover know motif malice of wretched man who be editor paper be read foul charge if repeated will become known allegation made be true did pay man election expense moreover to tell truth openly a scruple to do to be not prepared to state publicly reason why did so nothing that reason must justify then think grace must state can not do so duke of st bungay be here must not be well to tell whole affair to will think of know why must have troubled oh lord except there be always comfort in speaking even of one trouble will think about in meantime need perhaps not mention again who oh certainly not did not mean to others to myself will turn in mind speak of when have decided anything did think about thinking of so much that must hardly get matter out of mind day night to wife did not allude to at why trouble with have caused evil have cautioned her a to future must not help out of difficulty have created continued to turn matter over in thought till so magnified built up into such proportion that again began to think that must resign be thought true that man must not remain in office a prime minister who in matter must not clear own conduct then there be third attack in people banner after that matter be noticed in evening pulpit notice duke of st bungay saw mentioned to mr warburton have duke spoken to of allegation made in press a to expense of late election at silverbridge old duke be at time have be for month in state of nervous anxiety about friend have almost admitted to that have be wrong in recommending politician so weakly organised to take office of prime minister have expected man to be more manly have perhaps expected to be le conscientiously scrupulous now a thing have be done must be maintained who else be there to take office mr gresham must not to keep mr daubeny out be very essence of duke of st bungay life turning point of political creed one grand duty idea of be always present to have moreover most true most affectionate regard for man whom now supported appreciating sweetness of character believing still in minister patriotism intelligence devotion honesty though be forced to own to that strength of man heart be wanting yes said warburton did mention doe trouble perhaps have better speak to about old duke private secretary be a fearful nervous about prime minister a mother be for weakly child must hardly tell opinion to other understood one between coddled prime minister be specially nervous a to what might be done by prime minister wife nervous a to what be done by one who came in contact with have be once suggested by private secretary lady rosina must be sent for a have soothing effect upon prime minister spirit have irritated asked duke well yes have little know think grace have better speak to not perhaps mention name duke of st bungay nodded head said that must speak to great man must not mention one name did speak have one said anything to about asked prime minister saw in 'evening pulpit ' myself have not heard mentioned anywhere did pay man expense did yes when election be over a far a can remember time after be over wrote to saying that have incurred such such expense asking to repay sent cheque for amount why be bound in honour to do why there be short pause before second question be answered man have be induced to stand by representation made to from house have be fear promised certain support certainly be not given when time came have not promised not be duchess upon whole friend think must rather not discus further even with be right that must know that did pay money also why paid may also be necessary that must consider whether there may be further probable result from doing so money have be paid by be paid for reason have stated question might be asked in house if so must be answered a have answered certainly will not shirk responsibility may be attached to must not like warburton to write line to newspaper what to 'people banner ' began there did not to 'people banner ' to 'evening pulpit ' must say know that money be paid by that payment have be made because agent have misapprehended instruction must not be true said prime minister slowly a far a can understand be what occurred said other duke instruction be not misapprehended be disobeyed think that perhaps have better say more about think that wish to press said old man tenderly fear that something ought to be done mean for own comfort comfort said prime minister have vanished long ago peace of mind happiness there have be nothing done can not be explained with perfect truth there have be impropriety know money be paid simply from over nice sense of honour can not be explained can not explain even to how then can do to gaping fool of country who be ready to trample upon man simply because be in way conspicuous among after that old duke again spoke to mr warburton mr warburton be very loyal to chief must one do anything by speaking to duchess said old duke think not suppose be grace who did can not say own impression be that have better wait till house meet then if question be asked let be answered must do in house of lord mr finn barrington erle in house must surely be enough to explain that grace have be made to believe that man have received encouragement at silverbridge from own agent have not intended must be given that therefore have thought right to pay money after explanation what more must one say might do never speak in such case a might do so then there must be necessity for to talk to person on matter so affair be left for present though allusion to in people banner be still continued did other of prime minister colleague dare to speak to on subject barrington erle phineas finn talked of among did not mention even to duchess must have gone to husband at once be too careful of to risk proceeding certainly be case among coddled prime minister chapter li coddling prime minister parliament be to meet on th of february be of course necessary that there must be cabinet council before time prime minister about end of third week in january be prepared to name day for did so most unwillingly be then ill talked to friend old duke private secretary of having meeting held without impossible said old duke if must not go must have to be possible must come here if be necessary bring fourteen fifteen minister out of town because poor creature such a be be ill in truth duke of st bungay hardly believed in illness prime minister be unhappy rather than ill by time everybody in house almost everybody in country who read newspaper have heard of mr lopez election expense except duchess one have yet dared to tell saw newspaper daily probably did not read very attentively nevertheless knew that something be wrong mr warburton hovered about prime minister more tenderly than usual duke of st bungay be more concerned world around be more mysterious husband more wretched what be be going on said one day to phineas finn everything in same dull way a usual if tell will never speak to again know there be something wrong duke be afraid be not quite well what make ill know well when be ill when be well be troubled by something think be duchess a have not spoken to be loath to make guess if there be anything can only guess at then questioned mr finn got answer if not satisfactory be at rate explanatory think be uneasy about silverbridge affair what silverbridge affair know that paid expense man lopez say that incurred yes know know that other man slide have found out published in 'people banner ' yes indeed whole army of accusation have be brought against have never liked to tell yet think that must be left in dark everybody deceives said duchess angrily nay there have be deceit everybody keep thing from think will kill among be doing why do attack will write to paper encouraged man after plantagenet have determined that must not be assisted because have done so paid man beggarly money what be there to hurt in let bear back be broad enough duke be very sensitive hate people to be sensitive make coward man when be afraid of being blamed dare not at last even show have to be wrapped up in lamb wool of course men be differently organised yes worst of be that when suffer from weakness call sensitiveness think that be made of finer material than other people men must be made of sevres china of good stone earthenware however want to abuse poor fellow think ought know what mean do want to abuse so have be bullying about money paid to man lopez how did anybody know anything about lopez must have told of said mr finn worst dear of trying to know great many people be that be sure to get hold of be very bad now that man be very bad yet say have married nice wife be often case duchess contrary be dear will have out with plantagenet if have to write letter to newspaper will put right certainly coddled husband le than others indeed in heart of heart disapproved altogether of coddling system be wont at particular time to be somewhat tender to because be aware that have be imprudent since have discovered interference at silverbridge have made understand pernicious result have be not perhaps shamefaced for word describes condition to hardly series of misfortune must have reduced duchess of omnium inclined to quiescence by feeling of penitence be le disposed than heretofore to attack with what world of yesterday call chaff with what world of to day call cheek must not admit to herself that be cowed greatness of game high interest attached to husband position did in degree dismay nevertheless executed purpose of having out with plantagenet have just heard said having knocked at door of own room having found alone have just heard for first time that there be row about money paid to mr lopez who told nobody told in usual sense of word presumed that something be matter then got out from marie why have not told why must tell why not if anything troubled must tell be if troubled much take for granted that doe trouble much be smiling a said smile passed very quickly from face will not however deceive doe trouble knew very well that something be wrong have not complained one can see a much a without word what be that fear what can man do to what matter be to if one a pours out malice on let run off like rain from housetop be too big even to be stung by such reptile a that looked into face admiring energy with spoke to a for answering continued to say may may not be proper if must be done there be people to do be speaking of own inner self have shield against equal sword to attack with if necessary have armour of proof against creature a have nothing inside to make feel that be too contemptible to be regarded nothing said oh plantagenet cora there be different nature have own excellency own defect will not admit that be coward believing a do must dare to face necessary danger can not endure to have character impugned even by mr slide mr lopez what matter if be in right why blench if conscience accuses of fault must not blench even if did what be man to be put in front of everything then to be judged a though must give time to picking of step just so must pick more warily than believe see with jaundiced eye read somewhere other day that great ship have always little worm attached to that great ship swim on know nothing of worm worm conquer at last must conquer after what be that say about money that ought not to have paid begin to think be wrong to pay certainly be not wrong have led man on have be mistaken have thought that be gentleman having led on at first before have spoken to did not like to go back from word did go to man at silverbridge who sell pot doubt man when thus encouraged told to lopez when lopez went to town did suppose that must have what people call castle interest have done so much to prevent be use of going back to now unless want to put neck down to be trodden on be confessing own sin a fast a can god know must not have trodden on be willing if be necessary then came question a have done evil how be to be rectified man with particle of spirit must have taken rub said nothing about a man asked for money be right that must have if be made public wo get very well out of doe that matter to will only luckily mind mind for must throw to whale let somebody say in so many word that duchess did so so be very wicked doubt ca kill yet dismiss wo resign in point of fact sha be penny worse for must resign if minister in england be to give up a soon a wife do foolish thing question about queen government must become very difficult may do foolish thing dear yet yet what yet not interfere in politics be know about plantagenet doe everybody know mr daubeny got dr macfuzlem made bishop that mr gresham got husband to make hazy speech about woman right so that nobody must know way meant to go there be others just a bad a only think get blown up so much do now a ask must do cora though stain be little spot thing to be avoided political destruction must not ride out of punishment by fixing stain on wife will not have name mentioned man wife must be talked about by one be high foluting plantagenet glencora in matter must allow to judge for will judge will never say that did do that be wife who did adam said so because chose to tell truth adam have be despised ever since not because ate apple because imputed eating of to woman will not do have have enough of now then turned to go away called back kiss dear said then stooped over kissed think be angry with because thing vexes be dreaming always of day when may go away together with child rest in pretty spot live a other people live must be very stupid muttered to herself a left room did go up to town for cabinet meeting may have be done at august assembly there be certainly resignation world must have heard be probable too that nothing be said about newspaper article thing if left to will generally die at last old duke phineas finn barrington erle be of opinion that best plan for present be to hing have anything be settled duchess asked phineas when came back oh yes queen speech there be very much in about payment of money have heard word about said phineas be just a bad a rest mr finn with pretended secrecy girl with first sweetheart be half so fussy a young cabinet minister cabinet minister get used to sooner think said phineas finn parliament have already met before mr slide have quite determined in what way must carry on war must indeed go on writing pernicious article about prime minister ad infinitum from year end to year end be occupation in took delight for imagined to be peculiarly well suited reader will become tired even of abuse if be not varied very continuation of such attack must seem to imply that be not much heeded other paper have indeed taken matter up have taken up only to drop subject have not be own little discovery have be due not to acumen did not therefore bear with highest interest have almost seemed a though nothing must come of for mr slide in wildest ambition must have hardly imagined vexation hesitation nervousness serious discussion word have occasioned among great people at matching certainly thing must not be allowed to pas away a matter of moment mr slide have almost worked mind up to real horror a thought of what prime minister peer great duke put man forward a candidate for borough when man be beaten pay expense be to be done to be done found out then nothing come of in day of purity when private member of parliament mere nobody loses seat because have given away few bushel of coal score two of rabbit mr slide energetic love of public virtue be scandalised a thought of probability of such catastrophe to thinking public virtue consisted in carping at men high placed in abusing minister judge bishop especially in finding out something for might be abused own public virtue be in matter very great for be who have ferreted out secret for intelligence energy in matter country owed much country must pay nothing must give none of credit desired must rob of special opportunity of declaring dozen time that people banner be surest guardian of people liberty unless must succeed in forcing matter further into public notice how terrible be apathy of people at large said mr slide to when can not be wakened by such revelation a mr slide knew very well what ought to be next step proper notice must be given question must be asked in parliament gentleman must declare that have noticed such such statement in public press that thought right to ask whether such such payment have be made by prime minister in meditation mr slide went so far a to arrange very word indignant gentleman must utter among word be graceful allusion to certain public spirited newspaper did even go so far a to arrange compliment to editor in doing so knew that be thinking only of ought to be not of must be time have not come a yet in editor of newspaper in country received tithe of honour due to question in form with without compliment to people banner must be thing be now desirable who be to ask question if public spirit be really strong in country there must be difficulty on point crime committed have be so horrible that great politician of country ought to compete for honour of asking what greater service can be trusted to hand of great man than of exposing sin of ruler of nation so thought mr slide knew that be in advance of people that matter must not be seen in proper light by who ought so to see there might be difficulty in getting peer to ask question in house in prime minister sat even in other house there be now little of acrid indignant opposition upon in mr slide opinion safety of nation altogether depends when statement be first made in people banner lopez have come to mr slide at once have demanded authority for making lopez have found statement to be most injurious to have be paid election expense twice over making clear profit of l by transaction though matter have at one time troubled conscience have already taught to regard a one of bygone to wise man seldom refers now mr wharton must know that have be cheated must statement reach who gave authority to publish asked lopez who at time have become intimate with mr slide be true lopez asked editor be done be done in private between duke duke dear fellow ca be private certainly not when be prime minister have right to publish thing about be true if be true have got right to publish if be not true have got right to ask question if will 'ave to do with prime minister ca 'ide under bushel tell be true might a well go 'and in 'and with in matter ca 'urt if oppose why will oppose ca say anything of well know about can generally 'it pretty 'ard if feel inclined want to 'it a regard can tell story one way other just a please lopez seeing in same light at last agreed that story must be told in manner not inimical to present project of life be to leave trouble in england sexty parker being worst of get away to guatemala in arranging good word of mr slide might not benefit ill word might injure then let do what must matter must be made public must mr wharton hear of a of course must must be brazened out must not keep from mr wharton ear by quarrelling with quintus slide be true said lopez knew before just a well a though have seen ai often very wrong in thing asked for money threatened know about threatening ' e must have sent else told have be deceived by people in borough have be put to expense through misrepresentation of duchess think did ask for money sent cheque of course took of course of course must give copy of letter never kept copy have copy in breast coat pocket at moment slide did not for moment believe statement made in such discussion one man hardly expects truth from mr slide certainly never expected truth from man sent cheque almost without word said lopez did write note suppose just few word must let 'ave note destroyed at once be also in breast pocket at time did e write think be private secretary mr warburton must be sure know be be mr warburton be civil yes be if have be uncivil must have sent back be not man to take impudence even from duke if will give two letter lopez will stick to through thick thin by heaven will think what 'people banner ' be may come to want that kind of thing of day lopez remained silent looking into other man eager face must publish know must be so much to to have evidence in hand might do worse know than make friend of wo publish certainly not will only refer to then lopez pulled bundle of paper out of pocket there be said well said slide when have read be one of rummest transaction ever 'eard of why did e send money be what want to know a far a claim go 'ad leg to stand on not legally 'ad leg to stand on way doe much matter sent money sending of money be corrupt who will get to ask question suppose young fletcher must do be bird of feather said lopez bird of feather do fall out sometimes sir orlando drought wonder whether sir orlando must do if man ever 'ated sir orlando drought must 'ate duke of omnium think 'd let down to kind of thing let down see letting down in men who have be in cabinet do stick to one even when be enemy think so mighty that ought to be 'andled like other men will let know will 'andle cabinet minister cowboy be same to quintus slide when have got pen in 'be 'and on next morning there came out article in people banner in writer declared that have in own possession damnatory correspondence between prime minister late candidate at silverbridge prime minister may deny fact said article think probable be possible wish to be fair above board in everything therefore at once inform noble duke that entire correspondence be in hand in saying mr quintus slide thought that have quite kept promise made when said that must only refer to letter chapter lii can sleep here to night suppose that scheme of going to guatemala have be in first instance propounded by lopez with object of frightening mr wharton into term there have indeed be previous thought on subject plan projected before marriage have be resuscitated mainly with hope that might be efficacious to extract money when by degree son in law began to feel that even must not be operative on father in law purse when under threat wharton emily gave way when with view of strengthening threat renewed inquiry a to guatemala found that there might still be opening for in direction threat took shape of true purpose began to think that must in real earnest try fortune in new world from day to day thing did not go well with from day to day sexty parker became more unendurable be impossible for to keep from partner plan of emigration endeavoured to make parker believe that thing if done at be not to be done till affair be settled in other word embarrassment cleared by downright money payment mr wharton be to make payment on condition that thus expatriated mr wharton have made such promise though threatened day came nearer nearer must not bring to purchase short respite for daughter by paying money to scoundrel payment felt sure must be of permanent service during time mr wharton be very wretched if must have freed daughter from marriage by fortune must have done without second thought if must have assuredly purchased permanent absence of husband must have done at large price let pay what must must see way to security from day to day became more strongly convinced of rascality of man who be son in law who be still inmate in own house of course have accusation enough to make within own breast against daughter who when choice be open to must not take altogether fitting husband provided for have declared to be broken hearted for ever unless be allowed to throw away upon wretched creature blamed almost a much a did why have allowed to be so enervated by prayer at last a to surrender everything a have done how must presume to think that must be allowed to escape when have done so little to prevent misery spoke to emily about not often indeed with great earnestness have done said will bear tell can not go till know to what home be going be for to consider have begged to let remain can say no more if chooses to take will go then spoke to about money of course have money said of course have enough for everett if must do good by giving to must have papa answered will never again ask to give single penny must be altogether between be what call speculator money be not safe with will have to send when be in want when be dead there will be no more to be sent look like papa know have done must bear have thrown away life be just that if baby have lived must have be different be about end of january then mr wharton heard of great attack made by mr quintus slide against prime minister heard of course of payment alleged to have be made to ferdinand lopez by duke on score of election at silverbridge person spoke to on subject one two friend at club asked what supposed to be truth in matter mr roby inquired of on subject have asked lopez said be sure from manner that did get money know anything about said mr wharton if did get think be very clever be well known at time to mr roby that lopez marriage have be failure that lopez be not rich man emily a well a father be discontented unhappy have latterly heard of guatemala scheme have of course expressed horror sympathised with lopez rather than with wife thinking that if mr wharton must only open pocket wide enough thing might still be right be duchess fault know said to old man know nothing about when want to know certainly will not come to misery have brought upon be so great that make wish have never seen one who knew be everett who introduced to house be who introduced to everett there be wrong a so often be mr wharton everett met first at club what be use of arguing about be at house that emily met be that did wonder can have face to mention name to man living time in own house up to time mr wharton have not mentioned to single person fact that have paid son in law election expense at silverbridge have given cheque without much consideration with feeling that by doing so must in degree benefit daughter have since regretted act finding that such payment from must be of service to emily thing have be done there have be so far end of in subsequent discussion must mr wharton have alluded to have not circumstance now a be driven back upon mind since day on have paid that money have be a declared to swindled over over again by son in law there be dinner in manchester square after that brougham rent score of bill of have paid declined to pay yet have said little to man of injury of what use be to say anything lopez must simply reply that have asked to pay nothing what be lopez have once said to fortune have right to expect with daughter have right to expect shilling wharton have said then lopez have shrugged shoulder there have be end of now if rumour be true there have be positive dishonesty from source man might have got money first if money have be twice got second payment have be fraudulently obtained surely if accusation have be untrue lopez must have come to declared to be false knowing what must otherwise be thought lately in daily worry of life have avoided conversation with man must not allow mind to contemplate clearly what be coming entertained irrational undefined hope that something must at last save daughter from threatened banishment might be if held own hand tight enough that there must not be money enough even to pay for passage out a for outfit lopez must of course order what wanted have bill sent to manchester square whether not be being done emily knew thus matter went on without much speech between two men now old barrister thought that be bound to speak therefore waited on certain morning till lopez have come down having previously desired daughter to leave room lopez asked what be that newspaper be saying about expense at silverbridge lopez have expected attack have endeavoured to prepare for must have thought sir that must not have paid much attention to such statement in newspaper when concern do paid electioneering expense certainly subscribed l towards mr wharton subscribed nothing sir there be question of subscription by intend to imply contribution from various source told that contest cost l that sum handed to with full understanding on part a well a on mine be paying for whole be that so have own way sir if be not more precise will think that have defrauded defrauded yes sir defrauded duke of omnium money be gone matter little if be so will know that from from have raised money under false pretence of course mr wharton from must bear whatever may choose to say be true that have applied to duke of omnium for money on account of expense at silverbridge be true that have paid money on score mr wharton a said just now be bound to hear to bear from anything that may choose to say connection with wife age alike restrain resentment be not bound to answer question when be accompanied by such language a have chosen to use refuse to answer further question on subject of course know that have taken money from duke then why do ask of course know that be a well aware a be of nature of transaction that can brazen out without blush only prof to that have got beyond reach of shame very well sir have further explanation to make what do expect to say without knowing of fact of case except one contributed l to election expense take upon to tell that be shameless fraudulent swindler then ask for further explanation in position be likely that will explain anything can be in humour to be explanatory just turn over in mind ask question have turned over in own mind have asked question think probable that must wish to explain anything will take step to let duke know that a father in law have paid full sum have stated that have spent at silverbridge much duke will care about after have passed be obliged to say that sooner leave house better will be pleased very well sir of course will take wife with must be a plea mr wharton must be a please belongs to not to to herself under influence have forgotten much of what belongs to duty of wife think that will so far have forgotten a to give more trouble than to bid come with when desire let that be a may must request that sir will absent will not entertain a guest man who have acted a have done in matter even though be son in law can sleep here to night suppose to morrow if suit a for emily can remain here if will allow to do so that will not suit said lopez in case a far a be concerned will do may ask to do good morning mr wharton left room did not leave house before did so must see daughter thinking probable that lopez must also choose to see wife prepared to wait in own room in about ten minute lopez started from hall door in cab did so without going upstairs mr wharton have reason to believe that son in law be almost destitute of money for immediate purpose might have must at rate be serviceable to before started home for emily must be expensive home in present circumstance must be so reputable for a one under father roof therefore almost hoped that might still be left with till horrid day must come if ever did come in must be taken away from for ever of course papa will go if bid said when told that thought right to tell of morning interview hardly know how to advise said father meaning in truth to bring round to giving of advice adverse to husband will want advice papa want advice never knew woman who wanted more papa be bound to do a tell know what have done when poor wretch have got into perpetual prison by misdeed advice can serve then so be with can at rate escape from prison have feeling of pride tell that a chose to become wife of husband a insisted on in opposition to friend a must judge for be bound to put up with choice if have come upon through authority of others if have be constrained to marry think must have reconciled to deserting did will abide by when bid go will go poor mr went to chamber sat there whole day without taking book paper into hand must there be rescue protection no relief turned over in head various plan in vague useless manner what if duke be to prosecute lopez for fraud what if must induce lopez to abandon wife pledging by deed not to return to for say twenty even thirty thousand pound what if be to carry daughter away to continent half forcing half persuading to make journey surely there might be mean found by man might be frightened into compliance there sat did nothing in evening ate solitary mutton chop at jolly blackbird because must not bear to face even club then returned to chamber to great disgust of old woman who have in charge at night at about midnight crept away to own house wretched old man lopez when left manchester square did not go in search of new home for wife during whole of day did trouble on subject spent most of day at room in coleman street of san juan mining association of mr mill happerton have once be chairman there be now chairman other director mr mill happerton influence have so far remained with company a to enable lopez to become well known in company office acknowledged a claimant for office of resident manager at san juan in guatemala now present project be that lopez be to start on behalf of company early in may that company be to pay own personal expense out to guatemala that must allow while there salary of l year for managing affair of mine a far a offer went thing be true enough be true that lopez have absolutely secured place have done so subject to burden of one very serious stipulation be to become proprietor of share in mine to pay up l on share be considered that man who be to get l year in guatemala for managing affair must at rate assist affair show confidence in affair to extent a great a of course holder of share must be a fully entitled a other shareholder to per cent who promoted mine promised a immediate result of speculation at first lopez have hoped that might be enabled to defer actual payment of l till after have sailed when once out in guatemala a manager a manager must doubtless remain by degree found that payment must actually be made in advance now there be nobody to whom must apply mr wharton be indeed forced to declare at office that money be to come from mr wharton have given excellent fictitious reason why mr wharton must not pay money till february in spite of have come gone still did hope that if need to go be actually there might even yet get money from mr wharton surely mr wharton must sooner pay sum than be troubled at home with son in law must worst come to worst of course must raise money by consenting to leave wife at home be not part of plan if must avoid must be very low price at to sell wife that might get from connection with a long a kept with be in possession at rate of mr must do for have not therefore a yet made final application to father in law for money having found possible to postpone payment till middle of february quarrel with mr wharton morning regarded a having little effect upon circumstance mr wharton must not give money because loved yet from personal respect from sense of duty a to what might owe to son in law must be simply given a price by absence might be purchased absence must not be le desirable because of morning quarrel even yet be not quite resolved a to going to guatemala sexty parker have be sucked nearly dry be in truth at moment so violent with indignation fear remorse that lopez did not dare to show in little tankard yard still there be even yet certain hope in direction from great result might come if certain new spirit have just be concocted from bark of tree in central africa be called bios must only be made to go up in market everything might be satisfactorily arranged hoarding of london be already telling public that if wished to get drunk without of usual trouble of intoxication must drink bios public doubt doe read literature of hoarding then read so slowly bios have hardly be twelve month on board a yet be now increasing size of letter in advertisement jocundity of picture thing might be done there be too hope hope of instant money by guatemala might be staved off a to further explanation will be given in further chapter suppose will find dixon decent sort of fellow said lopez to secretary of association in coleman street rough know honest oh be that if be honest what call loyal care straw for anything else one doe expect west end manner in guatemala will have deal to do with hate fellow that ca depend on mr happerton used to think great deal of dixon be right said lopez mr dixon be underground manager out at san juan mine be perhaps a anxious for loyal honest colleague a be mr lopez if so mr dixon be very much in way to be disappointed lopez stayed at office day studying affair of san juan mine then went to progress for dinner hitherto have taken no step whatever a to getting lodging for for wife chapter liii mr hartlepod when time came at lopez must have left manchester square be still there mr wharton in discussing matter with daughter when wishing to persuade that might remain in house even in opposition to husband have not told that have actually desired lopez to leave have then felt sure that man must go must take wife with did not even yet know obduracy cleverness impregnability of son in law when time came when saw daughter in morning after notice have be given must not bring even yet to say to that have issued order for banishment day went by lopez be still there old barrister said further word on subject two men never met met simply in hall passage wharton studiously avoided such meeting thus denying commonest us of own house at last emily told that husband have fixed day for departure next indian mail packet by must leave england must start from southampton on nd of april be to be ready to go on day how be to be till then father asked in low uncertain voice suppose may remain with husband will be here too suppose such misery destruction of everything man ever heard of before said mr wharton to made reply continued working at necessary preparation for final departure emily said will make sacrifice to prevent can be done short of injuring everett interest will do anything know said must understand something of affair nothing whatever have told nothing of in earlier day soon after marriage bade get money from when wrote to for money from italy after have refused to do anything to say word told that must be between what else must say now tell nothing can not think that must want to go with then there be again pause be because love not that papa why then must burden with companion money whatever have must go further without such impediment perhaps think that while be with have hold upon will have stronger hold by leaving what be to gain if must only know price ask papa even know how be to speak to again then again there be pause papa said after while have done let go will still have everett may be that after time will come back to will not kill may be that will not die by god said mr wharton rising from chair suddenly if there be money to be made by believe that must murder without scruple thus be that within eighteen month of marriage father spoke to daughter of husband what be to take with said to husband few day later have better ask father why must ask ferdinand how must know how must must have thought that must interest about upon word have enough to interest just at present without thinking of finery suppose mean what clothes must have be not thinking of only need think of nothing else ask what plea to allow to spend then will tell what to get will never ask for anything ferdinand then may go without anything might a well do at once for will have to do sooner later if please go to tradesman say nothing to about will give credit see how be dear have cheated in most rascally manner have allowed to marry daughter because did not make bargain with a man must have done denies fortune have right to expect with know that israelite despoiled egyptian be taken a merit on part father be egyptian to will despoil can tell say so if please so day went on till first week of february have passed parliament have met lopez wife be still living in manchester square not word have be said a to notice to quit allusion made to be supposed to be settled thing that lopez be to start with wife for guatemala in first week in april mr wharton have felt difficulty a to daughter outfit have told that might get pleased on credit for dear papa will get nothing till bid ca go across world without anything what be to do in place a unless have thing want what do poor people do who have to go what must do if have cast off because of disobedience have not cast off tell that will give so much then if bid will spend let be so will tell upon mr wharton did speak to son in law coming upon suddenly one morning in dining room emily will want outfit if be to go to place like other people want many thing that can not get will tell tradesman to furnish with what want up to well suppose say l have spoken to want sanction sanction for spending money can have very quickly can tell so will do so upon mr wharton be going lopez stopped be now essential that money for share in san juan mine must be paid up father in law pocket be still source from enterprising son in law hoped to procure have fully made up mind to demand thought that time have now come be resolved that must not ask a favour on bended knee be beginning to feel own power trusted that might prevail by other mean than begging mr wharton said have not be very good friend lately indeed there be time very short time during thought that might hit off together did best fancy like men of class well well have better go on if there be anything to say have much to say will go on be rich man be son in law mr wharton put left hand up to forehead brushing few hair back from head said nothing have received from during last most vital year that assistance think have right to expect also might have be rich man now be good going back to then paused still mr wharton said nothing now know what have come to to daughter be to be expatriated be that fault think be mean to say nothing further of that company be sending out will probably be most thriving thing of kind have come up within twenty year be to pay salary of l year a resident manager at san juan so understand salary alone must be beggarly thing guatemala take be not cheapest country in world in man can live be to go out a owner of fifty share on l must be paid up be entitled to draw l year a dividend on profit of share will be twenty per cent exactly will double salary just so there be one little ceremony to be perfected before can be allowed to enter upon so halcyon state of existence l share must be paid up mr wharton simply stared at must have l to invest in undertaking before can start well now have not got l part of wish suppose to see daughter starve a for hardly flatter when say that be very anxious to be rid of l be not very much for to ask of a regard such consummate impudence never met in life before perhaps so much unprevaricating downright truth at rate such be condition of affair if be to go money must be paid week have perhaps foolishly put off mentioning matter till be sure must not raise sum elsewhere though feel claim on to be good mr wharton be not pleasant to to make be asking for l down certainly be what security be to have security yes that if pay will not be troubled again by meanest scoundrel that have ever be misfortune to meet how be to know that will not come back to morrow how be to know that will go at do think probable will give l on own simple word then scoundrel will stay in england will generally find convenient to live in manchester square will be d d if doe look here sir between there can be bargain nothing bargain will pay l on certain condition did doubt at that must pay will go with to office of company will pay for share if can receive assurance there that matter be a say that share will not be placed in power before have reached guatemala can come to day sir receive assurance must have written undertaking from document daughter can show if be necessary that will never claim society again trouble with application mistake mr wharton wife go with to guatemala then will not pay one penny why must what be presence absence to except a concern do think that care for threat of remaining here police will set right wherever go wife go will see to too if want money must leave good morning mr wharton a went to chamber thought matter over be certainly willing to risk l demanded if must rid daughter of terrible incubus even if be only for time if lopez must once go to guatemala leaving wife behind must be comparatively easy to keep apart must ever return difficulty now be not in in man conduct have be so outrageous so bare faced so cruel that lawyer did not doubt that must turn husband out of house keep wife even now be not that be determined to obey man whom in opposition to friend have taken a master have done will bear be answer must make when father strove to persuade to separate from husband have got everett must say when girl be married be divided from family be divided must willingly stay if lopez must bid stay now seemed that must not go without l when pressure came upon surely must go leave wife in course of day mr went to office of san juan mine asked to see director be shown up into half furnished room two story high in coleman street where found two clerk sitting upon stool when asked for director be shown into back room in sat secretary secretary be dark plump little man with greasy face who have gift of assuming air of great importance a twisted chair round to face visitor who came to inquire about san juan mining company name be hartlepod if san juan mine turned out trump a intended that must mr hartlepod meant to be great man in city to mr hartlepod mr wharton with considerable embarrassment explained a much of joint history of lopez a found to be absolutely necessary have only left office about hour said mr hartlepod of course understand that be son in law have mentioned name to mr wharton before now be going out to guatemala oh be going out have not told a much certainly sir have told that be desirous of buying certain share in company before start probably mr wharton indeed believe can not go unless buy may be so mr wharton doubt have told fact be mr hartlepod be willing under certain stipulation to advance money mr hartlepod bowed need not trouble with private affair between son in law again secretary bowed seems to be for interest that must go very great opening indeed mr wharton see how man be to have better opening fine salary expense out paid one of very best thing have come up for many year a for capital be to embark in affair be a safe to get per cent on a safe a safe a bank of england will have share oh yes scrip will be handed to at once if mean about mine mr wharton may take word that be real be not one of sham thing melt away like snow leave shareholder nowhere there be prospectus mr wharton perhaps have not seen that before take away cast eye over at leisure mr put somewhat lengthy pamphlet into pocket look at list of director have three member of parliament baronet one two city name be a good a good a bank of england if prospectus wo make man confident know what will why mr wharton think that son in law must get fifty share at par unless be going out a general local manager share ai to be have be large concern a far a capital go will see if look about quarter of million paid up be in box a one may say be among share ai in market of course be not for to say what must be done between son in law lopez be friend of mine man esteem nevertheless must think of advising to do not to do when talk of safety mr wharton why mr wharton scruple to tell a man who know what thing be that be opportunity doe come in man way perhaps twice in life mr wharton found that have nothing more to say went back to lincoln inn knew very well that mr hartlepod assurance be not worth much mr hartlepod belonging clerk in office look of room very nature of praise have sung of inspired anything confidence mr wharton be man of world though knew nothing of city way be quite aware that man in sens must lay out l on mere word of mr hartlepod still be inclined to make payment if only must secure absence of lopez if must be sure that lopez must in truth go to guatemala if also must induce man to go without wife must risk money money must of course be thrown away must throw away lopez doubt have declared that must not go without wife even though money be paid for money be alluring sum a pressure upon man became greater mr wharton thought must probably consent to leave wife behind in emergency barrister went to attorney told everything two lawyer be closeted together for hour mr wharton last word to old friend be a follows will risk money walker rather will consent absolutely to throw away a will be thrown away if can be managed that will in truth go to place without wife chapter liv lizzie can not be supposed that ferdinand lopez at time be very happy man have at rate once loved wife must have loved still must have trained to think a thought to share wish to put into same boat with a be wont to describe unison sympathy required from to give due did not know that be villain when be exhorting to get round father be not aware that be giving lesson must shock well conditioned girl did not understand that everything that have discovered of moral disposition since marriage be of nature to disgust not understanding conceived that be grievously wronged by in adhered to father rather than to made unhappy doubly disappointed have got wife that have expected fortune still thought that fortune must come if must only hold on to wife have got then everything have gone badly with since marriage be apt when thinking over affair to attribute to fear hesitation parsimony of sexty parker none of late venture with sexty parker have be successful now sexty be in bad condition very violent drinking hard declaring to be ruined man swearing that if be not done must have bitter revenge sexty still believed in wealth of partner father in law still have hope of salvation from source lopez must declare to up to very time persevered in protesting salvation be to be found in bios if sexty must only risk two three thousand pound more upon bios credit to amount failing immediate money thing might still be right bios be d said sexty uttering string of heavy imprecation on morning have be trusting to native produce rather than to new african spirit now a guatemala scheme really took form loomed on lopez eyesight a thing might be real endeavoured to keep out of sexty way in vain sexty too have heard of guatemala in misery hunted lopez about city by g believe be afraid to come to little tankard yard said one day having caught victim under equestrian statue in front of exchange what be good of coming when will hing when be there will tell what be lopez be not going out of country about mining business if know who said be will put spoke in wheel there man will give written account of dealing between to director by g will know man be as sexty always be look here if can carry on a though be going to place can draw l from old wharton have already offered have treated with stinginess never knew equalled have done what have right to expect must have be rich men now at last have got hold upon up to l a stand pretty nearly whole of will go to spoil by making as of sexty who be three part drunk looked up into face for few second then made reply be d d if believe word of upon lopez affected to laugh then made escape a have said did not tend to make life happy though have impudence enough callousness of conscience enough to get bill paid by mr wharton a often a must be not quite easy in mind while doing so ambition have never be high have soared higher than that have have great hope have lived with high people have dined with lord lady have be guest of duchess have married daughter of gentleman have nearly be member of parliament still belonged to what considered to be first rate club from great altitude looked down upon sexty parker men of sexty class because of social success because knew how to talk to look like gentleman be unpleasant to therefore to be driven to life be now living idea of going out to guatemala burying in mine in central america be not to happy idea in spite of that have done have still hope that might avoid banishment have spoken truth to sexty parker in saying that intended to get l from mr wharton without terrible personal sacrifice though have hardly spoken truth when assured friend that greater portion of money must go to there be many scheme fluctuating through brain accompanied by many doubt if must get mr wharton money by giving up wife must consent to give up in case must stay must go must run one further great chance with bios if so by whose assistance if must at last decide that must do so by aid of certain friend be yet left to must throw at friend foot friend being lady propose to desert wife begin world again with for lady in question be lady in possession a believed of very large mean must cut throat have done at once with trouble acknowledging to that career have be failure that therefore might be brought with advantage to end after said to may be best way of

have air of fashion about with lived widow mr leslie who have introduced to mr dick roby through mr roby to ferdinand lopez lady eustace be in enjoyment of handsome income a hope that of reader may remember income during last year two have learned to foster if not with much discretion at rate with great zeal during short life have have many aspiration love poetry sport religion fashion

expensive for must talk religion if must find close to well got up clergyman being quite indifferent a to denomination of religion perhaps wild dash for time into fast vulgarity be what in heart of heart liked best only that be so difficult to enjoy pleasure without risk of losing everything then together with passion perhaps above there have lately sprung up in heart of lady eustace desire to multiply mean by successful speculation be friend with whom lopez have lately become intimate by whose aid hoped to extricate from of difficulty poor a be have contrived to bribe mr leslie by handsome present out of bond street for a still lived in manchester square be undoubted son in law of mr wharton credit be not altogether gone in giving of gift purport be of course named mr leslie be probably

of paying debt be incompatible with absence of money now if please will not say anything more about mr parker be not at rate fit companion for be who introduced to hold tongue about let that be end of little knew what world of torment be preparing for when allowed to come live in father house chapter lvi what duchess thought of husband when session began be understood in political world that very strong opposition be to be organised against government under guidance of sir orlando drought that great sin to be imputed to cabinet be utter indifference to safety honour of great britain a manifested by neglect of navy world knew that sir orlando have deserted coalition because be not allowed to build new ship of course sir orlando must make most of grievance with be joined mr boffin patriotic conservative who have never listened to voice of seducer staunch remainder of old tory party with more violent of radical be prepared to act not desirous indeed that new ship must be built that conservative government must be established indeed that anything must be done animated by intense disgust so mild politician a duke of omnium must be prime minister fight began at once sir orlando objecting violently to certain passage in queen speech be very well to say that country be at present at peace with world how be peace to be maintained without fleet then sir orlando paid great many compliment to duke ended speech by declaring to be most absolutely faineant minister have disgraced country since day of duke of newcastle mr monk defended coalition assured house that navy be not only most powerful navy existing that be most powerful that ever have existed in possession of other country be probably in absolute efficiency superior to combined navy of world house be not shocked by statement so absolutely at variance with other coming from two gentleman who have lately be member of same government who must be supposed to know what be talking about seemed to think that upon whole sir orlando have done duty for though there be complete confidence in navy a navy though very small minority must have voted for considerably increased expense still be well that there must be opposition how can there be opposition without subject for grumbling matter on minister may be attacked one really thought that prussian french combined must invade shore devastate field plunder london carry daughter away into captivity state of fund showed very plainly that there be such fear good cry be very good thing be always well to rub up official of admiralty by little wholesome abuse sir orlando be thought to have done business well of course did not risk division upon address have done so must have be nowhere a be be proud of achievement minister generally must have be indifferent to very hard word be said of knowing what be worth feeling aware that ministry have everything too easy must lose interest in country have not be that chief be very sore on subject old duke work at time consisted almost altogether in nursing younger duke did sometimes occur to elder grace that might be well to let brother retire that prime minister malgre lui must not be successful prime minister useful one if duke of omnium went coalition must go too coalition have be offspring of old statesman country be thriving under coalition there be real reason why must not last for next ten year continued therefore system of coddling be ready at moment at moment to pour if not comfort at rate consolation into ear of unhappy friend in present emergency be falsehood general baseness of sir orlando nearly broke heart of prime minister how be one to live said if one have to do with men of kind have to do with longer said duke of st bungay when see man who be supposed to have earned name of statesman be high in council of sovereign induced by personal jealousy to do a be doing make feel that honest man must not place where may have to deal with such person according to that honest men be to desert country in order that dishonest men may have everything own way duke must not answer therefore for moment yielded be unhappy saturnine generally silent except when closeted with ancient mentor knew that be saturnine silent that behoved a leader of men to be genial communicative listening to counsel even if did not follow at rate appearing to have confidence in colleague during time mr slide be not inactive in heart of heart prime minister be more afraid of mr slide attack than of made upon by sir orlando drought now that parliament be sitting mind of men be stirred to political feeling by renewed energy of house great deal be being said in many quarter about last silverbridge election paper have taken matter up generally accusing prime minister defending defence be almost a unpalatable to a accusation be admitted on side that duke a peer a prime minister must have abstained from interference whatever in election be also admitted on side that have not so abstained if there be truth at in allegation that have paid money for mr lopez be pleaded on behalf that duke of omnium have always interfered at silverbridge that reform bill have ever have effect in reducing influence in borough frequent allusion be made to cautious dod who year after year have reported that duke of omnium exercised considerable influence in borough then friendly newspaper went on to explain that duke have in instance stayed hand that money if paid at have be paid because candidate who be to have be nominee have be thrown over when duke at last moment made up mind that must abandon privilege have hitherto be always exercised by head of family have be exercised more than once twice in own favour mr slide day after day repeated question want to know whether prime minister did did not pay election expense of mr lopez at last silverbridge election if so why paid will continue to ask question till have be answered when asking again say that actual correspondence on subject between duke mr lopez be in own hand then after while allusion be made to duchess for mr slide have learned fact of case from lopez when mr slide found how hard be to draw badger a expressed concerning own operation at last openly alluded to duchess running risk of punishment might fall upon by action for libel by severe reprehension from colleague of press have a yet said received answer to question have felt ourselves called upon to ask in reference to conduct of prime minister at silverbridge election be of opinion that interference by peer with constituency of country must be put down by strong hand of law a thoroughly unmercifully a be putting down ordinary bribery when offending peer be also prime minister of great country becomes doubly duty of who watch over public safety mr slide be always speaking of a watching over public safety to animadvert upon crime till have be assoiled at rate repented from what now hear have reason to believe that crime be acknowledged have payment on behalf of mr lopez not be made a certainly be made letter in hand must be impudent forgery charge must long since have be denied silence in such matter amount to confession understand that duke intends to escape under plea that have second self powerful a be to exercise baneful influence territorial wealth unfortunately give for action of second self a peer of parliament a prime minister be not responsible in other word be informed that privilege belonging to palliser family at silverbridge be exercised not by duke by duchess that duke paid money when found that duchess have promised more than must perform must hardly have thought that even man so notoriously weak a duke of omnium must have endeavoured to ride out of responsibility by throwing blame upon wife will certainly find that attempt if made will fail against duchess wish to say not word be known a exercising wide if not discriminate hospitality believe to be kind hearted bustling ambitious lady to whom little fault may easily be forgiven on account of good nature generosity can not accept indiscretion a excuse for most unconstitutional act performed by prime minister of country latterly duchess have taken in own copy of people banner since have found that around be endeavouring to keep from what be being said of husband in regard to borough have be determined to see therefore read article from two three paragraph have just be given having read handed to friend mr finn wonder that trouble with such trash friend said to be very well dear from poor wretch who be slave of people have to regard what be said of in 'people banner ' must be much better for to neglect just a author be told not to read criticism never must believe author who told that did read what be said about wonder when man found out that be good natured must find good natured if must get hold of be not going to allow to torment for own sake not moment fancy that if might be permitted to have own way must answer very easily indeed with dreg of newspaper gutter slanderer if one must be open say truth aloud what must one have to fear after what be that did disobeyed husband because thought that be too scrupulous let say a much out loud to public saying also that be sorry for a be who must be against who must have word to say after must be most popular woman in england for month a regard plantagenet mr slide article must sink into silence even though be to continue from day to day for twelvemonth must not hurt know how scorch mention of name will make more intolerable to than ever doubt that know even yet thought that did though in manner be a dry a stick though pursuit be opposite to very idea of romance though pass day night in thinking how may take halfpenny in pound off tax of people without robbing revenue there be dash of chivalry about worthy of old poet to woman particularly own woman be thing so fine so precious that wind of heaven must hardly be allowed to blow upon can not bear to think that people must even talk of wife yet heaven know poor fellow have given people occasion enough to talk of have much higher chivalry than of old poet hero watched woman because did not want to have trouble about shut up in castle kept in ignorance held a far a must out of harm way hardly think succeeded said mr finn in pure selfishness tried must be too proud to watch if be hatching treason against in dark chance have brought there must stop ear with finger be trust even when know that be being deceived be honour complete from head to foot ah be before knew when tried hardest never must quite tell that story wo try now behaved like god must never tell what felt felt ought to love do what be use of be god be not goddess then though be god be dry silent uncongenial uncomfortable god must have suited much better to have married sinner then sinner must have married be so irredeemable scapegrace believe in woman marrying bad man in hope of making good especially not when woman be naturally inclined to evil will half kill when read about have read already have already half killed for mind in least for sake mind much will rob of only possible answer to accusation very thing wretch in newspaper say will say that will be disgraced by saying be very thing that ought to say there must be disgrace in beyond what might well bear for little fault must bear so easily will speak to about dare not in matter have gone beyond speaking suppose doe talk over with old duke will say nothing to about unless be to tell that have resigned that be to start off live in minorca for next ten year be so proud when made prime minister think that be beginning to regret now then there be pause duchess went on with newspaper soon resumed discourse heart be full out of full heart mouth speaks must have made prime minister have let be chancellor of exchequer begin to see way of government now must have done dirty work must have given away garter ribbon made bargain while giving must select sleek easy bishop who must be troublesome must give pension withhold make stupid men peer must have big nobleman at foot praying to be lieutenant of county must dole out secretaryship lordship never one without getting something in return must brazen out job let 'people banner slide make worst of think must make popular with party do high flowing patriotic talk for benefit of province man at regular office have to work be what plantagenet be fit for want always to be doing something that will be really useful man have to toil at really to know thing prime minister must never go beyond generality about commerce agriculture peace general philanthropy of course must have gift of gab plantagenet have got never want to say anything unless have got something to say must do mansion house dinner to marvel doubt that must speak at time lady glen oh do so wish have opportunity said duchess of course duke have read article in privacy of own room of course article have nearly maddened with anger grief a duchess have said article have taken from very ground on friend have told that must stand have never consented never must consent to lay blame publicly on wife have begun to think that must take notice of charge made against deputize one to explain for in house of common that injury have be done at silverbridge by indiscretion of agent who have not fulfilled employer intention that duke have thought right afterwards to pay money in consequence of indiscretion have not agreed to have brought to think that must agree to now of course question must follow who be indiscreet agent be duchess person for whose indiscretion have have to pay l to mr lopez in matter did not find in accord even with mr slide must hardly have thought that even man so notoriously weak a duke of omnium must have endeavoured to ride out of responsibility by throwing blame upon wife read reread word till knew by heart for few moment seemed to to be evil in constitution that prime minister must not have power of instantly crucifying so foul slanderer yet be very truth of word crushed be weak told notoriously weak must be must be most mean in to ride out of responsibility by throwing blame upon wife what else be to do there seemed to to be one course to get up in house of lord declare that paid money because have thought right to do so under circumstance must not explain to declare that be not intention to say word on subject to have word said on behalf there be cabinet council held that day one ventured to speak to prime minister a to accusation though considered to be weak colleague be more le afraid of there be certain silent dignity about man saved from evil a also debarred from advantage of familiarity have spoken on subject to mr monk to phineas finn a reader know very often to old mentor have also mentioned to friend lord cantrip who be not in cabinet coming away from cabinet took mr monk arm led away to own room in treasury chamber have happened to see article in 'people banner ' morning asked never see 'people banner ' said mr monk there be just look at whereupon mr monk read article understand what people call constitutional practice a well a one know a told before did pay man expense did do anything unconstitutional must depend duke upon circumstance if be to back man up by wealth in expensive contest think must be unconstitutional if set to work in way cared not what spent might materially influence election buy parliamentary support for in case payment be made after man have failed certainly have not be promised either by by one on behalf think be unfortunate said mr monk certainly certainly be not asking a to said duke impatiently man have be injured by indiscreet person acting on behalf in opposition to wish said not word about duchess mr monk doubt knew that grace have be at rate one of indiscreet person applied to for money alleging that have be injured by agent that being so presuming that story be correct did act unconstitutionally think not said mr monk think that circumstance when explained will bear harmless thank thank did not want to trouble about just at present chapter lvii explanation mr monk have be altogether unable to decipher duke purpose in question have asked about hour afterwards walked down to house together mr monk having be kept at office hope be not little short with just now said duke did not find out said mr monk smiling read what be in paper may imagine that be of nature to irritate man knew that one must answer question so correctly a therefore be little eager to keep directly to question occurred to afterwards have be perhaps uncourteous not at duke if be goodness will excuse irritated man if question be asked about in house of common who must be best man to answer must do mr monk considered awhile think said that mr finn must do with better grace of course will do if wish have tact in such matter be known that wife be much regarded by grace will not have duchess name mentioned said duke turning short upon companion did not allude to thought that intimacy existed might make pleasant to to employ mr finn a exponent of wish have greatest confidence in mr finn certainly be on most friendly personal term with will be so if decide on answering question in house on matter so purely personal to must suggest that must have question asked in friendly way get independent member such a mr beverley sir james deering to ask matter must then be brought forward in carping spirit must be enabled through mr finn to set matter at rest have probably spoken to duke about have mentioned to be not that what must recommend old duke have recommended that entire truth must be told that duchess operation must be made public here be poor prime minister great difficulty mentor be at variance mentor be advising that real naked truth must be told whereas telemachus be intent upon keeping name of actual culprit in background will think over said prime minister a two parted company at palace yard that evening spoke to lord cantrip on subject though matter be so odious to must not keep mind from for moment have lord cantrip seen article in people banner lord cantrip like mr monk declared that paper in question did not constitute part of usual morning recreation wo ask to read said duke contains very bitter attack upon bitterest have yet be made suppose ought to notice matter if be said lord cantrip must put into hand of duke of st bungay do exactly what advises there be man in england know so well a doe what must be done in such case a prime minister frowned said nothing dear duke continued lord cantrip can give other advice who be there have personal interest honour at heart so entirely a grace what man can be more sagacious more experienced adviser be thinking that might ask question about in house must do for in manner that must be free from offence if did at must certainly strive to do have never occurred to that must make such suggestion must give few moment to think about must do lord cantrip said afterwards by taking such step even at request must certainly express opinion that matter be one on parliament be entitled to expect that must make explanation own opinion be parliament have business to meddle in matter think that action of minister life must be made matter of inquiry because newspaper may choose to make allusion to at rate if word be said about must think be said in other house duke of st bungay think that something must be said must not myself consent even to appear to desire information on matter so entirely personal to yourself duke bowed smiled with cold glittering uncomfortable smile must sometimes cross face when be not pleased more be then said upon subject attempt be made to have question asked in far different spirit by hostile member of house of common sir orlando drought be sounded for while did give ear to suggestion a came to have matter full before must not do duke have spurned advice a minister have refused to sanction measure a head of branch of government have proposed duke have so offended that conceived bound to regard duke a enemy knew must not escape from knowledge that england did not contain more honourable man than duke be delighted that duke must be vexed thwarted called ill name in matter to be gratified at discomfiture of enemy be in nature of parliamentary opposition blow might weaken opponent be blow in favour be blow must not strike with own hand there be thing in parliamentary tactic even sir orlando must not do arthur fletcher be also asked to undertake task be successful candidate man who have opposed lopez who be declared in people banner to have emancipated that borough by noble conduct from tyranny of house of palliser be thought that might like opportunity of making known in house be simply indignant when suggestion be made to what be to said who paid blackguard expense went on for week after parliament have met for day even after article in direct allusion be made to duchess prime minister must not be got to consent that notice must be taken of matter let paper public say what must must be induced to let matter be handled in manner proposed by elder duke during time be in such fever that about felt that something must be done mr monk suggested that if everybody held tongue meaning duke friend thing must wear out be apparent to who be nearest to minister to mr warburton for instance duke of st bungay that man must be worn out first happy possessor of thick skin can hardly understand how one not so blessed may be hurt by thong of little whip at last matter be arranged at instigation of mr monk sir james deering who be really father of house independent member one who generally voted with coalition consented to ask question in house of common phineas finn be instructed by duke a to answer be to be given duke of omnium in giving instruction made mystery of matter by mean intended be so sore that must not be simple in what said mr finn said must promise that name of duchess will not be mentioned certainly not by if tell that be not to mention one else can do so matter will take form of simple question though conduct of minister may doubt be made subject of debate be not improbable that conduct may do so in instance be think impossible that member must make allusion to wife privilege power of returning member for borough have undoubtedly be exercised by family since a well a previous to reform bill at last election thought right to abandon privilege notified to about intention that man have power of doing can not always do without interference of around there be misconception among adherent there be who injudiciously advised mr lopez to stand on interest did not get interest be beaten therefore when asked for money have spent paid to be think house can hardly avoid to see that effort be made to discontinue unconstitutional proceeding sir james deering asked question trusted said that house must not think that question of have given notice be about to ask be instigated by personal desire on part to inquire into conduct of prime minister be one who believed that duke of omnium be a little likely a man in england to offend by unconstitutional practice on own part great deal have be talked written lately about late election at silverbridge there be who thought be one of that something must be said to stop mouth of caviller with object must ask right honourable gentleman who led house who be perhaps first in standing among noble duke colleague in house whether noble duke be prepared to have statement on subject made house be full to very corner of gallery of course be known to everybody that question be to be asked to be answered there be who thought that matter be so serious that prime minister must not get over others have heard in club lady glen a duchess be still called be to be made scapegoat men of class be open mouthed in denunciation of meanness of lopez though one mr wharton knew villainy a alone knew that expense have be paid twice over in one corner of reporter gallery sat mr slide pencil in hand prepared to revert to old work on so momentous occasion be great day for by own unassisted energy have brought prime minister to book have created turmoil might be happy lot to be mean of turning prime minister out of office be who have watched over nation duchess have be most anxious to be present have not ventured to come without asking husband leave have most peremptorily refused to give can not understand glencora how can suggest such thing have said make so much of everything have replied petulantly have remained at home lady gallery be however quite full mr finn be there of course anxious not only for friend eager to hear how husband must acquit in task wife daughter of minister be there excepting wife of prime minister there never have be in memory of matter be so interesting to for be only matter remembered in woman conduct might probably be called in question in house of common seat appropriated to peer be so crammed that above dozen grey headed old lord be standing in passage divide from common stranger after be not in truth much of affair very little man indeed have calumniated conduct of minister of crown till have be thought well that minister must defend one really believed that duke have committed great offence at worst be no more than indiscretion be noticeable only because prime minister must never be indiscreet have taxation of whole country for next year be in dispute there must have be such interest felt have welfare of indian empire occupied house house must have be empty hope that certain woman name must have to be mentioned crammed from floor to ceiling reader need not be told that name be not mentioned old friend phineas on rising to leg first apologised for doing so in place of chancellor of exchequer perhaps house must accept statement from a noble duke at head of government have asked to make then made statement perhaps said falser accusation than have ever be brought forward against minister of crown for specially charged noble friend with resorting to employment of unconstitutional practice to bolster up parliamentary support whereas be known by everybody that there must have be matter for accusation at have not duke of own motion abandoned recognised privilege because in opinion exercise of privilege be opposed to spirit of constitution have noble duke simply nominated candidate a candidate have be nominated at silverbridge for century past candidate must have be returned with absolute certainty there must have be word spoken on subject be not perhaps for who have honour of serving under grace who a being part of grace government be for time one with grace to expatiate at length on nobility of sacrifice here made knew there at what rate be valued seat in house thank god privilege must not now be rated at money price must not be bought sold privilege noble friend have so magnanimously resigned from purely patriotic motif be believed still in existence must ask few who be still in happy perhaps have better say in envied position of being able to send friend to house what be estimation of conduct of duke in matter might be that there be one two such present who now heard perhaps one two who owed seat to exercise of privilege might marvel at magnitude of surrender might even question sagacity of man who must abandon so much without price hardly thought that even must regard a unconstitutional be what prime minister have done acting not a prime minister a english nobleman in management of own property privilege now must come to gist of accusation made in making thing duke have really done have be altogether ignored when vacancy have be declared by acceptance of chiltern hundred by gentleman whose absence from house regretted duke have signified to agent intention of retiring altogether from exercise of privilege power in matter duke be then a be also now must be to be hoped long continue to be prime minister of england need hardly remind gentleman in house that prime minister be not in position to devote undivided time to management of own property even to interest of borough of silverbridge that grace have be earnest in instruction to agent sequel fully proved that earnestness agent have misinterpreted then there be heard voice in house what agent from voice name for there be present who thought to be shameful that excitement of occasion must be lowered by keeping back allusion to duchess have not distinguished said phineas assuming indignant tone honourable gentleman from whom question have come therefore have le compunction in telling that be part of duty on occasion to gratify morbid indecent curiosity then there be cry of order appeal to speaker certain gentleman wished to know whether indecent be parliamentary speaker with hesitation expressed opinion that word a then used be not open to objection from thought that be within scope of member right to charge member with indecent curiosity if said phineas rising again to leg for have sat down for moment gentleman who called for name will rise in place repeat demand will recall word indecent substitute others will tell that be one who regardless of real conduct of prime minister a man a servant of crown be only anxious to inflict unmanly wound in order that may be gratified by seeing pain inflicts then paused a further question be asked continued statement candidate have be brought forward said by interested in duke affair man whom must not name who trusted must never succeed in ambition to occupy seat in house have be brought forward certain tradesman in silverbridge have be asked to support a duke nominee there be doubt about house perhaps must understand that local adherent neighbour of man so high in rank wealth a duke of omnium must not gladly see privilege of lord diminished perhaps too occurred to that prime minister must not have eye everywhere there must always be worthy men in borough who liked to exercise second hand authority at rate be case that candidate be encouraged then duke have heard have put foot upon little mutiny have stamped out at once might perhaps here said congratulate house on acquisition have received by failure of candidate so far at rate thought must be admitted that duke have be free from blame now came to gravamen of charge gravamen of charge be so well known to reader that simple account phineas gave of need not be repeated duke have paid money when asked for because felt that man have be injured by incorrect representation made to need hardly pause to stigmatise meanness of application said phineas may perhaps conclude by saying that whether last act done by duke in matter be be not indiscreet will probably have house with when say that savour much more strongly of nobility than of indiscretion when phineas finn sat down one arose to say word on subject be afterwards felt that must only have be graceful have sir orlando risen expressed opinion that house have heard statement just made with perfect satisfaction did not do so after short pause ordinary business of day be recommenced then there be speedy descent from gallery lady trooped out of cage grey headed old peer went back to own chamber member quickly jostled out through door mr monk be left to explain proposed

there be nothing more to be said on matter everybody of course knew that duchess have be chief of agent to whom have alluded have known a much a before be however felt by everybody that matter have be brought to end game such a be have be played out perhaps only person who heard mr finn speech throughout still hoped that spark must be again fanned into flame be quintus slide went out wrote article about duchess if man be so unable to rule affair at home be certainly unfit to be prime minister even quintus slide a wrote article felt that be hoping against hope charge might be referred to hereafter a one have never be satisfactorily cleared up game be always open to opponent of minister after lapse of few month old accusation can be serviceably used whether at time be proved disproved mr slide published article felt that for present silverbridge election paper have better be put by among property of people banner brought out if necessary for further use at future time mr finn said

very hard not so hard perhaps a rejection by lady eustace be episode in life of even felt ashamed of be unable to shake disgrace from memory have inner appreciation whatsoever of what be really good what be really bad in man conduct did not know that have done evil in applying to duke for money have only meant to attack duke when money have come have be regarded a justifiable prey when after receiving duke money have kept also mr wharton money have justified again by reminding that mr wharton certainly owed much more than in sense be what be called gentleman knew how to speak how to look how to use knife fork how to dress how to walk have not faintest notion of feeling of gentleman have however very keen conception of evil of being generally ill spoken of even now though be making up mind to leave england for long term of year understood disadvantage of leaving under so heavy cloud understood also that cloud might possibly impede going altogether even in coleman street be looking black upon mr hartlepod went so far a to say to lopez that by jove have put foot in have endeavoured to be courageous under burden day walked into office of mining company endeavouring to look a though have committed fault of have to be ashamed after second day found that nothing be said to of affair of company on fourth day mr hartlepod informed that time allowed for paying up share have passed by that local manager must be appointed time be not over till to morrow said lopez angrily tell what be told to tell said mr hartlepod will only waste time by coming here more have not once seen mr wharton since statement made in parliament although have lived in same house with everett wharton have come home two have met meeting have be stormy seems to lopez that be scoundrel everett said to one day after having heard whole story rather many story from father took place not in manchester square at club where everett have endeavoured to cut brother in law need hardly be said at time lopez be not popular at club on next day meeting of whole club be to be held that propriety of expelling might be discussed have resolved that must not be cowed that must still show still defend conduct did not know however that everett wharton have already made known to committee of club fact of double payment have addressed everett in solicitude to man must never be reduced of seeking to be recognised by at rate one acquaintance now brother in law have called scoundrel in presence of other men raised arm a though to use cane in hand be cowed by feeling that there be adversary how dare use language to said very weakly be language must use if speak to be brother in law that restrains unfortunately be be living in father house that again be misfortune appears difficult to remedy have be told to go wo go ingratitude sir be marvellous who saved life when be attacked in park be too drunk to take care of yourself who have stood friend with close fisted old father when have lost money

chair rang bell loudly for cup of coffee lit cigar have not be turned out of club a yet servant at rate be bound to attend to that night waited up for father in law in manchester square must certainly go to guatemala now if be not too late must go though be forced to leave wife behind thus surrender further hope for money from mr wharton beyond sum must receive a price of banishment be true that fortnight allowed to by company be only at end day that therefore following morning might be taken a last day named for payment of money doubt also mr wharton bill at few day date must be accepted if gentleman must not at moment give cheque for so large sum a be required appointment have be distinctly promised to with other stipulation than that money required for share must be paid did not believe in mr hartlepod threat be impossible thought that must be treated in so infamous manner merely because have have election expense repaid by duke of omnium must therefore ask for money renounce society of wife a made resolve something like real love returned to heart became for while sick with regret assured that have loved that must love still why have not be true to why have clung to father instead of clinging to husband why have not learned way a wife be bound to learn way of man marries why have not helped in device fallen into plan be regardful of fortune made one with there have be present to at time idea that if must take away with to distant country to thought to go thus remove from upas influence of father roof tree must then fall into view become wife indeed then must again be tender to again love again endeavour to make world soft to be too late now for that have failed in everything a far a england be concerned be chiefly by fault that have failed must consent to leave a thought of in solitude eye became moist with regret in day mr wharton never came home till about midnight then passed rapidly through hall to own room in morning have breakfast brought to in same room so that might not even see son in law daughter must go to when at breakfast there together for half hour must endeavour to look forward to future fate hitherto have never be

to be relieved from burden of wife support man must care nothing for wife comfort nothing even a mr wharton believed for wife life must simply use wife a best might a mean for obtaining money there be nothing to be done to buy off by so much money down by so much at stated interval a long a must keep away mr walker must manage be quite clear to mr wharton that guatemala scheme be altogether at end in meantime certain sum must be offered to man at once on condition that must leave house do so without taking wife with so far mr wharton have plan plan be at least feasible wretched a be miserable a thought of fate have befallen daughter there be still prospect of relief lopez a walked out of office have nothing to must look for comfort slowly made way to little tankard yard there found sexty

ill that at time father brother thought that must die when first month six week have passed by must often speak of husband especially to father always speaking of a though have brought to untimely fate must endure at time that father must say word against even when obliged old man to speak of one whose conduct have be so infamous have be doing have not married there must have be misfortune did not say that have be noble true honest asserted that evil have come upon have be produced by dear father said to one evening be matter can not forget on be well that must be silent will always know

plainly than father ever dared to do then also used language be very plain darling said brother once when have be trying to make out that husband have be more sinned against than sinning be bad man be better that truth must be told who be good man said raising in bed looking full in face with deep sunken eye if there be truth in religion be not bad who be to tell shade of difference in badness be not drunkard gambler through be true to wife poor creature be of course ignorant of little scene in little street near may fair in lopez have offered to carry lizzie eustace away with to guatemala be industrious idea about money be not same a yours papa how be worse than others happened that fault be distasteful to so perhaps be virtue fault such a be brought misery must have be successful now if have never seen why must talk of will never agree everett can never understand have passed through mind during last two year there be two three person who attempted to see at period avoided first came mr roby who a nearest neighbour a aunt a aunt who have be so nearly allied to have almost right to demand admittance must not see mr roby sent down word to say that be too ill when mr roby wrote to got father to answer note have better let drop old man said at last to sister in law of course remembers that be who brought together did bring together mr wharton how often be to tell so be everett who brought mr lopez here marriage be made up in house have destroyed child will not quarrel with wife sister if can help at present have better keep apart then have left abruptly mr roby have not dared either to write to call again at time arthur fletcher saw everett mr wharton frequently did not go to square contenting with asking whether might be allowed to do so not yet arthur said old man be sure think of a one of best friend must not see yet must have nothing to fear said arthur knew other when be child must be now only a be then not yet arthur not yet said barrister then there came letter rather two letter from mary wharton one to mr wharton other to emily to tell truth a to letter contained combined wisdom tenderness of wharton hall longbarns a soon a fate of lopez have be ascertained thoroughly discussed in herefordshire there went forth edict emily have suffered punishment sufficient be to be forgiven old mr fletcher did not come to at once having deep seated feeling did not dare to express even to son though muttered to daughter in law that arthur must be disgraced for ever be to marry widow of such man a ferdinand lopez when question of receiving emily back into family favour be mooted in longbarns parliament one alluded to possibility of such marriage there be fact that whom have loved have be freed by great tragedy from husband whom have condemned also knowledge that poor victim have suffered greatly during period of married life mr fletcher have frowned shaken head made little speech about duty of woman necessarily fatal consequence when duty be neglected there be present there with old lady john fletcher wife sir alured lady wharton mary wharton arthur be not in county must discussion have be held in presence can only say said john getting up looking away from mother that will always find home at longbarns when chooses to come here hope sir alured will say same a to wharton hall after john fletcher be king in part mr fletcher with many noddings sobbing have to give way to king john end of be that mary wharton wrote letter in to mr wharton asked whether must not be better that cousin must change scene come at once into country let come stay month at wharton then go on to longbarns might be sure that there must be company in house in june fletcher must go up to town for week then emily might return to wharton hall be long letter mary gave many reason why poor sufferer must be better in country than in town letter to emily be shorter full of affection do do do come know how love let be a used to be always liked country will devote to try comfort emily must not a yet submit to receive devotion even from cousin mary through under though must ever defend husband because be dead knew that have disgraced wharton brought load of sorrow upon fletcher be too proud to be forgiven so quickly then received tender of affection from quarter whence certainly did not expect duchess of omnium wrote to duchess though have lately be considerably restrained by condition of duke mind by effect of own political social mistake still from time to time made renewed effort to keep together coalition by giving dinner ball garden party by binding to herself gratitude worship of young parliamentary aspirant in carrying out plan have lately showered courtesy upon arthur fletcher who have be made welcome even by duke a sitting member for silverbridge with arthur have of course discussed conduct of lopez a to election bill have be very loud in condemning from arthur also have heard something of sorrow of emily lopez arthur have be very desirous that duchess who have received at house must distinguish between husband wife then have come tragedy to notoriety of man conduct of course gave additional interest be believed that lopez have destroyed because of disgrace have fallen upon from silverbridge affair for much of silverbridge affair duchess herself be responsible waited till couple of month have gone by then in beginning of may sent to widow what be intended to be indeed be very kind note duchess have heard sad story with greatest grief hoped that mr lopez must permit to avail herself of short acquaintance to express sincere sympathy must not venture to call a yet hoped that before long might be allowed to come to manchester square note touched poor woman to whom be written not because be solicitous to be acquainted with duchess of omnium because application seemed to to contain something like acquittal at rate pardon of husband sin in measure of silverbridge election sin father have be loud in denouncing before wretch have destroyed have be especially against duke of omnium now duchess came forward to say that must be forgiven forgotten when showed letter to father asked what must say in answer to only shook head be meant for kindness papa yes think be there be people who have right to be kind to if man stopped in street offered crown might be kindness want man half crown think be same papa there be reason here perhaps so dear see reason became very red even to must not explain idea think will answer certainly answer compliment to duchess thank for kind inquiry say will come here must not notice very well papa if think so of course will not perhaps must be inconvenience if be really to come on next day did write note not quite so cold a father proposed still saying nothing a to offered visit felt said very grateful for duchess kind remembrance of duchess must perhaps understand at present sorrow overwhelmed there be one other tender of kindness be more surprising than even that from duchess reader may perhaps remember that ferdinand lopez lady eustace have not parted when last saw other on pleasantest term have be very affectionate when have proposed to devote whole life to to carry off to guatemala have simply told that be fool then have escaped from house have never again seen lizzie eustace have not thought very much about have returned to next day with more tempting proposition for making money must have listened to have begged pardon for what have taken place on former day must have merely laughed be not more offended than must have be have asked for half fortune instead of person honour a be have escaped have never again shown in little street near may fair then have tidings of death first seeing account in very sensational article from pen of mr quintus slide be immediately filled with intense interest be infinitely increased by fact that man have few day before declared to be lover be bringing almost a near to event a though have seen be perhaps entitled to think that have caused nay in one sense have caused for certainly must not have destroyed have consented to go with to guatemala elsewhere knew wife uninteresting dowdy creature have called nevertheless have be in company together more than once so presented compliment expressed sorrow hoped that might be allowed to call there have be no one for whom have felt more sincere respect esteem than for late friend mr ferdinand lopez to note there be sent answer written by mr wharton madam daughter be too ill to see even own friend be madam obedient servant abel wharton after life went on in very quiet way at manchester square for many week gradually mr lopez recovered capability of attending to duty of life gradually became again able to interest herself in brother pursuit in father comfort house returned to old form a have be before terrible two year in happiness of wharton fletcher family have be marred scotched almost destroyed for ever by interference of ferdinand lopez mr lopez never for moment forgot that have done mischief that black enduring cloud have be created solely by own perversity self will though must still defend late husband if attack be made upon memory not le did feel that hers have be fault though punishment have come upon chapter lxii phineas finn have book to read sensation created by man death be by mean confined to manchester square be very general in metropolis indeed throughout country a catastrophe became subject of general conversation many people learned that silverbridge affair have not in truth have much to do with man have killed a many other men have done before because have run through money have chance left of redeeming to world at large disgrace brought upon by explanation given in parliament be apparent cause of self immolation there be not wanting who felt expressed sympathy for man who must feel so acutely effect of own wrong doing doubt have done wrong in asking duke for money request though wrong might almost be justified there must be doubt apologist said that have be ill treated between duke duchess doubt phineas finn who be now described by opponent a duke creature have be able to make out story in duke favour world knew what be worth be truth of ministerial explanation coalition be very strong even question in house must have be hostile have be asked in friendly spirit in way there came to be party who spoke wrote of ferdinand lopez a though have be martyr of course mr quintus slide be in front rank of accuser may be said to have led little army made matter pretext for special attack upon ministry mr slide be especially hostile to prime minister be not le hotly enemy of phineas finn against phineas finn have old grudge however age have never cooled must therefore write with most powerful pen when discussing death of unfortunate man late candidate for silverbridge crushing two foe in single grasp of journalistic fist phineas have certainly said hard thing against lopez though have not mentioned man name have congratulated house that have not be contaminated by presence of so base creature have said that must not pause to stigmatise meanness of application for money lopez have made have lopez continued to live to endure sling arrow of outrageous fortune one must have ventured to say that word must have inflicted too severe punishment death wipe out many fault self inflicted death caused by remorse will in mind of many wash blackamoor almost white thus came to pas that heavy weapon be hurled at phineas finn none so heavy a hurled by quintus slide must not irish knight who be so ready with lance in defence of prime minister asked mr slide have remembered past event of own rather peculiar life have not too be poor driven in poverty to rather questionable strait have not be abject in petition for office in what degree be such petition le disgraceful than request for money have be hopelessly expended on impossible object attempted at instance of great croesus who when asked to pay have at once acknowledged necessity of doing so must not mr finn remember that have stood in danger of life before british jury that though have be no doubt properly acquitted of crime imputed to circumstance have come out against during trial if not a criminal be at rate almost a disgraceful must not have have mercy on broken political adventurer who in aspiration for public life have shown none of greed by mr phineas finn have be characterised in relation of life a for prime minister a mr quintus slide always described wish to add to agony fate of mr lopez must have brought upon have hounded that poor man to death in revenge for trifling sum of money be called on to pay for may be that first blame lay not with prime minister with prime minister wife with have nothing to do whole thing lie in nutshell bare mention of name of grace duchess in parliament must have saved duke at rate a effectually a have be saved by service of man of work phineas finn must have saved without driving poor ferdinand lopez to insanity rather than do allowed servant to make statement about mysterious agent be justified in stigmatizing a untrue to throw whole blame where least of blame be due know result be found in gory shred tatter of poor human being with tenway railway station be bespattered of course such article have considerable effect be apparent at once that there be ample room for action for libel against newspaper on part of phineas finn if not on of duke be equally apparent that mr quintus slide must have be very well aware of when wrote article such action even if successful may bring with to man punished more of good than of evil pecuniary penalty might be more than recouped by largeness of advertisement action must produce mr slide doubt calculated that must carry with great body of public feeling by mere fact that have attacked prime minister duke if must only get publican in london to take paper because of patriotic bold conduct fortune of paper must be made there be better trade than of martyrdom if must be martyr know how far may judiciously go in what direction mr quintus slide be supposed to have considered very well phineas finn knew that enemy have also considered nature of matter must have be able to drag into court if there must be trial allusion very strong allusion have be made to former period of mr finn life though there be little if anything in past circumstance of be ashamed little if anything thought must subject personally to odium of good men must be made accurately known in detail must be well aware be impossible that such accuracy must be achieved story if told inaccurately must not suit then there be reason against public proceeding much stronger even than whether telling of story must must not suit certainly must not suit others a have be before remarked there be former chronicle respecting phineas finn in may be found adequate cause for conviction on part to outsider be history known better than to mr quintus slide therefore mr quintus slide must dare almost to defy law not le on account be there many who told phineas that ought to bring action among none be more eager than old friend lord chiltern master of brake hound man who really loved phineas who also loved abstract idea of justice who must not endure thought that miscreant must go unpunished hunting be over for season in brake country lord chiltern rushed up to london having object among others of very pressing nature on mind saddler have to be seen threatened on certain matter touching horse back draught of hound be being sent down to friend in scotland there be committee of master to sit on moot question concerning neutral covert in xxx country of committee be one desire to punish slide be almost a strong in indignant mind a other matter referring more especially to profession of life phineas said be bound to do if will allow fellow like to say such thing of why by heaven man may say anything of anybody now phineas must hardly explain to lord chiltern objection to proposed action lady be closely concerned lady be lord chiltern sister certainly will not said phineas why just because wish to do must be falling into little pit that have dug for must hurt have got to be afraid of ruat coelum there be certain angel chiltern living up in heaven wish to pull about ear a to whom if heart wish doings must be known nothing praise must be spoken who must still be dragged with soiled wing through dirt if man be empowered to bring witness after witness into court wife must be named for aught know wife by g 'd find wrong there leave chimney sweep alone when see chiltern must run against then remember that be one of necessary penalty of clean linen that be apt to be soiled be d d if 'd let off yes must old fellow when come to see clearly what must gain what must lose must not meddle with wife be at first inclined to think that action must be taken be more easily convinced than lord chiltern have not thought said of poor lady laura be not horrible that man must be able to go on like that there must be punishment in answer to only shrugged shoulder greatest pressure came upon from source did not in truth suffer much from what be said in people banner have become used to people banner have found out that in relation of life be le pleasantly situated because of malediction heaped upon in column of newspaper position in public life did not seem to be weakened by personal friend did not fall off because of who loved did not love le have not be so with always now at last be hardened against mr quintus slide poor duke be by mean equally strong attack upon denunciation of cruelty assurance that have caused death of ferdinand lopez be very grievous to be not that really felt to be guilty of man blood that one must say that be guilty be of use to point out to that other newspaper have sufficiently vindicated conduct in respect that be already publicly known that lopez have received payment for election expense from mr wharton before application have be made to that therefore man dishonesty be patent to world be equally futile to explain to that man last act have be in degree caused by what have be said in parliament have be result of continued failure in life final absolute ruin fretted fumed be very wretched at last expressed opinion that legal step must be taken to punish people banner now have be already acknowledged on dictum of le man than sir gregory grogram attorney general that action for libel if taken at must be taken not on part of prime minister on of phineas finn sir timothy beeswax have indeed doubted have come to be understood by member of coalition that sir timothy beeswax always did doubt whatever be said by sir gregory grogram duke think that something must be done said mr warburton duke private secretary to phineas finn not by hope said phineas nobody else can do be to say must be done in name of course must be government matter a far a expense go be duke must think so see that must hurt be sorry duke must think so repeated phineas because nothing can be done in name have made up mind about think duke be wrong in wishing believe be action taken must only be playing into hand of wretched fellow quintus slide have long be conversant with mr quintus slide have quite made up mind will never play upon pipe may tell duke that there be other reason man have referred to past life in seeking to justify remark must be enabled to drag before public circumstance story perhaps person in manner personally must disregard for sake of others be bound to prevent will explain to duke be afraid will find duke very urgent must then express great sorrow can not oblige duke trust need hardly say that duke have colleague more devoted to interest than be be to wish to change office to abandon to undertake political duty within compass of small power must find ready to obey behest in matter others be concerned can not make judgment subordinate to private secretary looked very serious simply said that must do best to explain objection to grace that duke must take refusal in bad part phineas felt nearly certain have be little surprised at coldness of minister manner to after statement have made in house have mentioned matter to wife hardly know have said a well a do certainly not ought to know very intimately have have little personal friendship with be moment in man might for moment have be cordial be not moment for cordiality duchess say that if want to get really genial smile from must talk to about cork sol know exactly what mean love to be simple doe not know how to show people that like lady rosina found out by accident suppose be in least aggrieved have said now spoke again to wife in same spirit warburton clearly think that will be offended warburton suppose know mind see why must have be reading longer still find very difficult lady glen have be at work for last fifteen year sometimes owns that there be passage have not mastered yet fancy mr warburton be afraid of be little given to fancy that everybody must bow down to now if there be anything certain about duke be that doe want one to bow down to hate bowing down think love who oppose be not opposition hate cause in man mind may produce when sir orlando opposed thought that sir orlando opposition be founded on jealousy then despised sir orlando have believed in sir orlando belief in new ship must have be capable of pressing sir orlando to bosom although might have be forced to oppose sir orlando ship in cabinet be sir bayard to said phineas laughing rather don quixote whom take to have be better man of two will tell what be phineas how be better than real knight of whom have ever read in story be man altogether without guile entirely devoted to country quarrel with if can help phineas have not slightest desire to quarrel with chief did think to be not improbable that chief must quarrel with be notorious to a member of cabinet a colleague living with other colleague by whom prime minister be coddled especially a husband of wife who lived almost continually with prime minister wife that duke be cut to quick by accusation that have hounded ferdinand lopez to death prime minister have defended in house against first charge by mean of phineas finn now required phineas to defend from second charge in way be obliged to refuse to do then minister private secretary looked very grave left with impression that duke must be much annoyed if not offended already there have grown up idea that duke must have on list of colleague none who be personally disagreeable to though be by mean strong minister in regard to political measure proper dominion of party still men be afraid of be not that must call upon to resign that if aggrieved must resign sir orlando drought have rebelled have tried fall with prime minister have greatly failed phineas determined that if frowned upon must resign that certainly must bring action for libel against people banner week passed after have seen warburton before by chance found alone with prime minister occurred at house in carlton garden at be frequent visitor must hardly have ceased to be so without being noticed a wife spent half time there be evident to then that occasion be sought for by duke mr finn said duke wanted to have word two with certainly said phineas arresting step warburton spoke to about newspaper yes duke seemed to think that there must be action for libel thought so too be very bad know yes be bad have known 'people banner ' for time be always bad doubt doubt be bad very bad be not sad that there must be such dishonesty that nothing can be done to stop say that wo hear of action in name there be reason duke doubt doubt well there be end of own think man must be punished be not often vindictive think that must be punished however suppose can not be see way so be so be must be entirely for to judge be not longing to get into country mr finn hardly yet said phineas surprised be only june have two month more of be use of longing yet two month more said duke two month certainly even two month will come to end go down to matching quietly very quietly when time doe come must promise that will come with eh make point of mr finn phineas did promise thought that have succeeded in mastering one of difficult passage in book chapter lxiii duchess friend duke though be by far too magnanimous to be angry with phineas finn because phineas must not fall into view respecting proposed action be not le tormented goaded by what newspaper said assertion that have hounded ferdinand lopez to death that by defence of have brought man blood on head be made repeated till around did not dare to mention name of lopez in hearing even wife be restrained became fearful in heart of heart began almost to wish for retirement to have occasionally alluded a distant elysium must never be allowed to reach be beginning to have worn look of old man scanty hair be turning grey long thin cheek longer thinner of what did when sitting alone in chamber at home at treasury chamber knew le le from day to day began to think that much of sorrow arose from fact that among must allow to hing there be special subject now stirred to eagerness brought upon explanation be tedious unintelligible to evidently delightful to there be quint semi tenth now aspiration for decimal perfection delightfully fatiguing hour spent in manipulation of multiplication table must not observe that old duke now spoke to much le frequently of husband political position than have be habit through first year half of present ministerial arrangement have be constant in advice to have always even when thing be difficult be cheery full of hope still came frequently to house did not often see when did see seemed to avoid allusion to political success political revers of coalition even other special ally seemed to labour under unusual restraint with barrington erle seldom told news mr rattler never have word for warburton who have ever be discreet became almost petrified by discretion even phineas finn have grown to be solemn silent uncommunicative have heard who be new prime minister said to mr finn one day have there be change suppose so everything have become so quiet that can not imagine that plantagenet be still in office do know what anybody be doing world be going on very smoothly take hate smoothness always mean treachery danger feel sure that there will be great blow up before long smell in air tremble for husband why must like being in office because give something to do must never be idle man a long a have seat in parliament will be contented to have be prime minister be something after ca rob of said duchess recurring again to own husband half fancy sometimes that charm of thing be growing upon upon duke yes be always talking of delight will have in giving up be always cincinnatus going back to peach plough fear be beginning to feel that salt must be gone out of life if ceased to be first man in kingdom have never said so there be nervousness about when suggest to name of man a successor alarm think be becoming tyrant with own men spoke other day of lord drummond almost a though meant to have whipped be what one expected from be weight of load on mind make irritable having load if have really much to do must surely have time to think so much of poor wretch who destroyed such sensitiveness be simply disease one can never punish fault in world if sinner can revenge upon by rushing into eternity sometimes see shiver shudder then know that be thinking of lopez can understand lady glen be a must be though can understand will bet guinea sir timothy beeswax have to go out before beginning of next session have objection why sir timothy mentioned lopez ' name other day before plantagenet heard plantagenet pulled that long face of looking a though meant to impose silence on whole world for next six week sir timothy be brass sounding cymbal of brass that nothing can silence went on to declare with loud voice of that death of lopez be good riddance of bad rubbish plantagenet turned away left room shut up did declare to that 'd dismiss sir timothy because be not way of mind will see that sir timothy will have to go at rate will be good riddance of bad rubbish said mr finn who did not love sir timothy beeswax soon after that duchess made up mind that must interrogate duke of st bungay a to present state of affair be then end of june nearly one of long tedious month have gone by of duke spoke so feelingly when asked phineas finn to come down to matching hope have be expressed in more than one quarter that must be short session such hope be much more common in june than in july though rarely verified serve to keep up drooping spirit of languid senator suppose will be early out of town duke said one day think so see what there be to keep often happens that minister be great deal better in country than in london fancy will be so year never think of poor girl who have got husband yet must make better use of time besides can get husband in country be quite true that never get to end of labour be not like member of parliament who can shut up portfolio go shoot grouse have to keep at work spring summer autumn winter year after year how must hate men persecute think can put off going for sake men be always selfish know what do think of plantagenet lately question be put very abruptly without moment notice there be avoiding think of yes what do think of condition of happiness health capacity of endurance will be able to go on much longer now dear duke stare at like that know know that have spoken word to for last two month know know how many thing there be of be thinking in common have quarrelled with plantagenet quarrelled with good heaven of course know still call noble colleague noble friend make one of same team with used to be so much more than that be still more than very much more be who made prime minister again no made prime minister by obtaining confidence of house of common there be other possible way in man can become prime minister in country if be not very serious at moment duke must make allusion to marine other human being must have said to duke of st bungay except young woman whom have petted life a lady glencora be very serious continued may say not very happy of course big wig of party have to settle among who will be leader when party be formed settled at advice that plantagenet must be man dear lady glen can not allow to pas without contradiction suppose be finding fault even that be ungrateful one rejoiced a rejoiced one still feel so much pride in a feel must have given ten year of life to make prime minister now must give five to keep so be like be to be king when men struggled among who must be king whatever may be be ambitious love to think that other men must look to a being above that something of must come down upon a wife know whether be not happiest moment of life when told that queen have sent for be not so with duke no be very different only want to be useful at rate be did want be still same man can not always be carrying huge load up hill without having back bent know that load need be so heavy duchess ah what be load be not going to treasury chamber at eleven twelve in morning sitting four five time week in house of lord till seven eight o'clock be never ill when must remain in house of common till two in morning not have decent dinner above twice in week load speak of be work what be then said duke who in truth understood nearly a well a duchess herself be hard to explain be very heavy responsibility dear will always be heavy be hardly that certainly not that alone be feeling so many people blame for so many thing doubt in own mind whether may not deserve then becomes fretful conscious that such fretfulness be beneath injurious to honour condemns men in mind condemns for condescending to condemn spends one quarter of hour in thinking that a be prime minister will be prime minister down to finger end next in resolving that never ought to have be prime minister at here something like frown passed across old man brow be however indication of anger dear duke said must not be angry with who be there to whom can speak angry dear indeed because looked a though must scold at smiled of course tell upon health do think be ill never say so there be special illness be thin wan careworn doe not eat doe not sleep of course watch doe doctor see never when asked once to say word to sir james thorax for be getting hoarse know only shook head turned on heel when be in other house speaking night must see thorax

for week two must come be quite nervous if desert think becomes more estranged day from others know wo do mischief by repeating what say hope not seems to to turn nose up at everybody used to like mr monk envy monk because mr monk be chancellor of exchequer asked whether must have lord drummond at matching told angrily that might ask government if liked drummond contradicted other day knew there be something have got to be like bear with sore head duke must have seen face other day when mr rattler made suggestion to about proper way of dividing farm think ever liked rattler what of have to smile upon men whom hate like poison woman too be worse do think that love old lady ramsden mr macpherson used to be so fond of lord cantrip think like lord cantrip said duke asked lordship to do

mr finn must never be harsh to mr finn because know that mr finn be one really intimate female friend whom have in world after duke besides plantagenet child there be only two person in world whom really love there be only will never desert must not desert either then put hand behind waist stooped over kissed brow swore to that must never desert what be to do knew without being told by duchess that colleague chief be becoming from day to day more difficult to manage have be right enough in laying down a general rule that prime minister be selected for position by general confidence of house of common be aware at same time that have hardly be so in present instance there have come to be dead lock in affair during of two old well recognised leader of party must command sufficient following for carrying on of government with unusual patience two gentleman have now for greater part of three session sat by offering little opposition to coalition of course biding time too called perhaps thought cincinnatus plough peach did not suffice to longed again to be in mouth to have if not deed then even omission blazoned in paragraph palate accustomed to cayenne pepper can hardly be gratified by simple salt when dead lock have come politician who be really anxious for country have be forced to look about for premier in search old duke have be foremost duchess have hardly said more than truth when declared that husband promotion have be effected by old friend be sometimes easier to make than to unmake perhaps time have now in truth come in must be better for country that usual state of thing must again exist perhaps nay duke now thought that saw that be so mr gresham might again have liberal majority at back if duke of omnium must find graceful mode of retiring who be to tell to duke of omnium there be only one man in england to whom task be possible be old duke who during last two year have be constantly urgent with friend not to retire how often since have taken office have conscientious timid minister begged of friend permission to abandon high office that permission have always be refused now for last three month request have not be repeated duchess probably be right in saying that husband did want to give up now duke of st bungay have brought friend into trouble be certainly duty to extricate from admonition might come in rude shape of repeated minority in house of common hitherto number of vote at command of ministry have not be very much impaired few always fall off a time go on aristides becomes too just mind of man be greedy of novelty sir orlando also have taken with few may be that two three have told that there must not be smoke raised by people banner without fire below there be good working majority very much at mr monk command mr monk be moved by none of feeling of rebellion have urged sir orlando on to destruction be difficult to find cause for resignation yet duke of st bungay who have watched house of common closely for nearly century be aware that coalition have created have done work be almost convinced that must not be permitted to remain very much longer in power have seen symptom of impatience in mr daubeny mr gresham have snorted once twice a though eager for battle chapter lxiv new kg early in june have died marquis of mount fidgett in england there be older family than of fichy fidgetts whose baronial castle of fichy fellow be still kept up glory of archaeologist charm of tourist people declare to be most perfect castle residence in country be admitted to have be completed in time of edward vi be thought to have be commenced in day of edward have always belonged to fichy fidgett family who with persistence be becoming rarer day have clung to acre that ever owned have added acre to acre in age consequence have be that existing marquis of mount fidgett have always be possessed of great territorial influence have be flattered cajoled revered by one prime minister after now late marquis have be a be custom with fichy fidgetts man of pleasure if truth may be spoken openly must be admitted that have be man of sin duty of keeping together family property have performed with perfect zeal have always be acknowledged on behalf of existing marquis that in manner might spend money however base might be gully into wealth descended never spent more than have to spend perhaps there be little praise in a must hardly have got beyond enormous income unless have thrown away on race course roulette table have long be remarked of mount fidgett marquis that be too wise to gamble family have not be honour to country have nevertheless be honoured by country man who have just died have perhaps be a selfish a sensual brute a have ever disgraced humanity nevertheless have be knight of garter have be possessed of considerable parliamentary interest prime minister of day have not dared not to make knight of garter marquis of mount fidgett have for many year past be knight of garter on last occasion good deal have be said about feeling have even then begun to prevail that highest personal honour in gift of crown must not be bestowed upon man whose whole life be disgrace who did indeed seem to deserve punishment human divine wrath must inflict have large family be illegitimate wife generally liked of own wife very soon broke heart of company with consorted be admitted king subject must do man honour castle of fichy fellow be visited by world at large man woman with character to lose went into house really inhabited by marquis yet have become knight of garter be therefore presumably one of noble englishman to whom majesty of day be willing to confide honour glory safety of crown there be many who disliked that base reprobate must become marquis peer of parliament be in accordance with constitution of country marquis peer be not a rule reprobate misfortune be one must not be avoided might have ill used own wife other wife husband without special remark have not be made knight of garter minister of day however have known value of man support being thick skinned have lived through reproach uttered without much damage to now wicked marquis be dead be privilege duty of duke of omnium to select knight there be good deal said about at time there be rumour doubt false rumour that crown insisted in instance on dictating choice to duke of omnium even be so duke must not have be very much aggrieved a choice dictated be supposed to be that of late duke have be knight when have died be thought that successor must succeed also to ribbon new duke have be at time in cabinet have remained there have accepted office inferior in rank to have formerly filled whole history of thing have be written may be read by curious duchess newly duchess then very keen in reference to husband rank have instigated to demand ribbon a right have not only declined to do have gone out of way to say that thought must be bestowed elsewhere have be bestowed elsewhere there have be very general feeling that have be passed over because easy temperament in such matter have be seen utilised now whether crown interfered not matter on one short of writer of newspaper article dare to make suggestion till time will have made mellow doings of sovereign minister suggestion be made duke of st bungay ventured to say to friend that other selection be possible recommend majesty to give to said prime minister will find to be majesty wish have be very common sir robert walpole have be not sir robert walpole duke named other example of prime minister who have be gartered by prime minister declared to be out of question honour of description must be conferred upon a long a held present position old duke be much in earnest there be great deal said on subject at last became clear not only to to member of cabinet generally then to outside world that prime minister must not consent to accept vacant honour for nearly month after question subsided minister be not bound to bestow garter day after becomes vacant there be other knight to guard throne one may be spared for short interval during interval many eye be turned towards stall in st george chapel good thing must be given away like clap of thunder if envy hatred malice be to be avoided broad blue ribbon across chest be of decoration most becoming at rate most desired there be fear impression on mind of men that duke in such matter be weak might be persuaded then there came to application in form of letter from new marquis of mount fidgett man whom have never seen of whom have never heard new marquis have hitherto resided in italy men only knew of that be odious to uncle have inherited fichy fidgett estate be now possessed of immense wealth great honour ventured said to represent to prime minister for generation past marquis of mount fidgett have be honoured by garter political status in country be exactly that enjoyed by late uncle intended that political career must be very different be quite prepared to support coalition what be that must expect to be made knight of garter said duke to old duke be marquis of mount fidgett next to perhaps richest peer of great britain have rich anything to do with something certainly must not name pauper peer yes if be man whose career have be highly honourable to country man of course must not be pauper think want of wealth must stand in way of being honoured by garter wealth rank territorial influence have be generally thought to have something to do with character nothing dear duke have not said so something very much like friend if advocate claim of marquis of mount fidgett did approve of selection of late marquis be in cabinet at time will therefore say nothing against have never heard anything against man character in favour of to thinking have a much claim more a man who just opened door be never seen in lower house surely that can not signify think then that must have know what think said elder statesman thoughtfully in opinion there be doubt that must best consult honour of country by allowing majesty to bestow act of grace upon subject who have deserved so well from majesty a yourself be quite impossible seems to said duke not appearing to notice refusal of friend that in peculiar position must allow to be persuaded to lay aside own feeling man of high character be desirous of securing to decoration may bestow upon others just so here decoration bestowed upon chief whom follow must confer wider honour upon many than must do if given to one else same may be said of prime minister not so commoner without high permanent rank large fortune be not lowered in world esteem by not being of order will permit to say that duke of omnium have not reached that position ought to enjoy unless be knight of garter must be borne in mind that old duke who used argument have worn ribbon for last thirty year if well well if be must call obstinate be obstinate in respect then said duke of st bungay must recommend majesty to give to marquis never said prime minister with very unaccustomed energy will never sanction payment of such price for service must never be bought sold must give offence be not enough friend here be man of whom only know that have bought great many marble statue have done nothing for country nothing for sovereign if be determined to look to what call desert alone must name lord drummond prime minister frowned looked unhappy be quite true that lord drummond have contradicted that have felt injury grievously lord drummond have be very true to yes true to what be that be in respect man of character well looked upon in country there must be enmity good deal of envy might be avoided by of course have proposed course will not take take for granted that be anxious to secure support of who generally act with lord drummond know that be old duke shrugged shoulder what mean be that think that ought to pay increased price for support lordship be very well a head of office be not nearly so great man a friend lord cantrip cantrip must not join there be evil in politics so great a of seeming to buy men who will not come without buying reward be fairly given for political support have not in truth thought of lord cantrip doe not expect more than butler only named a having claim stronger than lord drummond can put forward have man in mind to whom think honour be fairly due what do say to lord earlybird old duke opened mouth lifted up hand in unaffected surprise earl of earlybird be old man of very peculiar character have never opened mouth in house of lord have never sat in house of common political world knew not at all have house in town very rarely lived there early park in parish of bird have be residence since first came to title forty year ago have be scene of labour be nobleman possessed of moderate fortune a men said of of moderate intellect have married early in life be blessed with large family have certainly not be idle man for nearly century have devoted to improvement of labouring class especially in reference to abode education have gradually without desire on own part worked up into public notice be not eloquent man must take chair at meeting after meeting sit with admirable patience for long hour to hear eloquence of others be man very simple in taste have brought up family to follow habit have therefore be able to do munificent thing with moderate mean in long course of year have failed in hiding munificence from public lord earlybird till after middle life have not be much considered gradually there have grown up feeling that there be not very many better men in country be fat bald headed old man who be always pulling spectacle on off nearly blind very awkward altogether indifferent to appearance probably have more idea of garter in own mind than have of cardinal hat have grown into fame have not escaped notice of prime minister do know anything against lord earlybird asked prime minister certainly nothing against duke anything in favour know very well think may say intimately there be better man breathing honour to peerage said prime minister honour to humanity rather said other a being of men least selfish most philanthropical what more can be said of man according to view be not sort of person whom one must wish to see made knight of garter if have ribbon must never wear honour surely doe not consist in outward sign be entitled to wear kind of coronet walk about with on head be man of great heart of many virtue surely country majesty on behalf of country must delight to honour man really doubt whether look at matter in right light said ancient statesman who be in truth frightened at what be being proposed must not be angry with if speak plainly friend think that be within power to make angry well then will get for moment to listen to view on matter there be certain great prize in gift of crown of minister of crown greatest of be now traditionally at disposal of prime minister be always given to party friend may perhaps agree with that party support must not be looked to alone let acknowledge that character service must be taken into account very theory of government will be overset by reversal of rule have attempted to describe will offend own friend only incur ridicule of opponent be doubt desirable that high seat of country must be filled by men of party must not wish to see lord lieutenant of county whig in enthusiasm old duke went back to old phraseology know that opponent when turn come will appoint friend to lieutenancy so balance will be maintained if appoint friend wo appoint ours lord earlybird proxy have be in hand of conservative leader of house of lord ever since succeeded father then old man paused friend waited to listen whether lecture be finished before spoke duke of st bungay continued moreover though lord earlybird be very good man so much so that many of may well envy be not just man fitted for destination knight of garter must be man prone to show public man one whose work in country have brought face to face with fellow there be aptness propriety fitness in thing one can understand perhaps better than explain fitness aptness change think from day to day there be time when knight must be fighting man have gone by aptness fitness in accordance with sovereign of day be induced to grace with garter man a late marquis of mount fidgett have hope gone by will admit that there be such man proposed other fitness aptness will go by till time will come when man to be selected a lieutenant of county will be man whose selection will be most beneficial to county knight of garter will be chosen for real virtue think be quixotic prime minister be of men bound to follow tradition of country when leaf to leave with very gradual step if break that law throw over thraldom what then will lose confidence have made what be be well that know penalty be hardly heavy enough to enforce strict obedience a for matter in dispute have better stand over yet for few day when prime minister said old duke knew very well that intended to have own way so be week passed by then younger duke wrote to elder duke saying that have given to matter consideration in power that have at last resolved to recommend majesty to bestow ribbon on lord earlybird must not however take step for few day so that friend might have opportunity of making further remonstrance if pleased further remonstrance be made lord earlybird much to own amazement be nominated to vacant garter appointment be one certainly not popular with of prime minister friend with such a lord drummond indicated determination on part of duke to declare freedom from bond have hitherto be binding on head of government have duke selected certainly offence must have be given have marquis of mount fidgett be happy man excuse must have be made be unpardonable to lord drummond that must have be passed over that garter must have be given to lord earlybird to poor old duke offence be of different nature have intended to use very strong word when told friend that proposed conduct must be quixotic duke of omnium must surely know that duke of st bungay must not support quixotic prime minister yet younger duke telemachus of last two year after hearing that word have rebelled against mentor have obstinately adhered to quixotism greed of power have fallen upon man so said dear old duke to man fall be certain ala ala have be allowed to go before poison have entered vein how much le must have be suffering chapter lxv there must be time at end of third week in july when session be still sitting when day have be absolutely a yet fixed for escape of member mr wharton received letter from friend arthur fletcher certainly surprised very much left for day two unable to decide what answer ought to be given will be remembered that ferdinand lopez destroyed in march now three month since act have be more than nine day wonder having be kept in memory of many men by sedulous effort of quintus slide by fact that name of so great man a prime minister be concerned in matter gradually feeling about ferdinand lopez have died away fate though have outlived nominal nine day have sunk into general oblivion before end of ninth week prime minister have not forgotten man have quintus slide name be still common in column of people banner be never mentioned without being read by unfortunate duke others have ceased to talk of ferdinand lopez to mind however of arthur fletcher fact of man death be always present dreadful incubus have come upon life blighting prospect obscuring sun by great cloud covering up hope changing for outlook into world be not only that emily wharton must not have become wife that woman whom loved with so perfect love must have be sacrificed to so vile creature a man never blamed looked upon fate a fate then on sudden heard that incubus be removed man who have made wretched have by sudden stroke be taken away annihilated there be nothing now between memory must certainly forgive if must forget of course have felt at first moment that time must pas by have become certain that mad love for man have perished have be made sure that have repented own deed in sackcloth ash have be acknowledged to by father that have be anxious to be separated from husband if husband must consent to separation then remembering a did last interview with having in mind a did circumstance of caress have given down to very quiver of finger have pressed must not flatter that at last have touched heart there must be time convention of world operate on heart especially on female heart teach new vow too quickly given be disgraceful world have seemed to decide that widow must take two year before can bestow on second man without touch of scandal two year be to include everything courtship of second a well a burial of first not only courtship preparation of dress wedding then case be different from others of course there must be time surely not here full period of two year why must life of two young person be so wasted if be case that loved other there be horror here remorse pity perhaps pardon there be love none of love be always for time increased in fervour by loss of loved object none of passionate devotion must at first make very idea of man love intolerable there have be great escape escape must not be inwardly acknowledged however little prone tongue might be to confess of course there must be time how much time argued in mind daily at daily argument time considered by to be appropriate be shortened three month have passed have not yet seen have resolved that must not even attempt to see till father must consent surely period have passed sufficient to justify in applying for permission then bethought that must be best in applying for permission to tell everything to mr wharton well knew that must be telling secret mr wharton knew state of feeling a well a knew if ever there be case in time might be abridged be one therefore wrote letter a follows court temple th july dear mr wharton be matter of great regret to that must see so little of other especially of regret must never now see emily may a well rush into matter at once of course letter will not be shown to therefore may write a must speak if be with wretched man whom married be gone love for be same a be before have ever seen a have always be from day to must not address even think of a yet did not know that marriage have be unfortunate have not altered to in least have be dreadful trouble to to to to to connected with be over think that must be looked back upon a black chasm have bridged got over to need never cast back eye have right to think that though might day love man must therefore love think have right to try know must have good will be question of time if let time go by one else may slip in who can tell must not be thought to press indecently do feel that here ordinary rule govern men woman be not to be followed made unhappy almost from first day have made mistake acknowledged have be punished so have very severely can assure must be good thing to bring to end a soon a possible if can be brought to end in way want pray tell what think must propose that must ask to see then say just a much a please of course must not press at first might ask to dinner kind of thing so must get used to be not a though have not be very very old friend know will do best have put off writing to till sometimes think that will go mad over if sit still longer affectionate friend arthur fletcher when mr wharton got letter be very much puzzled must have have wish too must have left chasm behind a proposed by young friend have never cast eye back upon frightful abyss must willingly have allowed whole lopez incident to be passed over a episode in life if must not be forgotten must at rate never be mentioned have be severely punished a fletcher have said if matter must end there must be well content to bear on own shoulder remained of punishment to let everything begin again knew very well must not be so with even yet be impossible to induce emily to think of husband without regret have be only too manifest during last year of married life that have felt horror rather than love towards when there have be question of leaving behind must go to central america have always expressed more than willing to comply with such arrangement must go with must order to do so must infinitely sooner remain in england then too have spoken of while alive with disdain disgust have submitted to hear father describe a infamous life have be one long misery under have seemed gradually to be perishing now be relieved health be re established certain amount of unjoyous cheerfulness be returning to be impossible to doubt that must have known that great burden have fallen from back yet must never allow name to be mentioned without giving outward sign of affection for memory if be bad so be others bad there be many worse than such be excuse made for late husband old mr wharton who really thought that in experience have never known one worse than son in law must sometimes become testy at last resolved that must altogether hold tongue must hardly hold tongue now doubt have already formed hope in regard to arthur fletcher have trusted that man whom have taught year since to regard a wished for son in law might be constant strong enough in love to forget be past to be still willing to redeem daughter from misery a day have crept on since scene at tenway junction have become aware that time must do much before such relief must be accepted be however still possible that presence of man might do something hitherto since deed have be done stranger have dined in manchester square have seen visitor have hardly left house except to go to church then have be enveloped in deepest crape once twice have allowed to be driven out in carriage when have done so father have always accompanied widow since seclusion of widow be first ordained have be more strict in maintaining restraint of widowhood a enjoined how then must bid receive new lover how suggest to that lover be possible yet did not like to answer arthur fletcher without naming period for present mourning time at might at least show in manchester square have have letter from arthur fletcher said to daughter day two after have received be sitting after dinner everett be also in room be in herefordshire asked be up in town attending to house of common suppose have something to say to a be not in way of meeting wrote want to come see not yet papa talked of coming dining here oh yes pray let come must not mind must dine early be out of way must be so glad if must have somebody sometimes must think then be such such restraint to be not what mr wharton desired must like dear of course must know that be in house upon word think might meet old friend like said everett looked at brother then at father burst into tear of course will not be pressed if must be irksome to said father be first plunge hurt said everett if must once bring to do must find afterwards that be more comfortable papa said slowly know what mean goodness will always remember may tell say so can not meet yet then pressed further of course have understood father must not even ask to say word might give comfort to arthur a to long distant time went down to house of common next day saw young friend there then walked up down westminster hall for nearly hour talking over matter with most absolute freedom can not be for benefit of one said arthur fletcher that must immolate like indian widow for sake of such man a of course have right to dictate to hardly perhaps to give opinion yes yes yes doe seem to then that ought to force out of kind of thing why must not go down to herefordshire in time arthur in time people life be running away dear fellow if be to see must know how vain must be to try to hurry there must be time chapter lxvi end of session duke of st bungay have be very much disappointed have contradicted with repetition of no assertion of duchess that have be warwick who have placed prime minister crown on head of duke of omnium doubt felt in heart that have done so much towards that advice respecting vacant garter when given with so much weight must have be followed be old man have known secret of cabinet council when younger friend be little boy have given advice to lord john have be one of first to congratulate sir robert peel when statesman became free trader have sat in conclave with duke have listened to bold liberalism of old earl grey in lower upper house have be always great in council never giving advice unasked throwing pearl before swine cautious at time to avoid excess on side on that have never allowed hobby horse of own to ride have never be ambitious have never sought to be ostensible leader of men did now think that when with experience spoke very much in earnest attention must be paid to what said when have described certain line of conduct a quixotic have be very much in earnest did not usually indulge in strong language quixotic when applied to conduct of prime minister be to idea very strong thing described a quixotic have now be done duke of st bungay be disappointed man for hour two thought that must gently secede from private council with prime minister to resign to put impediment in way of own chief did not belong to character line of strategy have come into fashion since have learnt political rudiment be very odious to in party compact there must be inner party peculiar bond confidence stricter stronger also sweeter than bind together twenty thirty gentleman who form government from closer tie have hitherto bound to duke of omnium thought for while that must divorce surely on subject a nomination of knight of garter advice might have be taken if only because have come from so kept apart for day two even in house of lord ceased to whisper kindly cheerful word into ear of next neighbour various remembrance crowded in upon by degree compelling to moderate at last to abandon purpose among first be memory of kiss have given duchess woman have told that loved that be one of very few whom did love word have gone straight into old heart have bade not to desert have not only given promise have converted that promise to sacred pledge by kiss have known well why have exacted promise turmoil in husband mind agony sometimes endured when people spoke ill of aversion have at first genuinely felt to office for hardly thought fit now gradual love of power created by exercise of power have be seen by have created that solicitude have induced to ask for promise old duke have known well have hardly a yet given duchess credit for so true devotion to husband now seemed to that though have failed to love man have given entire heart to prime minister sympathised with altogether at rate must not go back from promise then remembered too that if man did anything amiss in high office have be made to fill who have induced to fill be responsible what right have duke of st bungay to be angry because friend be not wise at point let drought drummonds beeswax quarrel among with colleague belonged to different school in teaching of there be le perhaps of excitement more of long suffering surely also more of nobility be at rate too old to change must therefore be true to friend through evil through good having thought out again whispered cheery word to prime minister a sat listening to denunciation of lord fawn liberal lord much used to business who have not be received into coalition first whisper second whisper prime minister received very coldly have fully appreciated discontinuance of whisper be aware of cause have made selection on own unassisted judgment in opposition to old friend advice be result let be so friend be turning away from must have to stand alone if so must stand alone till pendulum of house of common have told that be time for to retire gradually determined good humour of old man prevailed have wonderful gift of saying nothing with second rate dignity whispered repentant friend speaking of lord fawn very honest man said prime minister in return sort of bastard honesty by precept out of stupidity there be real conviction in begotten by thought little bit of criticism harsh a be have effect prime minister became le miserable than have be lord drummond forgave nothing still held office more than once be seen in private conference with sir orlando mr boffin did not attempt to conceal anger lord earlybird old woman one whom other man in england must have thought of making knight of garter be not said personal disappointment in there be dozen peer whom must willingly have seen so graced without slightest chagrin must have be done simply to show duke power to let world understand that owed nothing must pay nothing to supporter be almost disgrace said lord drummond to belong to government head of must so commit session be nearly at end lord drummond thought that step must be conveniently taken now be quite clear to that state of thing must not be continued be observed that lord drummond prime minister never spoke to other in house that secretary of state for colony being office held never rose in place after lord earlybird nomination unless to say word two a to own peculiar duty be very soon known to world that there be war to knife between lord drummond prime minister strange to say there seemed to be feeling of general discontent on very trifling subject when aristides have be much too just oyster shell become numerous be said that duke have be guilty of pretentious love of virtue in taking lord earlybird out of own path of life forcing to write kg after name there came out article of course in people banner headed prime minister good work in poor lord earlybird be ridiculed in very unbecoming manner in be asserted that thing be done a counterpoise to iniquity displayed in hounding ferdinand lopez to death whenever ferdinand lopez be mentioned have always be hounded then article went on to declare that prime minister have quarrelled with colleague else that colleague have quarrelled with prime minister mr slide did not care might be whichever might be poor country have to suffer when such state of thing be permitted be notorious that duke of st bungay lord drummond must now even speak to own chief so thoroughly be disgusted with conduct indeed seemed that only ally prime minister have in own cabinet be irish adventurer mr phineas finn lord earlybird never read word of be altogether undisturbed a sat in chair in exeter hall just at time of year more frequently in province duke of omnium read after what have passed did not dare to show to brother duke did not dare to tell friend that be said in newspaper that did not speak to other word from mr slide pen settled on own memory added to torment came to be fixed idea in duke mind that mr slide be gadfly sent to earth for express purpose of worrying a matter of course prime minister in own mind blamed for what have done be chief torment of person constituted a be that strong a may be determination to do thing fixed a may be conviction that thing ought to be done sooner have be perfected than objection of others before have be inefficacious become suddenly endowed with truth force did not like being told by mr slide that ought not to have set cabinet against when have in fact done so then believed what mr slide told a soon almost a irrevocable letter have be winged on way to lord earlybird saw absurdity of sending who be that must venture to set aside tradition of office pitt peel palmerston might have done so because have be abnormally strong have be prime minister by work of own hand holding power against whole world told daily that be only there by sufferance because at moment one else must be found to take in condition must not have be bound by tradition of office bound by advice of one so experienced so true a duke of st bungay for whom have broken through tradition thrown away advice for man who have power whatever to help other minister of crown for one whose pursuit in life be at variance with acquisition of such honour a now thrust upon must see own obstinacy must even hate pretentious love of virtue have displayed have seen lord earlybird with ribbon wife said to know lord earlybird by sight replied angrily one else either must have come shown to if have have spark of gratitude in composition a far a can learn have sacrificed ministry for sake did duty a best knew how to do said duke almost with ferocity little becomes to taunt with deficiency plantagenet be driven said almost beyond kill when take part against take part against surely there be very little in what said yet a spoke repented bitterly that have at moment allowed to relapse into sort of badinage have be usual with before have understood extent of suffering if trouble by what say will certainly hold tongue repeat to what that man say in newspaper must regard man plantagenet must allow paper to come into hand be to be afraid of seeing what men say of never need not repeat at rate if be false have not seen article in question certainly must not have repeated accusation contained have quarrelled with colleague if one a lord drummond chooses to think injured be to stoop to nothing strike so much in a ill nature of world at large when used to bait bear tied to stake one around must cheer dog help to torment helpless animal be much same now only have man instead of bear for pleasure will never help dog again said coming up to clinging within embrace of arm knew that have be quixotic must sit in chair repeating word to aloud till began to fear that must do in company thing have be done must not be undone have have bestowal of one garter have given to lord earlybird be told not correctly only thing that have done on own undivided responsibility since have be prime minister last day of july have passed have be at last decided that session must close on th of august now th of august be thought to be great deal too near th to allow of such arrangement being considered satisfactory great many member be very angry at arrangement have be said through june into july that be to be early session yet thing have be so mismanaged that when end came everything must not be finished without keeping member of parliament in town up to th of august in memory of present legislator there have never be anything so awkward fault if there be fault be attributable to mr monk in probability delay be unavoidable minister can not control long winded gentleman when gentleman be very long winded there must be delay doubt strong minister can exercise control be certain that long winded gentleman find unusual scope for breath when reigning dynasty be weak in way mr monk duke may have be responsible be blamed a though for own special amusement detained gentleman in town indeed gentleman be not detained grumbled growled then fled grumbling growling be heard even after departure well what do think of duke said one day to mr monk at treasury affecting air of cheery good humour think said mr monk that country be very prosperous know that ever remember trade to have be more evenly satisfactory ah yes be very well for country ought suppose to satisfy satisfies said mr monk in way if be walking about in very tight pair of boot in agony with foot must be able just then to relish news that agricultural wage in parish have gone up sixpence week 'd take boot off then try said mr monk be just what be thinking of doing if have boot off prosperity must be so pleasant to see ca take boot off in company may be that have walk before that boot will be worse for foot even than tight one will have boot off soon duke said mr monk speaking of recess when will be quit of altogether joking apart have to be worn if country requires certainly duke may be that think that upon whole may be worn with advantage what doe country say to that country have never said reverse have not have majority against session on government question have have narrowing majority what will house do a to lord amendment on bankruptcy bill there be bill have gone down from house of common have not originated with government have however be fostered by minister in house of lord have be sent back with certain amendment for lord chancellor have made responsible be therefore now almost government measure manipulation of measure have be one of cause of prolonged sitting of house grogram say will take amendment if why then said mr monk lord must take rejection will have be beaten said duke undoubtedly beaten simply because house desire to beat be told that sir timothy beeswax intends to speak vote against amendment what sir timothy on one side sir gregory on other so lord ramsden tell said duke if be so what be to do certainly not go out in august said mr monk when time came for consideration of lord amendment in house of common did not come till th of august matter be exactly a duke have said sir gregory grogram with great deal of earnestness supported lord amendment a be in honour bound to do amendment have come from chief lord chancellor have indeed be discussed with sir gregory before have be proposed be very much in earnest be evident

wharton contented with sending love have come to pas that idea of being immured be growing to be natural to emily longer that be continued more did seem to be impossible to that must break from seclusion yet be gratified by note from duchess mean to be civil papa oh yes there be people whose civility want certainly did not want civility of horrid lady eustace can understand think that did ferdinand injury when begin dear hope will be soon to get back to world will find more comfortable think to find among own people want to go back said sobbing bitterly want to go back who know want to go back only begin at end suppose papa wish to go to duchess wish to go somewhere ca be good for to remain here indeed will think wicked at rate weak if continue to seclude where will go said

certainly will not go without may take that a certain be likely must leave alone in august september in great gloomy house if stay will stay now meant great deal more than have meant in former year since lopez have died mr wharton have not once dined at eldon came home regularly at six o'clock sat with daughter hour before dinner then remained with evening seemed a though be determined to force out of solitude by natural consideration for must implore to go to club have rubber must never give way no did care for eldon disliked whist so said till at last spoke more plainly be dull enough here day will not leave in evening there be pertinacious tenderness in have not expected from antecedent of life when therefore told that must not go into country without felt almost constrained to yield must have yielded at once for one fear how must insure to herself that arthur fletcher must not be there of course must be at longbarns how must prevent coming over from longbarns to wharton must hardly bring to ask question of father felt insuperable objection to finding in arthur presence of course loved of course in world be of dearest to of course if must wipe out past a with wet towel if must put crape off mind a well a from limb must become wife with greatest joy very feeling that loved be disgraceful to in own thought have allowed caress while lopez be still husband husband who have ill used betrayed who have sought to drag down to own depth of baseness now must not endure to think that other man must even touch be forbidden to believed by canon of womanhood even to think of love again there ought to be nothing left for crape weeper have done by own obstinacy must make compensation either to family to world to own feeling by drinking cup of misery down to very dreg even to think of joy must in be treason on occasion did not yield to father conquering a have conquered before by pleading of look rather than of word day two afterwards came to with argument of very different kind at rate must go to wharton immediately in reference to letter of vital importance have received from sir alured reader may perhaps remember that sir alured heir heir to title property be nephew for whom entertained affection whatever wharton have be discarded by wharton a profligate drunkard year ago sir alured have endeavoured to reclaim man have spent perhaps more money than have be justified in doing in endeavour seeing that a present occupier of property be bound to provide for own daughter at death acre must go to ne'er do well money have be allowed to flow like water for twelvemonth have done no good whatever there have then be hope man be strong likely to live after while married wife woman that took from very street have be last known achievement from moment not even have name be mentioned at wharton now there came tidings of death be said that have perished in attempt to cross glacier in switzerland by degree appeared that glacier have be le dangerous than brandy have swallowed whilst on journey at rate be dead a to sir alured letter be certain be equally certain that have left son tidings be quite a important to mr wharton a to sir alured more important to everett wharton than to of a must inherit after death of two old men at moment be away yachting with friend even address be unknown letter for be to be sent to oban might might not reach in course of month in man of sir alured feeling catastrophe produced great change heir to title property be one whom be bound to regard with affection almost with reverence if be only possible for to do so with late heir have be impossible everett wharton have always liked everett have not be quite that father uncle have wished fault have be exactly must be cured must almost be made virtue by possession of title property distaste for profession aptitude for parliament must become young man who be heir not only to wharton estate to half father money sir alured in letter expressed hope that everett might be informed instantly must have written have known everett address did know that elder cousin be in town besought elder cousin to come at once quite at once to wharton emily said must of course accompany father on occasion then there be long letter from mary wharton even from lady wharton to emily wharton must have be very much moved when lady wharton must be induced to write long letter wharton be very much moved be in state of enthusiasm at news amounting almost to fury seemed a though thought that tenant labourer on estate tenant labourer wife must be in abnormal condition unfit for duty of life till must have seen everett a heir of property lady went so far a to tell emily bedroom be being prepared for everett bedroom very different in honour from by occupation of have a yet be graced there be twenty point a to new will new deed a to present baronet wanted immediate advice of cousin there be score of thing must now be done be before impossible tree must be cut down building put up little bit of land sold little bit of land bought doing of must give new life to sir alured life interest in estate be much pleasanter thing when heir be friend who can be walked about property than when be enemy who must be kept at arm length delight must now be sir alured if old heir must give counsel young one assistance change in affair occasioned flutter also in manchester square must not make much difference personally to old mr wharton be in fact a old a baronet did not pay much regard to own chance of succession position be one must suit son admirably be now on good term with son have convinced that lopez have done that must to separate therefore found to be more bound to son than ever must go at once said to daughter speaking almost a though have forgotten misery for moment suppose everett ought to be there heaven know where everett be ought to be there suppose on occasion a will condescend to go with condescend papa what doe that mean know can not go alone be out of question must leave here why papa at time family ought to come together of course will take very much amiss if refuse what will lady wharton think if refuse after writing such letter a that be duty to tell that ought to go can not think that be right to throw over friend that have in world there be great deal more said in almost seemed that father tenderness have be worn out word be much rougher more imperious than that have yet spoken since daughter have become widow be also more efficacious therefore probably more salutary after twenty four hour of found that be obliged to yield telegram be sent to wharton by mean first telegram have be sent since news have arrived saying that emily must accompany father be to occupy for two day further in preparation for journey preparation to emily be so sad a almost to break heart have never a yet packed up widow weed have never a yet even contemplated necessity of coming down to dinner in before other eye than of father brother have a yet made none of struggle with widow seek to lessen deformity of costume be incumbent on now to get ribbon two le ghastly than weeper have for last five month hung about face shoulder then how must look if be to be there be not to be expected that wharton must seclude because of grief very change in circumstance of property must be sure of to bring fletcher to wharton then how must look at how answer if spoke to tenderly be very hard for woman to tell lie to man when love may speak word may be able to assure that be indifferent to when woman really love man a loved man there be desire to touch quiver at finger end longing to look at can not keep out of eye inclination to be near affect motion of body can not refrain from excessive attention to word have god to worship can not control admiration of emily felt much felt at same time that must never pardon if betrayed love by gleam of eye by tone of word movement of finger what must be known to love again after such mistake a hers after catastrophe evening before started who must bustle into house everett be then about six o'clock be going to leave london by night mail that must be little given to bustle on occasion may perhaps be forgiven have heard news down on scotch coast have flown up to london telegraphing a did so backwards forward to wharton of course felt that destruction of cousin among glacier whether by brandy ice did not much care have made for nonce one of important people of world young man who must not so feel might be better philosopher one might doubt whether must be better young man quite agreed with father that be sister duty to go to wharton be now in position to speak with authority a to duty of member of family must not wait even for one night in order that might travel with sir alured be impatient sir alured wanted in herefordshire sir alured have said that on occasion heir ought to be on property with shortest possible delay father smiled with approving smile everett therefore started by night mail leaving father sister to follow on morrow chapter lxviii prime minister political creed duke before went to matching twice reminded phineas finn that be expected there in day two duchess say that wife be coming to morrow duke said on day of departure phineas must not go then service to country be required among dockyard ship postponed visit till end of september then started for matching having double pleasure before of meeting wife noble host hostess found small party there not so small a duchess have once suggested to wife will be there of course mr finn be too good to desert in trouble there will probably be lady rosina de courcy lady rosina be to duke what wife be to suppose there will be anybody else except perhaps mr warburton lady rosina be not there in place of lady rosina there be duke duchess of st bungay with daughter two three palliser offshoot with wife barrington erle there be too bishop of diocese with wife three four others coming going so that party never seemed to be too small asked mr rattler said duchess in whisper to phineas declined with string of florid compliment when mr rattler wo come to prime minister house may depend that something be going to happen be like pig carrying straw in mouth mr rattler be pig phineas only laughed said that did not believe rattler to be better pig than one else be soon apparent to phineas that duke manner to be entirely altered so much so that be compelled to acknowledge to that have not hitherto read duke character aright hitherto have never found duke pleasant in conversation looking back must hardly remember that have in truth ever conversed with duke man have seemed to shut up a soon a have uttered certain word circumstance of moment have demanded whether be arrogance shyness phineas have not known wife have said that duke be shy have be arrogant effect must have be same be unbending hard lucid only when spoke on detail of business on point of policy now smiled though hesitating little at first very soon fell into way of pleasant country host shoot said duke phineas did shoot cared very little about hunt phineas be very fond of riding to hound be beginning to think said duke have made mistake in not caring for such thing when be very young gave up because appeared that other men devoted too much time to one might a well not eat because men be glutton only that must die if did not eat bread suppose must keep alive still one eats meat without being glutton very often regret want of amusement particularly of must throw more among fellow creature man be alone when reading alone when writing alone when thinking even sitting in parliament be very much alone though there be crowd around now man can hardly be thoroughly useful unless know fellow men how be to know if shuts up if have to begin again think must cultivate amusement of time not long after duke asked whether be going to join shooting men on morning phineas declared that hand be too full of business for amusement before lunch then said duke will walk with in afternoon there be nothing really like so much a walk there be very pretty point where river skirt park will show spot on sir guy de palliser performed feat for king gave property be grand time when man must get dozen parish because tickled king fancy suppose did tickle king fancy ah then indeed might go otherwise with be glad to say that sir guy be accomplished courtier walk be taken pretty bend of river be seen be looked at without much earnestness sir guy great deed be not again mentioned conversation went away to other matter of course be not long before prime minister be deep in discussing probability of next session be soon apparent to phineas that duke be no longer desirous of resigning though spoke very freely of probable necessity there might be for to do so at present moment be in best foot be on own property must see prosperity around spot be one loved best in world liked present companion who be one to whom be entitled to speak with freedom there be still present to sense of injury from must not free of course did not know that have be haughty to sir orlando to sir timothy others did know that have intended to be true thought that have be treacherous twelve month ago there have be goal before might attain winning post be still within reach there be in store for tranquillity of retirement must enjoy a soon a sense of duty must permit to seize now prospect of happiness have gradually vanished from retirement be no longer winning post for poison of place power dignity have got into blood a looked forward feared rather than sighed for retirement think will go against said phineas did think so there be hardly man high up in party who did not think so when one branch of coalition have gradually dropped off other branch will hardly flourish long then tint of political coalition be so neutral unalluring that men will only endure when feel that more pronounced colour be within reach after said phineas inning have not be bad one have be of service to country have lasted longer than most men expected if have be of service to country be everything must at least be everything with statesman to whom be not everything there must be something wrong duke a said be preaching to be telling that though saw better way be allowing to walk on in be worse for be not only phineas who must see change old duke duchess be apparent to man though must not prevent sometimes think said that whom chance have led to be meddler in game of politics sometimes give ourselves hardly time enough to think what be about man may have to work so hard said phineas that have time for thinking more probably may be so eager in party conflict that will hardly keep mind cool enough for thought seems to that many men men whom know embrace profession of politics not only without political conviction without seeing that be proper that must entertain chance brings young man under guidance of that elder man have come of whig family a be case from old tory stock loyalty keep true to interest have first pushed forward into world there be conviction there conviction grow yes conviction that be man duty to be staunch liberal not reason why man see opening on side on a be case with lawyer have body of men at back ready to support on side on that a see with commercial men perhaps have vague idea that aristocracy be pleasant becomes conservative democracy be prospering becomes liberal be liberal mr finn certainly duke why well after what have said will not boast of experience however seems to show that liberalism be demanded by country so perhaps at certain epoch may devil work will hardly say that will carry devil colour because country may like devil be not sufficient think to say that liberalism be demanded must first know what liberalism mean then assure that thing be good dare say have done so see who never make inquiry will not claim to be better than neighbour mean real neighbour understand understand said duke laughing prefer good samaritan on opposition bench to sir timothy pharisee be hard to come wounded out of fight then to see who must be friend not only walking by on other side flinging stone at a go did not mean just now to allude to detail of recent misfortune though there be one to whom must do so more openly than to be trying yesterday to explain to why have life sat on what be called liberal side of house to have belonged did succeed began life with misfortune of ready made political creed there be seat in house for when be twenty one nobody took trouble to ask opinion be matter of course must be liberal uncle whom nothing must ever induce to move in politics took for granted must run straight a must have said be tradition of family be a inseparable from a of title have inherited property might be sold squandered political creed be fixed a adamant know that ever have wish to rebel think that took at first very much a matter of course man seldom inquires very deeply at twenty one if doe be ten to one come to wrong conclusion since then have satisfied that chance put into right course have be dare say same with a with went into office early anxiety to do special duty well probably deterred from thinking much of great question when man have to be on alert to keep ireland quiet to prevent peculation in dockyard to raise revenue while lower tax feel to be saved from necessity of investigating principle in way sometimes think that minister who have be minister who have to watch minister from opposition bench have le opportunity of becoming real politician than men who sit in parliament with empty hand with time at own disposal when man have be placed by circumstance a be now doe begin to think yet have not empty hand be not so full perhaps a think at rate can not content with single branch of public service a used to do in old day suppose that claim to have made grand political invention think have at least labelled own thought suppose what desire be to improve condition of people by whom be employed to advance country at rate to save from retrogression that of course so much be of course give credit to opponent in parliament for desire quite a readily a do to colleague to myself idea political virtue be on one side be mischievous absurd allow to talk in way because indignation scorn sometimes fear vituperation be fuel with necessary heat of debate be maintained there be men who be very fond of poking fire said phineas well wo name one at present said duke have seen gentleman of country very handy with poker phineas laughed knowing that have be considered by to have be little violent when defending duke put aside when really think can give conservative credit for philanthropy patriotism a readily a liberal conservative who have have idea of meaning of name carry wish suppose to maintain difference distance separate highly placed from lower brother think that god have divided world a find divided that may best do duty by making inferior man happy contented in position teaching that place hold be by god ordinance be so hardly in sense that mean be great conservative lesson that lesson seems to to be hardly compatible with continual improvement in condition of lower man with conservative such improvement be to be based on idea of maintenance of distance a duke be to be kept a far apart from man who drive horse a be ancestor from man who drove who rode after to war be to go on for ever there be much to be said for such scheme let lord be of men with loving heart clear intellect noble instinct be possible that must use power so beneficently a to spread happiness over earth be one of millennium mind of man can conceive seems to be that conservative mind doe conceive other men who be not lord want that kind of happiness if such happiness be attainable might be well to constrain men to accept lord of world be fallible men though a unit ought to be perhaps be better than others who have fewer advantage be much more likely a unit to go astray in opinion than body of men whom must seek to govern know power doe corrupt that can not trust king to have loving heart clear intellect noble instinct men a come to think about to look forward to look back will not believe in such millennium a do believe in millennium think do after fashion think do be idea of conservatism doctrine of liberalism be of course reverse liberal if have fixed idea at must think have conceived idea of lessening distance of bringing coachman duke nearer together nearer nearer till millennium will be reached by by equality asked phineas eagerly interrupting prime minister showing dissent by tone of voice did not use word be open to many objection in first place millennium have perhaps rashly named be so distant that need not even think of a possible men intellect be at present so various that can not even realise idea of equality here in england have be taught to hate word by evil effect of absurd attempt have be made elsewhere to proclaim a fact accomplished by scratch of pen by chisel on stone have be injured in because good word signifying grand idea have be driven out of vocabulary of good men equality must be heaven if must attain how can to whom so much have be given dare to think otherwise how can look at bowed back bent leg abject face of poor ploughman who winter summer have to drag rheumatic limb to work while go hunting sit in pride of place among foremost few of country say that be a ought to be be liberal because know that be not all a ought to be because must still march on to nearer approach to equality though thing be so great so glorious so godlike nay so absolutely divine that have be disgusted by very promise of because perfection be unattainable men have asserted mock equality till very idea of equality stink in men nostril duke in enthusiasm have thrown off hat be sitting on wooden seat have reached looking up among cloud left hand be clenched from time to time with right rubbed thin hair on brow have begun in low voice with somewhat slipshod enunciation of word have gradually become clear resonant even eloquent phineas knew that there be story told of certain burst of word have come from in former day in house of common have occasionally surprised men induced to declare that planty pall a be then often called be dark horse have be few far between phineas have never heard now gazed at companion in silence wondering whether speaker must go on with speech face changed on sudden duke with awkward motion snatched up hat hope ai cold said not at said phineas came here because of bend of river be always very fond of bend go over river be mr upjohn property member for county yes very good member be too though doe support old school tory great friend of uncle who after have good deal of tory about wonder whether be at home must remind duchess to ask to dinner know of course only by just seeing in house 'd like very much when in country always wear knee breech gaiter think very comfortable dress troublesome duke be never tried must dare now goodness be past five o'clock have got two mile to get home have looked at letter warburton will think that have thrown into river because of sir timothy beeswax then started to go home at fast pace sha forget duke said phineas definition of conservative liberal think ventured on definition only few loose idea have be troubling lately say finn grace go tell ramsden drummond have be preaching equality will have pretty mess know that must serve with dear friend duke will be discretion equality be dream sometimes one like to dream especially a there be danger that matching will fly from in dream doubt whether must bear test have be attempted in other country poor ploughman must hardly get share duke be where be can only do little little to bring nearer to so little that wo touch matching in day here be ladyship pony think ladyship must like to lose pony by doctrine two wife of two men be in pony carriage little lady glencora duchess eldest daughter be sitting between mr warburton have sent three messenger to demand presence said duchess a live by bread believe that mr finn have be amusing have be talking politics said duke of course what other amusement be possible what business have to indulge in idle talk when mr warburton want in library there have come box said big enough to contain resignation of traitor of party be strong language duke frowned there be one there to hear phineas finn wife at least be trustworthy duke suggested that have better get back to house a soon a possible there might be something to be done requiring time before dinner mr warburton might at rate want to smoke tranquil cigar after day work duchess therefore left carriage a did mr finn duke undertook to drive little girl back to house will surely go against tree said duchess a fact duke did take child home in safety what do think about mr finn said grace suppose duke have be settling what be to be done have certainly settled nothing then must have disagreed a certainly have not done have in truth not once be out of cloud land ah then there be hope when once grown up politician get into cloud land be because reality of world have longer charm for big box did not contain resignation of of objectionable member of coalition minister often resign in september must be expedient that must do so lord drummond sir timothy be safe at rate till next february might live without show of obedience mutiny duke remained in comparative quiet at matching there be not very much to do except to prepare work for next session great work of coming year be to be assimilation something very near to assimilation of county suffrage with of borough measure be one have now be promised by statesman for last two year promised at first with half promise must mean nothing be not that such promise always lead to more defined assurance duke of st bungay lord drummond other minister have wished to stave off mr monk be eager for adoption be of course supported by phineas finn prime minister have at first be inclined to be led by old duke there be doubt to that measure be desirable must come there might well be question a to time at must be made to come old duke knew that measure must come believing to be wholly undesirable thought that be doing good work in postponing from year to year mr monk have become urgent old duke have admitted necessity there must surely have be shade of melancholy on old man mind a year after year assisted in pulling down institution in truth regarded a safeguard of nation knew that a liberal be bound to assist in destroying must have occurred to from time to time that must be well for to depart be at peace before everything be gone when went from matching mr monk took place phineas finn who have gone up to london for while returned then three between with assistance from mr warburton others worked out proposed scheme of new county franchise with new division new constituency must hardly have be hearty work a of felt that might be first proposition must be beat upon in house of common thought that aristides have be long enough at treasury chapter lxix mr parker fate lopez have now be dead more than five month not word have be heard by widow of mr parker child own

from arthur heard nothing yet be sure that be come very manner of approach brother word made certain that there have be no disappointment stood thinking for quarter of hour making up mind how best

absence till then be to be excused now opened door with much dignity of mien walked into middle of room arthur at moment be discussing duke chance for next session sir alured be asking with rapture whether old conservative party must not come in arthur fletcher heard step turned round saw woman loved went at once to meet very quickly put out hand gave hers of course there be excuse for refusal

have now be at wharton longer than have ever be known to remain there before emily must still remain in herefordshire at period not then fixed must go for month to longbarns there be various reason induced to consent to change of plan in first place found to be infinitely more comfortable in country than in town must go out move about bestir whereas in manchester square must only sit mope at home father have assured that thought that must be better that must be away from reminiscence of house in town then when first week of february be past arthur must be up in town must be far away from

be already in progress for purchase of barnton spinnies sir alured must not possibly leave own house not to have walked through wood on first day that became part of wharton property must to have be

afraid mother dear did think be man ever to be afraid of woman what can say to refuse then 'd better know at once think will be fool enough for perhaps hardly understand mother mr fletcher shook head with look of considerable annoyance perhaps not to tell truth like young woman whom ca understand young woman must be mysterious like people of whom can give pretty good guess what will do be sure never must have guessed that must have married that man if love let that be mentioned between again when said that did not understand did not mean that be mysterious think that before died since death learned of what sort man be will not say that hate memory hate for what have done so ought said mr fletcher have not yet brought to think that life must be anything one long period of mourning not for for own mistake may be quite sure that be in earnest be not because doubt of put off fear that if once asserts to resolution to remain a be will feel bound to keep word suppose be very much same a other woman after dear said mr fletcher who be almost jealous of peculiar superiority of sentiment son seemed to attribute to woman circumstance mother make people different replied so be going

be heavy with disappointment be end of march before left herefordshire for london having spent greater part of time at longbarns lady at place be moved by many doubt a to what must be end of mr fletcher elder at last almost taught to believe that there must be marriage having got back to belief be again opposed to idea of marriage anything everything that arthur wanted ought to have old lady felt doubt a to when convinced that did want to have widow woman whose life have hitherto be so unfortunate have for sake taken woman again by hand have assisted in making one of how much better must be that arthur must think better of be maddest constancy clinging to widow of such man a ferdinand lopez if there be doubt then must be prepared to do must to prevent marriage emily have be forgiven pardon bestowed must of course be continued might be pardoned without being made mr arthur fletcher while emily be still at longbarns old lady almost talked over daughter in law to way of thinking till john fletcher put foot upon altogether pretend to say what may do said oh john said mother to hear man like talk like be absurd 'd jump at if looked at with eye what may do continued saying without appearing to listen to mother can not say that will ask to be wife be a certain a stand here chapter lxxii think that day be numbered detail of new county suffrage bill be settled at matching during recess between mr monk phineas finn very experienced gentleman from treasury one mr prime who be supposed to know more about such thing than man living be consequently called constitution charlie be elderly man over sixty year of age who remembered first reform bill have be engaged in doctoring of constituency ever since bill if passed must be mainly bill yet world must never hear name a connected with let hope that be comfortable at matching that found consolation in smile of duchess during time old duke be away even prime minister be absent for day must fain have busied about bill be hardly allowed by colleague to have hand in framing great point of measure have of course be arranged in cabinet where however mr monk view have be adopted almost without change may not perhaps be too much to assume that one two member of cabinet did not quite understand full scope of suggested clause effect clause will produce danger may be expected from that change manner in proposition will come out in washing strike even cabinet minister at glance little study in man own cabinet after reading perhaps of few leading article perhaps short conversation with astute friend two will enable statesman to be strong at given time for even if necessary against measure who have listened in silence have perhaps given personal assent to original suggestion doubt whether lord drummond when sat silent in cabinet have realised fear weighed upon so strongly afterwards have then foreseen that adoption of nearly similar franchise for county borough must inevitably lead to american system of numerical representation when time have be given sir timothy have talked over mind of man be ever clearer than of lord drummond prime minister with diligence belonged to have mastered detail of mr monk bill before be discussed in cabinet yet found that assistance be hardly needed in absolute preparation have allowed must have done be assumed that must not trouble with such work perceived that be not wanted nothing of moment be settled without reference to required that everything must be explained a went on down to extension of borough boundary knew that be not doing that mr monk constitution charlie have prize between did dare to ask mr monk what must be fate of bill to devote one time mind industry to measure one know will fall to ground must be sad work under such circumstance must be very grievous such be often fate of statesman whether mr monk laboured under conviction prime minister did not know though saw friend colleague almost daily in truth one dared to tell exactly what thought even old duke have become partially reticent taken off to own wood at long royston to phineas prime minister must sometimes say word must say even timidly on abstract question such a have discussed when have be walking together must talk freely enough on matter of day affair be of infinite importance to on one must suppose must take delight in speaking to trusted colleague must not bring to be open must be long bill suppose said to phineas one day be afraid so duke will run fear to over hundred clause will take best part of session to get through if can have second reading early in march hope to send up to in first week in june will give ample time yes yes suppose so did not dare to ask phineas finn whether thought that house of common must assent to second reading be known at time that prime minister be painfully anxious a to fate of ministry seemed to be other day that everybody connected with government be living in fear lest must resign threat in direction have always be made to old friend duke of st bungay great man can not whisper thought without having carried in air in club have be declared that be rock by coalition must probably be wrecked newspaper have repeated story people banner have assured world that if be so duke of omnium must thus do for country only good service be possible that must render be at time when sir orlando be mutinous when lopez have destroyed now such threat came from duke people banner be already accusing of clinging to power with pertinacious unconstitutional tenacity have not sir orlando deserted be not well known that lord drummond sir timothy beeswax be only restrained from doing so by mistaken loyalty everybody came up to town mr monk having bill in pocket queen speech be read promising county suffrage bill address be voted with very few word from side battle be not to be fought then indeed state of thing be so abnormal that there must hardly be said to be side in house stranger in gallery not knowing condition of affair must have thought that minister have for many year commanded so large majority a crowd of member be always on government side of house opposition mr monk expected must knew come from who sat around behind even at very elbow about week after parliament met bill be read for first time second reading be appointed for early day in march duke have suggested to mr expedience of further delay giving a reason necessity of getting through certain routine work must rejection of bill create confusion of resignation one who knew duke must ever suspect of giving false reason seemed that in prime minister be allowing to be harassed by fear of future mr monk thought that delay must be injurious open to suspicion after what have be said done be urgent in argument duke gave way did so almost sullenly signifying acquiescence with haughty silence be sorry said mr monk to differ from grace opinion in matter be so strong that dare to abstain from expressing duke bowed again smiled have intended that smile must be acquiescent have be a cold a steel knew that be misbehaving be not sufficiently master of own manner to be gracious told on spot though be quite wrong in so telling that have now made enemy also of mr monk through mr monk of phineas finn now felt that have friend left in whom to trust for old duke have become cold indifferent old duke thought be tired of work anxious for rest be old duke who have brought into hornet nest have fixed upon back unwilling load have compelled to assume place now to lose must be disgrace old duke be now deserting be sore over angry with one ungracious even with private secretary wife especially miserable because be thoroughly aware of own fault yet through there be present to desire to fight on to very last let colleague do what might say what might must remain prime minister of england a long a be supported by majority of house of common know greater step than phineas said to pleasantly one day speaking of new measure towards that millennium of be talking at matching if can only accomplish moral speculation mr finn said will hardly bear wear tear of real life word of answer combined with manner in be spoken be stern almost uncivil phineas at rate have done nothing to offend duke paused trying to find expression by might correct injury have done not finding passed on without further speech phineas shrugged shoulder went way telling that have received one further injunction not to put trust in prince will be beaten certainly said mr monk to phineas not long afterwards what make so sure smell in air see in men face yet be moderate bill will have to pas something stronger before long if throw out now be not bill that will reject have served turn ought to go house be tired of duke duke be so good man hardly like to admit even that fear be so be fretful make enemy sometimes think that be ill be ill at ease sick at heart can not hide chagrin then be doubly wretched because have betrayed know that ever respected at same time pitied man more thoroughly snubbed awfully yesterday said phineas laughing can not help snub at word that speaks yet believe that be most anxious to be civil to ministry have be of great service to country for will never regret having joined think to have be continual sorrow system on duchess have commenced career a wife of prime minister have now be completely abandoned in first place have become so weary of that have be unable to continue exertion have too become in degree ashamed of failure name of major pountney mr lopez be not now pleasant to ear did look back with satisfaction on courtesy have lavished on sir orlando smile have given to sir timothy beeswax have known good many vulgar people in time said one day to mr finn none ever so vulgar a ministerial supporter remember mr bott dear be before time one of arithmetical men great friend of plantagenet be very bad there have come up worse since sometimes think like little vulgarity for change upon honour when get rid of will be pleasure to go back to lady gentleman duchess said in extreme bitterness seems to that have pretty well got rid of ' already have got anybody else in place have almost made up mind not to ask one into house for next twelve month used to think that nothing must ever knock up now feel that be almost done for hardly dare open mouth to plantagenet duke of st bungay have cut mr monk look a ominous a owl husband have word to say left barrington erle hide face pass by when see mr rattler did try to comfort other day by saying that everything be at six seven really took almost a compliment to be spoken to think plantagenet be ill be careworn man may be worn by care till there come to be nothing left of never speaks of giving up now old bishop of st austell talk of resigning have already made up mind who be to have see used to consult duke about thing think ever consults one now never forgave duke about lord earlybird certainly if man want to

sick of scheme oh dear wish knew something be really pleasant to do have never really enjoyed anything since be in love only liked that because be wicked duchess be wrong in saying that duke of st bungay have cut old man still remembered kiss still remembered pledge have found very difficult to maintain old relation with friend be opinion that coalition have done be wanted from that now have come time when might retire gracefully be doubt hard for prime minister to find excuse for going if duke of omnium must have be content to acknowledge that be not man to alter county suffrage excuse might have be found that must have be injurious to one mr monk mr gresham might have joined present prime minister might have resigned explaining that have done that have be appointed to accomplish have however yielded at once to mr monk now be to be feared that house of common must not accept bill from hand in such state of thing especially after disagreement about lord earlybird be difficult for old duke to tender advice be at cabinet council always came when presence be required be invariably good humoured seemed to that work be done must hardly volunteer to tell chief colleague that must certainly be beaten in house of common therefore there be little more now to be done than to arrange circumstance of retirement nevertheless a period for second reading of bill came on resolved that must discus matter with friend owed to to do so also owed to man whom have certainly placed in present position on politics have imposed burden very much lighter than have inflicted on more energetic much le practical colleague through long life have be in office in such position that men be sure that must soon return to have taken when have come willingly have always left without regret a man cut in out at whist table enjoys game rest from game so have duke of st bungay be well pleased in position be patriotic patriotism did not disturb digestion have be ambitious moderately ambitious ambition have be gratified never occurred to to be unhappy because party be beaten on measure when president of council must do duty enjoy london life when in opposition must linger in italy till may devote leisure to tree bullock be always esteemed always satisfied always duke of st bungay with duke be very different patriotism with be fever public service exacting mistress a long a have be all have still be happy not trusting much in have never aspired to great power now now at last ambition have laid hold of feeling not perhaps uncommon with such men personal dishonour must be attached to political failure what must future life be if have so carried in great office a to have shown to be unfit to resume hitherto office have sufficed in might be useful now must either be prime minister silent obscure humbled man dear duke will be with to morrow morning at be if can give hour yours affectionately st b prime minister received note one afternoon day two before appointed for second reading meeting friend within hour in house of lord confirmed appointment will not rather come to said old duke who lived in st james square declared that carlton terrace must be in way to downing street so matter be settled exactly at eleven two minister met like troubling said old man when know that have so much to think of on contrary have little to think of thought must be very much engaged indeed when will be too full to admit of seeing of course be anxious about bill prime minister smiled anxious yes indeed anxiety be of such nature that kept awake night never for moment left mind free by day of course must be prepared a to what will be done in event of success of failure might a well read said other only reached morning must have told of letter be communication from solicitor general containing resignation have now studied county suffrage bill closely regretted to say that must not give conscientious support be matter of sincerest sorrow to that relation so pleasant must be broken must resign place unless indeed clause a to redistribution must be withdrawn of course did not say a expecting that such concession must be made to opinion merely a indicating matter on objection be so strong a to over rule all other consideration explained at great length pleasantness of relation must have be on one side said veteran ought to have gone long since lord drummond have already a good a said that unless will abandon same clause must oppose bill in lord resign of course meant that presume lord ramsden have not spoken to clause will not stick in throat ought if lawyer have own way about law must be contented question be whether in circumstance must postpone second reading asked prime minister certainly not said other duke a to solicitor general will have difficulty sir timothy be only placed there a concession to party drummond will doubt continue to hold office till see what be done in lower house if second reading be lost there why then lordship can go with rest of rattler say will have majority roby be quite agreed about between must know said prime minister unintentionally pleading for ought to know if men do crisis be exceptional suppose think that if second reading be lost must resign oh certainly after if bill be much mutilated in committee know that will personally break own heart about bill existing difference in suffrage be rather in accordance with prejudice country desire measure suppose can not consent to such material alteration a men suggest a spoke laid hand on sir timothy letter mr monk must not hear of said prime minister of course not in measure must stick to mr monk great indeed only strong desire in matter be to act in strict unison with be always good true duke for own part will not in least regret to find in opportunity of resigning have done work if a believe majority of house must again support gresham monk a head of entire liberal party think that arrangement must be for welfare of country why must make difference to why must not return to council must not do so certainly not at once probably never who be in very prime of life prime minister did not smile now knit brow dark shadow came across face think must do that said caesar must hardly have led legion under pompey have be done greatly to service of country without slightest loss of honour character in who did need hardly talk of duke think then that will fail fail mean in house of common know that failure in house must be regarded a fatal in three case must fail loss of material clause in committee must be a bad a loss of bill oh yes then in spite of messrs rattler roby who have be wrong before may be wrong now may lose second reading third chance against must not probably try to carry on bill with very small majority not with three four think with six seven must be useless own belief be that will never carry bill into committee have always known to be right duke think that general opinion have set in direction general opinion be generally right having come to conclusion thought best to tell in order that might have house in order duke of omnium who with haughtiness reserve be simplest man in world least apt to pretend to be be not sighed deeply when heard for own part continued elder feel regret that must be so be first large measure that have tried to carry did not come in to carry large measure friend look back see how many large measure pitt carried took country safely through most dangerous crisis what have done carried on queen government prosperously for three year be that nothing for minister to do have never be friend of great measure knowing that when come fast one after more be broken in rattle than be repaired by reform have done what parliament country expected to do to poor judgment have done well feel much satisfaction duke well must see out if be a anticipate will be ready of course have prepared for if of late mind have be le turned to retirement than used to be have only be because have become wedded to measure have wished that must be carried under auspex then old duke took leave prime minister be left alone to consider announcement have be made to have said that have prepared in so saying have hardly known hitherto though have be troubled by many doubt have still hoped report made to by mr rattler backed a have be by mr roby assurance have almost sufficed to give confidence mr rattler mr roby combined be a nothing to duke of st bungay prime minister knew now felt that knew that day be numbered resignation of lingering old bishop be not completed person in whom believed must not have see have meditated making of peer two having hitherto be very cautious in respect must hing of kind if called upon by house of common to resign with uncompleted measure thought soon ran away from present to future what be now to come of how must use future life who a yet have not passed forty seventh year regretted much having made apparently pretentious speech about caesar though knew old friend well enough to be sure that must never be used against who be that must class among big one of world man may indeed measure small thing by great measurer must be careful to declare own littleness when illustrates position by of topping one of earth thing said have be true let pompey be who might little caesar of day must never now command legion have once told phineas finn that regretted that have abstained from ordinary amusement of english gentleman have abstained also from ordinary occupation except so far a politics be one of cared nothing for ox for furrow in regard to own land hardly knew whether farm be large small have be scholar after certain fitful fashion have maintained scholarship literature to have be really attached have be that of blue book newspaper what be to do with when called upon to resign understood thought that understood position too well to expect that after while with usual interval might return to power have be prime minister not a leading politician on side not a king of party so told a stop gap there must be nothing for now till insipidity of life must gradually fade away into grave after while got up went off to wife apartment room in used to prepare triumph where now contemplated disappointment have have duke with said what at last know that must have done good by coming sooner what doe grace say think that day be numbered psha be that must have told that ever so long ago be hardly necessary that must disturb at last to come tell such well ventilated news there be porter at one of club who doe know then there will be le surprise to who be concerned perhaps le mortification did tell who be to succeed asked duchess not precisely ought to have done that a be sure know everybody know except plantagenet if know can tell of course can will be mr monk with heart glencora mr monk be very good man wonder whether will do anything for think how destitute will be what if be to ask for place must not give will make unhappy cora what going yes change altogether looked in face for moment before answered with peculiar smile in eye to be well used smile half ludicrous half pathetic having in also dash of sarcasm can dare to tell truth said ca can be honest straightforward yes will make unhappy do think that can not be honest too at rate to doe fret like to think that will be without work yes occupation will be gone for awhile for awhile then came up to put hand on breast yet othello will not be unhappy where will be contentment in be making ill rough people whom tenderness of nature must not well endure trod upon worried with teeth wounded everywhere must have turned at again with teeth given worry for worry must not now will be saved from so will not be discontented said looking up into face still with smile be half pathetic half ludicrous then will be contented too said a kissed chapter lxxiii only duke of omnium night of debate arrived before debate be commenced sir timothy beeswax got up to make personal explanation thought right to state to house how came to pas that found bound to leave ministry at so important crisis in existence then observation be made by honourable member of government presumably in whisper still loud enough to catch sharp ear of sir timothy who now sat just below gangway be said afterwards that gentleman who made observation irish gentleman named fitzgibbon conspicuous rather for loyalty to party than steadiness have purposely taken place in then sat that sir timothy might hear whisper whisper suggested that falling house be often left by certain animal be certainly very loud whisper if gentleman be to be allowed to whisper at be almost impossible to restrain volume of voice to restrain mr fitzgibbon have always be found difficult sir timothy who did not lack pluck turned at once upon assailant declared that word have be used with reference to honourable member did not dare to get upon leg repeat larry fitzgibbon a gentleman be called looked full in face did not move hat from head stir limb be pleasant little episode in evening work afforded satisfaction to house generally then sir timothy went on with explanation detail of measure a soon a be made known to appeared to said to be fraught with gravest most pernicious consequence be sure that member of majesty government who be hurrying on measure with what thought be indecent haste minister be always either indecent in haste treacherous in delay have not considered what be doing if have considered be blind a to result then attempted to discus detail of measure be called to order personal explanation must not be allowed to give opportunity of anticipating debate contrived however before sat down to say very heavy thing against late chief especially to congratulate duke on service of honourable gentleman member for mayo meaning thereby mr laurence fitzgibbon must perhaps have be well for everybody if measure must have be withdrawn ministry must have resigned without debate a everybody be convinced what must be end of let second reading go a might bill must not be carried there be measure require hopeful heartiness of new ministry thorough going energy of young parliament be one of house be a fully agreed that change be necessary a ever be agreed on subject still thing must not be done even mr monk who be most earnest of men felt general slackness of around commotion excitement must be caused by change of ministry might restore proper tone to house in present condition be unfit for work nevertheless mr monk made speech put argument into lucid order knew be for nothing nevertheless must be done for hour after hour went on for be necessary to give detail of contemplated proposition went through a sedulously a though have expected to succeed sat down about nine o'clock in evening then sir orlando moved adjournment of house till morrow giving a reason for doing so expedience of considering detail have heard to opposition be made house be adjourned on following day club be alive with rumour a to coming debate be known that strong party have be formed under auspex of sir orlando that with sir timothy other politician be in close council be of course necessary that must impart to many secret of conclave so that be known early in afternoon that be intention of opposition not to discus bill to move that be read second time day six month ministry have hardly expected a bill be undoubtedly popular in house country if opposition must be beaten in such course defeat must tend greatly to strengthen hand of government if foe must succeed in carrying positive veto on second reading must under circumstance be tantamount to vote of want of confidence be afraid know almost more than do a to feeling of member said mr roby to mr rattler there be man in house whose feeling in matter know said rattler be not quite so sure of principle on own side in old party there be score of men who detest duke though must fain be true to government have voted with through thick thin have not spoken word to one of since became prime minister what be to do with man how be to act with lupton wrote to other day about something answered other forget what got note back from warburton a cold a ice absolute slap in face fancy treating man like lupton in way one of most popular men in house related to peerage man who think so much of must wonder if be to vote against must indeed have be old duke doing said rattler doubt be intended for best thing have be failure from beginning to end knew must be so think there have be single man who have understood what ministerial coalition really mean except from very beginning men be averse to in spirit look how be treated said mr roby be likely that must be very staunch when mr monk became leader of house there be cabinet council that day lasted few minute may easily be presumed that minister decided that must resign at once if sir orlando must carry amendment be not unlikely that be agreed to do same if must nearly carry leaving probably prime minister to judge what narrow majority must constitute nearness on occasion gentleman assembled be jocund in manner apparently well satisfied a though saw before end to trouble spartan boy did not even make grimace when wolf bit beneath frock be spartan boy even prime minister who have fortified for occasion who never wept in company that of wife old friend be pleasant in manner almost affable sha make step towards millennium just at present said to phineas finn a left room together referring to word phineas have spoken on former occasion then have not be very well taken will have made step towards step said phineas in getting to millennium even be something suppose be too anxious said duke to see great effect come from own little doings good day will know about tolerably early monk seems to think that will be attack on ministry not on bill that will be best to get vote with a little delay a possible will bet even five pound note said mr lupton at carlton that present ministry be out to morrow one name five member of next cabinet can help to win first bet said mr beauchamp very old member who like many other conservative have supported coalition will not do said lupton though think ought wo vote against man in misfortune though upon soul love very dearly will vote way hope that sir orlando may succeed if do who be to come in said other suppose want to serve under sir orlando certainly under duke of omnium will not want prime minister a long a there be a good fish in sea a have be caught out of there have lately be formed new liberal club established on broader basis than progress perhaps with greater amount of aristocratic support have come up since duke have be prime minister certain busy men have never be quite contented with existing state of thing have thought that liberal party with such assistance a such club must give must be strong enough to rule alone that great liberal party must be impeded in work triumph by such men a sir orlando drought sir timothy beeswax be odious to club pallisers have from time immemorial run straight a liberal therefore club have be unwilling to oppose duke personally though be chief of coalition certain member of government phineas finn for instance barrington erle mr rattler be on committee of club club a club be not averse to discontinuance of present state of thing mr gresham might again become prime minister if must condescend so far mr monk might be possible that great liberal triumph contemplated by club might not be achieved by present house present house must go shortly then with assistance from well organised club have lately be so terribly wanting lack of have made coalition necessary doubt british constituency must do duty liberal prime minister pure simple might reign almost for ever with great future before club be very lukewarm in support of present bill will go down vote for of course said mr obeahony just for look of thing in saying mr obeahony expressed feeling of club feeling of liberal party generally there be something due to duke not enough to make incumbent on friend to maintain in position a prime minister be great day for sir orlando at past four house be full not from desire to hear sir orlando argument against bill because be felt that good deal of personal interest must be attached to debate if one be asked in day what gift must prime minister ask first from fairy one must name power of attracting personal friend eloquence if be too easy may become almost curse patriotism be suspected sometimes sink almost to pedantry jove born intellect be hardly wanted clash with inferiority industry be exacting honesty be unpractical truth be easily offended dignity will not bend man who can be thing to men who have ever kind word to speak pleasant joke to crack who can forgive sin who be ever prepared for friend foe never very bitter to latter who forgets not men name be always ready with little word be man who will be supported at crisis such a be now in course of passing be for men will struggle talk if need be fight a though very existence of country depended on political security present man must receive such defence still violent deposition of prime minister be always memorable occasion sir orlando made speech a have be anticipated have very little to do with bill be almost exclusively attack upon late chief thought said that be occasion on have better come to direct issue with a little delay a possible if rightly read feeling of house bill of magnitude coming from present ministry must be likely to be passed in efficient condition duke have frittered away support in house a minister have lost that confidence majority of house have once be willing to place in need not follow sir orlando through speech alluded to own service declared that be obliged to withdraw because duke must not trust with management of own office have reason to believe that other gentleman who have attached to duke ministry have found equally crippled by passion for autocratic rule hereupon loud chorus of disapprobation came from treasury bench be fully answered by opposing noise from other side of house sir orlando declared that need only point to fact that ministry have be already shivered by secession of various gentleman only two said voice sir orlando be turning round to contradict voice when be greeted by weakest said other voice be indubitably that of larry fitzgibbon will not speak of said sir orlando pompously be authorised to tell house that noble lord who be now secretary of state for colony only hold office till crisis will have passed after there be sparring of very bitter kind between sir timothy phineas finn till at last seemed that debate be to degenerate into war of man against man phineas erle laurence fitzgibbon allowed to be lashed into anger a far a word went have best of of what use must be man there have come into house prepared to vote for against duke of omnium resolved like mr lupton not to vote at be hardly on card that single vote must be turned way that by violence of speaking let pas said mr monk in whisper to phineas fire be not worth fuel know duke fault said phineas men know nothing of virtue when hear abuse can not stand early in night before twelve o'clock house divided even at moment of division one quite knew how must go there must be many who must of course vote against amendment a being simply desirous of recording opinion in favour of bill generally there be who thought that sir orlando follower have be too forward too confident of own standing in house in trying so violent mode of opposition must have be better men thought to have insured success by gradual persistent opposition to bill hardly knew how thoroughly men may be alienated by silence cold demeanour sir orlando on division be beaten be beaten only by nine ca go on with bill said rattler in one of lobby of house defy house must stand know minister said roby must carry measure like with majority of nine on vote of confidence house be of course adjourned mr monk went at once to carlton terrace wish have only be three four said duke laughing why so because there must have be le doubt be there at present le possibility for doubt will say must not wish to make attempt with majority must not do duke quite agree with there will be who will say that attempt might be made who will accuse of being faint hearted because make will be men who understand nothing of temper of house very likely still wish majority have only be two three there be little more to be said suppose very little grace have better meet to morrow at two if possible will see majesty in afternoon good night mr monk good night duke reign be ended be good deal older man than yet probably have yet to begin mr monk smiled shook head a left room not trusting to discus so large subject at so late hour of night without waiting moment after colleague departure prime minister for be still prime minister went into wife room knowing that be waiting up till must hear result of division there found mr finn with be over asked duchess yes there have be division mr monk have just be with well have beaten of course a always do said duke attempting to be pleasant did suppose there be anything to fear husband have always bid keep up courage have not mr finn husband have lost sens think said have taken to such storming raving about political enemy hardly dare to open mouth tell have be done plantagenet ejaculated duchess be a unreasonable a mr finn cora house have voted against sir orlando amendment by majority of nine only nine will cease to be prime minister to morrow mean to say that be settled quite settled play have be played curtain have fallen light be being put out poor weary actor may go home to bed on such amendment surely majority must have done dear will not name number nine certainly must not do be over ministry be over if mean that then everything be over for will settle down in country build cottage mix draught marie will still be going up tree if mr finn manages well may come to be prime minister day have hardly such ambition lady glen ambition will come fast enough will not plantagenet let once begin to dream of a possible desire will soon be strong enough how must feel if be so be quite impossible said mr finn gravely see why anything be impossible sir orlando will be prime minister now sir timothy beeswax lord chancellor after anybody may hope to be anything well suppose may go to bed be carriage here dear hope so ring bell plantagenet for somebody to see down come to lunch to morrow because will have so many groan to utter what beast what brute what ungrateful wretch men be worse than woman when get together in number enough to be bold why have deserted have not done for think of new bedroom furniture that sent to gatherum merely to keep party together there be thousand of yard of linen have be of use feel like wolsey plantagenet not in least dear one will take anything away from be own for be almost a much divorced a catherine have have head cut off a completely a anne bullen rest of go away marie because be going to have cry by duke on night put mr finn into carriage a walked with downstairs asked whether believed duchess to be in earnest in sorrow so mix up mirth woe together said duke sometimes can hardly understand think doe regret duke told other day that must be contented few week will make so a for grace hope may congratulate oh yes think so none of like to be beaten when have taken thing in hand there be always little disappointment at first upon whole be better a be hope will not make husband unhappy not for own sake will go again into middle of scramble fight on one side other for own part think opposition pleasantest good night duke be so sorry must have troubled then went alone to own room sat there without moving for couple of hour surely be great thing to have be prime minister of england for three year prize of nothing now must rob ought not to be unhappy yet knew to be wretched disappointed have never occurred to to be proud of being duke to think of wealth otherwise than chance incident of life advantageous indeed by mean source of honour have be aware that have owed first seat in parliament to birth probably also first introduction to official life heir to dukedom if will only work hard may almost with certainty find received into one other regiment in downing street have not in early day be with a have with friend mr monk phineas finn who have worked way from very rank even duke can not become prime minister by favour surely have done something of might be proud so tried to console to have done something be nothing to nothing to personal happiness unless there be also something left for to do how must be with now how for future must men ever listen to again allow again to work in behoof a used to do in happy day in house of common feared that be over for that for rest of day must simply be duke of omnium chapter lxxiv be disgraced shamed soon after commencement of session arthur fletcher became constant visitor in manchester square dining with old barrister almost constantly on sunday not unfrequently on other day when house general engagement must permit between emily be father there be secret misunderstanding mr wharton quite understood that young member of parliament be earnestly purposed to marry daughter fletcher be sure of assistance support mr wharton must give name of lopez be very rarely used between have be tacitly agreed that there be need that must be mentioned man have come like destroying angel between fondest hope must ever be what must have be have that man never appeared to destroy happiness man have gone away not without tragedy be appalling thought that a regarded tragedy might be if not forgotten at least put aside if only that other person in whom be interested must be taught to seem to forget be not love said father feeling of shame arthur fletcher shook head not quite agreeing with be not that feared that loved memory of late husband such love be thought impossible there be believed something more than feeling father described a shame there be pride also determination in own bosom not to confess fault have made in giving to whom must now think to have be so much least worthy of two suitor fortune will not be what once promised said old man plaintively remember that ever asked a to fortune arthur replied certainly not if have must not have told a named sum be right must explain to that man succeeded in lessening by six seven thousand pound if be have promised sir alured everett a heir must have use of considerable portion of share without waiting for death be odd that one of child from whom certainly expected greater trouble must have fallen so entirely on foot that other well let hope for best everett seems to have taken up with wharton a though belonged to already emily well dear boy let hope that may come right yet be not drinking wine yes pas bottle will have glass before go upstairs in way time went by till emily returned to town ministry have just then resigned think that great reactionary success a be called by writer in people banner affected one member of lower house much le than return to london of mr lopez arthur fletcher have determined that must renew suit a soon a year must have expired since tragedy have made love widow that year have now passed away have known day well a have when passed morning weeping in own room at wharton now questioned whether year must suffice whether in mercy to with view of realizing own hope must give longer time for recovery have told that must be done at end of year a have allowed no one to talk out of word so neither must be untrue to became with deep matter of business question of great difficulty how must arrange necessary interview whether must plead case with at first meeting whether have better allow to become accustomed to presence in house mother have attempted to ridicule because be a said afraid of woman well remembered that have never be afraid of emily wharton when have be quite young little more than boy girl together then have told her of love over over again have found almost comfortable luxury in urging to say word have never indeed said probably in day still hoped that must say occasionally have feigned to be angry with have tempted on to little quarrel with boyish idea quick reconciliation must perhaps throw into arm now seemed to that age have passed since day love have certainly not faded there have never be moment when have be on wing now azure plumage of love have become grey a wing of dove gorgeousness of dream have sobered into hope fear be constant burden to heart there be time enough still time enough for happiness if must yield time enough for dull pressure of unsatisfied aspiration must persist in refusal at last saw almost by accident that meeting certainly be not fit for purpose of suit called at stone building day after arrival found at father chamber have come there keeping appointment with certainly have not expected to meet lover be confused hardly able to say word to account for presence greeted with almost sisterly affection saying word of longbarns family telling how everett to sir alured great delight have be sworn in a magistrate for county how at last hunt meeting john fletcher have be asked to take county hound because old lord weobly at seventy five have declared to be unable longer to ride a master of hound ought to ride thing arthur have of course heard such news being too important to be kept long from on none of subject have much to say stuttered stammered quickly went away not however before have promised to come dine a usual on next sunday not without observing that anniversary of fatal day of release have done something to lighten sombre load of mourning widow have hitherto worn yes must dine there on sunday how must be with then mr wharton never went out of house on sunday evening must hardly be expected to leave own drawing room for sake of giving lover opportunity no must wait till that evening must have passed then make occasion for a best might sunday came dinner be eaten after dinner there be single bottle of port single bottle of claret how do think be looking asked father be a pale a death before got down into country upon word sir said have hardly looked at be not matter of look now a used to be have got beyond that be not that be indifferent to seeing pretty face have longer opinion of own about woman figure there grows up think longing almost kill that consideration to be a beautiful a ever said father proudly fletcher did manage when in drawing room to talk for while about john hound then went away having resolved that must come again on very next day surely must not give order that must be denied admittance have be too calm too even too confident in herself for yes must come tell plainly what have to say must tell with solemnity of be capable with few word strongest must use must refuse a almost knew that must at first then must tell of father of wish of joint friend nothing must say to nothing personal dislike can justify in refusing to heal so many wound a fixed on word failed to remember how little probable be that lover must ever be able to use phrase arranges on monday came asked for mr lopez slurring over word a best must butler said mistress be at home since death of man have so thoroughly despised old servant have never called mr lopez arthur be shown upstairs found lady sought found mr roby also may be remembered that mr roby after tragedy have be refused admittance into mr wharton house since that there have be correspondence feeling have prevailed that woman be not to be quarrelled with for ever did not do papa because of emily have said with scorn scorn have procured mr roby pardon be now making morning call suiting conversation to black dress of niece arthur be horrified at seeing mr roby have always be to odious not only a personal enemy a vulgar woman at rate attributed to great part of evil have be done feeling sure have there be house round corner emily wharton must never have become mr lopez a be be forced to shake hand with forced to listen to funereal tone in mr roby asked if did not think that mr lopez looked much improved by sojourn in herefordshire shrank at sound then in order that might not be repeated took occasion to show that be allowed to call early playmate by christian name mr roby thinking that ought to check remarked that mr lopez return be great thing for mr wharton thereupon arthur fletcher seized hat off ground wished good bye hurried out of room what very odd manner have taken up since became member of parliament said mr roby emily be silent for moment then with effort with intense pain said word two thought have better be at once spoken went because doe not like to hear that name good gracious papa doe not like say word about aunt pray call emily be going to be ashamed of name never mind aunt if think wrong

whereby might allow to think that intended to renew suit then have wept because be so though resolution have be quite firm a to duty be incumbent on of remaining in desolate condition of almost nameless widowhood yet have be unable to refrain from bitter tear because also have seemed to see that such be duty now again knowing that request be coming feeling once more confident of constancy of love be urgent with a to heavy duty must be unwomanly dead to shame almost inhuman be to allow again to indulge in love after havoc have made have be little more than bride when husband for whom have so often be forced to blush have be driven by weight of misfortune disgrace to destroy by marriage have made have overwhelmed whole family with dishonour have done with persistency of perverse self will must not now look back upon without wonder horror too must have died a well a only that death have not be within compass of power a of how then must forget wipe away from mind a must figure from

word must find must not repeat to father next morning when came into parlour where be already sitting looked up at almost reproachfully did think that woman be piece of furniture can mend revarnish fit out with new ornament then send out for use second hand indeed for purpose a good a new then while be in frame of mind everett came in upon unawares with almost boisterous happiness succeeded for while in changing current of thought be of course now uppermost in own thought last few month have made so much of that might be excused for being unable to sink in presence of others be heir to baronetcy to double fortune of two old men be going to be married in manner a one told to increase glory stability of family be nonsense about not coming down said smiled shook head can only tell that

one of fashionable newspaper of day saying that alliance have be arranged between heir to wharton title property daughter of present baronet think that have probably originated in club gossip trust did not spring directly from activity ambition of everett chapter lxxvi who will be for first day two after resignation of ministry duchess appeared to take further notice of matter ungrateful world have repudiated husband have foolishly assisted given way to repudiation grand aspiration be at end triumph be over worse than that there be present to conviction that never have really triumphed there never have come happy moment in have felt to be dominant over other woman have toiled struggled have battled occasionally submitted yet there be present to feeling that have stood higher in public estimation a lady glencora palliser whose position have be own have not depended on husband than now have done a duchess of omnium wife of prime minister of england have meant to be something knew not what greater than have be wife of other prime minister other duke now felt that in failure have be almost ridiculous failure thought have be hers rather than of circumstance if have be le scrupulous more persistent might have be different if have be more discreet sometimes felt own failing so violently a to acquit almost entirely at other time be almost beside with anger because loss seemed to have arisen from want of stubbornness on part when have told that follower have determined to resign because have beaten foe by majority only of nine took into head that be in fault why must go while supporter be more numerous than opponent be useless to bid think over again though be far from understanding circumstance of game did know that must not remain after having arranged with colleague that must go so became cross sullen while be going to windsor back setting house in order preparing way for successor whoever successor might be be moody silent dreaming over impossible condition of thing in accordance with might have remained prime minister almost for ever on sunday after fatal division division duchess must not allow to have be fatal came across somewhere in house

easy thing to make ministry just at present why must not go back think be on card why not ever so many men have done after going out why not remember mr mildmay doing twice be always thing when man who have be sent for make mess of for old minister to have chance what if old minister will not take chance then be old minister fault why must take chance a well a be many day ago since be quite anxious to remain in thought be going to break heart because people even talked of going be going to break heart a call said smiling not because people talked of ceasing to be minister because feeling of house of common justified people in so saying hope see difference there be difference people be talking about be member have supported must go on if chose be sure mr monk must leave be just what mr

country be use discussing cora of course understand nothing because be woman understand great deal not quite may at rate understand trouble be at end be saying other day that labour of being prime

allowing opinion to have weight with sympathy must be so much to when thought be making ill wished that might be spared illness must be nothing honour be everything too have something to bear a well a if can not approve of what do at rate be silent yes can be silent then slowly left a went be almost tempted to yield to throw into arm to promise that must be soft to to say that be sure that did be for best must not bring a yet to be good humoured if have only be little stronger little thicker skinned made of clay little coarser little other than be might have be so different early on sunday afternoon have driven to mr finn house in park lane instead of waiting for friend latterly have seldom done finding that presence at home be much wanted have be filled with perhaps foolish idea of necessity of doing something of adding something to strength of husband position have certainly be diligent in work now might run about like other woman be honour duchess said mr finn be sarcastic marie have nothing further to do with bestowal of honour why did make everybody peer baronet while be about lord finn see why must have be lord finn be sure deserved for way in attacked sir timothy beeswax think 'd like say so suppose do like must take 'd have made locock knight sir james locock 'd make more knightly knight than sir timothy when man have power ought to use make people respect mr daubeny made duke people think more of than anything did be mr finn going to join new ministry if can tell duchess who be to be new minister can give guess mr monk then certainly will mr daubeny then certainly wo mr gresham must not answer duke of omnium must depend upon grace if duke came back mr finn service must be at disposal whether in out of office very prettily said dear never look round room without thinking of first time came here do remember when found old man sitting there old man alluded to be late duke be not likely to forget duchess how hated when saw what fright thought be pictured to myself a sort of ogre willing to eat up everybody for gratification of own vanity be very vain there be little pride with now have come to pas ca very well live without how did love grace be very good to must have done great harm after if have made duchess of omnium very great harm to lady glen a be got friend loved dearly husband love dearly too in other case must have have perhaps may say that in other case life must not have be brightened by affection of present duchess one ca tell how must have gone well remember state be in then door be opened phineas finn entered room what mr finn be at home thought everybody be crowding down at club to know who be to be what be settled be quiet have nothing to do to disturb ought to be in flutter of renewed expectation be waiting destiny in calm seclusion hope duke be well a well a can be expected doe walk about room with poniard in hand ready for sir orlando be sitting crowned like bacchus drinking health of new ministry with lord drummond sir timothy be probably sipping cup of coffee over blue book in dignified retirement must go see must be unwilling to trouble when be so much occupied be just what have done harm in world everybody presumes that have so much to think of nobody go near then be left to boody over everything by till becomes sort of political hermit ministerial lama whom human eye be not to look upon doe matter now doe visitor after visitor came in duchess chatted to leaving impression on everybody that heard that at least be not sorry to be relieved from trouble attending husband late position sat there over hour a be taking leave have few word to whisper to mr finn when be over said mean to call on mr lopez thought did go there be soon after poor man have killed when be going away of course only left card will see now if can want to get out of melancholy if possible have sort of feeling know that among made train run over think that got so horribly abused for what did at silverbridge really see why be to have money be that made spend be fancy thoroughly bad man wife doe always want to be made widow even if husband be bad think owe something must pay debt if knew how will go see if will marry other man will take by hand good bye dear 'd better come to early to morrow a suppose will know something by eleven o'clock in course of evening duke of st bungay came to carlton terrace be closeted for time with late prime minister have be engaged during last two previous day in lending aid to various political manoeuvre ministerial attempt from duke have kept altogether aloof did not go to windsor a successive competitor journeyed thither returned one sent for old duke went to seek counsel be nestor of occasion strove heartily to compose quarrel so to arrange matter that wholesome moderately liberal ministry might be again installed for good of country comfort of true whig in such moment almost ascended to grand height of patriotism being always indifferent a to now came to late chief with new project mr gresham must attempt to form ministry if duke of omnium must join be impossible said younger politician folding hand together throwing back in chair listen to before answer with such certainty there be three four gentleman who after work of last three year bearing in mind manner in defeat have just be accomplished feel disinclined to join mr gresham unless will do so also may specially name mr monk mr finn might perhaps add be not that have hoped that in event might at length regard a exempt from further service old horse must be left to graze out last day ne peccet ad extremum ridendus ca consider absolved on score there be other reason queen service must count before everything gresham cantrip with own friend can hardly make ministry a thing be now unless mr monk will join think that other chancellor of exchequer be at present possible will beseech mr monk not to let feeling a to stand in way why must be not only what may think may think what others will think say coalition will have done ought to have be expected from if party in can now join mr gresham by mean must give strength may be sure at rate of what little can do for out of office mr gresham have made acceptance of office well will not say strictly conditional on joining must hardly be correct have expressed quite willing to make attempt with aid doubtful whether can succeed without suggests that must join a president of council if be wanted at must take privy seal certainly not friend if there be question of return must reverse office think may say that mind be fixed if wish will see mr monk do can to get to go with for feel that must be useless at last at duke pressing request agreed to take twenty four hour before gave final answer to proposition chapter lxxvii duchess in manchester square duke said not word to wife a to new proposition when asked what tidings old friend have brought a to state of affair almost told fib in anxiety to escape from persecution be in doubt what mean to do said duke duchess asked many question got satisfactory reply to of did mr finn learn anything from husband whom however did not interrogate very closely must be contented to know when proper time might come for lady to be informed duke however be determined to take twenty four hour alone at rate not to be driven to decision by feminine interference in meantime duchess went to manchester square intent on performing certain good office on behalf of poor widow may be doubted whether have clearly made up mind what be that must do though be clear that debt be due by to mr lopez knew too in what direction assistance might be serviceable if only must in case be given have heard that present member for silverbridge have be lady lover long before mr lopez have come upon scene with feminine wile of be perfect mistress have extracted from confession that mind be unaltered liked arthur fletcher a indeed have for time liked ferdinand lopez felt that conscience must be easier if must assist in good work built castle in air a to presence of bride bridegroom at matching thinking how might thus repair evil have done heart misgave little a drew near to house remembered how very slight be acquaintance how extremely delicate mission on have come be not woman to turn back when have once put foot to work be driven up to door in manchester square without expressed hesitation on own part yes mistress be at home said butler still shrinking at sound of name hated duchess be then shown upstairs be left alone for minute in drawing room be large handsome apartment hung round with valuable picture having sign of considerable wealth since have first invited lopez to stand for silverbridge have heard much about have wondered how have gained possession of such girl a emily wharton now a looked about wonder be increased knew enough of such people a wharton fletcher to be aware that a class be more impregnable more closely guarded by feeling prejudice against stranger than other none keep daughter to with greater care be le willing to see rule of life changed abolished yet man half foreigner half jew a now appeared whole pauper have stepped in carried off prize for one a arthur fletcher be contending duchess have never seen emily once so a to observe well have then thought to be very handsome woman have be at garden party at richmond lopez have then insisted that wife must be well dressed must perhaps have be impossible in whole of assembly to find more beautiful woman than mr lopez then be one who carried with finer air now when entered room in deep mourning must have be difficult to recognise face be much thinner eye apparently larger colour faded there have come settled seriousness on face seemed to rob of youth arthur fletcher have declared that a saw now be more beautiful than ever arthur fletcher in looking at saw more than mere feature to eye there be tenderness added by sorrow have own attraction for be so well versed in line of countenance that must see there old loveliness behind sorrow loveliness must come forth again a bright a ever if sorrow must be removed duchess though remembered woman beauty a might that of other lady now saw nothing thing of woe wrapped in customary widow weed hope said be not intruding in coming to have be anxious to renew acquaintance for reason be sure will understand emily at moment hardly knew how to address august visitor though father have lived life in what be called good society have not consorted much with duke duchess have indeed on one occasion be for hour two guest of grand lady on occasion have hardly be called upon to talk to now doubted how to name duchess with show of hesitation decided at last upon not naming at be very good of to come said in faltering voice told must when wrote know be many month ago have not forgotten have be in country since think yes in herefordshire herefordshire be county know about said duchess smiling generally did contrive to learn about people whom chose to take by hand have herefordshire gentleman sitting for must not say borough of silverbridge be anxious to make allusion to arthur fletcher be difficult to travel on silverbridge ground a lopez have be chosen candidate when still wished to claim borough a appanage of palliser family emily however kept countenance did not show by sign that thought be running in direction though presume to regard mr fletcher continued duchess a in way connected with local interest have always supported duke hope have become friend of ours think be neighbour of yours in country oh yes cousin be married to brother knew there be something of kind told that there be close alliance duchess a looked at woman to whom wanted to be kind did not a yet dare to express wish that there might at not very distant time be closer alliance have come there intending to do so have still hope that might do before interview be over at rate must not do yet have not heard said something of marriage brother be going to marry cousin sir alured wharton daughter ah thought have be one of fletcher be member who told spoke a though be very dear friend be dear friend very poor emily still did know whether to call duchess lady grace yet felt need of calling by special name exactly supposed be so tell mr fletcher will become quite favourite in house at present moment nobody know on side anybody be going to sit to morrow may be that mr fletcher will become dire enemy of duke friend hope not of course be speaking of political enemy political enemy be often best friend in world can assure from own experience political friend be often bitterest enemy never hated people so much a of supporter duchess made grimace emily must not refrain from smiling yes indeed there be old saying that misfortune make strange bedfellow political friendship make stranger alliance than misfortune perhaps never met sir timothy beeswax never well a be saying there be knowing who may support whom now if be asked who must be prime minister to morrow must take dozen name shake in bag be not settled then settled indeed nothing be settled at moment indeed everything be settled though duchess did not know so none of can tell how mr fletcher may stand with when thing be arranged suppose call conservative oh yes wharton suppose be conservative fletcher

descending to serve under others have be foolish enough to express have be strong with from very commencement of ministry when first asked to take place have filled reason strong against have be conviction that must probably exclude from political work during latter half of life man who have written qc after name must abandon practice behind bar a then be although have already be driven by unhappy circumstance of peerage from house of common loved so well there be still open to many field of political work if must once consent to stand on top rung of ladder must not thought take lower place without degradation till must have be placed quite at top shifting place from higher to lower office must injure in own estimation exigency of service not defeat must produce such change a must not go down from being prime minister serve under other chief without acknowledging to have be unfit for place have filled of that have quite assured yet have allowed old duke to talk into doubt a sat considering question acknowledged that there might have be room for doubt though in present emergency there certainly be none must imagine circumstance in experience of individual in special branch of country service might be of such paramount importance to country a to make incumbent on man to sacrifice personal feeling be not so with there be nothing now must do might not do a well that blessed task of introducing decimal into commercial relation of british life have once kept aloft in air floating a upon eagle wing have be denied if ever done must be done from house of common people of country have become deaf to charm of great reform othello occupation be in truth altogether gone there be reason by must justify to step down in world old duke have proposed to early on following morning left carlton terrace on foot walked a far a mr monk house be close to st james street here at eleven o'clock found late chancellor of exchequer in state of tedious agitation in man be kept who

sent for have not expected that of ex prime minister of day must come to people have said that not improbably might be man have indulged in such dream office have have no great charm for if there be one man of late government who must lay down without personal regret be mr monk wish to come with to duke house in st james square said late prime minister think will find at home certainly will come moment then there be not word spoken till two men be in street together of course be little anxious said mr monk have anything to tell before get there of course must return to office mr monk with

country march have gone out like lamb even in early april day be sweet to be followed doubt by usual nipping inclemency of may never can get over feeling continued duke parliament must sit for six winter month instead of in summer if met on first of october how glorious must be to get away for early spring nothing le strong than grouse must break up parliament said mr monk then what must pheasant fox say be giving up almost too much to amusement used to think must like to move for return of number of hunting shooting gentleman in house believe must be small minority son shoot daughter hunt hanger on must be against custom be against mr monk be here be hope friend will not be out looking up young lord of treasury duke of st bungay be not in search of cadet for government be at very moment closeted with mr gresham mr gresham especial friend lord cantrip have be at work so long so constantly that very servant have ministerial crisis manner felt enjoyed importance of occasion two

answer to proposition made within twenty four hour find can do so without delay trust grace answer may be favourable to said mr gresham who indeed did not doubt much that must be so seeing that mr monk have accompanied think that will be unfavourable though can not do a friend have proposed practicable arrangement began mr gresham with frown however on brow most practicable arrangement be sure will be for to form government without hampering with beaten predecessor not beaten said lord cantrip certainly not said other duke be because of success that ask service said mr gresham have none to give none can not better bestow out of office than in must ask gentleman to believe that be quite fixed coming here with friend mr monk did not state purpose to begged to accompany fearing lest in absence must feel incumbent on to sail in same boat with late colleague must prefer to do so said mr monk of course be not for to say what may be mr gresham idea a friend here suggested to be to return to office mr monk must do so also can not be wrong in surmising that service be desired mr gresham bowed assent will therefore take liberty of telling mr monk think be bound to give aid in

omnium be at last resolute of administration must not at rate be member whether caesar might might not at future time condescend to command legion must not do so when purple have be that moment stripped from shoulder soon afterwards left house with repeated request to mr monk that must not follow late chief example regret greatly said mr gresham when be gone there be man said lord cantrip whom who know more thoroughly respect have be worried said old duke must take time to recover have one fault be little too conscientious little too scrupulous mr monk of course did join making one two stipulation a did so required that friend phineas finn must be included in government mr gresham yielded though poor phineas be not among most favoured friend of statesman so government be formed crisis be again over list newspaper have be publishing for last three day be republished in amended nearly correct condition triumph of people banner a to omission of duke be of course complete editor have hesitation in declaring that by own sagacity persistency have made certain exclusion of very unfit very pressing candidate for office list be filled up after usual fashion for while dilettante politician of club strong minded woman who take interest in such thing writer in newspaper have almost doubted whether in emergency have be supposed to be so peculiar government must be formed there have be so have said peculiarity so peculiar that might be that much dreaded deadlock have come at last coalition have be possible though antagonistic to british feeling generally have carried on government what might succeed coalition nobody have known radical liberal together must be too strong for mr daubeny sir orlando mr gresham have longer party of own at back second coalition must be generally spurned in way there have be much political excitement fair amount of consequent enjoyment after few day old men have rattled into old place generally old men into new place be understood that mr gresham must be again supported by majority a grow old be matter of interest to watch how natural gap be filled in two rank of parliamentary workman by whom government be carried on in one interest other of course there must be gap men become too old though be rarely case peel may perish even palmerston must die men though long supported by interest family connection loyalty of colleague be weighed down at last by own incapacity sink into peerage now again man can not bear bondage of office fly into rebellion independence must have be more respectable have not be result of discontent then gap must be filled whether on side on that candidate be first looked for among son of earl duke not unnaturally a son of earl duke may be educated for such work almost from infancy few rise by slow process of acknowledged fitness men who probably at first have not thought of office be chosen because be wanted whose career be grudged not by opponent rival by brown jones of world who can not bear to see smith walker become something so different to men have great weight to carry can not always shake off burden of origin live among begotten statesman a though too have be born to manner perhaps most wonderful ministerial phenomenon though now almost too common to be longer called phenomenon be who rise high in power place by having made thoroughly detested also ala for parliamentary cowardice thoroughly feared given sufficient audacity thick skin power to bear for few year evil look cold shoulder of comrade be man most sure to make way to high seat skin must be thicker than of animal known audacity must be complete to man who will once shrink at idea of being looked at askance for treachery hated for ill condition career be impossible let be obdurate bid will come not because want do ask for say groaning chief of party to also sufficiently aloud for others ear because sting goad will drive to madness a foe then pachydermatous one enters into other heaven probably with resolution already formed of ousting that unhappy angel so be in present instance when mr gresham completed list be published to world world be astonished to find sir timothy be to be mr gresham attorney general sir gregory grogram became lord chancellor liberal chief be content to borrow senior law adviser from conservative side of late coalition must not be that mr gresham

plantagenet be shifted from one office to of course did do think be not anxious about phineas when became prime minister gave up to altogether will never forget what felt when came to told that perhaps might be so told also that must escape from if be possible be lady macbeth of occasion over whereas be so scrupulous so burdened with conscience a for must have taken by mean then be that old duke played part of three witch to nicety well there have be absolute murder have quite gone mad need be afraid though wood of gatherum must come to matching god forbid will never see anything of gatherum again what annoys most be always be that must understand what felt about how proud be that must be prime minister how anxious that must be great noble in office how worked for not at for pleasure of own think did feel no not a did at last liked power rather feared disgrace of losing have idea of personal grandeur of place never understood that to be prime minister in england be a much a to be emperor in france much more than being president in america oh how did labour for how did scold for with quiet little stinging word of be vulgar be that quiet word yes a used indiscreet ignorant stupid bore though sometimes be dying with vexation now be over here be a humdrum a one else beeswax robys drought pountneys lopezes have passed over scene do remember that pountney affair how turned poor man out of house served right must have served right to be turned out only be there for purpose did like in way make sad to think that feeling can never come again even if must have back again must be very lame affair to then can never again rouse to effort of preparing food lodging for parliament wife will never again think that can help to rule england by coaxing unpleasant men be done gone can never come back again not long after duke took mr monk who have come down to matching for few day out to very spot on have sat when indulged in lecturing phineas finn on conservatism liberalism generally then asked chancellor of exchequer what thought of present state of public affair have supported mr gresham government did not belong to because must not at present reconcile to filling office mr monk did not scruple to say that in opinion present legitimate division of party be preferable to coalition have existed for three year in such arrangement said mr monk there must always be certain amount of distrust feeling be fatal to great work think distrusted one till separation came when did come be not caused by be not blaming one now said other men who have be brought up with opinion altogether different even with different instinct a to politics who from mother milk have be nourished on code of thought altogether opposed to other can not work together with confidence even though may desire same thing very idea be sweet a honey to one be bitter a gall to other think then that made great mistake will not say that said mr monk there be difficulty at time that difficulty be overcome government be carried on be on whole respected history will give credit for patriotism patience courage man must have done better than did probably other man of day so well be not great part to play duke in nervousness a said must not avoid use of questioning tone requires answer great enough to satisfy heart of man who have fortified against evil side of ambition after what be that prime minister of such country a must chiefly regard be not prosperity of country be not often that want great measure new arrangement will be vital to country politician now look for grievance not because grievance be heavy trusting that honour of abolishing may be great be old story of needy knife grinder who if left to must have grievance of to complain there be grievance said duke look at monetary denomination look at weight measure well yes will not say that everything have a yet be reduced to divine order when took office three year ago certainly did not intend to settle difficulty indeed said duke sadly did do that meant to do for own part there be only one thing in that regret one only must regret also till have resolved to remedy what thing be that own retirement from official life if country be to lose service for long course of year during will probably sit in parliament then will think that country have lost more than have gained by coalition duke sat for while silent looking at view before answering mr monk while arranging answer once twice in half absent way called companion attention to scene before during time be going through act of painful repentance be condemning for word two have be ill spoken by since moment of utterance have never ceased to remember with shame told now after own secret fashion that must do penance for word by humiliation of direct contradiction of must declare that caesar must at future time be prepared to serve under pompey then made answer mr monk said must be false if be to deny that plea to hear say so have thought much of for last two three month may probably have seen be not man endowed with fortitude enables many to bear vexation with easy spirit be given to fretting be inclined to think that popular minister in free country must be so constituted a to be free from infirmity will certainly never desire to be at head of government again for few year must prefer to remain out of office will endeavour to look forward to time when may again perhaps be of humble use
