forgive dealing with pallisers be published in two year before nina by time began writing nina shortly after tour of europe trollope be master at chronicling habit foible custom way of life of chosen subject nina balatka be on surface love story not unusual theme for trollope romance courtship be woven throughout previous work often with two three even more pair of lover per novel most of hero heroine after facing numerous hurdle often of own making be eventually happily united by next to last chapter few be doomed to disappointment johnny eames never won heart of lily dale through two of barsetshire novel marital bliss at least prospect of bliss be usual outcome even so reader of trollope soon notice analytical description of victorian courtship marriage in circle of trollope character only wealthy must afford to marry for love without wealth have to marry for money sometimes with disastrous consequence by time of nina trollope best exploration of subject be marriage between plantagenet palliser lady glencora m'cluskie former cold fish latter hot blooded heiress in love with penniless scoundrel can forgive yet to come be disastrous marriage of intelligent lady laura standish to wealthy old maidish robert kennedy in phineas finn sequel nina balatka be different from trollope previous novel in four respect first trollope be accustomed to include in novel own witty editorial comment about various subject often paragraph even several page long such comment be found in nina second story be set in prague instead of british isle third hero heroine be already in love engaged to one at opening be not told detail about falling in love hero anton trendellsohn be successful businessman in mid thirty not typical trollopian hero in early twenty still finding besotted with love anton be rather cold a lover go seldom whispering word of endearment to nina be fourth difference really set novel apart make masterpiece enigma fourth most important difference be clearly stated in remarkable opening sentence of novel nina balatka be maiden of prague born of christian parent christian loved jew be story marriage even worse love between christian jew must have be unacceptable to victorian british reader blatant anti semitism be prevalent perhaps ubiquitous among upper class let consider origin of anti semitism jew be first allowed into england by william conqueror for while prospered largely through money lending occupation to be restricted in th century series of increasingly oppressive law tax reduced jewish community to poverty jew be expelled from england in be not allowed to return until when oliver cromwell authorized entry over objection of british merchant legal protection for jew increased gradually even act for more effectual suppressing of blasphemy profaneness recognized practice of judaism a legal there be probably only few hundred jew in entire country british jewish community grew gradually effort to emancipate jew be included in various reform act in first half of th century although many failed to become law gradually jew be admitted to bar other profession full citizenship right including right to sit in parliament be granted in only seven year before trollope began writing nina balatka by time wealthy jewish family be growing in number upward mobility increasing economic political power doubt made british upper class envious resentful fuelling anti semitism trollope chose to have nina published anonymously in blackwood magazine for reason described in autobiography from commencement of success a writer have always felt injustice in literary affair have never afflicted even suggested to while be unsuccessful seemed to that name once earned carried with too much favour injustice struck did not consist in be withheld from in be given to felt that aspirant coming up below might do work a good a mine probably much better work yet fail to have appreciated in order to test determined to be such aspirant myself to begin course of novel anonymously in order might see whether must succeed in obtaining second identity whether a have made one mark by such literary ability a possessed might succeed in doing so again why did trollope start new career with novel whose central theme be subject of distaste at best more likely revulsion to vast majority of reading public perhaps nature of novel led to consider publishing anonymously although know be not averse to controversial subject in first book macdermots of ballycloran thought have best plot of novel principal female character be seduced by scoundrel dy giving birth to illegitimate child certainly nina be well suited for experiment because of be different setting subject matter perhaps further to disguise authorship trollope wrote nina in style of prose read almost like translation from foreign language experiment did not last long enough to test trollope hypothesis mr hutton critic for spectator recognized trollope a author so stated in review trollope did not deny accusation one can not discus nina balatka without addressing question be trollope anti semitic careful reading of work doe not provide clear answer jew appear in of book be referred to in others often a disreputable character money lender be seldom mentioned by christian character with respect probably realistically reflecting sentiment of class wrote about of greatest villain in later novel melmotte in way live now lopez in prime minister be rumored to be jewish trollope never unequivocally identifies a jewish perhaps christian character expect to be jewish because be foreigner villain however if one ignores dialogue of character even descriptive editorial comment by trollope at first seem anti semitic consistently us jew a pejorative adjective instead of jewish description of appearance of jewish character be usually unflattering stereotypical even anton trendellsohn hero of nina balatka be described a follows to who know outward type of race there must be doubt that anton trendellsohn be very jew among jew be certainly handsome man not now very young having reached year certainly in advance of thirty face be full of intellect be slightly made below middle height be well made in limb with small foot hand small ear well turned neck be very dark dark a man can be yet show sign of colour in blood white man must be more dark swarthy than anton trendellsohn eye however be quite black be very bright jet black hair a clustered round ear have in something of curl have be allowed to grow must almost have hung in ringlet be worn very short a though owner be jealous even of curl anton trendellsohn be decidedly handsome man eye be somewhat too close together in face bridge of aquiline nose be not sharply cut a be mostly case with nose on christian face olive oval face be without doubt face of jew mouth be greedy teeth be perfect bright movement of man body be movement of jew be not typical description of romantic hero of victorian novel even so trollope description of anton be le derogatory than description of ezekiel brehgert character in later novel way live now be fat greasy man good looking in certain degree about fifty with hair dyed black beard moustache dyed dark purple colour charm of face consisted in pair of very bright black eye be however set too near together in face for general delight of christian be stout fat over rather than corpulent have that look of command in face have become common to master butcher probably by long intercourse with sheep ox case for trollope being anti semitic be harder to support however when one considers behavior of jewish character brehgert whose physical description above be stereotypic be one of few character in way live now whose action be completely honorable trollope wrote novel before nina balatka only two of contain jewish character first who play minor role in orley farm be soloman aram attorney victorian rumpole known for defending accused at old bailey skill be needed to defend lady mason against charge of perjury much to distaste of christian advisor act with dignity show great consideration for personal comfort of lady mason during trial second jewish character in trollope novel be mr hart london tailor who run for seat in parliament in rachel ray served purpose in plot situation probably be included because legislation to allow jew to serve in parliament have be passed only five year before issue be still one of public discussion mr hart appearance be brief speaks only one two line reader be not told enough about to judge character trollope describes thus then jewish hero tailor came among astonished mind by ease volubility of speech did not pronounce word with of soft slushy judaic utterance by have be taught to believe must disgrace nose be not hookey with especial hook be thicker at bridge than be becoming be dapper little man with bright eye quick motion ready tongue very new hat seemed that knew well how to canvas have smile good word for enemy a well a friend in novel trollope comment on prejudice bigotry mr ray in quiet way expressed much joy that mr comfort son in law must have be successful that baslehurst must not have disgraced by connection with jew to have appeared monstrous that one must have be even permitted to show in town a candidate for representation to such must have denied civil right almost social right for true spirit of persecution one must always go to woman milder sweeter more loving more womanly woman stronger will be that spirit within strong love for thing loved necessitates strong hatred for thing hated thence come spirit of persecution in england who be now keenest against jew who must again take from right that have lately won be certainly who think most of faith of christian most deadly enemy of roman catholic be who love best religion a protestant when look to individual always find so though hardly suit to admit a much when discus subject broadly to mr ray be wonderful that jew must have be entertained in baslehurst a future member for borough that must have be admitted to speak aloud within few yard of church tower nina balatka present sharp contrast between behavior of jewish christian character nina father josef balatka live on edge of poverty be cheated out of business by christian brother in law who be now wealthy josef only source of money be to sell house to anton trendellsohn father who for many year have allowed josef nina to remain in house without paying rent nina christian relative use form of deceit in attempt to turn anton against nina nina aunt sophie spews invective in direction tell nina impudent girl brazen faced impudent bad girl do not know that must bring disgrace upon to nina father say tell that at once josef may know have sanction for for for accursed abomination to husband say oh hate do hate anything be fair against jew during meeting with anton exclaims how dare come here to talk of love be filthy be worse than filthy be profane anton family also opposes marriage anton father behavior toward be in sharp contrast to of aunt old man heart be softened towards must not bring to say word to of direct encouragement kissed before went telling that be good girl bidding have care a to house in kleinseite a long a lived father father must not be disturbed anton being more businessman than lover at time behaves insensitively toward nina otherwise throughout novel jewish character act with honesty kindness even jewish maiden who want to marry anton doe not scheme to break up engagement to nina rather befriends nina eventually save life one have to wonder whether trollope intended contrast to induce reader to reconsider prejudice consider perception of duty a writer criticism of work offered by hawthorne whether just unjust describes with wonderful accuracy purport have ever have in view in writing have always desired to 'hew out lump of earth to make men woman walk upon just a do walk here among with not more of excellence with exaggerated baseness so that reader might recognise human being like to not feel to be carried away among god demon if must do then thought might succeed in impregnating mind of novel reader with feeling that honesty be best policy that truth prevails while falsehood fails that girl will be loved a be pure sweet unselfish that man will be honoured a be true honest brave of heart thing meanly done be ugly odious thing nobly done beautiful gracious there be many who must laugh at idea of novelist teaching virtue nobility for instance who regard reading of novel a sin also who think to be simply idle pastime look upon teller of story a among tribe of who pander to wicked pleasure of wicked world have regarded art from so different point of view have ever thought of a preacher of sermon pulpit a one must make salutary agreeable to audience do believe that girl have risen from reading of page le modest than be before that may have learned from that modesty be charm well worth preserving think that youth have be taught that in falseness flashness be to be found road to manliness may perhaps have learned from that be to be found in truth high gentle spirit such be lesson have striven to teach have thought that might best be done by representing to reader character like to might liken given trollope philosophy be reasonable to believe that action of character must speak louder than word if so trollope might well have be holding up mirror to audience that might examine own prejudice unfortunately will never know anthony trollope

fortune be in kleinseite narrow portion of town lie on other side of river moldau further side be from so called old new town on western side of river immediately under great hill of hradschin old town new town be thus on one side of river kleinseite hradschin on other to who know prague need not here be explained that street of kleinseite be wonderful in picturesque architecture wonderful in light shade wonderful in strange mixture of shop palace now ala also of austrian barrack wonderful in intricacy great steepness of ascent balatka house stood in small courtyard near to river altogether hidden from somewhat to right of main street of kleinseite a pas over bridge lane for be little more turning from main street between side wall of what be once two palace come suddenly into small square from corner of square there be open stone archway leading into court in court be door door a may say of house in balatka lived with daughter nina opposite to two door be blind wall of residence balatka house occupied two side of court other window therefore besides own looked either upon upon aspect of place be such a to strike with wonder stranger to prague that in heart of so large city there must be abode so sequestered so isolated so desolate yet so close to thickest throng of life there be others such perhaps many others such in prague nina balatka who have be born there thought nothing of quaintness of abode immediately over little square stood palace of hradschin wide spreading residence of old king of bohemia now habitation of ex emperor of house of hapsburg who must surely find thousand chamber of royal mansion too wide retreat for use of old age so immediately did imperial hill tower over spot on balatka lived that must seem at night when moon be shining a shine only at prague that colonnade of palace be upper storey of enormous edifice of broken merchant small courtyard formed lower portion long row of window must glimmer in sheen of night nina must stand in gloom of archway counting till must seem to be uncountable wondering what might be thought of who abode there who abode there be few in number thought be hardly worthy of nina speculation window of king palace look out from many chamber window of hradschin look out a be told from thousand room within have seldom many tenant tenant perhaps many thought chamber after chamber will pas through by score know by sign unconsciously recognised that there be not never have be true habitation within window almost innumerable be there that may be seen from outside such be use of palace a must look must people room with throng of bright inhabitant must think of joy of happy girl who be loved by christian youth who must dare to tell friend of love nina balatka be coward have already determined that must at once tell love to who have right to know in what way intended to dispose of a to father if only must have be alone in matter must have have hope of compromise must have made not absolutely necessary that must separate from for ever in giving to anton trendellsohn josef balatka must doubtless express horror must feel shame that daughter must love jew though have not scrupled to allow nina to go frequently among people to use service with for staving off ill consequence of own idleness ill fortune be meek broken man be so accustomed to yield to nina at last might have yielded to even in there be however that madame zamenoy aunt aunt with bitter tongue there be ziska zamenoy cousin rich handsome cousin who must so soon declare willing to become more than cousin if nina must give one nod of encouragement smile of welcome nina hated christian lover cousin though be a warmly a loved jew nina indeed loved none of zamenoys cousin ziska very christian aunt sophie with bitter tongue prosperous money loving acutely mercantile uncle karil nevertheless be in degree so subject to that knew that be bound to tell what path in life meant to tread madame zamenoy have offered to take niece to prosperous house in windberg gasse when old house in kleinseite have become poor desolate though generous offer have be most fatuously declined most wickedly declined a aunt sophie used to declare nevertheless other favour have be vouchsafed other favour have be accepted with sore injury to nina pride a thought of standing in gloom of evening under archway remembered that very frock wore have be sent to by aunt in spite of bitter tongue in spite of ziska derision must tell tale must tell soon knew own courage trusted dreadful a hour must be must not put off by one moment a soon a anton must desire to declare purpose must declare a who stand on precipice contemplating expediency of throwing from rock will feel gradually seized by mad desire to do deed out of hand at once so did nina feel anxious to walk off to windberg gasse dare endure that zamenoys must say do knew thought knew that persecution must not go now beyond work of tongue priest must immure law must touch because be minded to marry jew even people in day be mild forbearing in usage with jew thought that girl of kleinseite must not tear clothes from back even when knew of love one thing however be certain though rag must be torn from though priest might have special power given to persecute though zamenoys in wrath must be able to crush even though own father must refuse to see must be true to jew love to must be so sacred that other sacredness must be able to touch sanctity have thought much of love have never loved before now loved heart soul belonged to to whom have devoted suffering might be before though be suffering unto death must endure if lover demanded such endurance hitherto there be one person who suspected in father house there still remained old dependant who though be man be cook housemaid washer woman servant of work perhaps must be more true to say that nina between did that requirement of house demanded souchey for be name be very faithful with fidelity have come want of reverence towards master mistress absence of respectful demeanour enjoyment of apparent independence by souchey went far perhaps in lieu of wage nina said to one morning be

difficulty to be known to who belonged to a girl who have given to jew be now late in evening moon be shining brightly on palace over against colonnade seemed to be so close to that there must hardly be room for portion of city to cluster between river stood looking up at great building fell again into trick of counting window thereby saving while from difficult task of following out train of thought be window of palace to so walked on again till reached spot on bridge at almost always paused moment to perform little act of devotion there having place in long row of huge statue adorn bridge be figure of martyr st john nepomucene who at spot be thrown into river because must not betray secret of queen confession be drowned who have ever be from period downwards favourite saint of

water a far at least a special transit of river may be perilous nina a child have always touched stone then touched lip did act without much thought a to saving power of st john nepomucene now a carried hand up to face did think of deed have who be about to marry jew right to ask for assistance of christian saint must such deed that now proposed to put beyond pale of christian aid must madonna desert must marry jew if be to become truer than ever to faith more diligent more thoughtful more constant in act of devotion must blessed mary help to save even though must commit great sin must mild eyed sweet saviour who have forgiven so many woman who have saved from cruel death woman taken in adultery who have be so gracious to samaritan woman at well must turn from graciousness of

to have not thing gone too far with for such thought to be useful loved jew have told so not penalty with priest might threaten must lessen love make think of safety here hereafter a thing to be compared with love religion be much to fear of everlasting wrath of heaven be much to love be paramount what if be soul must not give even soul for love if for love sake soul must be required from when reached archway have made up mind that must tell aunt first that must do so early on following day be to tell father first father might probably forbid to speak on subject to madame zamenoy thinking that own eloquence that of priest might prevail to put end to so terrible iniquity so madame zamenoy might never learn tidings nina thinking of being quite determined that zamenoys must know what intended to tell resolved that must say nothing on night at home be very late nina said father to crossly a soon a entered room in lived be wide apartment having in now little furniture two

injustice in father remark a for seeing often father have done because business have required when be ill in april have to be there almost daily need not have gone to night did not send for be needful that something must be done to get for be own a said there came to sting of conscience thought reminded that though be not lying to father in word be in fact deceiving remembering assertion to lover

twenty one on first of coming month therefore must be free a anton told to do with a pleased still there came over cold feeling of fear when aunt spoke to of police law might give police power over be

zamenoy when nina left sat in solitary consideration for twenty minute then called for chief confidant lotta luxa with many expression of awe with much denunciation of niece iniquity told to lotta what have heard speaking of a one who be utterly lost abandoned lotta however did not express so much indignant surprise a mistress expected though be willing enough to join in abuse against nina balatka come of letting girl go about just a please among men said lotta jew said madame zamenoy if have be kind of christian must understand have hold upon upon father said lotta jew have be to

madame zamenoy one be not altogether unpleasant to eye that niece must have promised to jew be dreadful that niece must be afterwards jilted by jew be poor remedy still be remedy therefore listened if nothing else can be done must perhaps put against said lotta luxa madame zamenoy on occasion said little more agreed with servant that must be better to resort to mean than to submit to degradation of alliance with jew chapter iii on third day after nina visit to aunt ziska zamenoy came across to kleinseite on visit to old balatka in mean time nina have told story of love to father effect on balatka have simply be that have not got out of bed since for must have cared perhaps little a to jewish marriage have not known that belonging to must have cared so much have strong religious prejudice of own indeed have strong feeling of kind loved daughter wished well even for have be unable to exert in younger day now simply expected from hand comfort remained to in world priest knew

must have be half inclined to let girl marry jew souchey indeed have frightened on subject when have first be mentioned to nina coming with own assurance so quickly after souchey suspicion have upset feeling in regard to nina have none of bitter anger touch of abhorrence animated breast of sister in law when ziska came to be alone in bedroom ziska have heard news a have household in windberg gasse have come over to uncle house to see what must do by own diplomacy to put end to engagement be to doubly calamitous uncle josef said sitting by old man bed have heard what nina be doing what be doing

knew that uncle cousin be very poor have halted in love because be ashamed of poverty have never thought of a people hungry from want of food cold from want of clothes may be said of to credit that love have be too strong for shame that have made up mind to marry cousin nina in spite of poverty when lotta luxa have called calf have not inappropriately defined one side of character be good looking well grown young man not very wise quickly susceptible to female influence gifted with eye capable of convincing that nina balatka be by far prettiest woman whom ever saw in connection with such calf like propensity ziska be endowed with something of mother bitterness of father persistency old zamenoys did not fear that fortune of family must prosper in hand of son when be known to madame zamenoy to husband karil that ziska have set heart upon having cousin have expressed no displeasure at prospect poor a balatkas be there be knowing how may go about house in kleinseite karil zamenoy have said old trendellsohn get rent interest have little nothing to show for merely written surrender from josef be worth nothing hindrance therefore be placed in way of ziska suit nina might have be already accepted in windberg gasse have nina chosen to smile upon ziska now ziska be told that girl loved be to marry jew because be starving tidings threw new light upon why have not offered assistance to nina be not surprising that nina must be so hard to to who have a yet offered nothing in poverty few cold compliment will have bread enough if be what want said ziska bread kindness said old man will have kindness too uncle josef love nina better than jew in prague can love why must not jew love believe man love well why else must wish to make wife love well must make wife want to marry nina yes uncle josef wish to marry nina will marry to morrow for matter to day if will have ziska zamenoy ziska zamenoy what must mother say father mother will consent there need be hindrance if nina will agree did not know that be so badly off did not indeed must have come to seen to old balatka did not answer for while having turned in bed to think of proposition have be made to must not like to have for son in law better than jew uncle josef said ziska pleading for a best knew how to plead have ever spoken to nina said old man well no not exactly to say what have said to when one love girl a love somehow know how be ready to do so at once ah ziska if have done sooner be too late say have taken up with man because be so poor can not like jew best be true so true if mean about promise to trendellsohn father jerome must tell in minute that must not keep such promise to jew must not mind father jerome what doe mind will not mind yes will mind to give food will not obey how be to bid obey will try ziska must not wish to marry jew ziska certainly must not wish will give consent yes if be good to will be good if will be round with telling that must not do thing a love jew be impossible a have be so very poor may be forgiven for having thought of tell uncle josef do be firm with there be in next room said father who have heard daughter entrance ziska face have assumed something of defiant look while be recommending firmness to old man now that girl of whom have spoken be so near at hand there returned to brow young calf like expression with lotta luxa be so well acquainted there be will speak to now said balatka ziska got up to go a did so fumbled in pocket brought forth little bundle of bank note bundle of bank note in prague may be not little yet represent very little money when bank note be passed for two penny become thick with use man may have great mass of paper currency in pocket without being rich on occasion however ziska tendered to uncle two penny note there be note for five florin two three for two florin perhaps dozen for florin so that total amount offered be sufficient to be of real importance to one so poor a josef balatka will help awhile said ziska if nina will come round be good girl will want anything need not be afraid of mother if will only do a say balatka have put out hand have taken money when bedroom door be opened nina came in what ziska said be here why not why must not see uncle be very good of certainly only a never came before mean for kindness now have come at rate said ziska then will take for kindness said nina why must there be quarrelling among relative said old man from among bed clothes why indeed said ziska why indeed said nina if must be helped knew that outward serenity of word spoken be too good to be fair representation of thought below in mind of of must not be that ziska have come there to express even own consent to marriage with anton trendellsohn without such consent there must of necessity be continuation of quarrelling have be speaking to father ziska about paper nina be determined that there must be glozing of matter soft word used effectually to stop in projected course so rushed at once at subject thought most important in ziska presence what paper said ziska paper belong to anton trendellsohn about house others be must not wish to keep thing belong to even though must be jew then occurred to ziska trendellsohn might be willing to give up nina if got paper nina might be willing to be free from jew by same arrangement must not be that girl a nina balatka must prefer love of jew to love of christian so at least ziska argued in own mind want to keep anything belongs to anybody said ziska if paper be with be willing that must be given up be if be right that must be given up be right said nina believe trendellsohns must have father son said old balatka of course must have said nina father son make matter will try see to said ziska pray do said nina will be only just one must not wish to rob even jew suppose ziska understood nothing of what be intended by tone of voice began to think that there might really be ground for hope nina said father be not quite well want to speak to in next room certainly ziska if wish father will come again to soon souchey be making soup will bring to when be ready then led way into sitting room a ziska came through carefully shut door wall dividing room be very thick door stood in deep recess so that sound must be heard from one room to nina did not wish that father must hear what might now pas between herself cousin therefore be careful to shut door close ziska said a soon a be together be very glad that have come here aunt be so angry with can not speak with uncle karil only snub if say word to about business must snub doubt worse than ever now yet who be there here to speak of such matter if may not do so see how be with father be not able to do much suppose be able to hing there be nothing for to hing can be of use of course must see that who have be good to be not be not injured because of kindness mean jew trendellsohns yes jew trendellsohns must not rob man because be jew said repeating old word know how to take care of nina very likely have managed to get father property between know how be father say that business uncle have be once that made in matter weakest always go to wall father have son to help a uncle karil have old trendellsohn may help better than son will help if can will uncle give up paper have kept since father left with uncle karil just that might be safe question ziska must not answer at once matter be one on wished to negotiate be driven to necessity of considering what might be best line for diplomacy be sure ziska continued nina will understand why ask father be too weak to make demand uncle must listen to nothing that anton trendellsohn must say to say that have betrothed to jew nina be true have nothing to do with be very anxious to have deed of course be anxious father be old poorly what must do if father be to die nina will have if will give up nina turned away from cousin looked out from window into little court ziska must not see face have done so must not have be able to read smile of triumph with for moment two became brilliant anton must make such bargain a anton loved better than title deed have not told that be sun sun gave to light heat if be own why must be asked to make such bargain said nina nina said ziska throwing passion into voice a best knew how can not be that must love man why not love jew yes jew do love nina what have to say ziska say abuse be affair not yours may think what like of for taking such husband remember that be to be husband nina let be husband ziska can not be love love fifty time better than can do be not christian love better than jew because love can there be other reason in matter love care if never see love with heart to see be only delight of life to sit beside with hand in mine head on shoulder be heaven to to obey be duty to serve be pleasure to be loved by be only good thing god have given on earth now ziska will know why can not be wife still stood before still looked up into face keeping gaze upon even after word be finished accursed jew said ziska be right ziska curse be so easy too will be cursed here hereafter if marry jew will be accursed to eternity that too be very easy to say be not who say priest will tell same let tell so be business be not yours say because can not have what want be when will call in ross markt for paper in ross markt be house of business of karil zamenoy there a nina well knew be kept document be so anxious to obtain demand at moment be made simply with object of vexing ziska urging on to further anger unless will give up anton trendellsohn have better not come to ross markt will never give up will see perhaps will give up after while will be fine thing to be jilted by jew jew at rate will not be jilted by christian now if please will ask to go choose to be insulted in father house be house still nina will give one more chance can give chance will do good if will go be want of now for moment two ziska stood in doubt a to what must next do say then took up hat went away without word on same evening one rang bell at door of house in windberg gasse in most humble manner with weak hesitating hand by tone produce seems to insinuate that one need hurry to answer appeal that answer when made may be made by lowest personage in house in instance however lotta luxa did answer bell not stout bohemian girl who acted in household of madame zamenoy a assistant fag to lotta lotta found nina at door enveloped in cloak lotta said will kindly give to cousin ziska then not waiting for word started away so quickly that lotta have not chance of speaking to power of uttering audible word of abuse when ziska opened parcel thus brought to found to contain note have given to josef balatka chapter iv when nina returned to father after ziska departure very few word made everything clear between must not have if there be not man in world nina have said think that be only anton trendellsohn prevents know nothing about

result confession have led till have delivered packet into hand of lotta luxa maintained spirit by excitement of thing be doing though must die in street of hunger must take money from ziska zamenoy question now be not only of want of father that for must be justified in returning ziska money there must be doubt be equally justified in giving back money have be given to father a walked to windberg gasse still holding parcel of note in hand have such qualm of conscience a returned when be altogether too late for repentance made picture to herself of terrible scene in father suffered pang of want because have compelled to part with money if be to say one word to anton trendellsohn trouble on head must be over anton trendellsohn must at once give enough to satisfy immediate want in month two when must be anton wife must not be ashamed to take everything from hand why must be ashamed now to take something from to whom be prepared to give everything be ashamed to do so felt that must not go to ask for bread one other resource have there remained to of mother property necklace be be left to from mother when have be given to at mother death have be specially enjoined not to

will see said souchey in mean time what be good of fighting with zamenoys be only friend nina therefore take delight in quarrelling with when people have money must be allowed to have little pride nina said nothing further on occasion though souchey father went on grumbling for hour discovered however from various word that father allowed to fall from that opposition to marriage have nearly faded away seemed to be opinion that if be to marry jew sooner did better now be determined that must marry jew though heaven earth must meet in consequence must marry if must marry have told that jew

have simply told that matter be in hand of father jerome a far a must be said to belong to church at have satisfied conscience by advising dear friend to use resource female persecution put at command will frighten out of madame zamenoy if go right way about said priest madame zamenoy be well inclined to go right way about if only knew how must make nina life burden to if must only get hold of girl must scruple at threat a to world next thought that priest ought to have done more for in such crisis than simply giving such ordinary counsel thing be not a used to be knew there be even yet something of prestige of power left to church there be convent with lock bar excommunication might still be made terrible public opinion in shape of outside persecution might a madame zamenoy thought have be brought to bear did get much more comfort from father jerome reliance be placed chiefly on operation to be carried on with jew failing on opposition jew must experience among own people think more of than do said father jerome how can that be father jerome well do must lose caste among friend by such marriage must think destroy influence among when perceives more fully will be shy enough about besides what be to get will get nothing will think better of might manage something with deed of course must have sooner later might be surrendered a price of giving up must say might be managed be not comfortable for madame zamenoy fretted fumed till husband have peace in house ziska almost wished that might hear more of jew betrothal must not even commence system of persecution a nina did not go near have already told lotta luxa that must decline to discus question of marriage further so at last madame zamenoy found obliged to go over in person to house in kleinseite such visit have for many year be very rare with since sister death day in balatkas have be prosperous have preferred that intercourse between two family must take place at own house thus a josef balatka rarely left own door have not seen for more than two year frequent intercourse however have be maintained aunt sophie knew very well how thing be going on in kleinseite lotta have compunction a to visiting house lotta eye be very sharp nina have be frequently in windberg gasse having believed to be duty to attend to aunt behest be no longer obedient madame zamenoy be compelled to go to brother in law unless

too conspicuous at arched gate in little square carriage did not often make way over bridge into kleinseite being used chiefly among suburb of new town where be now well known quickly recognised did not think that be good opportunity for breaking into new ground with equipage summoned lotta to attend after one o'clock dinner took umbrella in hand went forth be stout woman probably not more than forty five year of age little heavy perhaps from too much indulgence with carriage walked slowly therefore lotta who be nimble of foot quick in way thanked star that did not suit mistress to walk often through city how very long bridge be lotta said madame zamenoy not longer ma'be than always have be said lotta pertly of course be not longer than always have be know that still say be very long bridge be not so long in other place not where river be narrower said lotta madame zamenoy trudged on finding that must get comfort from servant at last reached balatka door lotta who be familiar with

about to befall be making ready for visit be well aware that must be sorely perplexed a to what must say in coming interview must not speak lightly of such evil a marriage with jew when sister in law must abuse jew must dare to defend must bring to say evil word of nina to hear evil word spoken of without making attempt to screen might be best perhaps to lie under bed clothes say nothing if only sister in law must allow to lie there be to come in with aunt sophie said nina yes child said aunt come hear have to say to father so nina followed aunt lotta souchey be left in sitting room how be souchey said lotta with unusual kindness of tone suppose be not so busy can stay with few minute while be in there there be not so much to do can not spare time said souchey nothing to do suppose le

not forbidden to think of marrying jew have not said nina josef answer for like man said madame zamenoy have not forbidden marriage do not forbid now let at rate hear say that have forbidden balatka found silence to be easiest course answered not at what be to think of continued madame zamenoy can not be that wish child to be wife of jew be to think aunt sophie that father be ill that can not stand against violence violence wicked girl be be violent will come out into parlour aunt will not come out into parlour will not stir from spot till have told father think about ill indeed what matter illness when be question of eternal damnation madame zamenoy put so much stress upon latter word that brother in law almost jumped from under bed clothes nina raised a be standing to full height smile of derision came upon face oh yes daresay mind said madame zamenoy daresay can laugh now at pain of hell castaway such a be always blind to own danger father hope have not fallen so far a to care nothing for religion though seems to have forgotten what be due to family have forgotten nothing said old balatka why then do not forbid to do thing demanded madame zamenoy old man have recognised too well comparative security of silence to be drawn into argument therefore merely hid more completely among clothes be to get answer from josef said madame zamenoy answer came therefore be driven to turn again upon nina why be doing thing poor deluded creature be man money that tempts be not man money if money must tempt must have elsewhere a know can not be love for such man a do not know that father between have robbed father of everything know nothing of kind have be now making fool of in order that may get remains nothing remains will get nothing will believe that after will ever marry will not be such fool perhaps not aunt in case will have wish one can ever speak to again after such condition do think that uncle must have at house when world will know that have be jilted by jew will not trouble by going to house be that satisfaction be to have what do want to say want to say that will give man up return to duty a christian will never give up never must sooner die very well then will know how to act will not be bit nearer marrying can promise that be mistaken if think that in such matter a girl like can do just a plea then turned again upon poor man in bed josef balatka be ashamed of be indeed be ashamed of aunt sophie said nina now that be here can say what please to might a well spare father will not spare be ashamed of thoroughly ashamed of can think of when will lie there not say word to save daughter from machination of filthy jew anton trendellsohn be not filthy jew be robber have cheated father out of everything be robber have cheated one know who have cheated father if come to whom do mean hussey will not answer need not tell more about jew cheating christian can cheat a well a jew can rob from own flesh blood too care for threat aunt sophie for frown did care for have said that make impossible must regard further be what get for trouble for uncle generosity again nina smiled suppose jew give more than have given therefore be preferred poor creature poor wretched creature during time balatka remained silent at last after very much more scolding in madame zamenoy urged again again terrible threat of eternal punishment prepared for going lotta luxa said where be lotta luxa opened door found lotta luxa seated demurely by window lotta said will go now will never come back to unfortunate house hear what say will never return here a make bed so must lie on be own doing one can save for part think that jew have bewitched like enough said lotta when once stray from holy church there be knowing what terrible evil may come upon said madame zamenoy indeed ma'be said lotta luxa have done in power that have ma'be feel quite sure lotta that jew will never marry why must man like who love money better than soul marry girl who have not kreutzer to bless why indeed ma'be be mind that think of marrying jew a be care for religion will not bring trouble upon everybody belonging to by taking christian for wife that will not ma'be may be sure said lotta where will be then only fancy lotta to have be jilted by jew then madame zamenoy without addressing directly to nina walked out of room a did so paused in doorway again spoke to lotta to be jilted by jew lotta think of must drown said lotta luxa then be gone idea that jew might jilt disturbed nina more than aunt anger than threat a to penalty might have to encounter in next world felt certain delight inward satisfaction in giving up everything for jew lover satisfaction be more intense more absolute be rejection more crushing scorn encountered on behalf from own people to encounter rejection scorn then to be thrown over by jew be more than must endure must must be so sat down to think of a thought of terrible fear came upon old trendellsohn have told that marriage on son part must bring into great trouble old trendellsohn be not harsh with a aunt be harsh old man in own communication with have always be kind forbearing then anton be severe to though must now again say dear well to be remembered happy word a when told that be sun that looked to for warmth light such soft speaking be few with far between then never mentioned time a probable date of marriage if only time must be fixed let be ever so distant nina thought that must still endure cutting taunt of enemy what must do if anton be to announce to day that found a jew unable to marry with a christian in such case thought that must drown a lotta have suggested to a sat thinking of eye suddenly fell upon one key possessed with woman acuteness of memory perceived to have be moved from spot on have left be key of little desk stood in corner of parlour in on top of paper be deposited necklace with intended to relieve immediate necessity of household at once remembered that lotta have be left for long time in room with anxious quick suspicion went to desk suspicion have wronged lotta there lying on bundle of letter be necklace in exact position in have left kissed trinket have come to from mother replaced carefully put key into pocket what must do next how must conduct in present circumstance heart prompted to go off at once to anton trendellsohn tell everything greatly feared that anton must not be glad to see knew that be not well that girl must run after lover yet how be to live without seeing what other comfort have from whom else must look for guidance declared to herself at last that in position must not be stayed by ordinary feeling of maiden reserve must tell everything even to threat on aunt have so much depended must then ask for counsel must describe to if word from must describe difficulty must promise to be guided by absolutely in everything everything must say to have given up for be yours entirely body soul do with a will if must then tell that must not have that did not want sacrifice must go away from drown must not go to to day no not to day not perhaps to morrow be day two a yet since have be over at trendellsohns house though on occasion have not seen anton anton of course must know that have be there did not wish to think that be hunting must wait yet two three day till next sunday morning perhaps then must go again to jew quarter on christian sabbath anton be always at home a on day business be suspended in prague for christian jew then went back to father be still lying with face turned to wall nina thinking that slept took up work sat by side be awake watching be gone said before needle have be plied dozen time aunt sophie yes father have gone hope will not come again say that will never come again what be use of coming here be lost be perishing be utterly gone will not help why must disturb with curse father there may be better day for yet how can there be better day when be bringing down jew upon better day for perhaps if mere eating drinking will serve oh father have not ruined everything with jew lover did not hear how be treated what must say to aunt when stood there reviled father be so grateful to for saying nothing knew that be right christian must not marry jew said be abominable so be father father speak like thought that have forgiven said to aunt sophie be good daughter will not say same to to myself be not good to love jew do love father how can help now can not change heart suppose will be dead soon said old balatka then will not matter will become one of will be forgotten father have ever forgotten said nina throwing upon on bed have not always loved have not be good to oh father have be true to other through speak to like at last chapter vi anton trendellsohn have learned from father that nina have spoken to aunt about title deed of house in kleinseite thus in roundabout way demand have be made for of course will not give up have said to father why must unless law make have idea of honour honesty to one of elder jew have then expressed opinion that josef balatka must be required to make demand a matter of business to enforce legal right to anton have replied that old man in kleinseite be not in condition to act efficiently in matter be to that money have be advanced to zamenoys that have in truth be paid anton declared purpose of going to karil zamenoy making demand then there have be discussion almost amounting to quarrel between two trendellsohns a to nina balatka poor nina need not have added to many cause of suffering by doubting lover truth anton trendellsohn though not given to speak of love with demonstrative vehemence to nina have trusted in attempt to make friend understand that must not be talked out of engagement be nevertheless sufficiently firm in purpose be man very constant in purpose whom none who knew must have supposed likely to jeopardise worldly interest for love of christian girl who be very little apt to abandon aught to have set hand because voice of around might be against have thought much of position a jew before have spoken of love to penniless christian maiden who frequented father house pleading for father in poverty word when spoken meant much nina need not have feared that must forget be man not much given to dalliance not requiring from day to day soft sweetness of woman presence to keep love warm love must maintain own heat without softness dalliance have not be so such girl a nina must hardly have surrendered to whole heart a have done will fall into trouble about maiden elder trendellsohn have said true father there will be trouble enough in what that do be there not trouble man in business of life must encounter labour grief disappointment must take to wife to give ease in thing not one who will be increase to sorrow that be done be done son thing be not done have plighted word father be not that enough nina be good girl will say for that be very good have wished that might have brought to house a wife child of old friend baltazar if may not be must have taken nina willingly by hand have be one of may be that god will open eye anton must not have eye opened by anything so weak a love for man have said that be good will hear reason when will know that marriage among must bring trouble on will restrain wish speak to anton see if be not so not for wealth people own in bohemia father to do so must be to demand not to ask if love must refuse such request be to ask will speak word to nina son request will come from if doe will never yield to for sake must not yield for know love neither for own must yield for a truly a worship god love better than world beside be to cup of water when be hot athirst morsel of bread when be faint with hunger voice be only music love touch of hand be so fresh that cool when be in fever kiss of lip be so sweet balmy that cure when shake with ague fit to think of when be out among men fighting for own be such joy now methinks now have have belonging to must no longer fight be to lose father will not be taken from love will keep oh that nina must have heard how must sorrow have fled from left happy in poverty anton trendellsohn though must speak after manner to father must hardly bring to talk of feeling to woman who must have given eye must for sake have spared to hear now again indeed must say word then must frown become gloomy a though angry with for such outward womanly expression of what felt a be word fell upon ear delighted not then son will live to rue day in first saw said elder jew will be bone of contention in way will separate from friend will become jew christian will be odious alike to will be same then father will bear sorrow together yes what happens when sorrow come from such cause man learns to hate woman who have caused ill us feel to be cain upon earth condemned by by none so much a by do think that have strength to bear contempt of around anton waited moment two before answered then spoke very slowly if be necessary to bear so much will at least make effort may be that will find strength nothing then that father say to avail aught nothing father on matter must have spoken sooner then must go own way a for must look for son to bear burden of year so parted anton trendellsohn understood well meaning of old man threat be quite alive to fact that father have expressed intention to give wealth standing in trade business of house to younger jew who must be more true than own son to traditional custom of tribe there be ruth jacobi granddaughter only child of house who have already reached age at might be betrothed there be samuel son of baltazar old trendellsohn oldest friend anton trendellsohn did not doubt who might be adopted child to be taken to fill place have be already explained that there be partnership actually existing between two trendellsohns by degree son have slipt into father place business by house have grown rich have for last five six year be managed chiefly by actual result of son industry son thrift be still in possession of father old man might doubt go far towards ruining son if be so minded dream of high ambition have from very early year flitted across mind of younger trendellsohn till have nearly formed into settled purpose have heard of jew in vienna in paris in london who be a true to religion a jew of prague who did not live immured in jew quarter like leper separate alone in loathed corner of city otherwise clean men went abroad into world a men using wealth with industry have be blessed openly a christian used lived among christian a one man must live with fellow men on equal term giving taking honouring honoured a yet be not so with jew of prague who be still bound to old narrow street to dark house to mean mode of living who worst of be still subject to isolated ignominy of judaism in prague jew be still pariah anton father be rich very rich anton hardly knew what be extent of father wealth did know that be great in father time however change must be made did not scruple to speak to old man of thing spoke of rather a dream a distant hope than a being basis of purpose of own father must merely say that old house looking out upon ancient synagogue must last time that change of anton spoke must be postponed not till died till such time a must feel right to give up thing of world anton trendellsohn who knew father well have resolved that must wait patiently for everything till father must have gone to last home knowing that nothing death must close old man interest in work of life have be content to wait to wait to think to dream only in part to hope still communed with daily a to house of trendellsohn might perhaps be heard of in city greater than prague might rival in grandeur of wealth mighty commercial name have drowned old shame of jew in new glory of great doings to be jew in london have told be almost better than to be christian provided that be rich knew way of trade be better for such purpose a be purpose anton trendellsohn believed that must be rich be sure that knew way of trade therefore nursed ambition meditated what action must be when day of freedom must come to then nina balatka have come across path to be jew always jew in thing jew have be ever part of great dream be a impossible to a must be to father to forswear religion of people to go forth be great in commerce by deserting creed must have be nothing to ambition did not desire wealth so much a possession of wealth in jewish hand without restriction upon enjoyment to jew under own eye have ever be subjected must have delighted to think that by mean of work there must no longer be jew ' quarter in prague that prague must be ennobled civilised made beautiful by wealth of jew wealth must be mean therefore be greedy wealth be not last only aim therefore greed did not utterly destroy heart then nina balatka have come across path be compelled to shape dream anew how must jew among jew hold up head a such who have taken to bosom christian wife again shaped dream aright so far aright that must still build castle of imagination to own liking nina must be wife might be that must follow creed of husband then must be well in far city to must go must hardly in such case be known that have be born christian else must show world around jew christian how well christian jew might live together to crush prejudice have dealt so hardly with people to make jew equal in thing to christian be desire how must better be fulfilled than by union with christian one thing at least be fixed with one thing be fixed even though must mar dream have taken christian girl to be part of nothing must separate father have spoken often to of danger must incur by marrying christian have never before uttered word approaching to personal threat anton have felt to be so completely mainspring of business in be engaged be so perfectly aware that be so regarded by commercial men of prague that have hardly regarded absence of positive possession in father wealth a detrimental to have be willing that must be father while father lived knowing that division must be detrimental to have never even asked father for partnership taking everything for granted even now must not quite believe that father be in earnest must hardly be possible that work of own hand must be taken from because have chosen bride for felt must father persevere in intention have expressed must be upheld in by jew of prague dark ignorant foolish anton said to speaking of among whom lived be pride to live in disgrace while honour of world be open to if chose to take did not for moment think of altering course of action in consequence of what father have said to indeed a regarded business of house must stand still altogether be to alter successor must take up work when must leave other hand must continue web be of weaving so went forth a errand of day called soon after father last word be spoken went through work a though own interest in be in danger on evening nothing be said on subject between father on next morning started immediately after breakfast for ross markt in order that might see karil zamenoy a have said that must do paper must get must belong to father must at once be put into father hand feeling that might not be for own personal advantage to place there did not deter father be old man old men be given to threaten at least must go on with duty be about eleven o'clock in day when entered open door of office in ross markt found ziska young clerk sitting opposite to other at desk anton took off hat bowed to ziska whom knew slightly asked young man if father be within father be here said ziska know whether can see will ask perhaps said trendellsohn well be engaged there be lady with perhaps will make appointment with will call again if will name hour will come at own time can not say to herr trendellsohn that wish to say to not very well know be in partnership with father be happy to be so placed together if father can spare five minute will take from a favour then with apparent reluctance ziska came down from seat went into inner room there remained time while trendellsohn be standing hat in hand in outer office if change hoped to effect among brother must be made jew in prague must before long be asked to sit down a readily a christian have not be asked to sit therefore stood holding hat in hand during ten minute that ziska be away at last young zamenoy returned opening door signified to jew that father must see at once if must enter nothing more have be said about lady there when trendellsohn went into room found lady who be other than madame zamenoy little family council have be held have be settled among that jew must be seen heard so sir be anton trendellsohn began madame zamenoy a soon a ziska be gone for ziska have be told to go door be shut yes madame be anton trendellsohn have not expected honour of seeing wish to say few word on business to husband there be can speak to anything can do will be very happy said karil zamenoy who have risen from chair to prevent necessity of having to ask jew to sit down zamenoy began jew be think aware that father have purchased from friend brother in law josef balatka certain house in kleinseite in one of old man still life upon word know nothing about said zamenoy nothing be to say in

made by contract price be paid in full before house be put into hand be not in hand now a far a know not one certainly in balatka life motif of friendship friendship said madame zamenoy with sneer now motif of love continued anton have induced to leave use of house with josef balatka love said madame zamenoy springing from chair love indeed talk to of love for jew dear dear said husband

document desired be in nina hand thought possible that might be in house in kleinseite be after on card old balatka be deceiving jew be by nature suspicious though be also generous must be noble in

so stated in direct term there might be mistake in at rate must interrogate nina if there be need must not spare old man question must lead to truth trendellsohn a thought of possibility of such treachery on balatka part felt that without compunction must be very cruel even to old man under such circumstance a chapter vii madame zamenoy son doubt understood other purpose there be person in house who understood lotta luxa namely karil zamenoy have be kept somewhat in dark touching that piece of parchment a to so much anxiety have be expressed only knew that have at wife instigation given into hand in order that might use in way for putting end to foul betrothal between nina jew elder zamenoy doubt understood that anton trendellsohn be to be bought off by document be not unwilling to buy off so cheaply knowing a did that house be in truth jew property madame zamenoy scheme be deeper than did not believe that jew be to be bought off at so cheap price did believe that might be possible to create such feeling in mind a must make abandon out of working of own heart ziska mother be equally anxious to save nina from jew not exactly with same motif have received promise from father mother before anything be known of jew love that nina must be received a daughter in law if must accept suit promise be still in force that girl whom loved must love jew distressed disgusted ziska did not deter from old purpose be shocking very shocking that nina must so disgrace herself be not on account le pretty le charming in cousin eye madame zamenoy must have have own will must have rescued nina from jew firstly because nina be known over prague to be niece secondly for good of christianity generally girl when rescued must willingly have left to starve in poverty of old house in kleinseite a punishment for sin in having listened to jew must have nothing more to say to said mother to son said lotta who be present have demeaned far too much to be fit wife for ziska hold tongue lotta what business have to speak about matter said young man same ziska if be must give up said mother if be mother must not give up if man be to give up girl like because somebody else interferes

former scheme be ziska own second be that in ziska mother put chief trust if once can be made to think that girl be deceiving will quarrel with utterly madame zamenoy have said on saturday there be little business done in prague because saturday be sabbath of jew shop be of course open in main street of town bank counting house be closed because jew will not do business on day so great be preponderance of wealth of prague in hand of people suited ziska therefore to make visit on saturday because have little to do on day because must be almost sure to find trendellsohn at home a made

opposite of nina though be of height nina be fair with grey eye smooth brown hair seemed to demand special admiration though did in truth add greatly to sweet delicacy of face be soft in gait appeared to be yielding flexible in motion of body must think that if be permitted to embrace outline of body must form to yours a though must in thing fit to who might be blessed by love rebecca be dark with large dark blue eye jet black tress spoke out loud to beholder of own loveliness must not fail to think of hair of eye a though be thing almost separate from herself stood like queen who knew to be queen strong on limb wanting support somewhat hard withal with repellant beauty seemed to disdain while courted admiration utterly rejected idea of caressing assistance men always love to give woman

ornamented with plumage of strange bird on shoulder wore coloured jacket open down front sparkling with jewelled button over there hung chain with locket in ear carried long heavy earring of gold be

escaped now from project must have done so without remark be ashamed to seem afraid to enter building a girl seemed to make so light of doing so therefore followed rebecca brother in minute two be inside narrow door door be very low narrow seemed to be choked up by men with short white surplice nevertheless found inside jammed among crowd of jew sound of many voice going together in sing song wail dirge met ear first impulse be to take off hat be immediately replaced upon head knew not by whom then observed that within building be covered guide did not follow whispered to one what be that

wailed continuously never ceasing for instant in long loud melancholy song of prayer at further end there seemed to be altar in front of high priest wailed louder than louder even than old men within cage even high priest be forced to move desk to make way for ziska apparently without displeasure moved with left hand while swayed right hand backwards forward a though regulating melody of wail beyond high priest ziska saw anton trendellsohn close to son saw old man whom have met in street whom recognised a anton father old trendellsohn seemed to take notice of anton have watched from entrance be prepared to speak to though did not discontinue part in dirge till last moment have few word to say to if must suit said ziska in low voice be of import trendellsohn asked if so will come to ziska then turned to make way back saw that be not to be road for retreat behind movable phalanx have again formed into close rank before wailing wearer of white shirt be preparing for commotion of passage by grasping upright stick of movable desk in hand so passed on making entire round of synagogue when got outside crowded door found that younger trendellsohn have followed have better go into house said anton will not be well for to talk here on matter of business will follow then led way into old house there at front door still stood two girl talking to other have come back uncle said

must hardly have received better have expected for twelvemonth can not be surprised that mother must be vexed besides must not be angry with lady for what might say care little what say word friend be thing be often thing of great moment however matter very little why have done honour of coming to house even ziska must perceive though power of perception in such matter be perhaps not very great that jew in jew quarter jew in ross markt be very different person ziska be now sitting while anton trendellsohn be standing over ziska when remembered that anton have not be seated in father office have not be asked to sit down must have risen have stood during interview did not know how to leave seat when jew called friend felt that jew be getting better of be already obtaining ascendant of course wish to prevent marriage said ziska dashing at once at subject can not prevent law allows if be what have to come to do may a well return listen to friend said ziska taking leaf out of jew book only listen to then will go speak then will listen be quick want of course to be made right about house father to whom belong wish to be made right a call be same thing now look here truth be everything will be settled for whole thing given up regularly into hand if will only give over about nina balatka will not give over about nina balatka be to be bribed out of love by offer of be already mine own that be in father house must be wrathful with for making such offer why must seek christian wife with such maiden among a whom saw at door mind maiden whom saw at door be nothing to be nothing to of course lady be nothing to if be to come here looking for must be angry must bid seek for beauty among own people must not do so answer now like enough rebecca loth have many friend who must take part why must not take nina part who be friend have taken part have comforted when be in sorrow have wiped tear when wept have taken from sting of poverty striven to make world to pleasant garden have mother of own have yours be mother to why be that nina balatka have cared to receive sympathy love of jew ask that girl whom saw at door for corner in heart will scorn jewess will scorn christian must so look at that must not dare to repeat prayer why be that nina have not so scorned be lodged poorly here while nina aunt have fine house in new town have carriage horse world around be gay bright why did nina come to jew quarter for sympathy seeing that too have friend of own persuasion take nina part indeed be too late now for to take part have chosen for herself resting place be to be here trendellsohn a spoke put hand upon breast within fold of waistcoat ziska hardly understood that doing so have special meaning ziska supposed that here of jew spoke be old house in be at moment talking to other be sure have meant to be kind to said ziska see effect of kindness tell only in answer to what said a to young woman whom saw at door have aught else to say to utterly decline that small matter of traffic have proposed to be not traffic exactly very well what else be there can do for hardly know how to go on a be so so hard in that say will not be able to soften fear about house though say that be trafficking really wish to be honest with say what have to say then be honest have never seen one document conveys ownership of house let father then have one document be in balatka house can hardly be possible said trendellsohn a be christian gentleman said ziska believe to be in house a be jew sir fearing god said other believe who in house have charge of ziska hesitated before replied a think said at last suppose nina have then must be traitor to what be to say a to said ziska smiling trendellsohn came to sat down close at side looking closely into face ziska must have moved away from jew elbow of sofa did not admit of receding then while be thinking that must escape by rising from seat anton spoke again in low voice so low that be almost whisper word seemed to fall direct into ziska ear to hurt be to say called just now christian gentleman one name other go for aught with be neither one other be man ask a man whether be true that nina balatka have paper in possession in own possession mind say ziska have hesitated before hesitation now be much more palpable why do not answer continued jew have made accusation against be accusation true think have said ziska indeed feel sure of in own hand oh yes in own hand of course must be in own hand christian gentleman said anton rising again from seat now standing opposite to ziska disbelieve think that be lying to despite christianity despite gentility be liar now sir unless have anything further to say to may go ziska when thus addressed rose of course from seat by nature be not coward be unready knew not what to do to say on spur of moment did not come here to be insulted said came to insult with two falsehood in mouth of prof other to be lie offer to give up deed on certain condition then tell that be with girl if have how can surrender know whether so silly story might prevail between two christian jew have be taught among to be somewhat observant sir be belief that document belonging to father be in father desk in ross markt by heaven be in house in kleinseite how must then have surrendered must have be managed be now jew turn to pause hesitate in general conclusion to mind have come be not far wrong thought that ziska be endeavouring to deceive in spirit of what said that a regarded letter young man be endeavouring to adhere to fact for salvation of conscience a christian if anton trendellsohn must find out in what lay quibble discovery might be very serviceable to must have be managed must said speaking very slowly between perhaps well yes between nina between of said ziska can not be managed now nina be not one of now how can deal with then will deal with myself will manage if be to be managed sir if find that in matter have told simple truth not truth mind a from gentleman truth a from christian for suspect simple truth a from man to man then will express sorrow for harsh word have used to a finished speaking trendellsohn held door of room open in hand ziska not being ready with answer passed through descended stair jew followed also held open house door did not speak again a ziska went out did ziska say word proper word not being ready to tongue jew returned at once into synagogue having during interview with ziska worn short white surplice in have be found ziska returned at once to own house in windberg gasse chapter viii early on following morning morning of christian sunday nina balatka received note very short note from lover jew dearest meet on bridge evening at eight will be at end on right hand pathway exactly at eight thine ever always t nina directly have read word rushed out to door in order that might give assurance to messenger that must do a be bidden messenger be gone be obliged to reconcile to prospect of silent obedience note however have made very happy prospect pleased well be on very day that have intended to go to lover be in respect much pleasanter to that lover must come to then to walk with be of thing most delightful especially in gloom of evening when eye must see eye own must hang upon arm in way must talk more freely with than in other then note have in more of sweetness of love letter than written word have hitherto received from be very short doubt have called dearest instead of dear nina a have be custom then have declared that be hers ever always word must have be sweeter be glad that note be so short because there be nothing in to mar pleasure yes must be there at eight be quite determined that must not keep waiting at half past seven be on bridge there must be reason thought why must not walk across to other side then retrace step though in doing so be forced by rule of road upon bridge to pas to old town by right hand pathway in going while must come to by opposite side must walk very quickly watch very closely if did not see a crossed recrossed must at rate be on spot indicated at time named autumn evening have become somewhat chilly wrapped thin cloak close round a felt night air a came upon open bridge be not cold told that must not must not be cold how must be cold when be going to meet lover night be dark for moon be now gone wind be blowing there be few star bright in heaven when looked down through parapet of bridge there be just light enough for to see black water flowing fast beneath crossed quickly to figure of st john that might look closely on passing on other side after few moment recrossed road be figure of saint st john nepomucene who be thrown from very bridge drowned who have ever since be protector of good christian from fate have suffered then nina bethought whether be good christian whether st john of bridge must be justified in interposing on behalf must be in want of have strong doubt a to validity of own christianity now that loved jew feared that be more than probable that st john must hing for be in strait a in be supposed to interfere why now must think of such danger lotta luxa have told to drown when must find to have be jilted by jew lover jew lover be true to have dear word at moment in bosom in few moment hand must be resting on arm so passed on from statue of st john with mind made up that did not want st john aid other saint must want doubt prayed little silent prayer to st nicholas that must allow to marry jew without taking offence at circumstance have be very hard a saint must know have meant to do best might not be possible if saint must help that might convert husband a thought of shook head anton trendellsohn be not man to be changed in religion by word must use must be much more probable knew that conversion must be other way thought must not mind that if only must be real conversion if be induced to say that be jewess while still believed in st nicholas st john in beautiful face of dear virgin if to please husband be to call jewess while be at heart christian then state must be very wretched prayed again to st nicholas to keep from that state if be to become jewess hoped that st nicholas must let go altogether heart soul into judaism when reached end of long bridge looked anxiously up street by knew that must come endeavouring to discover figure by glimmering light of oil lamp that hung at angle in street by brighter glare came from gas in shop window by must pas stood thus looking looking till thought must never come then heard clock in old watch tower of bridge over head strike three quarter became aware that instead of lover being after time have yet to wait quarter of hour for exact moment have appointed did not in least mind waiting have be little uneasy when thought that have neglected forgotten own appointment so turned again walked back towards kleinseite fixing eye a have so often done on row of window glittered along great dark mass of hradschin palace what be doing up there slow faded courtier to ex emperor that must want to burn so many candle thinking of passed tablet on bridge according to custom put end of finger on a be raising hand to mouth to kiss remembered that saint might not like such service from one who be already jew at heart refrained refrained then considered whether bridge might not topple down with into stream because of iniquity did not topple down now be standing beyond danger from water at exact spot trendellsohn have named stood still lest might possibly miss by moving till be again cold did not regard that though pressed cloak closely round limb did not move till heard first sound of bell a struck eight then gave little jump a found that lover be close upon so be here nina said putting hand upon arm of course be here anton have be looking looking looking thinking never must come how did get here be a punctual a clock love oh yes be punctual know where did come from came down hill from hradschin have have business there did not occur to simplicity must reach otherwise than by direct road from own home never thought of coming from side of hradschin said nina wondering whether of light have seen must have be there for use of anton trendellsohn be so glad have come to be so good of be good of to come meet own one be cold let walk will be warmer nina who have already put hand upon lover arm thrust in little farther encouraged by such sweet word then took little hand in drew still nearer to till be clinging to very closely nina own one said again have never before be in so sweet mood with walk with yes must walk with night if must let instead of turning again over bridge a have expected took back into kleinseite not bearing round to right in direction of own house going up hill into large square round pathway be covered by overhanging house a be common for avoidance of heat in southern city here under low colonnade be very dark passenger going to fro be not many at angle of square where neighbouring street entered in open space there hung dull dim oil lamp other light there be none nina however did not mind darkness while anton trendellsohn be with even when walking close under buttress of st nicholas of st nicholas who must not have be offended close under very niche in stood statue of saint have uncomfortable qualm when anton be with did not much regard saint be when be alone that thought on religion came to disturb mind do so like walking with said be nicest way of talking in world want to ask question nina said anton perhaps two question tight grasping clasp made on arm by tip of finger relaxed little a heard word remarked altered tone be not then to be love must perceive that be going to be serious with a feared perhaps angry whenever spoke to on matter of business manner be so very serious a to assume in eye when judged by feeling appearance of anger jew immediately felt little movement of finger hastened to reassure be quite sure that answer will satisfy hope so said nina pressure of hand upon arm be not at once repeated have seen cousin ziska nina indeed have seen twice lately have seen uncle aunt suppose did not say anything very pleasant about did not say anything very pleasant about anybody about anything be not very anxious to be pleasant did not mind hope did not insult anton jew be used a yet to insolence from christian mind will never more be anything to if have insulted be nothing nina bear thing think that such of christian a use that liberty of vulgar tongue be still possible towards jew in prague be simply poor in heart ignorant be poor in heart ignorant first went to uncle office in ross markt where saw aunt ziska afterwards ziska came to at own house be tame enough then to own house yes to jew quarter be not condescension came into synagogue ferreted out may be sure that have something very special to say when did that looked a though thought that life be in danger among anton what have to say will tell wanted to buy off buy off yes to bribe to give up aunt sophie doe not relish idea of having jew for nephew aunt sophie will never call aunt sophie again do mean that offered money offered property dear be same did economically for only offered own be kind enough to suggest that if must merely break word to must tell how must get title deed of house thus have power of turning father out into street have power must go at once if bade wish to go a have told often be welcome to use of house will have for life a far a be concerned must like to have what be own what did say nina a asked question be very careful not to tighten hold upon arm by weight of single ounce what did say said that have many thing valued greatly that have one thing valued more than gold house more even than right what be said nina stopping suddenly so that might hear clearly syllable of word be to come what be that did not even yet add ounce to pressure finger be ready poor thing said anton just heart of christian girl then hand be tightened rather two hand for be closed together upon arm other arm be wound round waist then in gloom of dark colonnade pressed to bosom kissed lip forehead then lip again no said have not bribed high enough yet to get from treasure treasure dearest be treasure be not what else have make equal to nina be supremely happy triumphant in happiness cared nothing for aunt nothing for lotta luxa threat very little at present moment even for st nicholas st john of bridge to be told by lover that be own treasure be sufficient to banish for time misery fear be treasure want to remember to believe said jew will believe said nina trembling with anxious eagerness must be possible that must ever forget now will ask question where be title deed where be said repeating question yes where be why do ask why do look like want to tell where be to best of knowledge uncle karil have else ziska be sure of how can be sure be not sure at ziska said something made feel sure of a told before have supposed always that must be in ross markt where else can be aunt say that have got have got yes be what intends to understand jew have stopped at one of corner close under little lamp looked intently into nina face a spoke to believe said nina went on without noticing question intends to believe that have got be keeping from fraudulently cheating in point of fact that be cheating so that may have hold over property for own purpose be what aunt wish to believe be wise woman be not very clever in one breath try to bribe to give up in next want to convince that be not worth keeping anton nay nina will not put to trouble of protestation look at star must a soon suspect light god have placed in heaven of misleading a must suspect oh anton dear anton do so love for saying must be possible must keep anything from think must keep nothing from be to do so must not be own love longer man wife must be true to in everything be not wife must endure not only no fraud from must endure falsehood have never be false to with god help never will be false to have given help have made true hearted doubt now answer question be possible that father must have paper nina paused moment then replied with eagerness quite impossible be sure that know nothing of more than know when have so spoken walked in silence for few yard anton did not at once reply to think that father be keeping anything from do said nina know said jew be not sure may be sure may be quite sure father be at least honest have always thought so do not think so still look here nina know that there be christian in prague who must feel to be beneath to rob jew altogether blame believe that must rob many of do so be very sharp on other dealing against other always in hatred never in love never even in friendship for father have never wronged must not do so for be endeavouring to be kind to for sake nina must treat a though be jew have never wronged be sure that have never wronged nina be more to than be to yes be be own yet will declare that have never wronged must be more to than be be more be everything to still know that have never wronged then jew paused again still walking onwards through dark colonnade with hand upon arm walked in silence whole side of large square nina waiting patiently to hear what must come next trendellsohn considering what word must use did suspect father be needful to purpose that must tell so be needful also a thought that must be made to understand in loyalty truth to must give up father even suspect father if purpose required that must do so though be still christian herself must teach to look at other christian even at belonging to herself with jewish eye unless must do so must not be true loyal to with troth loyalty required poor nina be dearest wish of heart to be true loyal to in thing might be possible to put too hard strain even upon such love a hers nina jew said fear father think that

matter between such obedience matter everything if be to be together must abandon everything for must comply in everything with then nina leaning close upon whispered into ear that must obey volume ii chapter ix nina misery a went home be almost complete have not indeed quarrelled with lover who have again caressed a left assured of absolute confidence have undertaken task against very soul revolted gave comfort to say to herself that have undertaken to look for knew must not find that therefore search must do harm have in truth consented to become spy upon father be so to do in furtherance of view of one who suspected father of fraud who have not scrupled to tell that father be dishonest now again thought of st nicholas a heard dull chime of clock from saint tower found forced to acknowledge that be doing very wickedly in loving jew of course trouble must come upon what else must expect have not endeavoured to throw behind to trample under foot that have learned from infancy under guidance of st nicholas of course saint must desert very sound of chime told that be angry with how must hope again that st john must be good to be not to be expected that black flowing river over understood to preside must become enemy must swallow up a lotta luxa have predicted before returned home when be quite sure that anton trendellsohn have already passed over went down upon bridge far enough along causeway to find over river there crouching down looked at rapid running silent black stream beneath water be very silent very black must still see feel that be running rapidly be cold too at present moment be very cold shuddered a looked down pressing face against stone work with two hand resting on two of pillar of parapet must be very terrible did not think that much cared for death world have be so hard to be growing so much harder that must be good thing to get away from if must become ill die with good kind nun standing by bedside with cross pressed to bosom with eye fixed on sweet face of virgin mother a be painted in little picture in room in way thought that death might even be grateful to be carried away knew not whither in cold silent black flowing moldau yet half believed prophecy of lotta such quiet death a have pictured to herself must not be given to what nun must come to bedside to bed of girl who have declared to prague that intended to marry jew for week past have feared even to look at picture of virgin be afraid will think be very late father said a soon a reached home father muttered something not angrily soon busied about doing little thing for comfort a be wont a did so must not remember that have undertaken to be spy upon to secrete key to search surreptitiously for be supposed to be keeping fraudulently a sat by empty handed for be sunday night a christian never worked with needle upon sunday told that must not do must there be harm done be to ask now openly what paper kept in desk desired to obey lover where obedience be possible have expressly forbidden to ask such question sat therefore said word must tend to ease suffering then when time came went suffering to bed on next day there seemed to come to opportunity for doing have to do souchey be in out of house morning explaining to that have almost come to end of flour of potato have bought that have swallowed on previous evening last tip of great sausage for a have alleged be use fellow dying of starvation outright that there be hardly enough of chocolate left to make three cup nina have brought out necklace have asked souchey to take to shop do best with must souchey have declined commission alleging that must be accused of having stolen nina have then prepared to go father have called her have come out into sitting room have remained there during afternoon so that sale of trinket search in desk have be postponed latter might have done at night when night came deed seemed to be more horrid than must be even in day observed also more accurately than have ever done before that always carried key of desk with did not indeed put under pillow conceal in bed placed with old spectacle case always carried little worn pocket book nina knew to be empty on low table stood at bed head now during whole of afternoon have key on table beside nina did not doubt that must take key while be asleep for when be even half asleep be perhaps most customary state must not stir when entered room if took at must do so in day must not bring to creep into room in night to steal key in dark a lay in bed still thought of have promised lover that must do thing must resolve not to do in spite of promise must at rate tell anton of resolution must tell then there must be end of everything must be possible for to live without love on following morning occurred to that might perhaps be able to induce father to speak of house of horrid document of have heard so much without disobeying of trendellsohn behest there must thought be harm in asking father question a to ownership of house a to jew right to property father have very often declared in presence that old trendellsohn must turn into street at moment there have be no secret between father a to poverty there must be reason why tongue must now be silenced so long a refrained from positive disobedience to lover command that must be obeyed still recognised a strongest rule of obeyed be till must go to lay down love at foot give back to troth have given father said to old man about noon that day suppose house doe belong to trendellsohns of course doe said crossly belongs to altogether mean said know what call altogether doe belong to there be end of be good of talking about only if so ought to have deed be so anxious about everybody ought to have what be own think so father be keeping nothing from said suppose want to rob of course then nina paused again be drawing perilously near to forbidden ground if be not standing on already yet be very anxious that subject must not be dropped between father be sure want to rob anyone father what suppose young trendellsohn have be talking to again about suppose suspect if so doubt will suspect too oh father how can be so cruel if think paper be here be own house let come search for will not do be sure what be want then ca go out to uncle make give up be then with uncle suppose so how be to know see how treat can not go to never come to except when woman come to scold ca belong to uncle of course then why must keep what good can do when spoke to ziska ziska said must be kept because trendellsohn be jew surely jew have right to own at rate ought to do what can for jew a be since let live in house slight touch of irony nina have thrown into voice when spoke of what be due to lover even though be jew be not lost upon father of course must take part against christian said take one part against anyone said except so far a right be concerned if take jew money think must give thing purchase who be keeping from said balatka angrily well suppose be uncle replied nina why can not let be at peace then having so said turned round to wall nina felt to be in worse position than ever there be nothing now for to take key else to tell lover that must not obey there must be further hope in diplomacy have just resolved that must not take key that in spite of promise must not bring to treat father after such fashion a when old man turned suddenly round upon again went back to subject have got letter somewhere from karil zamenoy said telling that deed be in own chest have father said anxiously struggling to repress anxiety have know be written ever so long ago before have settled with trendellsohns have seen often since take key unlock desk bring bundle of paper be tied with old tape stop bring paper with trembling hand nina took key be now desired by father to do exactly that lover wished to have done better still father be about to do thing must at rate have positive proof that paper be not in father desk have desired to bring paper so that there must be doubt left took key very gently a softly a be possible to went slowly into other room when there unlocked desk took out bundle of letter tied with old tape lay at top ready to hand then collected together other paper be not many without looking at carried to father studiously avoided scrutiny of what there might be even by so much a glance of eye seems to be there be father except one two old account book took bundle with feeble hand untied tape moved document one by one nina felt that be fully warranted in looking at now a father be in fact showing to in way must be able to give evidence in favour without having have recourse to ignoble practice old man moved paper in bundle must see that be letter have understood that deed for trendellsohn have desired to search be written on larger paper than now saw that might thus know at once there be certainly no such deed among paper father slowly turned over slowly proceeded to tie up again with old tape be sure saw other day said fingering among loose paper while nina looked on with anxious eye then at last found letter from karil zamenoy having read gave to read be dated seven eight year back at time when balatka be only on way to ruin not absolutely ruined a be case with now contained offer on zamenoy part to give safe custody to certain document be named among deed now sought for stood first have got other paper nina asked have none of unless have there be nothing left one that jew want uncle karil have never given that back never must belong to stephen trendellsohn yes suppose must who can wonder then that must be anxious inquire after make noise about will not law make uncle karil give up how can law prove that have got know nothing about law put back again then nina replaced paper locked desk have at rate be absolutely entirely successful in diplomacy must be able to assure anton trendellsohn of knowledge that sought be not in father keeping on same day went out to sell necklace waited till be nearly dark till first dusk of evening have come upon street then crossed bridge hurried to jeweller shop in grosser ring have observed at

observation believed that might be able to borrow money on treasure leaving a deposit if possible must do there be regular pawnbroker in town by whom question must be made who of course must lend money in ordinary way of trade believed that such people must advance to very small portion of value of necklace then if a must be too probable must not redeem necklace must be gone gone without price yes be own altogether own very own have to explain circumstance to jeweller at last with view of quelling suspicion told jeweler what be name explained how poor be circumstance of house must be niece of madame zamenoy in windberg gasse said jeweller then when nina with hesitation acknowledged that such be case man asked why did not go to rich aunt instead of selling trinket must be so valuable said nina can not do that if will lend something of value will be so much obliged to madame zamenoy must surely help must not take from will not speak of sir can have money then jeweller gave receipt for necklace took receipt for sum lent be more than nina have expected rejoiced that have so well completed business nevertheless wished that jeweller have known nothing of aunt be hardly out of shop before met cousin ziska so met that must not escape heard voice indeed almost a soon a recognised have stopped at summons before have calculated whether might not be better to run away what nina be

possible because because love never wish to see again because hate hate because have be cruel let tell poor a be have never taken farthing of anton money when be wife a hope to be a hope to be will take what give a though came from heaven from must sooner die in street than take crust of bread from then darted from succeeded in escaping without hearing word with replied to angry taunt be woman enough to understand that keenest weapon for wounding must be expression of unbounded love confidence a to man who be rival therefore though be compelled to deny that have lived on charity of lover have coupled denial with assurance of faith affection be doubt bitter enough in ziska ear do believe that be witched said a turned away towards own house then reflected wisely on backward tendency of world in general regretted much that there be longer given to priest in bohemia power of treating with salutary ecclesiastical severity patient suffering in way in cousin nina be afflicted nina have hardly got out of grosser ring into narrow street lead from thence towards bridge when encountered other lover be walking slowly down centre of street when passed must have passed have not recognized

how must deceive nina nina own one said a love so do love say that love also do said love a love own soul then parted nina a went home tried to make happy with assurance have be given to by last word lover have spoken still there remained with suspicion of doubt if really existed must be so cruel injury to love chapter x day passed on after visit to jeweller shop perhaps ten twelve before nina heard from saw lover again during time have tidings from relative in windberg gasse life went on very quietly in old house not le quietly because proceeds of necklace saved nina from further immediate necessity of searching for money cold weather have come rather weather be cold in morning cold in evening old balatka kept bed altogether state be such that one must say why must not get up dress continued to speak of future time when must do so there be lying in bed nina told that in probability must never see about house again for be becoming painfully anxious that day must be fixed for marriage knew that be ignorant in such matter knew also that there be woman near from whom must seek counsel be to go to matron of neighbourhood neighbour must only rebuke because loved jew have boldly told relative of love by doing so have shut out from assistance from from even father must get sympathy though with engagement have become so far thing sanctioned that have ceased to speak of in word of reproach when be to be have more than once made up mind that must ask lover courage have never a yet mounted high enough in presence to allow to do so when be with conversation always took such turn before left be happy enough if must only draw from assurance that be not forgetting to love of final time for marriage never said word in mean time father might starve must not live on price of necklace for ever have not made up mind never must make up mind a to what might be best for father when must be married have made up mind that when happy time must come must simply obey husband must tell what must be best for father in mean time there be word of marriage now have be ten day in kleinseite without once having have so much a message from lover how be possible that must continue to live in such condition a be sitting one morning very forlorn in big parlour looking out upon bird who be pecking among dust in courtyard below when eye just caught drapery of dress of woman who have entered arched gateway nina from place by window must see out through arch one therefore must come through gate while be at seat without passing under eye on occasion bird have distracted attention have not caught sight of woman face figure must be aunt come to torture again father knew that souchey be down stair hanging somewhere in idleness about door therefore did not leave place if be indeed aunt aunt might come up there to seek might possibly be lotta luxa who next to aunt be of woman most disagreeable to nina lotta indeed be not so hard to bear a aunt sophie because lotta must be answered sharply must be told to go if matter proceeded to extremity in such case lotta doubt must not go still power of desiring to do so be much then nina remembered that lotta never wore petticoat so full a be morsel of drapery have seen a thought of there came low knock at door nina without rising desired stranger to come in then door be gently opened rebecca jewess stood before nina have seen rebecca have never spoken to girl have heard much of other from younger friend ruth jacobi ruth be very intimate with nina have be willing enough to be told of rebecca a have rebecca also to be told of nina grandfather want anton to marry rebecca ruth have said more than once thus nina knew well that rebecca be rival think love better than own eye ruth have said to rebecca speaking of uncle nina rebecca have heard from thousand source of information that who be to have be lover have forgotten own people own religion have given to christian girl therefore now knew that looked upon enemy rival be anxious to be very courteous to enemy nina rose from chair directly saw visitor came forward to meet suppose hardly know who be fraeulein said rebecca oh yes said nina with pleasantest smile be rebecca loth yes be rebecca jewess like jew said nina rebecca be not dressed now a have be dressed on gala occasion when saw in jew quarter then have be a smart a white muslin bright ribbon

aspect to girl who wear half defiant half attractive there be there of course long glossy black curl dark blue eye turn of face be so completely jewish in hard bold almost repellant beauty nina have said that liked jew when word be spoken remembered that might be open to misconstruction blushed same idea occurred to rebecca scorned to take advantage of even successful rival on point a that must not twit nina by hint that assumed liking for jew be simply special predilection for one jew in particular be not ungrateful to for coming among knowing said rebecca then there be slight pause for nina hardly knew what to say to visitor rebecca continued to speak hear that in other country prejudice against be dying away that christian stay with jew in house jew with christian eating with drinking with fear will never be so in prague why not in prague hope may why must not do in prague a do elsewhere ah feeling be so firmly settled here have own quarter live altogether apart christian here will hardly walk with jew unless be from counter to counter from bank to bank a for living together even eating in same room do ever see nina of course understood meaning of girl said to be intended to prove to how impossible be that must marry jew live in prague with jew a wife who stood ground before aunt sophie who have never flinched for moment before threat must be showered upon from christian side be not going to quail before opposition of jewess that jewess rival know why must not live to see said nina must take long first very long said rebecca even now fraeulein fear will think that be very intrusive in coming to know that jewess have right to push acquaintance upon christian girl jewess spoke very humbly of herself of people in word uttered there be slight touch of irony be not lost upon nina nina must not bethink that be poor so poor that everything around on about told of poverty while rebecca be very rich showed wealth even in sombre garment have chosen for morning visit idea of nina poverty have crossed rebecca mind nina herself must not remember when felt sarcasm implied in visitor self humiliation be glad that have come to very glad indeed if have

love best woman whom have known longest anton trendellsohn have known long enough to find that loved best why then must jewish girl come to throw in teeth shortness of intimacy with man who be to be husband if nina have also be jewess rebecca must not then have spoken in such way a thought of turned face away from stranger looked out among sparrow who be still pecking among dust in court have told rebecca at beginning of interview that must be delighted to find friend in jewess now felt sorry that girl have come to for anton sake must bear with much from one whom have known so long for thought must have answered visitor with short courtesy a be sat silent looked out upon bird have come to now said rebecca loth to say few word to about anton trendellsohn hope will not refuse to listen will depend on say do think will be for good to marry christian will leave to judge of replied nina sharply can not be that think of be sure must not willingly do injury to man love must die for if must serve can serve without dying if take for wife people will turn against own father will become enemy how can that be father know of yet be not enemy be a tell father will disinherit jew in prague will turn back upon know now anton know can not be first to say word that will put end to engagement jew have married christian in prague before now said nina pleading own cause with strength

that friend have in world will turn back upon so must be with two must be alone a jew a christian with none to aid with friend to love for care nothing said nina may say if like be christian how will be with can ever be happy if have be cause of ruin to husband nina be again silent for while sitting with face turned altogether away from jewess then rose suddenly from chair facing round almost fiercely upon other girl asked question came from fulness of heart what be that intend to do do wish to marry do said rebecca bearing gaze without dropping own eye for moment do do wish to be wife of anton trendellsohn then will never have wish never love only ask will tell so have asked have told so there be something so serious so sad so determined in manner of young jewess that almost cowed nina almost drove to yield before visitor if have told so said then stopped not wishing to triumph over rival have told so knew without telling know have not come here to deceive to create false suspicion doe love care nothing for doe love be therefore to be ruined have better lose that have in world girl have taken fancy must sooner lose world twice over than lose yes be only woman think of position there be not jew in prague respected among a be respected know more can do more have more of wit cleverness than of look to to win for jew in prague something of freedom jew have elsewhere in paris in london if take christian for wife will be destroyed will be well if be to marry now be rebecca turn to pause be not for long love dearly said with love a warm a yours therefore be to be untrue to said nina again seating be to become wife continued rebecca not regarding interruption must be well with in worldly point of view people must be glad because there have be friendship between family from of old father must be pleased must become rich also be not without wealth of own while be poor said nina so poor that look here can only mend rag there look at shoe have not pair to foot if like poor ragged better than like rich got so far raising voice a spoke must get farther for sob stopped voice while be struggling to speak other girl rose knelt at nina foot putting long tapering finger upon nina thread bare arm so that forehead be almost close to nina lip doe said rebecca be true quite true love poor a be ten time hundred time better than love who be not poor have won altogether by with nothing of outside art to back have triumph will not that be enough for life contentment no said nina will not be enough voice now be not altogether sorrowful there be in something of wild joy have come to heart from generous admission jewess made did triumph a remembered that have conquered with other weapon than nature have given be more of contentment than will ever have said rebecca listen to if will say to that will release from promise will swear to by god whom worship will never become wife that will never touch speak to in love have risen before made proposal now stood before nina with one hand raised with blue eye fixed upon nina face solemnity in manner for while startled nina into silence will believe word be sure said rebecca yes must believe said nina will be bargain between say so be mine will be mine yours too though jew may not make christian wife jewish girl may love christian maiden then nina will know that have done very best for whom love better than world beside nina be again silent considering proposition have be made to there be one thing that did not see one point of view in matter have not be presented to cause for sacrifice have be made plain to why be sacrifice of other also to become necessary by not yielding might be able to keep lover to herself if be to be induced to abandon for sake so that might not be ruined by love for why in case must not take other girl for wife in such case nina told that there must be world left for there must be nothing left for beyond accomplishment of lotta luxa prophecy yet though thought of though in misery half resolved that must give up anton not exact from rebecca oath jewess have tendered still in spite of feeling dread of rival success helped to make feel that must never bring to yield will be a say said rebecca will dear be friend while live said nina suddenly can not bring to do so much for man love can not must throw from bridge into moldau drown yes said rebecca must if must serve think must do so what in dark when be so cold people must see in daytime must live that might hear of doings see success ah must not live without feeling that loved what will think of love when have ruined will be pleasant then be to do then then must bethink of cold river dark night eye of passer by whom must be afraid to meet in daytime ask to be a be who be there that pity think again nina know must wish that must be prosperous nina did think again thought long wept jewess comforted many word be said between beyond have be here set down in end nina must not bring to say that must give up for sake have not given up uncle aunt st john st nicholas very virgin whose picture have now removed from wall beside bed to dark drawer how must give up be everything have in world very life of bosom will ask said at last hoarsely will ask do a bid can not do anything unless be a bid in matter must act on own judgment nina will not have judgment must judge for in everything if say be better that must part then then then will let go after rebecca left room house before went kissed christian girl nina did not remember that have be kissed mind be so full not of thought of suggestion have be made to that must now take impression from anything else have be recommended to do thing a duty a paramount duty towards who be everything to doing of must be impossible that must survive so told when be once more alone have again seated in chair by window did not for moment accuse rebecca of dealing unfairly with never occurred to a possible that jewess have come to with false view of own fabrication have so believed suspicion must have done great injustice to rival such idea presented to nina mind that rebecca have said to have come to a though be gospel did believe trendellsohn a jew must injure greatly by marrying christian did believe that jew of prague must treat somewhat a christian must treat for such treatment must be nothing if be once married must understand to must be ruinous nina believed also that rebecca have be entirely disinterested in mission that came thither not to gain lover for herself to save from injury man loved without reference to own passion nina knew that rebecca be strong good acknowledged also that be weak selfish thought that ought to have be persuaded to make sacrifice once twice almost resolved that must follow rebecca to jew quarter tell that must be made must not do be to do so what must be left to with must bear anything everything to starve must hardly be bitter to so that arm must be round waist that head must be on shoulder moreover be not to do with a pleased after promise to how must take upon to dispose of otherwise than a might direct then thought of missing document came back upon remembered in grief that suspected that even now have frightful doubt a to truth to faith be ala ala more firm bright towards than towards heavenly friend whose aid must certainly suffice to bring through trouble if only must bring to trust a asked must trust only in doubted must not be better to do a rebecca said make most of such contentment a might come to from triumph over herself must be better ten time better than to be abandoned by to be deserted by jew lover because jew must not trust christian on side there must be nothing for death there be choice even of death if did thing thought that there might be something sweet even in sadness of last hour something of flavour of sacrifice must be done by in way there lay nothing madness of desolation be last resolve a still sat at window counting sparrow in yard that must tell everything leave to to decide if must say that be better for to part then might go rebecca loth might become wife if so wished chapter xi on one of day old trendellsohn went to office of karil zamenoy in ross markt with full determination of learning in truth what there might be to be learned a to deed must be so necessary to to who must come after when josef balatka might die accused of having be foolishly soft hearted in transaction with christian reminded from time to time that jew in prague must have be so treated by christian be return made to

balatka house a did so observed that certain repair be needed in adjoining building belonged to father determined that mason must be sent there on next day then turned in under archway not passing through into court there stood looking up at window in nina small solitary lamp be twinkling knew that be sitting by light that be working knew that must be raised almost to seventh heaven of delight if must only call to door speak to dozen word before returned to home have thought of doing be possible that must have document in keeping be thought filled mind have bribed lotta luxa lotta have sworn by christian god that deed be in nina hand if thing be false why must conspire to tell same falsehood yet knew that be false in nature manner word of of betrayed something of falsehood to well tuned ear to acute eye to sharp sens with nina from nina everything came from spoke of truth sweet savour of honesty hung about breath be blessing to when be near enough to to feel yet told that be bound to doubt stood for half hour in archway leaning against stonework at side looking up at window where nina be sitting what be to do how must carry in special period of life great idea about destiny of people be mingled in mind with suspicion a to nina of must have be probably be ashamed must certainly take away from prague have already perceived that marriage with christian must be regarded in stronghold of prejudice in lived with so much animosity a to impede perhaps destroy utility of career must go away taking nina with must be careful that must never know by word look that have in way suffered for sake swore to that must be soft to gentle loving with love more demonstrative than have hitherto exhibited knew that have be stern exacting sometimes harsh must be mended have

companion of thought be no longer with be useless for to remain there standing in archway blew kiss from lip blessed in heart protested to that knew must come out of fire pure altogether proved to be without dross then went way in mean time chill wretched crept to cold bed unconscious of happiness have be so near if think can be false to will be better to die said to herself a drew scanty clothing over shivering shoulder a did so lover walked home having come to resolution be intended to be definite a to love allowed thought to run away with to other subject after must be no evil to to leave prague at prague how little be there of progress in thought in thing material at prague jew must earn money become rich might own city yet at prague must only live a outcast a regarded law of land a jew might fix residence anywhere in prague around prague might have garden land result of money might put wife into carriage twice a splendid a constituted great social triumph of madame zamenoy so strong against mode of life be traditional prejudice of jew christian that such fashion of living must be absolutely impossible to must not be good for that must remain at prague knowing father a did must not believe that old man must be so unjust a to let go altogether empty handed have toiled have be successful something of corn have garnered must surely be rendered to with if need be without christian wife must go forth see if world be not wide enough to find spot on might live without contempt of around though nina have quenched lamp have gone to bed be not late when trendellsohn reached home knew that must find father waiting for father be not alone rebecca be sitting with old man have just supped together when anton entered room ruth jacobi be also there waiting till friend must go before also went to bed how be anton said rebecca giving hand to man loved be strange to see in day strangeness rebecca come from fault of own few men be more constant to home than be sleep here eat here daresay business lie mostly out about town have be about business now uncle anton said ruth ask forward question ruth said uncle rebecca fear teach to forget that be still child scold said old man be good girl be anton that forgets nature be making ruth young woman said rebecca want to be young woman bit before uncle anton like said ruth mind waiting ever so long for when be married will not care what be if be so may be woman very soon said rebecca be more than know said anton turning very sharply on what do know of marriage when will be be scolding too said elder trendellsohn nay father let do so said rebecca have known long enough to scold if think that deserve be gentle to spoil be only well that one among old friend must be sincere enough to be ungentle beg pardon rebecca if have be uncourteous there can be pardon where there be offence if be ashamed to hear of marriage said father must be ashamed to think of then there be silence for few second before anyone spoke girl did not dare to speak after word so serious from father to son be known to of that anton must hardly bring to bear rebuke even from father felt that rebuke a given in presence must be altogether unendurable one in room understood exact position in stood to other that rebecca must willingly have become anton wife that have refused various offer of marriage in order ultimately might be so be known to stephen trendellsohn to anton to ruth jacobi there have not be pretence of secret among in matter subject be one must hardly be discussed by openly father said anton after while during black thunder cloud have for instant settled on brow have managed to dispel without bursting into visible storm father be neither ashamed to think of intended marriage to speak of there be question of shame be unpleasant to make such subject matter of general conversation when be source of trouble instead of joy among wish must have made happy by marriage will make very wretched then let not talk about can not be altered must not have false to plighted word again there be silence for minute then rebecca spoke word coming from in lowest possible accent can be altered without breach of plighted word ask young woman what think will find that know that be wrong of course know said father will ask nothing of kind said son must be of use said ruth after rebecca rose to take leave saying something of falseness of brother samuel who have promised to come for to take home be with miriam harter said rebecca of course will forget will go home with said anton indeed will not do think can not walk alone through own street in dark without being afraid be well aware that be afraid of nothing nevertheless if will allow will accompany there be sufficient cause for to refuse company two left house together a descended stair rebecca determined that must have first word in what might now be said between have suggested that marriage with christian girl might be abandoned without disgrace upon anton of having broken troth have thereby laid open to suspicion of having worked for own end of having done so with unmaidenly eagerness to gratify own love something on subject must be said must be said by if not by therefore must explain at once spoke a soon a found by side in street regretted what said up stair anton a soon a word be out of mouth know that said anything to regret told that if in truth thought marriage to be wrong pardon friend for moment if have so thought said that there be mode of escape without falsehood disgrace in saying so must have seemed to urge to break away from nina balatka be urging to do coming from others such advice can not even seem to have improper motive here paused feeling difficulty of task aware that must not conclude without admission woman willingly make shook away impediment bracing to work went on steadily with speech coming from such motive may be imputed nay must be imputed motive be imputed be not believed by to be good healthy friendly friend continued rebecca have wished that must be husband wife be now impossible be impossible because nina will be wife be impossible whether nina must become wife must not become wife say from girlish pride before knew that loved christian woman must willingly have be a friend wished see can trust enough for candour when be young told to love obeyed told be to be wife taught to be happy in believing now know that be wrong will endeavour to teach happiness rebecca if have be in fault have never be in fault be by nature too stern to fall into such fault have be misfortune perhaps rather must say difficulty that till of late have given sign by must foresee lot be still young still believed what told even though did not come to a lover come now know a such thought wish if will a used to have can never return to may perhaps be felt by to be free to use what liberty of counsel old friendship may give know will not misunderstand be come further with called to be gone escaping from with quick running foot through dark night returned to father house thinking of girl have left chapter xii again day passed by without meeting between nina lover thing be going very badly with balatkas in old house money have come from jeweller be not indeed expended nina looked upon a last resource till marriage must come to relieve time of marriage seemed to be a far from a ever so kreutzers be husbanded a only woman can husband new attempt be made to reduce little expense of little household souchey have better go have indeed said nina can not feed now souchey have spoken of leaving day since urged to do so by christian indignation at abominable betrothal of mistress said other day that must do so will be better will not then will be starved be starved already can not be

when give up what if ziska then must not be so forward of who be enemy whom hate because be so cruel hate ziska worst go tell so since be becoming one of in doing so much can not at rate do harm then

eagerness to mess of hot cabbage cold sausage have by mean become one of in windberg gasse have have more than one interview of late with lotta luxa have perceived that something be going on of much desired to be at bottom lotta have scheme be half willing half unwilling to reveal to by hoped to prevent threatened marriage between nina jew now souchey be well enough inclined to take part in such scheme provided did not in way make party with zamenoys in thing general against balatkas be duty a christian though be rather slack in performance of own religious duty to put stop to horrible marriage if must do so behoved to be true to master mistress especially true to in opposition to zamenoys have in sort be carrying on losing battle against zamenoys life have of feeling of martyr telling that have lost rich wife by doing so must go on occasion eat dinner be very confidential with lotta must be very discreet must learn more than told above must not betray master mistress soon after be gone anton trendellsohn came over to kleinseite ringing at bell of house received admission from nina what anton said almost jumping into arm then restraining will come up be so long since have seen yes be long hope time be soon coming when there will be more of such separation be be indeed trust be suppose a maiden ought to be coy say must prefer to wait dearest love sorrow trouble have banished that will not love le because tell count minute till may be wife love le on account must have be true faithful in thing though word be assuring there be something in tone of voice repressed to be true faithful in thing a faithful a though be already husband what be saying of time be soon coming did not answer question turned subject away into channel have brought something for said something hope will be glad to have be present asked a yet have never given anything that must call gift be to almost matter of pride that have taken nothing from jew lover that must take nothing till must be right to take everything hardly present will look at a will remember rapinsky do not now rapinsky be jeweller in grosser ring nina though well remembered man shop did not at moment remember name will not have forgotten at rate said trendellsohn bringing necklace from out of pocket how did get said nina not putting out hand to take looking at a lay upon table thought must be glad to have back again must be glad if if what will be le welcome because come through hand man lent money upon must have paid money what if have like pride nina be not too proud of course have paid money know rapinsky who deal with often went to after spoke to got back again there be mother necklace be sorry for anton why sorry be so poor that will be driven to take elsewhere again can not keep such thing in house while father want better must want than than what nina there must be something like cheating in borrowing money on same thing twice then put by will be lender will not borrow from be only one in world must never repay can not borrow from keep thing if be ever wife then will give if be ever wife be there room for such if hope there be not anton wish be a certain a sun rising people around be so cruel seems sometimes a though world be against then yourself what of nina think trust altogether unless trust know will not make wife be certain yet doubt that will be wife do trust do believe in heart of heart know nothing of paper for be searching paused for reply did not at once make tell went on saying with energy be sure that be true to in matter a in others though be starving be nearly so with already though loved beyond even heaven a do do must not become wife if doubted in tittle say that doubt then will be over still did not speak rebecca will be fitter wife for than can be said nina if be not wife will never have wife said trendellsohn in ecstasy of delight a heard word took up hand kissed dropped again a remembered that have not yet received assurance that needed do believe about horrid paper be necessary that must be made to go again through fire in deliberate reflection have made aware that such necessity still existed might be that have inner reserve a to duty towards father there be possibly reason must not fathom why must still keep something back from in matter did not in truth think that be so there be chance there be chance must not bear to be deceived felt assured that ziska zamenoy lotta luxa believed that deed be in nina keeping indeed be assured that household of zamenoys so believed if there be god above be there lotta have said crossing did not think be there thought that lotta be wrong that zamenoys be wrong by mistake must not fathom still there be chance nina must be made to bear additional calamity do think impossible said that must have among own thing what without knowing have asked may have come to with other paper said may not quite have understood nature there in desk be paper have in world can look if suspect will not easily forgive for looking then threw down key of desk upon table took up fingered did not move towards desk greatest treasure there said be scrap of own have be fool to value a have come from man who doe not trust knew that must be useless for to open desk if be secreting anything from be not hiding there might not possibly be among clothes asked have clothes answered then strode off across wide room towards door of father apartment after have grasped handle of door turned again upon lover may however be well that must search chamber bed if will come with will show door will find to be sorry place for one who be affianced bride who be affianced bride said trendellsohn sir who be be so no longer will have to ask pardon at foot before will let speak to again a lover go search look for deed then will see will tear out own heart rather than submit to ill usage of distrust from one who owes so much faith a do nina said well sir do trust yes with half trust with one eye closed while other be watching think have so conquered will be good to yet can not keep from listening to who whisper that be bad to sir fear have be right when told that jew nature must surely shock at last dark frowning cloud have so often observed with fear came upon brow did not fear now do too taunt with religion said not so not with religion anton with nature how can help nature suppose can not help be wrong to taunt must not have taunted must only have said will not endure suspicion of christian of jew came up to now put out arm a though be about to embrace said not again till have asked pardon for distrusting have given solemn word that distrust no longer paused moment in doubt then put hat on head prepared to leave have behaved very well still must not be weak enough to yield to in everything at once a to opening desk going up stair into room that felt to be quite impossible even nature did not admit of did nature allow to ask pardon to own that have be wrong have said that must implore forgiveness at foot one word however one look must have sufficed that word that look be at present moment out of power good bye nina said be best must leave now by far best will take necklace with if please will leave can not keep trinket be mother take then to jeweller get back money will not be left here will have nothing from hand be so far cowed by manner that took up necklace left house nina be once more alone what have told her of lover be after true be first idea occurred to a sat in chair stunned by sorrow have come upon have dinned into ear accusation not against man against tribe to belonged telling that jew be of very nature suspicious greedy false have perceived early in acquaintance with anton trendellsohn that be clever ambitious gifted with power of thinking a none others whom knew must think that have word at command be brave be endowed with certain nobility of disposition prompted to wish for great result rather than for small advantage have conquered have made resolve to think that jew must be a good a christian now when trial of man have in truth come found that around have be right in what have said how base must be nature must prompt man to suspect girl who have be true to a nina have be true to lover must never see again never have left room without even answering question have asked must not even say that trusted be manifest that did not trust that believed at moment that be endeavouring to rob in matter of deed have asked if have in desk among clothes very soul revolted from suspicion so implied must never speak to again be over must never willingly speak to again what must do for few minute fell back a be so natural with mortal in trouble upon religion have be so willing to outrage by marrying jew went to little drawer took out string of bead have lain there unused since have be made to believe that virgin saint must not permit marriage with anton trendellsohn took out bead did not use passed berry through finger to check number of prayer said for found unable to say prayer at if must come back to ask pardon ask in truth at foot must still forgive regardless of virgin saint if did not come back what be fate lotta luxa have predicted for to have acknowledged to herself that must be driven to submit in case how must again come to term with st john st nicholas how be to live must lose lover a now told must certainly be fate what possibility of life be left to from day to day from week to week have put off to future hour definite consideration of what father must do in poverty believing that might be postponed till marriage must make thing easy future mode of living have often be discussed between lover have be candid enough in explaining to that must not leave father desolate have always replied that wife father must want for nothing have be delighted to think that must with joy accept that from husband nothing must induce to accept from lover thought have sufficed to comfort a evil of absolute destitution be close upon surely day of marriage must come soon now seemed to to be certain that day of marriage must never come expectation must be banished must look elsewhere if elsewhere there might be relief knew well that if must separate from jew pocket of aunt must be opened to relieve distress of father must be opened so far a to save old man from perishing of want aunt sophie if duly invoked must not see sister husband die of starvation nay aunt sophie must doubtless so far stretch christian charity a to see that niece be in way fed if niece must be duly obedient further still aunt sophie must accept niece a very daughter of house a rising mistress of own establishment if niece must only consent to love son ziska be there a husband in anton place if ziska might only gain acceptance a rose from chair walked backwards forward through chamber telling thing clenched fist stamped foot a swore to herself that must dare that saint must do to her that must face terror of black dark river before must succumb to cousin ziska a worked into wrath thinking now of man loved then of man did not love thought that must willingly perish if be not that father lay there so old so helpless gradually a magnified to herself terrible distress of heart agony of yearning love for man who though loved be so unworthy of perfect faith began to think that must be well to be carried down by quick eternal almighty stream beyond reach of sorrow encompassed when father must leave must be alone alone in world without friend to regard one living human being on whom girl might rely for protection shelter even for morsel of bread must st nicholas cover from contumely of world must st john of bridge feed did in heart of heart believe that even virgin must assist in such strait have such belief might be that such real belief have never be hers hardly knew did know now in hour of deep trouble must not say prayer tell bead trust valiantly that goodness of heaven must suffice to in need in mean time souchey have gone off to windberg gasse have gladdened with soup with hot mess of cabbage sausage supplied by madame zamenoy hospitality joy of such moment be unknown to who like souchey have be driven by circumstance to sit at table very ill supplied on previous day have fed upon offal thrown away from butcher stall habit have made such feeding not unfamiliar to a walked from kleinseite through old town to madame zamenoy bright looking house in new town have comforted greatly with thought of coming feast representation imagination made to of banquet sufficed to produce happiness went along hardly envying man propensity at moment be propensity of beast yet be submitting to terrible poverty made so small matter now matter of joy to because there be something of nobility within made true to master who have be true to when have be young together even now resolved a sharpened teeth that through soup sausage must be true to balatkas must be true even to nina balatka though recognised a paramount duty to do in power to save from jew be seated at table in kitchen almost a soon a have entered house in windberg gasse found plate full before lotta have felt that there be need of delicacy of compliment in feeding man who be so undoubtedly hungry have therefore bade at once fall to hearty meal be thing be not used to have said will do old bone deal of good address be not complimentary especially a coming from lady in regard to whom entertained tender feeling souchey forgave something of coarse familiarity word displayed seating on stool before victual gave play to feeling of moment there be one to measure what be left of sausage said lotta instigating to new feat ai there now said souchey responding to sound of trumpet always thought have devil own eye in looking after be used in kitchen devil wink sometimes said lotta cutting half inch off from unconsumed fragment picking skin from meat with own fair finger hitherto souchey have be regardless of such niceness in eating skin having gone with rest now thought that absence of outside covering touch of lotta finger be grateful to appetite souchey said lotta when have altogether done have turned stool round to kitchen fire where do think nina must go if be to marry jew there be abrupt solemnity in manner of question at first baffled man whose breath be heavy with comfortable repletion have be bestowed upon where must go to said repeating lotta word yes souchey where must go to where must be eternal home what must become of soul do know that not priest in prague must give absolution though be on dying bed oh holy mary be terrible thing to think of be bad enough for old man to be there day after day without morsel to eat suppose if be not for anton trendellsohn must be bad enough with not gulden then have nina ever taken from jew value of gulden a far a can judge between what matter that souchey be not engaged to a wife can anything in world be so dreadful know will be damned for ever ever lotta a uttered terrible word brought face close to souchey looking into eye with fierce glare souchey shook head sorrowfully owning thereby that knowledge in matter of religion did not go to point indicated by lotta luxa must anything then be good deed must prevent that be priest must do among priest be not men used to be souchey be not exactly fault neither there be so many folk about in day who care nothing who go to glory who doe not be too many for priest if priest ca fight own battle ca fight for said souchey for old family souchey that have known so long look here between can prevent how be to be done ah be question if felt be talking to real christian have care for poor girl soul must tell in moment so be only soul be business then can not tell ca do unless acknowledge that welfare a christian be business of fancy souchey mistress married to filthy jew for matter of that be so filthy abominable jew souchey will never fall out with must contrive that will quarrel with if have thing about that did not want to have must contrive that must know sort of thing do mean lover like gander if there be anything of sort must manage if have thing locked up away from must manage to show to be very generous in rewarding know want to have anything to do with said souchey getting up from stool preparing to take departure though have be so keen after sausage be above taking bribe in such matter a stop souchey stop did think must ever have to ask anything of in vain then put face very close to so that lip touched ear laid hand heavily upon arm be very confidential souchey listened to whisper till face grew longer longer 't be for soul said lotta for poor soul sake when can save by raising hand must let be damned for ever must exact promise from souchey except that must keep faith with that must consider deeply proposal made to then there be tender farewell between souchey returned to kleinseite chapter xiii for two day after nina heard nothing from jew quarter in terrible distress heart almost became softened towards man who have so deeply offended began to tell in weariness of sorrow that men be different from woman of nature more suspicious that woman have right to expect virtue in lover that woman have le of such right than who have so little to give in return for anton proposed to bestow upon began to think that must forgive even for suspicion if must only come to be forgiven came not be only too plain to that must not be first to go to after what have passed between then there fell crushing sorrow upon father be ill so ill that be like to die doctor came to son of galen who have known merchant in prosperity with kind assurance told nina that father though must pay nothing must have assistance medical attention must give said at same time medical attention must give aid must be of permanent service light have burned down in socket must go out doctor took nina by hand put own hand upon soft tress spoke kind word to console then said that sick man ought to take few glass of wine day a be going away turned back again promised to send wine from own house nina thanked plucked up something of old spirit during presence spoke to a though have other care than of father health a soon a doctor be gone thought again of jew lover that father must die be great grief when must be alone in old house with corpse lying on bed must anton trendellsohn come to then did not come to now though knew of father illness sent souchey to jew quarter to tell sad news not to to old trendellsohn for sake of property be right that must know nina said to herself excusing to herself on plea weakness in sending message to house of anton trendellsohn till must have come asked pardon even after came not listened to footstep entered courtyard must not keep from going to window from looking into square surely now in deep sorrow in solitude must come to must come say one word that did trust that must trust came not at hour of day night followed slowly surely upon other a sat by father bed watching last quiver of light in socket though trendellsohn did not come there came to messenger from jew house messenger from jew house not messenger from anton trendellsohn here be girl from jew said souchey whispering into ear a sat at father bedside one of will tell to go away because be so ill souchey pointed to

not surely carry through street have shadrach boy with carried be not from exactly though have be so glad to come with who sent said nina quickly with finger trembling on lid if anton have thought to send anything to that anything must suffice be rebecca loth who thought of who asked to come said ruth then nina drew back finger a though be burned walked away from table with quick angry step why

sin upon conscience then priest went being unwilling to endure further questioning nina seated in glow of triumph be worst that must have to endure from church after aunt threatenings after lotta

be hopeless be to marry jew after went to drawer in bedroom restored picture of virgin to place chapter xiv father jerome have be very mild with nina mildness did not produce corresponding feeling of gentleness in breast of nina relative in windberg gasse indeed have contrary effect of instigating madame zamenoy lotta luxa to new exertion nina in triumph must not restrain from telling souchey that father jerome did not by mean think so badly of a did others souchey partly in defence of nina partly in quest of further sound information on knotty religious difficulty involved repeated to lotta among succeeded in cutting souchey ground from under a far a defence of nina be concerned succeeded also in solving religious doubt poor souchey be at last convinced that best service must tender to mistress be to save from marrying jew let mean by be to be done be almost what might a result of teaching souchey went late one afternoon to jew quarter did not go thither direct from house in kleinseite from madame zamenoy abode where have again dined previously in lotta presence madame zamenoy have condescended to enlighten mind on subject of nina peril have gone so far a to invite to hear few word on subject from priest on side of water souchey have only heard nina report of what father jerome have said be listening with own ear while other priest declared opinion that thing must go very badly with christian girl who might marry jew sufficed for then having be so far enlightened by madame zamenoy accepted little commission took to jew house lotta have have much difficulty in arranging for souchey be not open to bribe in matter on account be able to press legitimate suit very closely before must start on errand to jew lotta be almost obliged to promise that must yield be late in afternoon when got to trendellsohn house have never be there before though well knew exact spot on stood have often looked up at window regarding place with unpleasant suspicion for knew that trendellsohn be now owner of property have once be master of course a good christian believed that jew have obtained balatka money by robbery fraud hesitated moment before presented at door having fear at heart knew that be doing right jew in own quarter be uncanny might be dangerous to anton trendellsohn over in kleinseite souchey must be independent perhaps on occasion little insolent of anton trendellsohn in own domain almost acknowledged to that be afraid lotta have told that if anton be not at home commission must be done a well with old man a at last made way round synagogue to house door determined that must ask for elder jew have to say thought might be said easier to father than to son door of house stood open souchey who in confusion missed bell entered passage little oil lamp still hung there giving mysterious glimmer of light did not at enjoy walked on very slowly trying to get courage to call when of sudden perceived that there be figure of man standing close to

gloom of chamber have never be arranged for honest christian purpose now what be have to tell said jew after fashion souchey told tale jew listened to without word of interruption more than once souchey have paused hoping that jew must say something not sound have fallen from trendellsohn till souchey tale be done be so be said jew when souchey ceased to speak there be nothing in voice seemed to indicate sorrow joy even surprise yes be so said souchey how much be to pay for information jew asked be to pay nothing said souchey what betray mistress gratis betray said souchey love old man too

loth said nina hush there be father voice anton have nothing more to say to nothing nothing then left went into father room for minute be busy by father bed went about work with determined alacrity a though must wipe out of mind altogether for moment thought about love jew document have be found in desk for while be successful with consciousness indeed that be under pressure of terrible calamity must destroy still with outward presence of mind supported in work father spoke to saying more to than have done for day past thanking for care patting hand with caressing bidding still be of good cheer a god must certainly be good to one who have be so excellent daughter wish nina be not jew said suddenly dear father will not talk of now be stern man nina on subject must speak further therefore left bedside for moment offered cup from drank when have tasted forgot matter have be in mind said further word a to nina engagement a soon a have taken cup from father hand returned to parlour might be that anton be still there have left in room have shut ear against sound of step a though be resolved that must care nothing ever again for coming going be gone however room be empty

that have made guilty in eye must never see again never willingly be not only that must never forgive that must never now be brought to forgive have stabbed while word of love be warmest in ear foul suspicion have be present to mind even while be caressing have never known what be to give up really to love for one moment while be seated on knee with head pressed against intellect have be busy with key desk a though be policeman looking for thief rather than lover happy in endearment of mistress vivid mind pictured to filling full with incident of insult have endured no there must be end of now if must see aunt moment lotta even ziska must tell that must be so must say nothing to anton not word again though might live for eternity must write line to rebecca tell jewess that jew be now free to marry whom must among own people of word that thought must be fitting for letter occurred to a sat there know now that jew christian ought not to love other a loved heart be different that be present purpose a will be seen changed afterwards ever again a strengthened resolution thought must run from carrying back to sweet rapture of moment in man have be gracious to even while be struggling to teach to hate must lean head on one side a though by doing so might once more touch brow with hers unconsciously must put out finger a though might find way into hand then must draw back with shudder a though recoiling from touch of adder hour have passed over before began to think whence have come paper trendellsohn have found in desk then when idea of fraud presented to that part of subject did not seem to to be of great moment mattered little who have betrayed might be rebecca souchey ruth lotta of together love knowledge of whom loved must have carried aloft out of reach of such poor trick a what mattered now who have stolen key gone like thief to desk laid plot for destruction that must have be capable of being deceived by such plot against be enough for did not even speak to souchey on subject in course of afternoon came across a moved about house looking ashamed not daring to meet eye hardly able to mutter word to said not syllable to about desk must not bring to plead cause between lover before father servant greater part of day passed by father bedside whenever must escape from room seated in chair against wall endeavouring to make up mind a to future there be much more of passion than of thought within breast never never never must forgive never again must sit on knee caressing never again must even speak to nothing must take from hand from hand of friend must ever stoop to take aught from aunt from ziska have triumphed over knew not how have triumphed over triumph must be very bitter to very bitter if there be touch of humanity left among later in day there came to be something of motion in house father be worse in health be going fast doctor be again there in moment souchey be with busy in dying man room there be gentle kind word spoken between nina a must be natural between such person at time knew that have be traitor thought of treachery be heavy at heart perceived that immediate punishment be to come upon be solace to that must be sedulous gentle tender nina though knew that man have given aid in destroying bore with not only without hard word almost without severe thought what did matter what one a souchey must do in middle watch of night old man died nina be alone in world souchey indeed be with in house took from painful charge of bed at now care must no longer be of use early in morning while be yet dark lotta came down spoke word to of remembered nothing then knew that aunt sophie be there that offer be made to at only shook head of course will come up to aunt sophie said made many more suggestion in answer to of nina only shook head then aunt nina with lotta aid fixed upon plan nina hardly knew what a to morrow did not care to know what be that fixed be going to leave alone for day day must be very long told that must be long enough for day be very long when aunt have left saw one souchey old woman who be busy in bedroom be now closed have stood at foot of bed with aunt after did not return to chamber be not only father who for be now lying dead have loved father well with love infinitely greater have loved that other one be now dead to also what be there left to in world charity of aunt lotta triumph ziska love no indeed must bear charity triumph love one other visitor came to house that day be rebecca loth nina refused to see rebecca tell said to souchey can not see stranger while father be lying dead how often did idea occur to throughout terrible length of day that might come to came not so much better said to herself be to come must not see late in evening when little lamp in room have be already burning for hour two called souchey to take note said to anton trendellsohn what to night said souchey trembling yes to night be right that must know that house be now own to do what will with then souchey took note be a follows father be dead house will be empty to morrow may come take property without fear that will be troubled by nina balatka chapter xv when souchey left room with note nina went to door listened heard turn lock below heard step out in courtyard listened till knew that be crossing square then ran quickly up to own room put on hat old worn cloak cloak aunt sophie have given returned once more into parlour looked round room with anxious eye seeing desk took key from pocket put into lock then there came thought into mind a to paper resolved that thought need not arrest her left key in lock with paper untouched then went to door of father room stood there for moment with hand upon latch tried ever so gently found that door be bolted bolt knew be on side must withdraw did not do so seeming to take impediment a though be sufficient bar against entrance then ran down stair rapidly opened front door found out in night air be cold windy night not so late indeed a to have made feel that be night have not come from gloom of dark parlour glimmer of one small lamp be now something beyond middle of october at present might be eight o'clock knew that there must be moonlight looked up at sky cloud be dark though must see that be moving along with gust of wind be very cold drew cloak closer about a stepped out into archway up above almost close to in gloom of night there be long colonnade of palace with light glimmering in window a always glimmered allowed for moment to think who might be there in room a have so often thought before be possible that anton might be there have be there once before at time in evening a have told wherever might be be thinking of if thought of be thinking of a one who have deceived who have tried to rob ah day must soon come in must learn that have wronged when day must come must heart be bitter within will certainly be unhappy for time said be hard will recover will console will be better so christian jew must never love other a stood cloud be lifted for moment from face of risen moon must see by pale clear light whole facade of palace a ran along steep hillside above must count arch a have so often counted by same light seemed to be close over head stood there thinking of till cloud have again skurried across moon face must only see accustomed glimmer in window a eye fell upon well known black building around found that be very dark be well for that must be so dark never wanted to see light again there be footstep on other side of square paused till have passed away beyond reach of ear then came out from under archway hurried across square to street led to bridge be dark gloomy lane narrow composed of high building without entrance side of barrack old palace from window above head on left heard voice of soldier song be being sung must hear word how cruel be that other people must have so much of light hearted joy in world that for everything must have be so terribly sad wind a met seemed to penetrate to bone be very cold be useless to regard that there be place on face of earth must ever be warm for a passed along causeway leading to bridge sound with be very familiar met ear be singing vesper under shadow of one of great statue be placed one over arch of bridge there be lay friar standing by little table on there be white cloth lighted lamp small crucifix above crucifix supported against stone work of bridge there be picture of virgin with child there be tawdry wreath of paper flower so that by light of lamp must see that little altar have be prepared on table there be plate containing kreutzers into faithful who passed took part in evening psalm of praise might put offering for honour of virgin for benefit of poor friar brother in poor cloister at home nina knew about well score of time have stood on same spot upon bridge sung vesper hymn ere passed on to kleinseite now paused sang once again around table upon pavement there stood perhaps thirty forty person most of child remainder girl perhaps of nina age friar stood close by table leaning idly against bridge with eye wandering from little plate with kreutzers to passer by who might possibly contribute ever anon with drawling voice must commence sentence of hymn then girl child must take up well knowing accustomed word voice a sang must sound sweetly across water loud gurgling of a ran beneath arch must be heard during pause nina stopped sang when be child have sung there very often friar of day must put hand upon head bless a brought small piece of tribute to plate of late since have be at variance with church by reason of jew have always passed by rapidly a though feeling that have no longer right to take part in such ceremony now have done with jew surely might sing vesper song so stopped sang remembering not le a sang that be about to do if really done must make such singing unavailing for then perhaps even might not be done lotta first prediction that jew must desert have certainly come true lotta second prediction that there must be nothing left for to drown seemed to to be true also have left house in father dead body be still lying with purpose doubly deserted a now be by lover father must live no longer might however be possible that saint who be so powerful over water might yet do something for might yet interpose on behalf knowing a did of course that idea of marriage between christian jew lover have be abandoned at rate stood sang hymn when there came accustomed lull at end of verse felt in pocket for coin taking piece of ten kreutzers stepped quickly up to plate put in day two ago ten kreutzers be important portion of little sum still have left in hand now ten kreutzers must hing for be at rate better that friar must have than that money must go with down into blackness of river nevertheless did not give friar saw one girl whispering to a stepped up to table heard own name be nina balatka then there be answer did not hear be sure referred to jew girl looked at with angry eye longed to stop explain to that be no longer betrothed to jew then perhaps must be gentle with might yet hear kind word spoken to before went did not speak to must never speak to man woman again what be use of speaking now sympathy that must receive must go deep enough to give relief to such wound a hers a dropped piece of money into plate eye met of friar recognised at once man whom have known year ago at same spot engaged in same work be old haggard thin grey very dirty there came smile over face a also recognised must not speak to for have to take up verse in hymn drawl out word be to set crowd singing nina have retired back again before be silent knew that have known almost felt that have found friend who must be kind to on morrow when inquiry must be made aunt sophie must certainly be loud in inquiry friar must be able to give testimony respecting passed on altogether across bridge in order that might reach spot desired without observation perhaps also with halting idea that might thus postpone evil moment figure of st john nepomucene rested on other balustrade of bridge be minded to stand for while under shadow now at prague be custom that who pas over bridge will always take right hand path a go therefore in coming from kleinseite have taken that opposite to statue of saint have thought of have told that must cross roadway in middle of bridge at moment moon be shining brightly then too night be long why need be in hurry at further end of bridge stood while in shade of watch tower looked anxiously around when last have be over in old town within short distance of spot where now stood have chanced to meet lover what if must see now be sure that must not speak to yet looked very anxiously up dark street through glimmer of dull lamp first there came one man then third thought a eye fell upon that figure of be figure of anton trendellsohn a emerged from darker shadow into light be near saw that be not so told that be glad if anton be to come find there might be that must disturb purpose yet looked again before left shadow of tower now there be one passing in street there be figure there to make think that lover be coming either to save to disturb taking pathway on other side turned face again towards kleinseite very slowly crept along under balustrade of bridge bridge over moldau be remarkable in many way be specially remarkable for largeness of proportion be very long taking spring from shore long way before actual margin of river be of fine breadth side walk to be high massive group of statue with be ornamented though not in of much value a work of art have dignity by mean of immense size lend to causeway making whole thing noble grand impressive below moldau run with fine silent dark volume of water very sea of water when rain have fallen little river have be full though in time of drought great patch of ugly dry land be to be seen in half empty bed at present moment there be such patch water ran by silent black in great volume with unchecked rapid course be only by pausing specially to listen to that passer by must hear a glided smoothly round pier of bridge nina did pause did hear must have be almost le terrible to have sound be rougher louder on went very slowly moon thought have disappeared altogether before reached cross inlaid in stone on bridge side on be accustomed to lay finger in order that might share somewhat of saint power over river at moment a came up to night be very dark have calculated that by time light of moon must have waned so that might climb to spot have marked for without observation paused hesitating whether must put hand upon cross must not at least do harm might be that saint must be angry with accusing of hypocrisy what must be saint anger for so small thing amidst multitude of charge must be brought against for be going to do now there must be absolution given perhaps saint might perceive that deed on part be not altogether hypocritical that there be something in of true prayer might see intervene to save from water so put palm of little hand full upon cross then kissed heartily after raised up again till rested on foot of saint a stood there heard departing voice of girl child singing last verse of vesper hymn a followed friar off causeway of bridge into kleinseite be determined that must persevere have endured that made impossible that must recede have sworn to herself thousand time that must never endure that must have to be endured if remained longer in cruel world there must be roof to cover now roof in windberg gasse beneath there be to hell upon earth must face anger of saint rather than eat bitter bread aunt must provide for must face anger of saint rather than fall short in revenge upon lover have given to altogether for have be half starved when for might have lived a favoured daughter in aunt house for have made impossible to herself to regard other man with spark of affection for sake have hated cousin ziska cousin who be handsome young rich have loved feeling that very idea that must accept love from anyone anton have be insult to have trusted anton a though word have be gospel to have obeyed in everything allowing to scold a though be already subject to rule to speak truth have enjoyed such treatment obtaining from certain assurance that be already own have loved entirely have trusted altogether have be prepared to bear that world must fling upon for sake wanting nothing in return that must know that be true to have not known have be able to understand such truth have not be possible to to know inborn suspicion of nature have broken out in opposition to love forcing to acknowledge to herself that have be wrong in loving jew have be unable not to suspect of vile scheme by might possibly cheat of property if at last moment must not become wife told that understood now that must see into mind dark gloomy a be recess have wasted heart upon man who have never even believed in must not be revenged upon yes must be revenged must cure malady of own love by only possible remedy within reach statue of st john nepomucene be single figure standing in melancholy weeping posture on balustrade of bridge without of ponderous strength of wide spread stone belongs to other group st john be always pictured to a thin melancholy half starved saint who have have life washed out of by long immersion there be saint to whom trusting religious heart can turn relying on apparent physical capability st mark for instance be always tower of strength st christopher be very stout st peter carry with ancient manliness make one marvel at cowardice when denied master st lawrence too with gridiron st bartholomew with flaying knife own skin hanging over own arm look a though liked martyrdom be proud of must be useful on occasion st john of bridge have pride in appearance strength in look be mild meek saint teaching one rather by attitude how to bear with malice of water than offering protection against violence now at moment aid be only aid to nina must look with hope have heard of rescuing many person from death amidst current of moldau indeed thought that must remember having be told that river have power to drown who must turn mind to when be struggling in water whether applied only to who be in sight of statue on bridge of prague whether be good in river of world did not know then tried to think whether have ever heard of case in saint have saved one who have who have done thing be now about to do be almost sure that have never heard of such case a then be there not something special in own case be not suffering so great condition so piteous that saint must be driven to compassion in spite of greatness of sin must not know that be punishing jew by only punishment with must reach looked up into saint wan face fancied that eye be ever so piteous brow ever so laden with deep suffering of compassion must punishment reach heart of anton trendellsohn must care for when must hear that have destroyed own life because must not endure cruelty of suspicion must tidings make unhappy when last have be together have told with energy knew so well how to put into word that love be necessary to happiness will never release from promise have said when offered to give back troth because of ill will of people still believed yes did love there be something of consolation to in assurance that string of heart must be wrung when must hear of if bosom be capable of agony must be agonised be very dark at moment now be time for to climb upon stone work hide behind drapery of saint statue more than once a have crossed bridge have observed spot have told that if deed be to be done must be place for doing have always be conscious since idea have entered mind that must lack power to step boldly up on to parapet go over at once a bather do when tumble headlong into stream have danger for have known that must crouch pause think of look at nerve with memory of wrong then at moment in heart be wrung to utmost must gradually slacken hold dark black silent river must take climbed up into niche found that river be very far from though death be so near to fall must be so easy when became aware that there be nothing between great void space below nothing to guard nothing left to in world to protect retreated descended again to pavement never in life have moved with more care lest inadvertently foot hand might slip might tumble to doom against will when be again on pathway remembered note to anton that note be already in hand what must think of if be only to threaten deed then not perform must allow to go unpunished must triumph a must do if be now to return to

moment eternity be before of life there remained to few moment in might cling there think of what be coming surely need not begrudge minute two more of life be very cold so cold that pressed against stone in order that might save from wind whistled round water must be colder still than wind when once there must never again be warm chill of night blackness of gulf before smooth rapid gurgle of dark moving mass of water beneath be together more horrid to imagination than even death thrice released from backward pressure against stone in order that might fall forward have done with a often found returning involuntarily to protection still remained to seemed a though must not fall though must have thought that must have gone directly to destruction if placed where be crouching though must have trembled with agony to see anyone perched in such danger appeared to be firm fixed must jump forth boldly river must not take ah what if be so that saint who stood over whose cross have so lately kissed must not let perish from beneath foot in moment mind wandered in maze of religious doubt fear entertained unconsciously enough of doctrinal scepticism to found school of freethinker must be that god must punish with everlasting torment because in agony be driven to a only mode of relief must there be measuring of sin against sorrow account taken of simplicity of life looked up towards heaven not praying in word with prayer in heart for there must be absolution final blessing act of going must be act of terrible sin god must know must surely take measure of case must save if must despite priest in prague more than one passenger have walked by while be crouching in niche beneath statue have passed by have not seen indeed night at present be so dark that one standing still looking for must hardly be able to define figure yet dark a be must see something of movement of water beneath shimmer produced by gliding movement of stream ah must go now have done with moment that remained be added agony then at moment heard voice on bridge near crouched close again in order that passenger might pas by without noticing did not wish that anyone must hear splash of plunge be called on to make ineffectual effort to save so must wait again voice drew nearer to suddenly became aware that be souchey voice be souchey be not alone must be anton who have come out with to seek to save must have such relief a from coming sorrow so clung fast waiting till must pas still leaning little towards causeway so that if be possible might see figure a passed heard voice of souchey quite plain then perceived that souchey companion be woman something of gentleness of woman voice reached ear must distinguish word be spoken step be now very close to with terrible anxiety peeped out to see who might be souchey companion saw figure knew at once by hat that be rebecca loth be walking fast be close to now must be gone in instant on sudden at very moment that souchey rebecca be in act of passing beneath foot of saint cloud swept by from off disc of waning moon three face be looking at other in clear pale light of night souchey started back screamed rebecca leaped forward put grasp of hand tight upon skirt of nina dress first one hand then other pressing forward with body against parapet got hold also of nina foot perceived instantly what be girl purpose by god blessing on effort there must be cold form found in river night if one then there must be two nina kept hold against figure appalled dumbfounded awe stricken still with inner consciousness of salvation comforted whether life be due to saint to jewess knew not acknowledged to herself silently that death be beyond reach be grateful nina said rebecca nina still crouched against stone with eye fixed on other girl

of wealth few of appurtenance of comfort generally fall to lot of bride among rich man however be well to do in world be one who be not likely to bring wife to want need hardly be said that anton trendellsohn be man that nina balatka be wife on eve of departure nina friend jewess have said farewell to other will write to from frankfort said rebecca indeed will said nina will write to often very often a often a will wish will wish always said nina can write be clever know how to make word say what there be in heart have be able to make face more eloquent than word rebecca dear rebecca why be that did not love one a rather than be more beautiful at least have not thought so be so clever so good must have given help never can give doe not want help want to have by side sweet soft

endeavour to do so must do so if saint must let be glad be going away nina continued rebecca will be better for better for yes will be better will be better for also then nina threw on rebecca neck

that rebecca who be so strong must have loved a have loved if have daughter said rebecca if will let name one of after will be glad swore that if god gave such treasure a daughter child must be named after friend who have be so good to there be also few word of parting between anton trendellsohn girl who have be brought up to believe that be to be wife though there be friendship in there be not much of tenderness hope will prosper where be going said rebecca a gave man hand fear that will prosper rebecca will become rich perhaps great a great be a jew can make ourselves hope will live to hear that jew be not crushed elsewhere a be here in prague anton will not cease to love old city where father friend have lived so long will never cease to love at least whom leave behind farewell rebecca attempted to draw to a though must kiss withdrew from very quietly with mark of anger with ostentation of refusal farewell said perhaps will see other after many year trendellsohn a sat beside

almost wish that have not loved take with that love infinitely better than prague contains will not therefore allow regret though must never see old city again will always look upon going a good thing done nina must only answer by caressing hand by making internal oath that very best must be done in moment of life to make contented with lot have chosen there remains very little of tale to be told nothing indeed of nina tale very little to be explained nina slept in peace at rebecca house night on have be rescued from death upon bridge more probably lay awake anxiously thinking what might yet be fate have be very near to death so near that shuddered even beneath warmth of bed clothes with protection of friend so close to a thought of long dreadful minute have passed crouching over river at foot of statue have be very near to death for while must hardly realise fact of safety knew that be glad to have be saved what might come next be at moment vague uncertain utterly beyond own control hardly ventured to hope more than anton trendellsohn must not give up to madame zamenoy if did must seek river again other mode of escape from worst of fate rebecca have assured of anton love in rebecca word have certain though dreamy faith night be long wished to be longer to be there to feel that be warm safe be almost happiness for after misery have endured on next day for day two afterwards be feverish did not rise rebecca mother came to ruth at last anton never must quite remember how few day be passed what be said how came to be arranged that be to stay for while in rebecca house that be to stay there for long while till such time a must become wife leave for house of own never afterwards have clear conception though very often thought of how came to be settled thing among jew around that be to be anton wife that anton be to take away from prague knew that lover father have come to that have be kind that there have be no reproach cast upon for wickedness have attempted be till found going to mass alone on third sunday that remembered that be still christian that lover be still jew will not seem so strange to when be away in place rebecca said to afterwards will be good for of that must be away from prague did nina hear much of attempt zamenoys made to rescue from hand of jew anton once asked very gravely whether be quite certain that did not wish to see

with police statement that nina be being kept in durance in jew quarter accusation be too manifestly false to receive attention even when made against jew nina have reached age allowed to choose own friend without interposition from law only said anton be necessary that must know own mind do know said nina eagerly saw madame zamenoy more uncle karil cousin ziska though lived in same city with for three month after night on have be taken to rebecca house never again be brought into contact with relation lotta once saw when walking in street with ruth lotta too saw endeavoured to address nina fled to great delight of ruth who ran with lotta luxa be left behind at street corner know that nina ever have more clearly defined idea of trick lotta have played upon than be conveyed to by sight of deed a be taken from desk knowledge that souchey have put lover upon track soon learned that be acquitted altogether by anton did not care for learning more of course there have be trick of course there have be deceit of course aunt lotta luxa ziska who be worst of have have hand in what did signify have failed have be successful why need inquire farther souchey who repented thoroughly of treachery spoke mind freely to lotta luxa said not if have ten time a many florin be twice a clever for nearly drove to be murderer of mistress
