purpose if be hard to hard obstinate in determination then must be enabled to be so also to in determination with le of pain to felt to be duty to teach that be justified in doing what liked with property because intended to do what liked with not only must not say word towards dissuading from change in old intention must make change a little painful to a possible by teaching to think that be justified by own manner to for there be change not only in mind in declared intention llanfeare have belonged to indefer jones for many generation when late squire have died now twenty year ago there have be remaining out of ten child only one eldest to whom property now belonged four five coming in succession after have died without issue then there have be henry jones who have gone away married

be married former old man having be given to extravagance be generally in want of money have felt more comfortable to be without entail son have occasionally be induced to join with in raising money thus not only since have owned estate before father death there have be forced upon reflection a to destination of llanfeare at fifty have found unmarried unlikely to marry brother henry be then alive

about place unlike jones of llanfeare then have come time in isabel have be brought to llanfeare henry have be sent away from oxford for offence not altogether trivial squire have declared to others llanfeare must never fall into hand isabel have so endeared to that before have be two year in house be young mistress of place everything that did be right in eye might have anything that must ask only that must ask for nothing at time cousin have be taken into office in london have become so be said of steady young man of business still when allowed to show at llanfeare be unpalatable to unless might be to old squire be certainly case that in office in london made useful seemed that have abandoned that practice of running into debt having bill sent down to llanfeare have adopted early in career during time old squire be terribly troubled about property will be always close at hand till isabel be twenty one will have always be in henry favour with clause however that certain sum of money squire possessed must go to then in disgust towards nephew changed purpose made will in isabel favour remained in existence a last resolution for three year have be three year of misery to have endured badly idea that place must pas away out of what regarded a proper male line to thinking be simply accident that power of disposing of property must be in hand be religion to that landed estate in britain must go from father to eldest son in default of son to first male heir britain must not be ruined because llanfeare must be allowed to go out of proper order britain must be ruined if briton did not do duty in sphere of life to have pleased god to call in case duty be to maintain old order of thing during time additional trouble added to existing having made up mind to act in opposition to own principle to indulge own heart having declared to nephew to niece that isabel must be heir there came to a consolation in misery power of repurchasing certain fragment of property father with assistance have sold loss of acre have be always sore wound to not because of lessened income from feeling that owner of estate must allow to be diminished during holding of never saw separated field estranged from llanfeare grieved in heart that might get back again have saved money since llanfeare have first become own then have come upon necessity of providing for isabel when with many groan have decided that isabel must be heir money must be allowed to go for intended purpose have so gone then conscience have become too strong for will be made will be seen how have endeavoured to reconcile thing when be found that henry jones be working like steady man at london office to be attached that have sown wild oat then uncle indefer began to ask why dearest wish must not be carried out together by marriage between cousin care bit for wild oat isabel have said almost playfully when idea have first be mooted to oat be too tame for rather than too wild why ca look one in face then uncle have be angry with thinking that be allowing foolish idea to interfere with happiness of anger with be never enduring indeed before time at story commenced have begun to acknowledge to that might rather be afraid of anger than of there be courage about nothing must dash have grown up under eye strong brave sometimes almost bold with dash of humour always quite determined in own idea of wrong right have in truth be afraid of when found compelled to tell of decision to conscience compelled will be made third perhaps fourth fifth have seemed to to be necessary since mind have be exercised in matter made will assured must be last leaving llanfeare to nephew on condition that must prefix name of indefer to of jones adding certain stipulation a to further entail then everything of might die possessed except llanfeare furniture in house left to niece isabel must get rid of horse said to about fortnight after conversation last recorded why will have be made there will be so little now for that must save what can before die oh bother said isabel laughing do suppose be not dreadful to to have to reflect how little can do for may perhaps live for two year may save six seven hundred year have put charge on estate for four thousand pound property be only small thing after not above fifteen hundred year will not hear of horse being sold there be end of have be taken out about place day for last twenty year must crush if be to see change have done best can now leave in god hand pray pray let there be more talking about if only knew how welcome be to chapter ii isabel brodrick when mr indefer jones spoke of living for two year spoke more hopefully of than doctor be wont to speak to isabel doctor from carmarthen visited llanfeare twice week having become intimate confidential with isabel have told that candle have nearly burnt down to socket there be special disease be worn out old man be well that must allow to be driven out about place day be well that must be encouraged to get up after breakfast to eat dinner in middle of day after old fashion be well to do everything around a though be not confirmed invalid doctor thought that must not last long candle a doctor said have nearly burnt out in socket yet there be apparent decay in old man intellect have never be much given to literary pursuit have always done did still daily copy of might be most thoroughly conservative paper of day always read carefully from beginning to end weekly copy of guardian nearly filled up hour be devoted to study on sunday read two sermon through having be forbidden by doctor to take place in church because of draught thinking apparently that must be mean wrong to make excuse for shirking onerous duty hour day be devoted by religiously to bible rest of time be occupied by care of property nothing gratified so much a coming in of one of tenant of whom be so intimately known to that old a be never forgot name even of child idea of raising rent be abominable to around house there be about two hundred acre be supposed to farm on half dozen worn out old labourer be maintained in such manner that return from land be ever forthcoming on subject must endure remonstrance from one not even from isabel such a have be here described must have be happy old man during last half dozen year have not mind be exercised day by day hour by hour by care a to property be ever present to more loving heart than must hardly be found in human bosom power of love have be bestowed on isabel must man be subject to stronger feeling of duty than pervaded feeling of duty induced to declare to that in reference to property be bound to do be demanded of by established custom of order in way have become unhappy man troubled by conflicting feeling be now a be approaching hour of final departure tormented by thought that must leave niece without sufficient provision for want thing be done new will be executed tied in on top of bundle contained other will have made then naturally enough there came back upon idea hardly amounting to hope that something might even yet occur to set matter right by marriage between cousin isabel have spoken to so strongly on subject that did not dare to repeat request yet thought there be good reason why two must not become man wife henry a far a must learn have given up bad course man be not evil to eye somewhat cold looking man rather than otherwise tall with well formed feature with light hair blue grey eye not subject to be spoken of a being unlike gentleman if not noticeable a being like one inability of to look one in face when be speaking have not struck squire forcibly a have done isabel must not have be agreeable to squire have there be bond between must still have be reverse a have be formerly for connexion a thing be there be room for attempt at love if for attempt at love on part why not also on isabel did not dare to bid isabel even to try to love cousin think must like to have down again soon said to niece by mean more tenant know better will be can go to hereford at time why must run away from not from uncle indefer from why from because love must always run away from people love yes when people person be man when man have be told that ought specially to love when said looked into uncle face smiling indeed still asking serious question dared to make answer by face told truth have declared wish to nephew not that mean to be in least afraid of continued perhaps will be better must see if speaks to have out with how long must stay month suppose can come for month then will stay for first week must go to hereford before summer be over will write to then be settled a have proposed wrote uncle letter even to cousin henry unless there be by chance something very special to be communicated on present occasion sent invitation a follows llanfeare th june monday dear henry uncle want to come here on st july stay for month st of july will be monday travel on sunday a did last time because doe not like will be here first part of time then will go to hereford be in middle of summer only that can leave affectionate cousin isabel brodrick have often felt compelled to sign to in way have gone much against grain with to cousin be ordinary thing a be to call different man dear sir though be not in least dear so have reconciled to falsehood incident in isabel life must be told to reader be custom to go to hereford at least once year there to remain at father house for month visit have be made annually since have lived at llanfeare in way have become known to many of hereford people among others who have thus become friend there be young clergyman william owen minor canon attached to cathedral who during last visit have asked to be wife at time have supposed to be uncle heiress looking at a future owner of llanfeare have considered bound to regard offer in reference to future duty to obedience owed to uncle never told lover not did ever quite tell that must certainly accept if bound by such consideration may tell reader that be so have felt to be altogether free must have given to man who have offered love a be answered anything hopefully saying nothing of passion of own speaking of a though be altogether at disposal of uncle have decided now said that when be gone property be to be minor canon who have heard nothing of drew up a though about to declare in pride that have not intended to ask for hand of lady of llanfeare must make difference in continued reading plainly expression in young man face regard must be swayed one way other by feeling of kind a have chosen to make daughter must obey a daughter be not probable that will consent to marriage then there have be nothing further between till isabel on return to llanfeare have written to to say that uncle have decided against marriage that decision be final now in isabel have certainly be hardly used though ill usage have in part be due to own reticence a to own feeling when told squire that offer have be made to did so a if have be almost indifferent william owen squire have said repeating name grandfather kept inn at pembroke believe did said isabel calmly must wish to make owner of llanfeare did not say so rejoined isabel have told what occurred have asked what thought then squire shook head there be end of letter be written to minor canon telling that squire decision be final in there have be allusion to love on part of isabel have there be uncle must hardly have pressed upon claim of nephew manner in regard to young clergyman have be so cold a to leave upon uncle impression that matter be one of little moment to isabel be matter of infinite moment yet when be asked again again to arrange difficulty of family by marrying cousin be forced to carry on conversation a though such person existed a lover at hereford yet squire remembered remembered that when have thus positively objected to grandson of innkeeper have done so because have felt to be duty to keep grandson of innkeeper out of llanfeare that grandson of old thomas owen of pembroke lion must reign at llanfeare in place of indefer jones have be abominable to to prevent have certainly be within duty be very different now when must leave girl poorly provided for without friend without roof of own over head yet though name be brodrick too be jones father though attorney have come of family nearly a good a own in case must be right that must marry grandson of old thomas owen therefore hitherto have never again referred to proposal of marriage must again have spoken of answer might perhaps have be le decided have again spoken of clergyman be hard upon isabel who if said nothing still thought of lover must be acknowledged also that though did not speak still thought of future prospect have laughed at idea of being solicitous a to inheritance have done so in order that might thereby lessen trouble of uncle mind knew a well a did difference between position have be promised a owner of llanfeare that to must be reduced a stepdaughter of stepmother who did not love knew too that have be cold to william owen giving sort of encouragement having seemed to declare to that have rejected because be uncle heiress knew also thought that knew that be not possessed of feminine gift probably might make man constant under difficulty more have be heard of william owen during last nine month now then letter must come to from one of younger sister who now have own anxiety own love not word be there in one of of william owen therefore may be said that last change in uncle purpose have fallen upon with peculiar hardness never uttered complaint even looked one a for utterance there be one to whom must have spoken there have never be many word between own family a to inheritance a have be reticent to father so have to idea in attorney house at hereford be that be stubborn conceited disdainful may be that in regard to stepmother there be something of let be a might there have be little confidence between a to matter at llanfeare be doubt supposed by father that be to be uncle heir conceited perhaps be a to certain gift of character did believe herself to be strong of purpose capable of endurance in respect be humble enough gave credit for feminine charm such a world love in appearance be one calculated to attract attention somewhat tall well set on limb active of good figure brow be broad fine grey eye be bright full of intelligence nose mouth be well formed there be not mean feature in face there be withal certain roughness about absence of feminine softness in complexion to tell truth of be more conspicuous to own eye than to others farmer wife about place must declare that miss isabel be finest young woman in south wale with farmer wife be on excellent term knowing way anxious a to want with gentry around concerned little uncle habit be not adapted to keeping of much company to uncle habit have fitted altogether be on account that did know young men around did know then because such intimacy have grown up told that be unlike other girl that be rough unattractive unpopular then day came for arrival of henry jones during approach to uncle indefer have from day to day become more more uneasy isabel have ceased to say word against when have be proposed to a lover have declared that have loathed now that suggestion have be abandoned left in abeyance therefore dealt with name with coming a might with of other guest looked to room asked question a to comfort must not be well to provide separate dinner for seeing that three o'clock must be regarded a awkward hour by man from london if doe like have better go back to london said old squire in anger anger be not intended against girl against man who by mere force of birth be creating such sea of trouble have told what intention be squire said to nephew on evening of arrival be sure that be very much obliged to dear uncle need not be in least obliged to have done what conceive to be duty can still change if find that deserve a for isabel deserves everything can be done for isabel have never given slightest cause for displeasure doubt whether there be better creature in world living than isabel deserves everything a be male heir think right that must follow in property unless show to be unworthy be certainly greeting hard to be endured speech very difficult to answer nevertheless be satisfactory if only old squire must not again change mind young man have thought much about have come to resolution that best way to insure good thing promised must be to induce isabel to be wife be sure be that say uncle indefer replied uncle indefer grunted told that if wanted supper have better go get chapter iii cousin henry cousin henry found position to be difficult precarious that suggestion of uncle rather assertion that must still change mind be disagreeable doubt must do so a cousin henry thought must be very man to do if angered thwarted even annoyed knew that more than one will have already be made set aside cousin henry have turned whole matter very much in mind since have become cognizant of uncle character however imprudent might have be in earlier day be now quite alive to importance of being squire of llanfeare there be nothing that be not ready to do to please conciliate uncle llanfeare without isabel a burden must doubt be preferable be quite ready to marry isabel to morrow if isabel must only accept game have to play be for llanfeare be to be llanfeare nothing position offered to be to come not from love from sense of duty on part of old man if must keep old man firm to idea llanfeare must be own must be excluded from inheritance there must be lesser prize by might reconcile to loss uncle must not leave anything from love understood thoroughly be therefore not unnaturally nervous a to own conduct at present crisis be only too manifest to that uncle did in fact dislike at very first interview be made to listen to praise of isabel threat against be quite prepared to put up with with other disagreeable hardship might be inflicted upon if only must do so successfully believed that best course must be to press suit with isabel must do so successfully must at rate be safe must be persistent in refusing believed to be probable then must have shown desirous of carrying out uncle wish a to be clear sighted enough did not quite perceive state of uncle mind in regard to did not understand how painfully old man be still vacillating between affection duty did fathom depth of love uncle felt for isabel have be altogether wise in matter must have kept out of uncle presence have devoted to tenant land in lieu of intruded a much a possible into uncle morning room often to exclusion of isabel now have come to pas uncle indefer be never at ease unless niece be with nobody can be more attached to than be to isabel said nephew to uncle on third morning of arrival whereupon uncle indefer grunted more saw of man le liked idea of sacrificing isabel to husband will certainly do best to carry out wish wish have reference solely to exactly sir understand completely a be not to be heiress best thing possible be to be done for think that marrying must be best thing possible uncle said in tone of scorn must have be very hard to bear be unjust too a unfortunate nephew have certainly not intended to speak of personally a being best thing possible for isabel too have to be borne meant sir that if must accept hand must have pretty nearly a great interest in property a must have much more said uncle indefer angrily know man woman child about place there be not one of who doe not love so ought for have be best friend a far a be concerned be almost cruel that must not be left in hand so will be sir if will consent to do a wish wish pshaw then repeated grunt turning shoulder round against nephew affecting to read newspaper have held in hand during conversation must be acknowledged that part to be played by intended heir be very difficult must perceive that uncle hated must not understand that might best lessen hatred by relieving uncle of presence there sat looking at empty grate pretending now again to read old newspaper be lying on table while uncle fumed grunted during moment be so passed uncle indefer be asking whether british custom a to male heir be absolutely essential to welfare of country here be two person suggested to mind one of whom be to be future successor one of be undoubtedly sweetest human being have ever crossed path other a be inclined to think at present moment be least sweet a be to must not be to tenant whose welfare be to depend so much on future owner of property longer that endured presence of man more desirous did feel of turning to drawer be close at hand destroying topmost of document lay there tied in bundle together did not allow to be at once driven to step so unreasonable young man have done nothing ought to offend have indeed only obeyed in coming down to south wale that custom of country be good valid wise if believed in anything of world worldly believed in primogeniture in respect of land though isabel be ever so sweet duty be duty who be that must dare to say to that must break through what believed to be law on conscience without sin if might permit to make special exemption for in indulgence of own affection then why might not so on did not know that must have be better that whole thing must have be settled for by entail if so how must be right that must act in opposition to spirit of such entail merely because have power to do so thus argued with again again argument must never become strong till nephew have relieved of presence while be so arguing cousin henry be trying hand with isabel there have be week for to do three day have already passed away at end of week isabel be to go to hereford henry a far a knew be still expected by uncle to make offer to cousin a regarded be well enough disposed to do so be man with strong affection also with strong aversion except at present have strong affection for llanfeare strong aversion to monotonous office in be wont to earn daily bread up in london too be desirous of doing duty a long a doing of duty might tend to desired possession of llanfeare be full of idea that great deal be due to isabel great deal be certainly due to isabel if only by admitting so much possession of llanfeare be to be assured so be going away in two three day said to in four day be to start on monday be very soon be so sorry that be to leave suppose be best that dear uncle indefer must not be left alone must have gone at time in case said isabel who must not allow to be supposed that must fill place near uncle nevertheless be sorry that must not have remained while be here of course can not be helped then paused have not word further to say must see by anxiety displayed in face by more than usually unnatural tone in voice that be about to make proposition be quite prepared for remained silent fixed attentive isabel said suppose uncle indefer have told what intends must say so think always tell what intends about property mean yes about property believe have made will leaving to believe have done not because love best because think ought to go to male heir quite agree with that thing must not be governed by affection be so good that will certainly do what belief to be duty nevertheless effect be same oh yes a regard effect will be same will have property whether come from love duty will lose can not lose what never be mine said smiling why must not have one a well a other ca do yes can if will do what wish what wish also love with heart opened eye a though driven to do so by surprise knew that must not have expressed in way must not avoid temptation do indeed with heart why must not marry know then property must belong to of yes then must why must not eh isabel then approached a though about to make ordinary symptom of lover passion sit down there henry will tell why can not do love in least might learn to love never never that lesson must be impossible to now let there be end of uncle indefer have dare say asked to make proposition wrote letter just saying that must like exactly so have found compelled to do bidding have done then let there be end of must not marry angel even to oblige to get llanfeare be not angel to way of thinking know about angel said trying still to be good humoured be nonsense there be question of angel not for llanfeare not even to oblige must undertake to marry man even if be near to loving must have to love entirely without reference to llanfeare be not at near loving why not isabel asked foolishly because because because be odious to isabel beg pardon must not have said so be very wrong then why did ask so foolish question did not tell to let there be end of now will let give one little bit of advice what be asked angrily be beginning to hate though be anxious to repress hatred lest by indulging must injure prospect say word about to uncle will be better for not to tell that there have be between such interview a if did once wish that must become man wife think that wish now let thing slide a say have quite made up mind in favour because be duty unless do something to displease very greatly will make further change trouble more than can help by talking to on thing be distasteful anything in regard to coming from will be distasteful to have better go about among farm see tenant learn condition of everything then talk to about do never suggest that money coming from be le than ought to be be advice now if please need not talk about more then got up left room without waiting for reply when be alone resolved upon complying with advice at rate in one respect must not renew offer of marriage must hold further special conversation with of course be hateful to having declared so plainly to own opinion regarding have made offer have thereby done duty have made offer have escaped did not at believe in sincerity of advice a to uncle heart be throbbing with desire to secure inheritance to so thought doubt be hers a to herself might be that old man intention must depend upon obedience if so be certainly necessary that old man must know that have be obedient of course must tell old man what have done said not word till isabel have gone did take advice about land tenant hardly to much effect if there be falling roof here half hung door there displayed zeal by telling squire of default squire hated to hear of such default must be acknowledged that must have required man of very great part to have given satisfaction in position in young man be placed a soon a isabel be gone declared obedience have asked sir have refused said in melancholy low sententious voice what did expect at rate did a must have be to jump down throat when asked be very decided very of course spoke of wish have not wish thought that desired so did have changed mind must not do at almost wonder how must have have courage to ask suppose that have insight to see that be different from other girl oh yes perceived that yet must go ask to be wife off hand just a though be going to buy horse suppose told that must be good thing because of estate did mention said young man altogether astounded put beyond by uncle manner word yes just a if be bargain if will consent to put up with a husband why then can go share with in property be kind of thing be then come tell that have done duty by making offer heir expectant be then convinced that must have be better for to have followed advice isabel have given yet must not bring to believe that advice have be disinterested why must isabel have given disinterested advice in opposition to own prospect must not isabel feeling about property be same a own chapter iv squire death with sore heart isabel went way to hereford troubled because saw nothing sorrow vexation in store for uncle know that be getting weaker day said yet be not long since have spoken of living for two year will stay asked isabel must be wrong ought to go to father suppose will live till come back oh uncle indefer what if did die be not that trouble then kissed left knew how vain be to ask further question understanding thoroughly nature of sorrow idea that nephew must be master of llanfeare be so bitter to that must hardly endure then added to be vexation of nephew presence that three week must be passed alone with man three week of little be left to of life seemed to be cruel addition to greater sorrow isabel went uncle nephew be left to do best must with other company isabel have not seen mr owen heard from since writing of letter in have told of uncle decision now must be necessary that must meet looked forward to doing so almost with fear trembling on one point have made up mind thought that have made up mind a have refused when supposed to be heiress of llanfeare certainly must not accept must feel constrained by sense of honour to renew offer to now that position be so different have not accused in own heart of having come to because of supposed wealth thinking well of in other matter thought well of also in still there be fact that have refused when supposed to be heiress not even to secure happiness must allow to think that accepted because of altered circumstance yet be in love with have now acknowledged to herself that be so position in a in thing seemed to be so cruel have be heiress of llanfeare must not have married because must then have be duty to comply with wish of uncle such duty must now be imposed upon at rate after uncle death a simple isabel brodrick might marry whom must without bringing discredit upon indefer jones that have be constrained to do before uncle have changed purpose now tied hand did seem to cruel told that be peculiarly duty to bear such cruelty without complaint of uncle intense love to be fully aware loving a warmly be prepared to bear everything on account vacillation have be unfortunate for in everything have done best according to light perhaps there be present to mind something of pride of martyr perhaps gloried little in hardship of position be determined to have glory martyrdom to herself human being must ever hear from lip word of complaint against uncle indefer day after arrival father asked few question a to uncle intention in reference to property think be settled said think have be left to cousin henry then have changed mind said father angrily did mean to make heiress henry be at llanfeare now henry will be heir why have changed nothing can be more unjust than to make promise in such matter then to break who say that made promise have never heard anything of kind from papa must so much rather not talk about llanfeare ever since have known uncle indefer have be love to must not allow thought of mine to be polluted by ingratitude towards whatever have done have done because have thought to be best perhaps ought to tell that have made charge on property on behalf will prevent being burden upon week ten day after when have be nearly fortnight at hereford be told that william owen be coming in to drink tea communication be made to by stepmother in serious tone be always intended to convey matter of importance have other minor canon other gentleman be coming to tea fact must have be announced in different manner will be delighted to see said isabel suppressing with usual fortitude slightest symptom of emotion hope will dear be sure be very anxious to see then mr owen came drank tea in midst of family isabel must perceive that be somewhat confused not quite able to talk in usual tone that be especially anxious a to manner towards took part in conversation a though there be nothing peculiar in meeting spoke of llanfeare of uncle failing health of cousin visit taking care to indicate by apparently chance word that henry be received there a heir played part well evincing sign of special feeling ear be awake to slightest tone in voice after have received information have given knew that voice be altered did not read alteration altogether aright will call in morning said a gave hand at parting there be pressure of hand still have addressed especially to why must come in morning have made up mind at spur of moment that news have heard have settled that matter for ever if so why must come in morning then felt a sat alone in room that have done foul injustice in spur of moment must be that have done injustice must not have said that must come if must be generous so must have refused when believed to be heiress of llanfeare certainly must not accept now on next morning about eleven o'clock came have become aware that be intention of family that must see alone made struggle against intention a such intention existed interview must of course take place a well now a later there be confidence on matter between herself stepmother special confidence between even half sister be aware that supposed that mr owen be to come there on morning for sake of renewing offer to be soon done when have come isabel said have brought with that

bedside in course of afternoon did leave hereford at about ten o'clock night be at carmarthen one concerned have looked into matter of train there at station be fly ready to take to llanfeare before eleven uncle hand be in hers a stood by bedside cousin henry be in room so be housekeeper who have be with constantly almost ever since have left have seen at once by manner of old servant a entered house from woeful face of butler from presence of cook who have lived in family for last twenty year that something terrible be expected be not thus that must have be received have not danger be imminent dr powell say miss isabel that be to be told that will be here quite early in morning coming from cook told that uncle be expected to live night that more be expected uncle indefer said how be with uncle indefer speak to moved head little upon pillow turned face somewhat towards hers there be slight return to grasp of hand there be gleam of loving brightness left in eye must not then speak word when after hour left room for few minute to get rid of travelling clothes to prepare for watching by through night housekeeper whom isabel have known ever since have be at llanfeare declared that in opinion uncle must never speak again doctor miss isabel thought so when left hurried down at once occupied place old woman have filled for last three day night before long have banished woman so that to might belong luxury of doing anything if aught must be done that cousin must be there be altogether unnecessary if old man must know one at deathbed certainly must not wish to see heir whom have chosen must go must indeed said isabel then cousin went so at last with persuasion did housekeeper sat there hour after hour with hand lying gently upon when must move for moment though be to moisten lip must give sign of impatience for hour lay in way till early dawn of summer morning broke into room through chink of shutter then there came from sign of stronger life at last with low muttered voice indistinct not so indistinct that sound be caught whispered word two be all right be done soon afterwards rang bell violently when nurse entered room declared that old master be more when doctor arrived at seven having ridden out from carmarthen there be nothing for further to do to give certificate a to manner of death of indefer jones esq late of llanfeare in county of carmarthen chapter v preparing for funeral isabel when be left alone felt that terrible weight of duty be imposed on seemed to be immediately encompassed by double world of circumstance there be that world of grief be so natural must yet be easy must only be allowed to sit down weep be explained to that until after funeral till will must have be read everything about llanfeare must be done by in obedience to order necessity of action of action in present condition of mind did not seem clear to be not at easy doctor be good to gave instruction before left will give key to cousin said to even a said there be doubt on mind what last word of uncle have be intended to mean though grief be very bitter though sorrow be quite sincere must not keep from thinking of word be not that be anxious to get estate for herself be hardly in way that matter in moment presented to did meaning of word impose on duty must be right that must speak of be silent ought to suppose that have meaning if so that referred to will think that must keep key till after will have be read said doctor even though must ask for even though must ask for said doctor will not press such request if tell that say ought to be so if there be difficulty send for mr apjohn mr apjohn be lawyer there have be quite lately disagreement between uncle mr apjohn advice be not palatable to continued dr powell will not find difficulty of kind funeral have better be on monday will suppose can be read afterwards mr apjohn will come out read there can be difficulty about know that mr apjohn feeling be of kindest towards uncle mr apjohn have taken upon to scold uncle because of altered will will have be altered in favour of cousin henry so much old man have said to isabel if think proper have no right to scold old man have said scolding have probably be in guise of advice lawyer so often feel justified in giving isabel thought that have better keep word to herself at rate for present almost resolved that must keep word altogether to herself unless other fact must come out must explain meaning testify to truth must say nothing of in way must seem to imply that have be led by to conceive that expected property did certainly think that alluded to property be all right be done when uncle have uttered word using last effort of mortal strength for purpose doubt be thinking of property have meant to imply that have done something to make last decision right in favour be thought sure of so much then bore in mind condition of old man failing mind wandering thought must so naturally endeavour to fix upon upon property in combination with other how probable be that must dream of something that must fain do then dream that have done knew too a well a lawyer must know that word must go for nothing though have be spoken before dozen witness if later will be there later will must speak for if later will be there word be empty breath above be anxious that one must think that be desirous of property that one must suppose that must be hurt by not having be not desirous be not hurt matter be so important have so seriously burdened uncle mind that must not feel weight a to own desire be limited to wish that uncle will whatever might be must be carried out not to have llanfeare not to have even shilling from uncle estate must hurt little must hurt heart not at to know that be thought by others that be disappointed must be grievous burden to therefore spoke to dr powell even to cousin a though estate be doubtless now property of latter henry jones at time during day immediately following uncle death seemed to be so much awe struck by position a to be incapable of action to cousin isabel be almost servile in obedience with bated breath did suggest that key must be surrendered to making proposition simply on ground that must thus be saved from trouble when told that be duty to keep till after funeral that must be duty to act a mistress in house till after ceremony be cringing in compliance think best isabel will be done must not interfere for moment then time afterwards on following day assured that might be nature of will be to regard llanfeare a home a long a must suit to remain there will go back to papa very soon have said a soon indeed a can have thing packed up after funeral have already written to papa to say so everything will be just a please replied only pray believe that if can do anything for accommodation will be done to made formal answer of courtesy not may be feared very graciously did not believe in civility did not think be kind to in heart must not bring to make manner false to feeling after during day remained before funeral very little be said between dislike to grew in bitterness though failed to explain even to herself cause of dislike did know that uncle have be in truth a little disposed to love a herself knowledge seemed to justify last word have assured at rate of though be quite sure of own conscience in regard to llanfeare though be certain that did not covet possession of domain still be unhappy to think that must become if only for tenant sake servant old house there be thousand pity in then belief must intrude upon that uncle in last expression of wish have not intended nephew to be heir then in day report reached seemed to confirm own belief have not be habit of life to talk intimately with servant even though at llanfeare there have be no other woman with whom must talk intimately there have be about sense of personal dignity have made such freedom distasteful to herself have repressed in now housekeeper have come to with story to isabel have found impossible not to listen be reported about place that squire have certainly executed will few day after isabel have left llanfeare if so said isabel sternly will be found when mr apjohn come to open paper housekeeper did not seem satisfied with though believed that document have be written mr apjohn have not be sent for a have always be done on former similar occasion making of squire will have be thing always known well understood at llanfeare mr apjohn have be sent for on such occasion have returned after day two accompanied by two clerk be quite understood that clerk be there to witness will old butler who must bring in sherry biscuit after operation be well acquainted with testamentary circumstance of occasion nothing of kind have occurred now old joseph cantor who have be tenant on property for last thirty year son joseph cantor younger have be called in be supposed that have performed duty of witnessing document housekeeper seemed to think that when interrogated have declined to give information on subject have not seen have seen others of tenant be certain said that llanfeare generally believed that old squire have executed will during absence of niece in answer to isabel simply said that if new will must turn out to be real will have actually be made must be found among uncle paper knew well manner in other will have be tied deposited in one of drawer of uncle table have be invited to read have understood from thousand assurance that have wished that nothing must be kept secret from key of very drawer be at moment in possession there be nothing to hinder from searching must wish to search never touched drawer key locked placed in envelope put apart under lock key though listened though must not listen to old woman narrative rebuked narrator there must be talking about such thing said have be said uncle intention to make nephew owner of llanfeare believed that have done so be better that there must be conversation on matter until will have be read during day did not go beyond precinct of garden be careful not to encounter of tenant even when called at house mr apjohn did not see dr powell again till day of funeral lawyer have written to more than once have explained to exactly manner in intended to proceed with dr powell must be at house at eleven o'clock funeral must be over at half past twelve must lunch at one immediately afterwards will must be looked for read word looked for be underscored in letter special explanation of underscoring be given went on to say that tenant must a matter of course attend funeral that have taken upon to invite few of who have known squire most intimately to be present at reading of will named among be joseph cantor elder joseph cantor younger immediately occurred to isabel that son be not tenant that one else who be not tenant be included in list from be sure that mr apjohn have heard story housekeeper have told during day there be little intercourse between isabel cousin at dinner met only at dinner even then almost nothing be said between what did with during day did not even know at llanfeare there be so called book room small apartment placed between drawing room parlour in be kept few hundred volume constituted library of llanfeare have not be much used by late squire except that from time to time must enter for sake of taking down with own hand volume of sermon from shelf have for year be accustomed to sit in parlour in ate meal have hated ceremony of moving even into drawing room isabel have sitting room of own upstairs too have never used book room here cousin henry have now placed here remained through whole day though be not believed of that be given to much reading for breakfast supper went to parlour alone at dinner time isabel came down through long hour of day remained among book never once leaving house till moment came for receiving mr apjohn dr powell before funeral housekeeper must say little word about wondering what be doing in book room to isabel must apparently pay attention simply remarking that be natural that at time must remain in seclusion doe get so very pale miss isabel said housekeeper be white not like when come first to llanfeare to isabel made reply too have remarked how wan how pallid how spiritless have become on monday morning when men upstairs be at work on ghastly duty before coming of doctor lawyer went down to to tell something of programme for day hitherto have simply be informed that on morning body must be buried under wall of old parish church that after funeral will must be read entering room somewhat suddenly found seated vacant in chair with open book indeed on table near so placed that be sure that have not be occupied with there be looking apparently at bookshelf when entered room jumped up to greet with air of evident surprise mr apjohn dr powell will be here at eleven said oh ah yes replied thought must tell that might be ready yes be very kind be ready men came in just now put band on hat laid glove there will not go of course yes will follow body see why must not go a well a woman may be strong enough at rate for then will come back to lunch oh indeed did not know that there must be lunch yes dr powell say that will be proper will not be there of course will be present to take head of table if wish of course must be proper there must be one to seem at rate to entertain when be over mr apjohn will find will will read richard will lay lunch here so that may go at once into parlour where will will be read tell that be to be there will do a bid though will be sore trouble to dr powell will be there of tenant mr apjohn have thought right to ask therefore tell who will be present be a follows john griffith of coed william griffith who have home farm mr mortimer green of kidwelly samuel jones of llanfeare grange two cantor joseph cantor father joseph son know whether know by appearance a yet yes said know face be almost sepulchral a answered a looked at perceived that slight quiver came upon lip a pronounced with peculiar clearness two last name on list thought best to tell added if find possible will go to hereford on wednesday most of thing be already packed may be that something may occur to stop if be possible will go on wednesday chapter vi mr apjohn explanation reader need not be detained with elaborate account of funeral tenant labourer about place be there a also be many of people from carmarthen llanfeare church stand on point of little river just a run into creek of sea be not more than four mile distant from town such be respect in old squire be held that large crowd be present a body be lowered into vault then lunch followed just a isabel have said there be cousin henry there be doctor lawyer there be tenant who have be specially honoured by invitation there be joseph cantor younger viand be eaten freely though occasion be not happy one appetite be good even amidst grief farmer of llanfeare took victual wine in funereal silence not without enjoyment mr apjohn dr powell also be hungry being accustomed perhaps to such entertainment did not allow good thing prepared to go waste cousin henry though made attempt must not swallow morsel took glass of wine then second helping from bottle a stood near at hand ate nothing spoke hardly word at first made attempt voice seemed to fail not one of farmer addressed syllable to have before funeral taken of by hand even then have not spoken to be rough of manner little able to conceal feeling understood well from bearing that be odious to now a sat at table with determined that a soon a matter must be settled must take away from llanfeare even though llanfeare must belong to while be at table lawyer doctor said word to making struggle to be courteous after first struggle attempt ceased also with silence of man even pallor of face might be supposed to be excused by nature of occasion now said mr apjohn rising from table when eating drinking have ceased think might a well go into next room miss brodrick who have consented to be present will probably be waiting for passed through hall into parlour in long string mr apjohn leading way followed by cousin henry there found isabel sitting with housekeeper beside shook hand in silence with attorney doctor tenant then a took seat spoke word to mr apjohn a have felt hard to be alone have asked mr griffith to remain with hope be not improper there can be reason on earth said mr apjohn why mr griffith must not hear will of master who respected so thoroughly mr griffith bobbed curtsey in return for civility then sat down intently interested in coming ceremony mr apjohn took from pocket envelope containing key opening little packet very slowly very slowly opened drawer took out from bundle of paper tied with red tape undid then sitting with bundle loosened before examined document lying at top then slowly spreading out a though pausing over operation with premeditated delay held in hand have at first taken be in truth thinking of word must have to use at present moment have expected have expected with doubt that document must have be found there close at right hand sat dr powell round room in distant chair be ranged six farmer with hat in hand between knee on sofa opposite be isabel housekeeper cousin henry sat alone not very far from end of sofa almost in middle of room a operation went on one of hand quivered so much that endeavoured to hold with other to keep from shaking be impossible that one there must not observe trepidation too evident discomfort document lying at top of bundle be opened out very slowly by attorney who smoothed down with hand preparatory to reading then looked at date to assure that be last will have drawn knew well be cognizant with legal quiddity must judiciously have explained clause of without reading word might probably have to do so before occasion be over delayed looking down upon still smoothing evidently taking minute two to collect thought will now under hand be very objectionable to having be made altogether in opposition to own advice having thus created that scolding of squire have complained to isabel will bequeathed whole of property to cousin henry did also affect to leave certain sum of money to isabel sum of money have be left simply a sum of money not a charge on property now within last few day mr apjohn have learnt that there be fund remaining for payment of such legacy will therefore be to thoroughly distasteful must will in truth be found to be last will testament of old squire then must be duty to declare that estate everything upon belonged to cousin henry that there must be a feared source from considerable part of money nominally left to miss brodrick must be defrayed to thinking nothing must be more cruel nothing more unjust than have heard tidings must make duty to question authenticity of will be now under hand now have come moment in must explain document hold here said purport to be last will of old friend will doe that a matter of course then there may always be later will here paused looked round room at face of farmer so there be said joseph cantor younger hold tongue joe till be asked said father at little interruption other farmer turned hat in hand cousin henry gazed round at said never word lawyer looked into heir face saw great bead of sweat standing on brow hear what young mr cantor have said continued lawyer be glad that interrupted because will make task easier there now feyther said young man triumphantly hold tongue joe till be asked will lend ye cuff now must explain continued mr apjohn what passed between dear old friend when received instruction from in room a to document be now before will excuse mr jones said addressing especially to cousin henry if say did not like new purpose on squire part be proposing altogether new arrangement a to disposition of property though there must be doubt not shadow of doubt a to sufficiency of mental power for object in view still did not think well that old man in feeble health must change purpose to have come in maturer year after very long deliberation on matter of such vital moment expressed opinion strongly explained reason told that thought right to keep property in direct line of family endeavoured to explain to that might be sufficiently done though property be left to lady if lady be required to take name to confer name on husband must afterwards marry will probably understand circumstance understand said john griffith of coed who be supposed to be tenant of most importance on property well then urged idea perhaps too strongly be bound to say that felt very strongly mr indefer jones remarked that be not business to lecture on matter in conscience be concerned in be undoubtedly right still thought have done no more than duty must only be sorry that be angry with can assure never for moment entertained feeling of anger against be altogether in right be actuated simply by sense of duty be quite sure of said samuel jones from grange old farmer who be supposed to be far away cousin of family have said continued lawyer to explain why might be probable that mr jones must not have sent for if in last day felt called on by duty to alter yet once again decision to have come can understand that if determined in illness to make yet will did said younger cantor interrupting exactly will come to directly joe will be made to sit out in kitchen ye will said cantor father can understand say that might not like to see again upon subject in such case must have come back to opinion have advocated though man in strong health must have be more ready to acknowledge error than indefer jones of llanfeare know that with failing strength come failing courage think that must have be so with for reason did not avail of service if there be such will there be said irrepressible joe cantor younger upon father only looked at name be to continued joe can not say that for certain mr cantor said lawyer old squire may have made will a say may have destroyed must have will before can use if left such will will be found among paper have turned over nothing a yet a be here in drawer tied in bundle mr jones be accustomed to keep will a last will made be here a expected to find together with have made before seems never to have wished to destroy have have to explain to be suppose true mr cantor that son be called upon by squire to witness signature to document purported to be will on monday th of july then joseph cantor father told circumstance a have occurred when mr henry jones have be about fortnight at llanfeare when miss isabel have be gone week cantor have happened to come up to see squire a be custom to do at least once week then squire have told that service also of son be needed for witnessing of deed mr jones have gone on to explain that deed be to be last will old farmer seemed have suggested to landlord that mr apjohn must be employed squire then declared that must be unnecessary that have copied former will exactly compared word for word reproduced with other alteration than of date be wanted must be signature efficiently witnessed by two person who must be present together with testator then document have be signed by squire after by farmer son have be written said joseph cantor not on long broad paper such a have be used for will now lying on table before lawyer on sheet of square paper such a be now found in squire desk cantor have not read word of what have there be set down have be enabled to see that be written in peculiarly accurate laborious handwriting squire be known to use not more frequently than must help thus story be told at least that there be to tell a yet drawer be opened ransacked a be also other drawer belonging to table then regular search be made by attorney accompanied by doctor butler housemaid continued through whole afternoon in vain farmer be dismissed a soon a explanation have be given a above described during remainder of day cousin henry occupied chair in parlour looking on a search be continued offered help be natural enough did make remark a to work in hand be perhaps also natural matter be to one of such preponderating moment that must hardly be expected to speak of be to have llanfeare belonged to be to have nothing then though accusation be made against though one have insinuated that have be to blame in matter still there be apparent among strong feeling against who have made away with will a to existence of at one time there be doubt of course idea be present to mind that must think that have done so in such circumstance be not singular that must say nothing hing late in evening mr apjohn just before left house asked cousin henry question received answer mr griffith tell mr jones that be closeted with uncle for about hour immediately after cantor have left on tuesday just after signature have be written be so again drop of sweat came out stood thick upon forehead mr apjohn must understand without making accusation against man even in heart unexpressed suspicion be so heavy that man might well sweat under burden of paused moment tried to look a though be thinking yes said think be with uncle on morning knew that cantor have be with not that remember think did know that somebody have be there yes did know have seen hat in hall did say anything about not that remember of what be talking can tell rather fancy that did not talk much to think be then that told name of tenant used to scold because did not understand nature of lease did scold then think so always scolded did not like used to think must go away leave wish that have never come to llanfeare do do there seemed to be touch of truth about almost softened mr apjohn heart to poor wretch must mind answering one more question mr jones said did tell that have made will that intended to do so no never spoke to about will further will must again bestow estate on cousin said cousin henry with perspiration still on brow now seemed to mr apjohn certain have old man made such change in purpose must have informed nephew of fact chapter vii looking for will search be carried on up to nine o'clock evening then mr apjohn returned to carmarthen explaining that must send out two men to continue work on tuesday that must come out again on wednesday to read might then be regarded a old squire will last prepared document if must be found former one must search have be unsuccessful of course said in presence of two cousin reading document will give force of found last in date will be good until one later be found will be well however that step must be taken nothing can be done till will have be read then took leave went back to carmarthen isabel have not shown during whole of afternoon when mr apjohn explanation have be given search commenced retired went to own room be impossible for to take part in work be being done almost equally impossible for to remain without seeming to take too lively interest in proceeding point of affair be clear to imagination must not now be doubted by that uncle doubly actuated by presence of man disliked absence of whom so dearly loved have found driven to revoke decision to have be brought a put to herself love have got better of conscience during weakness of latter day be pity pity that must have be so be to be regretted that there must have be one near to comfort in misery have produced lamentable result will thought must be outcome of man strength not of weakness having obeyed conscience must have clung to conscience must not affect what have be done seemed to be certain to that other will have be made executed even though must have be irregularly executed so a to be null void still must for time at least have have existence where be now having thought in mind be impossible for to go about house among who be searching be impossible for to encounter tremulous misery of cousin that must shiver shake be covered with bead of perspiration during period of such intense perturbation did not seem to to be unnatural be not fault that have not be endowed with especial manliness disliked in cowardice almost more than before must not on account allow to suspect of crime mr apjohn just before went have interview with in own room can not go without word said only purport will be to tell can not a yet express decided opinion in matter suppose mr apjohn that be anxious for will said be have nothing to do with that did make will have witnessed by two cantor be think certain that must afterwards have destroyed will without telling witness who must be sure hereafter to think talk of what have done seems to be most unlike thoughtful consideration of uncle weakness increased upon very quickly just at time dr powell think that be certainly competent on day to make will think also may have destroyed day two afterwards when mind be hardly strong enough to enable to judge of what be doing if at last new will will not be forthcoming think must be bound to interpret matter in way tell before go in order that may assist perhaps little in forming own opinion then went be impossible that must bethink at moment that knew more than dr powell mr apjohn last expression of old man thought upon upon matter have be made to herself last word that have uttered have be whispered into ear be all right be done let light of failing intellect have be ever so dim let strength have faded from ever so completely must not have whispered word have destroyed that last document mr apjohn have spoken of opinion be to form felt how impossible to must be not to have opinion in matter must not keep mind vacant even if must mr apjohn have said that if will be not found must think that squire have in weakness again changed mind destroyed be sure that be not so alone have heard last word be be not duty to tell mr apjohn that such word have be uttered have referred to interest of one of course must have be duty now now doubted did not choose to seem even to put forth claim on own account of what use must be revelation a to uttering of word must be accepted in court of law a evidence in one direction upon whole thought must keep peace regarding even to mr apjohn if be to be that cousin must live there a squire owner of llanfeare why must seek to damage character by calling in question will under must inherit property thus determined that must speak of uncle last word to one what must be opinion a to whole transaction at present moment felt bound to think that missing document must be found that to seemed to be only solution must not be terrible to contemplate that other solution of destruction of will by uncle own hand altogether repudiated if be not found then what then must not then be evident that fraud be being perpetrated if so by whom a thought forced upon mind must not think of pallid face shaking hand great drop of sweat from time to time have forced on to man brow be natural that must suffer be natural that must be perturbed under consciousness of hostile feeling of around yet there have hardly be occasion for sign of fear have found impossible not to notice a have sat there in parlour while mr apjohn be explaining circumstance of two will must innocent man have trembled like because circumstance around be difficult must anything guilt have betrayed by such emotion then have will in truth be made away with by human hand what other hand must have done who else be interested who else be there at llanfeare not interested in preservation of will must have left property to did not begrudge estate have acknowledged strength of reason have induced squire to name a heir declared to herself that if latter document be not found deed of hideous darkness must have be perpetrated by with thought disturbing breast lay awake during long hour of night when mr apjohn have taken departure servant have gone to bed butler having barred double barred door after usual manner cousin henry still sat alone in book room after answering question from mr apjohn have spoken to one still sat alone with single candle burning on table by elbow butler have gone to twice asking whether wanted anything suggesting to that have better go to bed heir if be heir have only resented intrusion desiring that might be left alone then be left alone there sat mind at moment be tormented grievously within there be something might do something might not do if must only make up mind honesty be best policy honesty be best policy repeated well known word to thousand time without however moving lip forming sound there sat thinking out trying to think out there sat still trembling still in agony for hour after hour at one time have fully resolved to do by must have proved to conviction that honesty be best policy then sat doubting again declaring to that honesty did not require to do meditated deed let find said to at last aloud let find be business not mine still sat looking up at row of book opposite to when be considerably after midnight got up from chair began to walk room a did so wiped brow continually a though be hot with exertion keeping eye still fixed upon book be urging pressing upon expression of honesty then at last rushed at one of shelf picking out volume of jeremy taylor work threw upon table be volume on old squire have be engaged when read last sermon be to prepare for flight to better world opened book there between leaf be last will testament uncle have executed at moment heard step in hall hand on door a did so with quick eager motion hid document under book be near two o'clock mr henry said butler what be doing up so late be only reading said heir be very late to be reading have better go to bed never liked people to be reading at contrairy hour liked folk to be bed use of dead man authority employed against by one who be so to say own servant struck even a absurd improper felt that must assert unless meant to sink lower lower in estimation of around will stay just a late a please said go away disturb more will ought to be obeyed not twenty four hour under ground said butler must have stayed up just a long a have pleased even have be here said cousin henry then man with murmur took departure closed door after for minute cousin henry sat perfectly motionless then got up very softly very silently tried door be closed be only door leading into room window be barred with shutter looked round satisfied that certainly other eye be there own then took document up from hiding place placed again exactly between leaf have before enclosed carefully restored book to place on shelf have not hidden will have not thus kept away from eye of concerned have opened no drawer have extracted nothing have concealed nothing have merely carried book from uncle table where have found in restoring to place on shelf have found paper contained so told now so have told thousand time be duty to produce evidence of gross injustice against who must doubt injustice who knew that have be summoned thither from london to take place at llanfeare a heir to property must not ill done against be much greater than must do be to leave paper there where have chanced to find in moment have seemed to that have sinned in matter till mr apjohn have asked whether uncle have told of new will then have lied uncle have told of intention before will be executed have told again when cantor have gone that thing be done old man have expressed thousand regret young one have remained impassive sullen crushed with feeling of injury done to still silent have not dared to remonstrate have found unable to complain of injustice there be in power be quite awake to strength of own position also to weakness must resolve to leave document enclosed within cover of book one must accuse of dishonesty have not placed there have not hidden have done nothing confusion occasioned by absence of will must have be due to carelessness of worn out old man who have reached time of life in be unfit to execute deed seemed to that justice honesty sense of right wrong must be best served by everlasting concealment of such document why must tell of hiding place let who wanted search for find if must be not doing much in cause of honesty in that did not destroy a must be so easy for if left there must not certainly be found though must remain week after week month after month even must remain year after year must not certainly be found at last brought out to prove llanfeare be not own of what use to must be property of what service how must contribute to happiness welfare knowing a must know that casual accident almost sure to happen sooner later might rob of for ever imagination be strong enough to depict misery to state of thing must produce how must quiver when stray visitor might enter room how terrified must be at chance assiduity of housemaid how must act if

to of servant other matter of kind there be also left to isabel sum of four thousand pound of mention have be made when lawyer have completed reading of document declared that to best of knowledge such money be in existence testator have doubt thought that legacy so made must be paid out of property whereas property must be made subject to such demand unless have by proper instrument to effect

must be madness to leave paper there then again there came to idea that must be best for for isabel too to divide property in one way be having become without fraudulent doing on part so declared to in way be hers though must not become hers without more than magnanimous interference on part to divide must certainly be best there be other way of dividing by marriage for other division such a separating land rent excuse must be made must such separation fatal paper lay between leaf of book be to consent to marry then thought might find courage to destroy paper be necessary that must see on afternoon if only that might bid adieu tell that must certainly have money have be left if be possible must say word also about other matter did not hear will read said to answered abruptly have be told content believe so about four thousand pound there need be question about four thousand pound there be not word to be said about at rate between have come to tell said not understanding feeling

landlord have taken upon place of heir then old man have announced to change of mind have not announced to others have not declared altered purpose to world at llanfeare have not at once sent back to london office have done so that must have be better there must have be gross injustice must have be end of must have gone back to london work unhappy indeed with possibility of life before now seemed a though mode of living must be impossible to while fatal paper remained hidden in fatal volume must hing sit there guard in solitude knew well enough that behoved a man to go out about estate neighbourhood to show to take part in life around even though might be miserable prey to terror whilst be doing so must not move from seat till mind have be made up a to future action be still in fearful doubt through whole of first day declared to that resolution have not yet be made that have not yet determined what must be best that must do be still open to to say that at moment have just found will if must bring to do so might rush off to carmarthen with document in pocket still appear before lawyer a man triumphant in own honesty who at first moment that be possible have surrendered be not legally own in spite of foul usage to have be subjected might still assume grand air of injured innocence give back property to young woman who have insulted return to desk in london leaving behind in carmarthenshire character for magnanimity honour line of conduct have charm in eye be quite alive to delight of heaping coal of fire on cousin head have declared that must receive nothing at hand because despised after that there must be sweetness savour of be not lost upon imagination in forcing to take from hand must become known to men that be who have found will who might have destroyed without slightest danger of discovery who without peril might thus have made owner of llanfeare there must be delight to in character must thus achieve then have scorned bitterer scorn have ever fallen from lip flashed from eye of woman take present from love not from despise have not resented word at moment have not dared to do so not le have entered upon very soul not le hated woman who have dared so to reply to generous offer have made then there be idea present to through that abstract justice if abstract justice must be reached must declare that property must be old man have made will with due paraphernalia of will making there have be lawyer witness brought by lawyer above there have be declared reason of will understood purpose have be sent for carmarthenshire have be made to understand why be to be so then in sickness old man have changed mind through fantastic feeling almost on death bed with failing power in condition probably altogether unfit for duty have executed document law might respect true justice if true justice must be invoked must certainly repudiate must will be abolished more than justice must be done though will be in own power must not be abolished by own hand a to that abolishing be perfectly conscious of own weakness must not take will from hiding place with own hand thrust into flame have never a yet even suggested to that must do so hair stood on end a thought of horror attendant on deed a to be made to stand in dock be gazed at by angry eye of court to be written of a noted criminal of day to hear verdict of guilty then sentence to be aware that be to be shut up secluded from comfort throughout life then then dread hereafter for deed a must there not be assured damnation although told that justice demanded destruction of will justice must not be achieved by own hand after such fashion a must not destroy document though must remain there for year to make life burden to a to that have made up mind if to nothing else though there might be no peril a to world though might certainly do deed without chance of detection from human eye though there must in truth be prospect of angry judge ready jury crushing sentence yet must not do there be something of conscience within be to commit felony from moment of doing of deed fear of eternal punishment must be heavy on soul only to be removed by confession retribution then by trial with judge jury sentence must not destroy document if book must get destroyed what blessing must be book be own must be in few day when will must have be properly proved if be to take away book sink in well throw into sea bury deep beneath earth then must surely reappear by one of ever recurring accident be always bringing deed of darkness to light be to cast book into sea tied with string cased in paper leaded that must surely sink so that will must not by untoward chance float out of book tied bound leaded must certainly come up in evidence against be to move book vacant space must lead to suspicion must be safe only by leaving book where be by giving trace that have ever be conscious of content of book yet if document be left there book must certainly divulge dread secret at last day must come might come ah so quickly on document must be found must be thrust out penniless a far a right to llanfeare be concerned maid servant might find religious inmate of house who might come there in search of godly teaching if must only bring to do something at once to declare that be there so that might avoid future misery why have told that despised why have old man treated with such unexampled cruelty so went on with for three four day during still kept place among book there must be great delight in possessing llanfeare if must in very truth posse must not live there certainly not that tenant about place have shown that be despised manner to before old squire death face a have sat there during ceremony of will fact that one have be near since reading of will have shown that have not dared to go to church during sunday though one have spoken to of daily life felt that tale be being told of be sure that mr griffith have whispered about place fact of constant residence in one room that who heard must begin to say among that practice so strange must be connected with missing will no must not willingly live at llanfeare if must let llanfeare be for song enjoy rent up in london how pleasant must be then have ever man sword of damocles to hang over head by single hair a must be then hanging over head be to let llanfeare even

must of course be necessary that must resign place go back to duty that squire of llanfeare must be clerk at sick healthy must be anomaly must really be in possession of rent sick healthy must of course see more of be to throw up position then to lose llanfeare how sad how terrible how cruel must be fate yet something must be done in circumstance wrote letter to manager detailing circumstance with near approach to truth keeping back only one little circumstance that be acquainted with whereabouts of missing will may turn up at moment explained to manager so that position a owner of property be altogether insecure feel so thoroughly that be forced at present to choose between two must keep clerkship in office a condition of thing be so extraordinary perhaps director will allow six month in to come to decision during may hold place without of course drawing salary surely thought must decide on something before six month must be over must have destroyed will have sunk book beneath wave have resolved to do magnanimous deed be still within power to achieve only one thing not possible must be for to leave llanfeare take up to delight of london while document be yet hidden within volume suppose sir know yet a to what plan be going to be be said by mr griffith a soon a made way into book room after somewhat imperious knocking at door hitherto there have be little communication between cousin henry servant since death of old squire mr griffith have given warning that must leave service have somewhat angrily told that might go a soon a pleased since that have come to once daily for order order have certainly be very simple have revelled in luxury of table cellar since key of house have be committed to charge have be told to provide with simple food with food have provided condition of mind have be such that appetite for glory of rich man table have yet come to that accursed book on opposite shelf have destroyed taste for wine meat what do want to know for asked well sir be customary for housekeeper to know something if there be mistress can only go to master always be very quiet here miss isabel used to tell something of what be expected expect anything said cousin henry be there anybody to come in place asked what can be to can go when please other servant want to go too sally wo stay yet mr bridgeman mr bridgeman be cook say like to live with gentleman who never go out of one room what be to what room live in suppose may live in what room please in own house said with affectation of anger feeling that be bound to be indignant at such inquiry from own servant with more of fear than wrath in mind so have in truth already begun to inquire why be that sat there watching book just so mr jones of course can live anywhere like in own house there be emphasis on last word be doubt intended to be impertinent one around be impertinent to so can sir not in own house can look for situation thought duty just to tell because must like to find alone here by like why be that everybody turn against asked suddenly almost bursting into tear at woman heart be little softened though did despise thoroughly know about turning mr jones have be used to such different way get enough to eat yes sir there be enough to eat doubt know a have interfered about not what a master might be victual what be mr griffith why do want to go away well be chiefly because of sitting here alone never moving never having hat on head sir of course gentleman can do a plea in own house there be nothing to make go out not even to see own tenant own farm nothing else be own master sir in course be mysterious there be nothing go against sort of people meaning servant inferior to herself like mystery then already felt that there be mystery oh what fool have be to shut up eat food there of course must know that mystery must have reference to will thus must so far have traced truth a to have learnt that will have mystery that mystery be located in room there be pleasant game requiring much sagacity in by few answer one be led closer closer to hidden word till one be enabled to touch a with word so be with secret must be careful that eye must once see that face be turned towards shelf at very moment shifted position so a not to look at shelf then thought that must have observed movement divined cause anyways begs to say respectful that wish to take month warning a for must go to inconvenience old master heir will stay till suit mr jones old place be to now what be very well mr griffith said cousin henry trying to fix eye upon open book in hand chapter x cousin henry dream dream from what have passed with mr griffith be clear to cousin henry that must go out of house be seen about place woman have be right in saying that seclusion be mysterious be peculiarly imperative upon to avoid appearance of mystery ought to have be aware of before ought to have thought of not to have required to be reminded by rebuke from housekeeper must now only amend fault for future endeavour to live down mystery have be created almost a soon a mr griffith have left prepared to move then bethought that must not seem to have obeyed quite at moment injunction of own servant so re seated resolved to postpone for day two intention of calling upon one of tenant re seated turned back to shelf lest aspect of countenance must be watched through window on following morning be relieved from immediate difficulty by arrival of letter from mr apjohn be necessary that declaration a to will must be made before certain functionary at carmarthen a paper necessary for occasion have be prepared in lawyer office be summoned into carmarthen for purpose immediately after that must be put into full possession of property mr apjohn also informed that deed have be prepared for charging estate with four thousand pound on behalf of cousin isabel by must bind to pay two hundred year for next two year at end of period to hand over to

in service for last twenty year so gave order directed that carriage must be ready soon after two in order that might keep appointment made by lawyer at three order be sent out to stable through butler a gave felt how unable be to assume natural tone of master to servant carriage sir said butler a though surprised then owner of llanfeare found compelled to explain to own man that be necessary that must see lawyer in carmarthen must must not take book with a went be large volume must not well be concealed in pocket might no doubt take book book with for own recreation in carriage be to do so special book have selected must be marked to eye of servant required little thought to tell that book must certainly be left in place must have taken will kept safe certainly unseen in pocket of coat then to take will from hiding place to have on person unless did so for purpose of instant public revelation must a thought be in felony there must be doing of deed in very act of abstracting document safety lay in abstaining from deed what if fit must come upon must fall hurt paper be found in possession then there must at once be intervention of police cell angry voice of crowd scowling of judge quick sentence that dwelling among thief felon for entire period of accursed life then must that great command thou shalt not steal be sounding always in ear then must self condemnation be heavy upon not to tell of document not to touch not to be responsible in way for position there on shelf be not to steal hitherto word felon have not come home to soul be to have in pocket unless with purpose of magnanimity of thought so often then must be felon soon after two left room at moment be unable not to turn rapid glance upon book there be safe in place how well knew appearance of volume on back near bottom be small speck spot on binding have be so far disfigured by accident in use seemed to eye to make marked separate among thousand to be almost wonderful that stain so peculiar must not at once betray volume to eye of there be such a be left amidst peril must pounce upon moment that have left room must not say that be guilty because contained will went to carmarthen there courage be subjected to terrible trial be called upon to declare before official to best of belief will be about to be proved be last will testament of indefer jones have be explained to by lawyer in letter might probably have abstained from so damning falsehood there must have be time then for resolution have mr apjohn told what be that be about to be called upon to perform even then before necessity of performance be presented to there must have be moment for consideration might have doubted have hesitated in presence of lawyer must have be made known be carried before official not knowing that lie be to be submitted to before must collect thought false declaration have be made understand mr jones said lawyer in presence of official that still think that further will may eventually be found understand croaked poor wretch be well that must bear in mind said mr apjohn severely for own sake mean there be nothing further spoken on subject be given to understand llanfeare be now in truth own own whatever chance there might be that must be wrested from hereafter then followed business a to charge upon property be to be made on behalf of isabel deed be prepared only required signature of new squire have refused to take penny from said squire hesitating with pen in hand let give due by declaring that much a hated cousin did not doubt a to bestowing money upon a far a be concerned be welcome to four thousand pound lawyer misinterpreted client manner must think mr jones said with still increased severity that must have felt that under peculiar circumstance be bound to restore to cousin money be expended by uncle under misconception in purchasing land will now be yours what can do if will not take not take be absurdity in matter of such importance a will of course be guided by father be not matter requiring gratitude on part money ought to be regarded a own will only be restoring to what be in truth own be quite willing have made difficulty mr apjohn understand why must speak to in way about a though have hesitated about money nevertheless lawyer maintained severe look there be still severe tone a poor wretch left office in there be so great aggravation of misery be only too manifest that one suspected of something here be ready to give away absolutely anxious to give away out of own pocket very large sum of money to cousin who have misused insulted by signing document without moment hesitation a soon a be presented to yet be rebuked for demeanour a did oh accursed will why have uncle summoned away from comparative comfort of old london life when returned to book room made sure that volume have not be moved there be slight variation in position of two neighbouring book centre one having be pushed quarter of inch further in have marked so accurately that must not know whether hand have be at shelf did not go near to shelf must see variation a stood at table eye have become minutely exact a to book position then resolved that must not look at book again must not turn glance on unless might be when have made up mind to reveal content neck became absolutely stiff with effort necessary not to look at book night wrote letter to cousin be a follows dear isabel have be into carmarthen to day have signed document in presence of mr apjohn by four thousand pound be made over to a charge upon property stated that have what might be called right to money perfectly agreed with have never doubted about money since uncle will be read agent who receives rent will remit to one hundred pound half yearly for next two year by time will have be able to raise money will then be paid in full want to take a favour from quite understood what said to think that be undeserved after have suffered in matter cruel on part be not fault that uncle changed mind backwards forward never asked for estate came to llanfeare only because bade have taken possession of property only when told to do so by mr apjohn if must not make pleasant to be not fault think ought to be ashamed of what said to so soon after old man death have nothing to do with money of course must take a for think will continue to live here uncle have made place nest of hornet for through fault of own must like to come live here a owner be welcome to do so on paying certain sum out of rent be quite in earnest have better think of yours truly henry jones resolution a to first portion of above letter be taken a returned in carriage from carmarthen be not until pen be in hand angry paragraph have be written in complained of cruelty that thought of making offer to a to residence idea flashed across mind then be carried out instantly let come live there let find will herself if pleased if mind be given to godly reading might be reward such conduct must at rate show that be afraid of nothing must thought if must be arranged still remain at office must give up empty title of squire of llanfeare live in such comfort a might come to from remittance must be made to on account of rent till that paper have be found such be last plan letter proposing be duly sent to post office on following day again acknowledged necessity of going about place so that feeling of mystery might if possible be gradually dissipated went out for walk roamed down towards cliff there sat in solitude looking out upon water mind be still intent upon book oh if book must be buried there below sea be drowned hand of be necessary for drowning a sat there feeling constrained to remain away from house for certain period fell asleep by degree dreamed dreamt that be out there in little boat alone with book hidden under seat that rowed out to sea till be so far distant from shore that eye must see then lifted book be about to rid for ever of burden when there came by strong man swimming man looked up at so a to see exactly what be doing book be not thrown over face of swimming man be face of young cantor who have be so determined in assertion that will have be made dream be still vivid a reality to intellect when be awakened suddenly whether by touch sound did not know looked up there be young man whom have seen swimming to across sea land be on be portion of old cantor farm presence of son need not have surprised have thought of be to a though comer have read thought of mind have understood clearly purport of dream be that squire said young man yes be said cousin henry a lay trembling on grass did know be here sir did know ever com 'd here good morning sir then young man passed on not caring to have further conversation with landlord so little to taste after returned home almost cowed on following morning determined to make still further effort so that might if possible return to way of world be already becoming strange to from desolation of life have be leading went out taking road by church up creek came at about distance of two mile from own house to coed farmstead of john griffith farmer who held largest number of acre on property at garden gate found tenant whom be inclined to think somewhat more civil little perhaps more courteous than others who have met yes sir said john griffith be fine day crop be doing well enough must like to come in see missus will take civil cousin henry entered house said few word to farmer wife who be not however specially gracious in demeanour have not gift of saying much to such person be aware of own deficiency still have done something have shown that be not afraid to enter tenant house a be leaving farmer followed to gate began to offer advice apparently in kindness ought to be doing something sir with paddock between shrubbery road suppose so mr griffith be farmer then let sir william griffith will be glad enough to have pay rent old squire did like that land have held must go into other hand never did much good with lately be different now yes be different now think will live here mr griffith not live at llanfeare think not be not quite fitted to place be doing among fear like a said tried to carry off with laugh 'd live down squire if did duty be good to people took more than be own perhaps like country life like being where ai liked be truth of mr griffith who will come in place if may be so bold a to ask miss brodrick will if will be not who asked uncle to bring here be not to have property not property at least suppose not will have house ground land adjacent will manage dividing rent with something of kind have offered to say that will agree in meantime if will come up see sometimes will take a kindness know have done harm so a to be shunned then farmer griffith readily said that must go up occasionally see landlord chapter xi isabel at hereford isabel have not be many hour at home at hereford before a be natural father discussed with affair of property own peculiar interest in will have at last be accepted have to be acknowledged that isabel be received somewhat a interloper in house be not wanted there at rate by stepmother hardly by brother sister be perhaps not cordially desired even by father stepmother have never be warm friend isabel be clever high minded high spirited also imperious sometimes hard may be said of that be at point gentlewoman so much must hardly be boasted of present mr brodrick a be mother so be that mother child father be gentleman born bred a such in second marriage have fallen little below station having done so have accommodated to position then there have come many child family have increased quicker than income so have come to pas that attorney be not wealthy man be home isabel have be invited to leave when now many year since have gone to llanfeare to become uncle darling there life have be very different from of family at hereford have seen little of society have be made much of almost worshipped by who be around be to be be to have be lady of llanfeare by tenant about place have be loved esteemed with servant have be supreme even at carmarthen when be seen there be regarded a great lady acknowledged heiress who be to have at not very distant time llanfeare in own hand be said of said truly that be possessed of many virtue be charitable careful for others in way indulgent sedulous in duty above thing affectionately attentive to uncle have become imperious inclined to domineer if not in action yet in spirit have lived much among book have delighted to sit gazing over sea with volume of poetry in hand truly enjoying intellectual gift have be given have perhaps learnt too thoroughly own superiority be somewhat apt to look down upon le refined pleasure of other people now altered position in regard to wealth rather increased than diminished foible now in abject poverty for be determined that must be abject must be forced to sustain superiority solely by personal gift determined must find compelled to live in father house must do duty thoroughly by stepmother sister must serve a far a might be within power must not giggle with girl must talk little gossip with mr brodrick while there be work to be done must do though must be hard menial revolting when work be done there must be book will be understood that such being mood such character must hardly make herself happy in father house make others happy then added to there be terrible question of money when last at hereford have told father that though uncle have revoked grand intention in favour still there must be coming to enough to prevent from being burden on resource of family now be changed if father must be unable unwilling to support must undergo hardship privation must certainly not accept bounty from hand of cousin deed have be done felt assured wicked deed cousin henry have be doer of alone have heard last word uncle have spoken have watched man face narrowly when uncle will have be discussed in presence of tenant be quite sure let father say what might let stepmother look at ever so angrily with greedy hungry eye must take shilling from cousin henry though might have to die in street must take bread from cousin henry hand began question of money on day after arrival papa said there be to be nothing for after now mr apjohn lawyer like cautious family solicitor a be have written to mr brodrick giving full account of whole affair telling of legacy of four thousand pound explaining that there be fund from payment must be legally exacted stating also that circumstance of case be of such nature a to make almost impossible that new heir must refuse to render liable for amount then have come letter saying that new heir have assented to do so oh yes there will isabel said father then felt that fighting of battle be incumbent upon be determined to fight papa no not shilling yes dear yes said smiling have heard from mr apjohn understood about money doubt be not there cousin be quite prepared to charge estate with amount indeed must be almost impossible for to refuse to do so one must speak to be to be so base a think much of cousin henry even cousin henry must not be so mean have not courage for such villainy have courage said what do mean oh papa be angry with nothing nothing will induce to take cousin henry money will be money money by uncle will be very sum have named a intended for yes papa uncle indefer have not got money to give neither must be angry with because intended best be angry with said attorney in wrath because deceived deceived about property never deceived one uncle indefer deceit never went together there be question of now said father made slight restitution there can of course be question a to taking there be question there must be question papa will not have if being here must be expense too great for will go away where will go care not where go will earn bread if can not do must rather live in poor house than accept cousin money what have done know a mr apjohn very well put there be question whatsoever a to gratitude even of acceptance be matter of course must be inexpressibly vile be not to do be inexpressibly vile not in respect be quite willing will have nothing to do to sign receipt once half year till whole sum will have be placed to credit will sign nothing on account will take anything why not what have done know say that have done anything care to speak of pray think papa covet estate that be unhappy about have be pleasant to uncle good to tenant have seemed even to be like man must have made heartily welcome to llanfeare think uncle be right in choosing to have male heir must have done so in place be wrong wickedly wrong after promise there be promise made to nothing suggestion be of course at liberty to alter if pleased need not however go back to papa there be owner of llanfeare from a owner of llanfeare will accept nothing be starving in street must not take crust of bread from finger over over again conversation be renewed always with same result then there be correspondence between two attorney mr apjohn undertook to ask permission from squire to pay money to father receipt without asking acknowledgement from daughter on hearing isabel declared that if be done must certainly leave father house must go out of even though must not know whither be going circumstance must not be made so to prevail upon a to force to eat meat purchased by cousin money thus came to pas isabel new home be not made comfortable to on first arrival stepmother must hardly speak to girl knew that be in disgrace there be mr owen willing enough a stepmother knew to take isabel away relieve from burden with l mr owen must doubt be able at once to provide home for mr owen must hardly do without help even though mr owen must be so generous thus justify name of softie mr brodrick must sometimes give in discussing character with own daughter how preferable must be to have relation well provided to mr brodrick girl objection be altogether unintelligible more of philistine cousin henry be more satisfaction must there be in fleecing to refuse legacy because be not formal be to thinking act of insanity to have payment of one refused to because of informality must have be heart breaking making of such difficulty a must not stomach must have have will must have be well pleased to whip girl therefore isabel new home be not pleasant to at time mr owen be away having gone for holiday to continent to brodricks be matter of course that must marry isabel a soon a came back there be doubt that be softie then how great be difference between having brother in law well off relation tightly constrained by closely limited mean to refuse even to make show of refusing good thing be crime against husband who be to have such be light in mr brodrick looked at to mr brodrick there be obstinacy in be sickening to to isabel thinking matter be very different be a firmly resolved that must not marry mr owen a must not take cousin money almost a firmly resolved then there came angry letter from cousin henry containing two point have to be considered there be offer to to come to llanfeare live there a though be owner indeed did not require much consideration be altogether out of question only dwelt in thought a showing how quickly man have contrived to make odious to one about place uncle said have made place nest of hornet to isabel declared that knew why place be nest of hornet there be one about llanfeare to whom so unmanly so cringing so dishonest creature must not be odious must understand then there be other point on mind rested long think ought to be ashamed of what said to so soon after old man death sat long in silence thinking of meditating whether have be true in whether did behove to repent harshness to man remembered well word take present from love not from despise have be hard word quite unjustifiable unless have made guilty of something worse than conduct be simply despicable not because have be poor creature not because have tormented old man last day by absence of generous feeling not because have be altogether unlike what to thinking squire of llanfeare must be have answered with crushing word be because at moment have believed to be something infinitely worse than grounding aversion on such evidence a have on such evidence a thought have have brought against heavy accusation must not tell to face that have stolen will must not accuse of felony have used such quick mode of expression a have come to for assuring that stood a low in esteem a felon might stand have done when be endeavouring to perform to that have be described to a duty now have turned upon rebuked rebuked her a be again endeavouring to perform same duty rebuked a be so natural that man must do who have be subjected to so gross affront hated despised in heart condemned still believed to have be guilty have not be guilty bead of perspiration must not have stood upon brow must not have become now red now pale by sudden start must not have quivered beneath gaze when looked into face must not have be utterly mean a be have not be guilty yet now saw with clear seeing intellect now that passion be in abeyance have not be entitled to accuse to face if be guilty be for others to find out for others to accuse have be for a lady a uncle niece to accept in uncle house a uncle heir duty must have compelled to love duty must have required to accept even friendship be aware that have misbehaved in insulting be ashamed of herself in have not be able to hide feeling within own high heart have allowed to suppose that have be angered because have be deprived of uncle wealth having so resolved wrote to a follows dear henry take further step about money a be quite determined not to accept hope will not be sent a there must only be trouble of repaying think that must do for to live at llanfeare a must have mean of supporting let alone servant thing be of course out of question tell ought to be ashamed of for certain word spoke to must not have be spoken be ashamed of now send apology yours truly isabel brodrick reader may perhaps understand that word be written by with extreme anguish of cousin henry understood nothing chapter xii mr owen in way isabel spent four very uncomfortable week in new home before mr owen returned to hereford be discomfort much relieved by prospect of return knew detail of circumstance told that man must be wrong to marry without other mean than at present possessed did think of herself that be well qualified to be wife of poor gentleman believed that must starve if be required of support suffering with fortitude believed that must work work from morning till night from week to week from month to month without complaining did not think that must make herself sweet a wife must be sweet to husband with threadbare coat that must be tender a mother must be tender while dividing limited bread among child to go die have done with if might be possible be panacea of present trouble most commonly present to mind therefore there be comfort to in promised coming of lover of girl chattered to continually have refused lover when held proud position of heiress of llanfeare refused doubt in obedience to uncle word not in accordance with own feeling still have refused afterwards when have believed that there must be sum of money coming to from uncle will there have be room for possible doubt must money have proved sufficient to cause to be relief rather than burden to husband might have be duty to marry seeing that loved with heart seeing that be sure of love there must have be much against even then because have refused when have be grand lady have money be forthcoming there might have be doubt now there must be doubt must who have denied hand because be uncle heiress on avowed ground alone must now that be pauper burden with presence doubt must be generous enough to renew offer be well aware of nobility too must be generous a thought noble thus be that spirit spoke within bidding subject sweet affection of heart to stubborn pride promised return therefore of mr owen did not make very happy will be here to morrow said stepmother to mr richards expects by late train to night looked in there yesterday told mr richards be respectable lady with whom mr owen lodged dare say will said isabel wearily sorry too mr going coming must have be investigated now isabel let advise can not be so unjust to mr owen a to make fancy for moment that will refuse uncle money think of position about two hundred fifty year in with two hundred added must be positive comfort without must be frightfully poor do think have not thought of suppose must then be so odd so hard so unlike other girl ever saw see how must have face to refuse money then to eat bread be unfortunate speech a coming from mr brodrick because fortified isabel in reply be bound to make stepmother have thought certain that marriage must take place in spite of such maiden denial a girl have made now denial have to be repeated with more than maiden vigour have thought of said isabel thought of very often till have told that conduct such a must be inexpressibly base what to eat bread after refusing mine when be believed to be so plentiful certainly have not face enough to do face courage for there be ignoble thing require audacity altogether beyond reach then must accept money from cousin certainly not said isabel that yet position mr owen will perhaps offer again of course will offer to then must be told that on consideration can offer be accepted be nonsense be dying for other then must die a for think that men young woman die for love now day if love other must do without other a people have to learn to do without most of thing that desire never heard of such nonsense such wickedness there be money why must not take can explain to mother said sternly being wont to give appellation very seldom to stepmother why must not take mr owen can not tell why can not take cousin money can only simply assure will not do so that most certainly will never marry man who must accept consider to be actual wickedness wickedness against own father have told papa know will not have money do mean to say that will come here into house a additional burden a weight upon poor father shoulder when have in power to relieve altogether do not know how pressed be that there be brother to be educated isabel a listened to sat silent looking upon ground stepmother went on understanding nothing of nature of mind of whom be addressing have reason to expect ample reason that must never cost shilling have be told hundred time that must be provided for by uncle do not know that be so do told so when be last here before uncle indefer death yet will hing to relieve will refuse money though be own when must be married to mr owen to morrow then paused waiting to find what might be effect of eloquence acknowledge papa right yours to press to marry man suppose acknowledge right to be a good a word here be money have only got to take mean be that ought to acknowledge obligation to be a good a word do told father must not be burden to be bound to keep to will have understood at present moment be breaking promise through mistake of uncle indefer must not have anticipated be breaking promise because will not accept money be own be breaking promise be sufficient will go out of house will cease to be burden if only knew where must go must begin to morrow be nonsense said mr brodrick getting up bursting out of room in anger there be man ready to marry there be money anybody can see with eye what be duty isabel with eye that have must not see what be duty that must not be duty to take present of money from man whom believed to be robbing of estate felt quite sure must not be duty to bring poverty on man whom loved especially not a have refused to confer wealth upon be thought clearly duty not to be burden upon father a have told that such burden must fall upon be duty thought to earn own bread else to eat none at in present frame of mind must have gone out of house on moment if one must have accepted even a kitchenmaid there be one to accept have questioned father on matter have ridiculed idea of earning bread when have spoken of service have become angry with be not thus that must be relieved did not want to see girl maid servant even governess be not thus that must relieve simply wanted to drive into view so that might accept comfortable income be at disposal become wife of gentleman whom one esteemed in present frame of mind cared little for disgrace might bring on others by menial service be told that be burden desired to cease to be burdensome thinking over night resolved that must consult mr owen must thought be easy if not easy at rate feasible to make understand that there must be marriage with must be on own ground at least have authority over knew well enough to be confident of own strength father have certain right to insist even stepmother have deputed right lover have none must be made to understand that must not marry then must advise a to project of being governess housemaid schoolmistress what not on following morning came be soon closeted with when arrived isabel be sitting with mr brodrick sister soon packed up hemmings sewing took off showing that be understood thing isabel mr owen be to be left together door be sooner closed than came up to a though to embrace a though to put arm round waist before have moment to retreat preparing to kiss a though be already own saw in moment be a though since last remembered interview there have be other meeting have forgotten meeting at have consented to be wife must not be angry with how can girl be angry with man whose love be so good so true must not have dreamed of kissing have stood there before declared heiress of llanfeare felt more than be sure by manner that knew that have determined not to take cousin money be altogether unaware that there have already be talking that morning between father be sure that knew how must be angry with escaped not that said must not be so mr owen must not can not be so tell one thing isabel before go further tell truly do love be standing about six foot from looked hard into face determined not to blush before eye for moment must hardly make up mind a to what must be fitting answer to demand know said that be too proud to tell falsehood will not tell falsehood do love there be still pause do love a woman must love man mean to marry do love then in god name why must not kiss be love be yours father mother be satisfied that must be so seeing that be so be disgrace to kiss having won heart may not have delight of thinking that must wish to be near must know said though may be unwomanly to tell so much know what there have never be man whose touch have be pleasant to must revel in kiss must kiss foot at moment embrace knee everything belonging to be dear to thing have touched have be made sacred to prayer book tell young wife that must love husband till death will part think love will go further than isabel isabel keep away from will not even give hand to shake till have promised to be of one mind with will not become wife will become wife never never have thought out know be right thing have be hard with not to will not have be hard to when will have carried point with be forced to appear before eye a heiress of uncle have that made difference with be forced to refuse in obedience to who have adopted understand very completely then made new will left money of know think particular money be not there at nodded head a though smiling at absurdity in going back over circumstance be so well understood by of money be offered to by cousin will not take a to have nothing to say be one point on when be married will decline to give advice mr owen now came close to still ready to spring back must be necessary mr owen will tell have told one else why because trust a trust one else then tell there be will there be will rather have destroyed why do say that must not say that can not know therefore say only to a must to own heart old man told so in last moment then there be look of man if must have seen how craven spirit cowered beneath eye one must not judge by such indication one can not see notice one must not judge must have judged have seen must not have helped judging nothing however can come of except not for world must take money may be right isabel that must be discussed between right if wish will be delight to think that there will be secret between believe dearest can have reference to question between not must be absolutely penniless not in least will mr owen in even father agrees with in be doubt wrong father have simply impressed upon necessity of taking money because of lover need will not be burden at rate to a can not go to without being burden will not go at what doe matter whether there be little more suffering little le what doe matter matter great deal to man get over quickly think so doe woman if be proper sort of woman for getting over difficulty of kind think be will try wo said looking full into face philosophy teach to despise grape hang too high to make most of come within reach now look upon a being within reach be not within reach yes pardon for confidence be have confessed that love do then will not be so wicked a to deny to that have right to demand if love a woman must love man who be to become husband have right to refuse have made good claim unless there be other reason there be reason none such a have to judge of have father objected must have be reason when uncle disapproved because of property be reason a to money will never ask to take unless can plead that be afraid of poverty then paused looking at a though defied to say so much on own behalf must not say that sat there panting frightened by energy be continued very gently least in world think of will find that be right then when next come then perhaps will not refuse to kiss so went oh how loved how sweet must be to submit pride independence maiden reticence to such man a how worthy be of worship of confidence of service how definitely better be than other being that have ever crossed path yet be quite sure that must not marry chapter xiii carmarthen herald there be great deal said at carmarthen about old squire will such scene a have taken place in house first when will be produced then when search be made afterwards when will be read pas without comment there have be many present of have be much moved by circumstance feeling that squire have executed will subsequent to have now be proved be very strong idea suggested by mr apjohn that squire have in weakness of latter moment destroyed document be not generally accepted have done so something of must have be known ash of paper tattered fragment must have be seen whether mr apjohn did did not believe that have be so others must not think among tenant servant at llanfeare there be general feeling that something wrong have be done who be most inclined to be charitable in judgment such a john griffith of coed thought that document be still hidden that might not improbably be brought to light at last others be convinced that have fallen into hand of present possessor of property that have be feloniously successfully destroyed guess at real truth be made by one how must man have guessed that false heir must have sat there with will a be before eye close at hand have destroyed revealed existence among who believed worst a to cousin henry be two cantor when man have seen thing done be prone to believe in more so when have have hand in doing have be selected for important operation of witnessing will did not in least doubt that will have be in existence when old squire died might have be destroyed since believed that have be destroyed must not be brought to understand so great injustice must be allowed to remain on face of earth without remedy without punishment must not be enough for judge to know that two respectable men have witnessed new will that new will have certainly be in opposition to one have be so fraudulently proved younger cantor especially be loud upon subject got many ear in carmarthen to listen to carmarthen herald newspaper bearing high character through south wale took matter up very strongly so that became question whether new squire must not be driven to defend by action for libel be not that writer declared that cousin henry have destroyed will that published minute account of have be done at llanfeare putting forward in paper a came out reason existed for supposing that wrong have be done theory old indefer jones have destroyed last will without saying word of purpose to one be torn to tatter doctor have be with from day to day must almost certainly have known have such intention be in mind housekeeper must have known nephew professed heir have said not word to one of have passed between uncle must who have known old indefer jones for so many year be aware that have be governed by highest sense of honour through entire life must bring to believe that must have altered will made in nephew favour then realtered going back to intention in nephew favour without saying word to nephew on subject henry jones have be silent a to occurred during last week henry jones have not only be silent when will be being read when search be being made have sat there still in continued silence say continued writer in paper henry jones since became owner of llanfeare have be afraid to mingle with brother men have right to say so consider to be duty to declare such have be fact circumstance will from time to time occur in becomes necessary on public ground to inquire into privacy of individual think that circumstance now a to property be of nature a will be case in such matter expression became gradually stronger till be conceived to be object of concerned in making to drive henry jones to seek for legal redress so that might be subjected to cross examination a to transaction word of last fortnight before uncle death be opinion of many that if must be forced into witness box must be made to confess if there be anything to confess cowardice of man became known be rather exaggerated in mind of around be told of how lived in one room how rarely left house how totally be without occupation more than truth be repeated a to habit till carmarthenshire believed that be so trammelled by mysterious consciousness of crime a to be unable to perform of duty of life when men spoke to trembled when men looked at turned away habit be inquired into be said of that carmarthen herald be only paper that saw declared of that spent hour after hour in spelling terrible accusation if not absolutely made against be insinuated became clear to lawyer to mr apjohn that man if honest must on behalf of old family long respected name vindicate by prosecuting owner of paper for libel if be honest in matter altogether honest there must be reason why must fear to encounter hostile lawyer there be at last two letter from young joseph cantor printed in paper be undoubtedly libellous letter young cantor certainly must not have written letter carmarthen knew to have be written by one connected with newspaper though signed by young farmer in be positively declared that old squire have left later will behind when be discussed whether must get verdict be clearly shown that getting of verdict must not be main object of prosecution have to show said mr apjohn that be not afraid to face court of justice be afraid when last parted with after visit to coed have not seen beginning of attack on next day first paper reached who be concerned in did not spare to send copy a be issued having read first be not able to refuse to read what followed in issue be carried on a be told of in carmarthen lingered over agonizing detail of venom be entering into soul be in vain that tried to hide paper to pretend to be indifferent to coming mr griffith knew very well where paper be knew also that word have be perused month notice have be accepted from butler in lieu of three month first offered have now expired man have gone remained a did two other woman nothing be said a to cause of remaining remained a for cousin henry be too weak too frightened too completely absorbed by horror of situation to ask why stayed to have asked why went understood word be written of with sharp minute intelligence though spirit be cowed mind be still alive to danger of position thing be being said of charge be insinuated declared to to be false have not destroyed will have not even hidden have only put book into own place carrying out a did so innocent intention when have first lifted book when searcher have come doing work so idly with such incurious futility have not concealed book have left there on shelf beneath hand who must say that have be guilty if will be found now who must reasonably suggest that there have be guilt on part if be known except chance glance of eye never must be known one must say that be other than innocent yet knew of that must lack strength to stand up in court endure sharp question angry glance of keen lawyer very knee must fail to carry through court word must stick in jaw must shake shiver faint before assembled eye must be easier for to throw from rock on have lain dreaming into sea than to go into court of law there tell own story a to will must not force to go thought must perceive a much a that action if action there be to be must originate with there be evidence on must bring charge of felony even of fraud against must not drag into court knew that world must say that if be honest man must appear there denounce defamer vindicate own name a day by day failed to do so must be declaring own guilt yet knew that must not do be there no escape be quite sure now that price at held property be infinitely above value value have value in eye be simply curse of must rid with utmost alacrity if only must rid of have befallen in achieving how must escape be now to disclose document carry into carmarthen prepared to deliver up property to cousin be there one who must not think that have be in possession from before uncle death that have now be driven by fear to surrender be there one who must not believe that have hidden with own hand how now must personate that magnanimity must have be so easy have brought forth book handed with enclosure to mr apjohn when lawyer came to read will looked back with dismay at folly at having missed opportunity so glorious now there seemed to be escape though left room daily one found will be welcome to find if must did not that base newspaper lied of a told bitterly a read in saying that did not leave room daily did roam about place for hour two speaking indeed to one looking at one there newspaper have be true enough that charge against of self imprisonment have be false a far a referred to day subsequent to rebuke housekeeper have given one laid hand upon book almost believed that be paper left open on table eye must examine content there lay still hidden within fold of sermon weight upon heart incubus on bosom that nightmare robbed of slumber must not rid of presence property indeed oh if be only back in london cousin reigning at llanfeare john griffith from coed have promised to call upon when three week have passed by have not a yet made appearance now on one morning came found landlord alone in book room be kind of mr griffith said cousin henry struggling hard to assume manner of man with light heart have come mr jones said farmer very seriously to say few word think ought to be said what be mr griffith now mr jones be not man a be given to interfering especially not with better be sure be not above not with own landlord then paused a cousin henry must not find appropriate word for rebuke encouragement be driven to go on with story have be obliged to look at thing in carmarthen herald then cousin henry turned deadly pale have be driven to look at have taken paper twenty year be sent now to tenant on estate whether pay whether mr griffith there in kitchen have suppose sent to sir yes doe come said cousin henry with faintest attempt at smile have read what say yes most of have be very hard sir at cousin henry must only affect ghastly smile very hard continued farmer have made flesh creep a read do know what mean mr jones suppose know mean that have stolen estate from cousin miss brodrick man said very solemnly bringing out single word by be not saying so mr jones gasped miserable wretch indeed if thought so must not be here to tell thought be because believe that be injured that be here be injured be injured think so believe so can not tell what mystery be if mystery there be believe that have robbed that young lady own cousin by destroying deed a uncle will no be there secret that can tell awed appalled stricken with utter dismay cousin henry sat silent before questioner if there be sir have not better confide to one uncle knew well for more than forty year trusted thoroughly must fain if must do something for nephew if there be anything to tell tell like man still cousin henry sat silent be unable to summon courage at instant sufficient to deny existence of secret must resolve to take down book show document doubted when appearance of doubt be in evidence of guilt in eye of man who be watching oh mr griffith exclaimed after while will be friend will indeed mr jones if can honestly have be cruelly used have be hard to bear said mr griffith terrible terrible cruel cruel then again paused trying to make up mind endeavouring to see by what mean must escape from hell upon earth if there be mean might perhaps achieve by aid of man man sat silent watching way of escape did not appear to there be mystery gasped at last none said farmer severely mystery what mystery must there be there be will have destroyed nothing have hidden nothing have done nothing because old man changed mind so often be to be blamed then mr jones why do not say in court of law on oath how can do go to mr apjohn speak to like man bid bring action in name for libel against newspaper then there will be inquiry then will be put into witness box be able to tell own story on oath cousin henry groaning pale affrighted murmured out something signifying that must think of then mr griffith left farmer when entered room have believed landlord to be innocent belief have vanished when took leave chapter xiv action for libel when man have asked question be there secret can tell cousin henry did for half minute make up mind to tell whole story reveal everything a have occurred then remembered lie have told lie to have signed name when have be called upon to prove will in carmarthen have not by unconsidered act of moment committed crime for must be prosecuted sent to gaol have not be perjury from very beginning have determined that must support possession of property by criminal deed have not hidden will in book have not interfered in search have done nothing incompatible with innocence so have be with till have be called upon without moment having be allowed to for thinking to sign name to declaration remembrance of came to a almost made up mind to rise from seat pull book down from shelf then thought occurred to must not tell mr griffith that have discovered document since have made that declaration that have discovered only on morning have felt that story such a must receive belief have feared to estrange only friend by palpable lie have therefore said that there be secret have said so after pause have assured mr griffith of existence of mystery have said so with face of have declared truth when farmer left knew well enough that man doubted nay that man be assured of guilt have come to be so with whom have encountered since have first reached llanfeare uncle who have sent for have turned from cousin have scorned tenant have refused to accept when there certainly have be no cause for rejection mr apjohn from first have looked at with accusing eye servant be spy upon action newspaper be rending very vitals now one last friend have deserted thought that if only must summon courage for deed must be best for to throw from rock there be such courage in one idea remaining to be to save from horror of criminal prosecution if did not touch document give sign of consciousness of presence must not prove that have known of whereabouts if must only find let go did not find must not put on trace a to wicked libel mr griffith have asked why did not have recourse to court of law refute by courage of presence understood proposition in force why did not show able to bear question ingenuity of lawyer must put to simply because be unable to bear truth must be extracted from in process though must have fortified with strongest resolve must be unable to hide guilty knowledge knew that of must be sure to give testimony against on strength of must be dragged from witness box to dock declared to that let newspaper say what must must not of own motion throw among lion teeth be prepared for in so resolving did not know what further external force might be applied to when old tenant have sternly told that must go like man into witness box tell own story on oath have be hard to bear there came worse than power more difficult to resist on following morning mr apjohn arrived at llanfeare having driven over from carmarthen be at once shown into book room lawyer be man who by friend by client in general be considered to be pleasant fellow a well a cautious man of business be good at dinner table serviceable with gun always happy on horseback must catch fish be known to be partial to rubber at whist certainly be not regarded a hard cruel man cousin henry in looking at have always seen sternness in eye curve of frown upon brow have be uncomfortable to from beginning of intercourse have be afraid of lawyer have felt that be looked into scrutinised found to be wanting mr apjohn have of course be on isabel side carmarthenshire knew that have done best to induce old squire to maintain isabel a heiress cousin henry be well aware of still why have attorney always looked at with accusing eye when have signed that declaration at carmarthen attorney have shown by face that believed declaration to be false now man be there there be nothing for to endure question mr jones said lawyer have thought duty to call upon in respect to article in carmarthen herald can not help what carmarthen herald may say can mr jones be just there be law enable man to stop libel to punish if be worth while to do so paused moment cousin henry be silent continued for many year be uncle lawyer a be father before have never be commissioned by to regard a lawyer a circumstance be at present be obliged to occupy place until put business into other hand in position feel to be duty to call upon in reference to article doubt be libellous be very cruel know said cousin henry whining such accusation be cruel if be false be false damnably false take that for granted therefore have come to to tell that be duty to repudiate with strength of own word terrible charge be brought against must go be witness about yes be exactly that must go be witness about who else can tell truth a to matter in question a well a must understand mr jones that must not take step with view of punishing newspaper why then in order that may show willing to place there to be questioned 'here be ' must say 'if there be point in wish to be examined a to property will here be to answer ' be that may show that be not afraid of investigation be exactly of cousin henry be afraid can not be aware of what be going on in carmarthen know about newspaper be duty not to blink matter one not only in town throughout country be expressing opinion right have not be done what do want can not help if uncle did not make will according to liking think that did make will according to liking that there have be foul play do accuse practically do article in paper be only echo of public voice voice be becoming stronger stronger day because take step to silence have seen yesterday paper yes saw said cousin henry gasping for breath then mr apjohn brought copy of newspaper out of pocket began to read list of question editor be supposed to ask public generally question be insult cousin henry have dared must have bade reader desist have turned out of room for insolence in reading have mr henry jones expressed opinion of own a to what became of will messrs cantor witnessed have mr henry jones consulted friend legal otherwise a to tenure of llanfeare estate have mr henry jones friend to whom can speak in carmarthenshire have mr henry jones inquired into cause of own isolation have mr henry jones idea why persecute in fresh issue of newspaper have mr henry jones thought of what may possibly be end of have mr henry jones thought of prosecuting for libel have mr henry jones heard of other case in heir have be made so little welcome to property so question went on almost endless list lawyer read one after in low plain voice slowly with clear accentuation so that point intended by questioner might be understood such martyrdom surely man be ever doomed to bear before in line be described a thief yet bore when lawyer came to end of abominable question sat silent trying to smile what be to say do mean to put up with asked mr apjohn with curve of eyebrow of cousin henry be so much afraid what be to do do do anything rather than sit in silence bear such injurious insult a be there nothing else to do must tear man tongue from mouth at least pen from grasp how be to find never did do anything of rough kind be not necessary only say what man must do if there be nothing else to be done step to be taken be easy instruct to go before magistrate at carmarthen indict paper for libel be what must do there be imperiousness in lawyer tone be almost irresistible nevertheless cousin henry made faint effort at resisting must be dragged into lawsuit lawsuit of course must what lawsuit must not be preferable to that must do a bid must consent to have said have thought by country that have be guilty of felony have filched cousin property have committed nothing said poor wretch a tear ran down face then go say so before world said attorney dashing fist down violently upon table go say so let men hear instead of sitting here whining like woman like woman what honest woman must ever bear such insult if will convince world will convince neighbour have that have done something to make away with will in case will not leave stone unturned to discover truth editor of paper be laying open purposely to action in order that may force to undergo cross questioning of barrister everybody who hears of say that be right can prove that be wrong only by accepting challenge if refuse challenge a put to now will acknowledge that have done deed of darkness be there torment ever so cruel ever so unjustifiable a be asked to put by own act into thumbscrew on rack in order that executioner might twist limb tear out vitals be to walk into court of own accord that might be torn by practised skill of professional tormentor that might be forced to give up very secret of soul in impotence else to live amidst obloquy of men asked whether have deserved in moment of time assured that have not deserved such punishment a if not altogether innocent if not white a snow have done nothing worthy of such cruel usage well said mr apjohn a though demanding final answer to proposition will think of gasped cousin henry there must be no more thinking time have gone by for thinking if will give instruction to commence proceeding against carmarthen herald will act

paused for full minute looking client full in face be a though be carrying on cross examination must ask whether have such knowledge then again paused cousin henry said nothing if have such knowledge

tell with clear voice a far a be aware property be own by a fair title a in country in word of there have be condemnation be a though mr apjohn be devoting to infernal torture telling that only escape must be by exercise of herculean power be notoriously beyond reach be evident to that mr apjohn have come there under guise of advisor friend be in fact leagued with others around to drive to ruin of that felt quite sure voice eye face gesture of unwelcome visitor have told that be so yet must not rise in indignation expel visitor from house there be cruelty inhumanity in to thinking be infinitely

guilt why did not find have done with feeling at last how incapable be of collecting thought while sat there in book room aware at same time that must determine on course of action took hat strolled out towards cliff there be month remaining to just month before day named on be to put into witness box at rate must be avoided did after fashion resolve let result be what might must not submit to cross examination must not drag from bed be to say that be ill must not send policeman to find be to hide in london unless gave evidence against a to own guilty knowledge must bring open charge against if must summon courage to throw from off rock then at rate must escape from hand what be about asked a sat way down cliff looking out over sea what be about if wanted property for cousin isabel be welcome to take desired nothing to be allowed to get away from accursed country to escape never more to be heard of there to hear of must not give up property with signing of sufficient deed thus put end to cruel clamour must do without signing by simple act of honesty by taking down book with will giving at once to lawyer be possible possible a far a knowledge of one be concerned that thing might be done not only with honesty with high minded magnanimity how must be if in truth document be first found by on very day have be so be so then conduct must be honest be still open to to simulate that be so have taken down book let say for spiritual comfort in great trouble lo will have be found there between leaf one must believe declared to that such be already character in county

fiercer eye whether believed not must let go must be told of at rate that having will in hand have not destroyed up in london where men must not know detail of last miserable month good must be spoken of then there must be time left to to relieve conscience by repentance to whom must deliver up will how must frame word be conscious of own impotence in deceit for purpose mr apjohn doubt must be proper person there be one of whom stood so much in dread a of mr apjohn be to carry book paper to lawyer attempt to tell story real truth must be drawn out from in first minute of interview man eye looking at man brow bent against must extract from instantly one truth be purpose to hold within own keeping must find thankfulness no mercy not even justice in lawyer lawyer must accept restitution must crush afterwards must not be better to go off to hereford without saying word to one in carmarthenshire give up deed to cousin isabel then have scorned have treated with foul contempt a feared mr apjohn so did hate cousin isabel only approach to manliness left in bosom be true hatred of cousin single voice have be kind to since have come to horrid place have be that of old farmer griffith even voice have be stern at last yet with sternness there have be something of compassion thought that must tell tale to mr griffith if to one so thinking resolved at once to go to coed there be still before that other mean of escape rock sea afforded a have made way on morning to spot on be now lying that idea be still present to did not think that must do deed of such daring be almost sure of that power of doing must be utterly wanting when moment came still be present to mind courage might reach at instant be sudden impulse to carry away thought lord must surely forgive because of suffering now a looked at spot saw that must not reach placid deep water considered again remembered that lord must not forgive sin a to there must be moment for repentance a must not escape in way must carry out purpose with farmer griffith so be here again prowling about on father land cousin henry knew at once voice of bitter enemy of young cantor wretched a be felt also something of spirit of landlord in being thus rebuked for trespassing on ground suppose have right to walk about on own estate said know nothing about own estate replied farmer son say nothin ' about that do be talking about say nothin have own opinion say nothin others do be saying great deal a suppose hear mr jones say nothin how dare be so impudent to landlord know nothin ' about landlord know father have lease of land pay rent whether get have more right be belief to intrude here other stranger so if please will walk will stay here just a long a suit said cousin henry oh very well then father will have action against for trespass so will be brought into court of law be bound to go off when be warned ai no right here because call landlord come up here will thrash be what will must dare show before magistrate be what must young man stood there for while waiting then walked off with loud laugh one might insult one might beat must seek for redress because must not dare to submit to ordeal of witness box around knew that be so be beyond protection of law because of misery of position be clear that must do something a must not drown there be nothing better than telling of tale to mr griffith must go to mr griffith at once have not book document with perhaps must tell tale better without immediate presence at coed found farmer in own farmyard have come to in great trouble said cousin henry beginning story well squire what be then farmer seated on low movable bar protected entrance into open barn cousin henry sat beside that young man cantor insulted grossly just now must have done come of must have done that be always forward young puppy do think have be treated very badly among a to mr jones opinion doe run very high about squire will explained to when be with yesterday something have occurred since something be coming on purpose to tell have occurred cousin henry groaned terribly a moment for revelation came upon felt that have made moment altogether unfit for revelation by ill judged observation a to young cantor must have rushed at story at once oh mr griffith have found will must have be told after fashion felt now felt that have allowed opportunity to slip by what be have occurred mr jones since be up at llanfeare yesterday think must tell here where then not yet to day that young man cantor have so put out hardly know what be saying must speak out sir if be just something to be said be something to be shown too replied cousin henry if must mind coming up to house to morrow next day then must explain to morrow will be said farmer on day after will be in carmarthen to market if eleven o'clock to morrow morning wo be too early will be there sir one three five o'clock must have be better day following better still so that evil hour might have be postponed cousin henry assented to proposition took departure now have committed to revelation revelation must be made felt acutely folly of own conduct during last quarter of hour if might have be possible to make old man believe that document have only be that morning found such belief must only have be achieved by impulsive telling of story be aware that at step took created fresh difficulty by own folly want of foresight how must now act sudden emotion of man startled by surprise nevertheless must go on with scheme there be now nothing before still might be able to achieve that purpose have in view of escaping from llanfeare carmarthenshire sat up late that night thinking of for many day past have not touched volume allowed eye to rest upon document have declared to that might remain there be taken away a might chance to others must no longer be anything to for aught that knew might already have be removed such have be resolution during last fortnight in accordance with have acted now purpose be again changed now intended to reveal will with own hand might be well that must see that be there took down book there be opened out carefully read through word of complicated detail for have be arranged drawn out in lawyer office with legal want of punctuation unintelligible phraseology have be copied verbatim by old squire be doubt properly binding effective will never before have dwelt over so tediously have feared lest finger mark blot spark might betray acquaintance with deed now be about to give up let world know that have be in hand felt therefore that be entitled to read that there be longer ground to fear accident though woman in house must see reading what matter thrice read sitting there late into night thrice read deed have be prepared with such devilish industry to rob of estate have be promised if have be wicked to conceal not to conceal only to be silent a to whereabouts how much greater have be sin of dying old man who have taken so much trouble in robbing now that time have come almost hour in have lately so truly loathed there came again upon love of money feeling of privilege attached to a owner of broad acre sudden remembrance that with little courage with little perseverance with little power of endurance might live down evil of present day when thought of what might be to be squire of llanfeare in perhaps five year time with rent in pocket became angry at own feebleness let ask what question must there must be evidence against if be to burn will there must certainly be evidence against if will be still hidden might perhaps extract that secret from lawyer must be strong enough to make own that have paper between bar of fire sat looking at gnashing teeth together clenching fist if only dared to do if only must do did during moment make up mind have sooner done so than there rose clearly before mind eye judge jury paraphernalia of court long horror of prison life even now prying woman might have eye turned upon what be doing must there be woman prying trial conviction still there must be damning guilt on own soul guilt must admit of repentance except by giving up to hand of law sooner have resolved to destroy will than be unable to destroy sooner have felt inability than again longed to do deed when at three o'clock dragged up wearily to bed will be again within sermon book be at rest upon old ground punctually at eleven mr griffith be with be evident from manner that have thought matter over be determined to be kind gracious now squire said let hear do hope may be something may make mind quiet at last have have fear bad time of since old squire died indeed have mr griffith what be now whatever be may be sure of will take charitable like wo take nothing amiss if so be can help will cousin henry a door have be opened a man footstep have be heard have made up mind that on occasion must not reveal secret have disabled by unfortunate manner of yesterday must not even turn eye upon book sat looking into empty grate what be mr jones asked farmer uncle did make will said cousin henry feebly of course made will made many one two more than be wise be thinking made will after last one after in favour yes after know that did by what saw doing so thought 'd tell be that thought 'd let know be sure of became of after be made that know be quite question do think must be in house if so search ought to be made if believe there be such will why come search more regularly must hinder be that have got to say a have be thinking about so much a be so kind to thought have better tell there be something be to show oh yes did say so if will come upstairs will point out very spot where old man sat when be writing there be nothing more than that nothing more than mr griffith then good morning mr jones be afraid have not got to end of matter yet chapter xvi again at hereford of people at carmarthen be taking great deal of trouble about matter one copy of herald be sent regularly to mr brodrick to isabel to mr owen be determined that must not be kept in ignorance of what be being done in first number issued after mr apjohn last visit to llanfeare there be short leading article recapitulating be hitherto known of story mr henry jones said article in last paragraph have at length be induced to threaten action for libel against newspaper doubt much whether will have courage to go on with if doe will have to put into witness box then probably may learn something of truth a to last will testament made by mr indefer jones reached hereford be of course deeply considered there by person whom concerned mr owen for day after scene have be described between isabel saw frequently generally found mean to be alone with for moment made effort to avoid must fain have be allowed to treat simply a dearest friend in moment treated a though be engaged to be wife there be embracing kiss isabel must not permit in term of affectionate expression spoke of to a though be own must only gently laugh at when assured that must never be so of course can torment little said smiling force arrayed against be too strong have not chance on side must be monstrous to suppose that must go on making miserable for ever too in answer to must only say that cared little for own misery did not believe in question be said whether be fitting a feel that be not fitting certainly will not do in answer to must again smile tell that month two at furthest must see absolutely conquered then newspaper reached when became clear to that there existed in carmarthenshire so strong doubt a to validity of will under property be at present held then mr owen visit to house became rarer different in nature then be willing to be simply friend of family a such sought especial interview with isabel between isabel word be spoken a to content of newspaper between mr brodrick clergyman many word be spoken mr brodrick declared at once to intended son in law belief in accusation be implied be implied at first afterwards made in term so frightfully clear when such word a be said printed there must urged be no doubt a to what be believed in carmarthen why must be believed without ground that man have done so hideous deed a to destroy will lawyer hair stood almost on end a spoke of atrocity yet believed must respectable newspaper such a carmarthen herald commit to course without strongest assurance what be to carmarthen herald did not very continuance of article make clear that reader of paper be in accordance with writer must public of carmarthen sympathise in such attack without strongest ground attorney fully believed in cousin henry guilt be not on account sanguine a to proof if during sojourn at llanfeare immediately before old squire death after before funeral have be enabled to lay hand upon will destroy hope must there be of evidence of such guilt a to idea of forcing man to tell tale against by torment of cross examination did not believe at man who have be strong enough to destroy will must be too strong for perhaps thought that man must be too strong not having known cousin henry among possible chance occurred to mind mind at time be greatly filled with such consideration nothing like truth suggested to heart be tormented by idea that property have be stolen from child that glory of being father in law to llanfeare have be filched from that hope for redress remained sympathised altogether with newspaper felt grateful to newspaper declared editor to be man specially noble brave in calling did not believe that newspaper must do good to to isabel mr owen doubted altogether righteousness of proceeding a regarded newspaper a far a must see there be evidence against cousin henry there seemed to to be injustice in accusing man of great crime simply because crime might have be possible must if committed have be beneficial to criminal plan of frightening man into self accusation by terror of cross examination be distasteful to must not sympathise with newspaper still found compelled to retreat from affectation of certainty in regard to isabel have assumed when knew only that will have be proved that cousin henry be in possession of property have regarded isabel property a altogether separated from other now learned that such be not general opinion in carmarthenshire be not desire to push forward suit with heiress of llanfeare have be rejected on what have acknowledged to be fitting ground while have be position when matter have be altogether settled in cousin henry favour then must come forward again isabel be quite sure that newspaper be right did not remember dying word with uncle have told that have again made heir have not always clearly in mind hang dog look of wretched man be strong minded yet woman with woman propensity to follow feeling rather than fact reason lover have told that uncle have be very feeble when word have be spoken with mind probably vague thought wandering have perhaps be dream such word did not suffice a evidence on to believe man guilty of so great crime knew so declared to herself that old man word have not be vague a to hang dog look lover have told that must not allow man countenance to go so far in evidence a in so judging must trust much too far to own power of discernment must not contradict felt sure of discernment in respect did not in least doubt truth of evidence conveyed by man hang dog face have sworn to herself thousand time that must not covet house property when uncle have first declared to purpose of disinheriting have be quite sure of herself that love for must not be affected by change have be pride to think that must soar above consideration of money be sure of own nobility even though must be stricken with absolute poverty now be tempted to long that newspaper might be found to be right be there man so fitted to be exalted in world so sure to fill high place with honour a lover though might not want llanfeare for herself be not bound to want for sake have told how certain be of heart how sure be that sooner later must win hand have almost begun to think that must be so that strength must not suffice for to hold to purpose how sweet must be triumph if must turn to tell now hour have come in must be proud to become wife love well enough to rejoice in giving something too well to have be burden on when must give nothing must be sweet to then there must be kiss a for cousin henry there be not even pity in heart towards must be time to pity when must have be made to give up fruit of wickedness to confess fault mr brodrick be not made to understand newspaper did care much about work have taken in hand if isabel must be made to accept smaller legacy so mr owen might marry out of hand take away must be enough to satisfy mr brodrick if isabel be settled somewhere with mr owen joint mean being sufficient to make certain that call must be made on paternal resource must satisfy mr brodrick craving in regard to welsh property be not sure that be anxious to see half sister of own child altogether removed from sphere exalted so high then smaller stroke of good fortune might be so much more easily made certain single word from isabel word girl le endowed with wicked obstinacy must have spoken at once must make sure immediate whereas great inheritance be to depend upon almost impossible confession of man who enjoyed seemed to to be a distant a ever bother newspaper said to eldest daughter why doe write sign receipt take income like one else be getting new boot at jackson yesterday where be money to come from if of want new boot papa be sure to tell of spirit be embittered too by severity of certain word husband have spoken to isabel have appealed to father when step mother have reproached with being burden in house papa have said let leave house earn something can at rate earn bread then mr brodrick have be very angry too have wished to accelerate marriage between daughter lover thinking that must surely accept money on lover behalf too have be annoyed at persistency of double refusal have be very far from purpose to drive girl from house to subject to misery of such reproach a wife have cast upon dear have said there be necessity for anything of kind mother be only anxious for welfare think that must take uncle money if not for own sake then for sake of to whom hope that will soon be married putting that aside be a well entitled to remain here a sister until be married here will be home there be comfort in small comfort did not tend to create pleasant intercourse between isabel step mother mr brodrick be woman who submitted habitually to husband intended to obey one who nevertheless must not be deterred from own little purpose felt to be ill used by isabel presence in house many year ago isabel have be taken away have be given to understand isabel be removed for ever there be to be no more expense more trouble there must be more jealousy in regard to isabel old uncle have promised to do everything that sore have be removed from life now isabel have come back again insisted on remaining there so unnecessarily now again there be boot to be bought at jackson other increased expenditure back head mouth pair of foot must create then be so palpable that hereford thought much of isabel thought little nothing of own girl one a mr brodrick be sure to make unpleasant in circumstance such a isabel said to one day did say anything about being turned out of house who have said that did mother must have gone to father talked about going out a housemaid told papa that if thought right must endeavour to earn bread told that have complained about being here so did have to tell so must not explain purpose of course be burden human being who eats wear clothes earns nothing be burden know that be thought of more because have be felt have be be disposed of must be disposed of now a call if pleased please be matter on will listen to dictation therefore be that wish must go away earn own bread choose to be independent in matter therefore ought to suffer for be reasonable enough must be felt to be burden then other girl came in nothing more be said till after hour two mr brodrick isabel be again alone together do think very odd that can not take money certainly do said mr brodrick what be use of going on about will not be made to take people at carmarthen so sure that be entitled to ever so much more say nothing about burden can not conceive how can reconcile to conscience when poor papa have got so many thing to pay be so little able to pay then paused a isabel must not be enticed into further declaration of independence continued certainly be setting up of own judgment against people who must know better a for mr owen of course will drive to look for one else young man want wife of course will find one then chance will be lost in way isabel did not pas time comfortably at hereford chapter xvii mr cheekey month have be left for cousin henry to consider what must do month from day in have be forced to accede to mr apjohn proposal up to on must have to stand before barrister at carmarthen must be brave enough at last to undergo ordeal have in truth resolved that must not undergo ordeal be quite sure of that nothing short of cart rope of police must drag into witness box still there be month there be various thought filling mind great expense be being incurred most uselessly if intended to retreat before day came who must pay money there be hardly hope left in bosom that property must remain in hand hope indeed now ran in altogether direction in what way might best get rid of property how most readily might take off from llanfeare have nothing more to do with tenant rent still be who must be responsible for terrible expense have be explained to by lawyer that might either indict proprietor of newspaper on criminal charge bring civil action against for damage mr apjohn have very strongly recommended former proceeding must be cheaper have said must show that man who brought have simply wished to vindicate own character must be cheaper in long run because a lawyer explained must not be so much object to get verdict a to show by presence in court that be afraid of one be to sue for damage a be probable not to get must then bear double expense of prosecution defence such have be argument mr apjohn have used have considered also that if must bind man to prosecute newspaper people on criminal charge then poor victim must be le able to retreat in such case a must victim courage fail at last moment policeman must be made to fetch force into witness box in conduct of civil action such constraint must be put upon knowing mr apjohn have eagerly explained superior attraction of criminal prosecution cousin henry have fallen into trap understood now have not be ready enough to do so when choice have be within power have now bound to prosecute certainly must be dragged into carmarthen unless first made known truth a to will if did that then thought that must surely spare trial be to say to there have at last found will here behold take will take llanfeare let escape from misery then surely must not force to appear in reference to matter must have be already decided in own favour have lost that opportunity of giving up will through mr griffith be still resolved that other mode must be discovered before month must have run by day be of moment yet day passed on nothing be done last idea be to send will to mr apjohn with letter in must simply declare that have just found amongst sermon that be prepared to go away a day flew by letter be left unwritten will be still among sermon will be understood that be much talked of in carmarthen mr henry jones of llanfeare be known to have indicted mr gregory evans of carmarthen herald for publication of various wicked malicious libel against be known also that mr apjohn be mr jones attorney in carrying on prosecution not le be understood that mr apjohn mr evans be not hostile to other in matter mr apjohn must be quite honest in what did must do best to prove libel on condition that client be honest owner of property in question in truth however great object of be to get henry jones into witness box so that if possible very truth might be extracted from day by day week by week since funeral idea have grown become strong in carmarthen that wicked deed have be done irked heart of that one a henry jones must do deed not be discovered old indefer jones have be respected by neighbour miss brodrick though not personally well known in county have be spoken well of by men idea llanfeare must belong to have be received with favour then have come that altered intention in old squire mind neighbour have disapproved mr apjohn have disapproved very strongly though be not without reticence so essentially necessary to character of attorney opinion have become known then squire return to old purpose be whispered abroad cantor have spoken very freely everything done everything not done at llanfeare be known in carmarthen mr griffith have at length spoken being last to abandon hope a to cousin henry honesty one be convinced that cousin henry have simply stolen property be to be endured that deed a must have be done by such man that carmarthen must not find out mr apjohn be very much praised for energy in having forced man to take action against mr evans one be more inclined to praise than mr evans who have seen man did believe that truth must be worked out of who have only heard of be sure that trial must be time of intense interest in borough sale of newspaper have risen immensely mr evans be quite leading man of hour so be going to have mr balsam against said mr evans to mr apjohn one day now mr balsam be very respectable barrister who for many year have gone welsh circuit be chiefly known for mildness of behaviour accurate knowledge of law two gift hardly of much value to advocate in assize town yes mr evans mr balsam have doubt will do that want suppose want to get into prison certainly if will be proved that have deserved libel be so manifest that will be only necessary to read to jury unless can justify think will have to go to prison suppose so will come see be quite sure mr apjohn suppose mr cheekey will have something to say on behalf before come to now mr john cheekey be gentleman about fifty year of age who have lately risen to considerable eminence in criminal court of law be generally called in profession perhaps sometimes outside supercilious jack from manner have of moving eyebrow when be desirous of intimidating witness be strong young looking generally good humoured irishman who have thousand good point under circumstance must bully woman must bully man unless according to own mode of looking at such case man wanted bullying when time did come reference to old bailey assize report in general must show that came very often supercilious jack must make teeth felt worse than terrier must pause in cross examination look at man projecting face forward by degree a did so in manner must crush false witness who be not armed with triple courage at breast ala not unfrequently witness who be not false for unfortunately though mr cheekey intended to confine process to who a said wanted bullying sometimes made mistake be possessed also of precious gift if have not invented have brought to perfection that of bullying judge also have found that by doing so must lower judge in estimation of jury thus diminish force of damnatory charge mr cheekey service have be especially secured for trial circumstance have be accurately explained to be felt that great day must have arrived in carmarthen when mr cheekey must stand up in court to cross examine cousin henry yes said mr evans chuckling think that mr cheekey will have something to say to what will be result mr apjohn asked abruptly how be to say if can only hold own like man there will of course be verdict of guilty can asked of newspaper hope may with heart if have done nothing that ought not to have done in matter mr evans have altogether divided sympathy dislike man utterly care who know one know better than idea of coming here over young lady head be from first abhorrent to when saw heard found out what be such poor cringing cowardly wretch feeling be of course exacerbated be terrible to that old squire whom have always respected must have brought man among be old squire doing certainly did bring a certainly intended to make heir if did make heir if will read be in truth last will then hope most sincerely that mr cheekey may do may be of avail against if be case will be glad to have opportunity of calling upon in new lodging if there be will mr apjohn later will then of course there be doubt whether man be aware of if be aware of then hope that mr cheekey may tear limb from limb feel sure that be so ah know about that be very hard to be sure of anything when see do feel almost sure that be guilty when think of afterwards again have doubt be not by men of such calibre great crime be committed can hardly fancy that must have destroyed will hidden if be hidden must live in agony lest be discovered used to think so when knew that passed whole day sitting in one room now go out for hour together two three time have be down with old griffith at coed twice young cantor found lying on sea cliff doubt whether must have gone so far afield if will be hidden in house can have on own person be not brave enough for that presence of there must reveal by motion of hand finger must always be on pocket contained know what to think be because be in doubt have brought under mr cheekey thumbscrew be case in must if possible force man to confess truth even against for reason have urged to prosecute a honest man be bound to hope that may succeed if be rightful owner of llanfeare one belief mr apjohn not one in carmarthen belief will not say what believe indeed know do hope that by mr cheekey aid otherwise may get at truth in own peculiar circle with mr geary attorney with mr jones auctioneer mr powell landlord of bush hotel mr evans be much more triumphant among indeed with gentleman of carmarthen generally be something of hero did believe probable that interloper must be extruded from property did not belong to that doing of must be due to mr evans apjohn pretend to think that be very doubtful said to three friend apjohn be doubtful at said mr geary be little cautious a to expressing apjohn have behaved very well remarked innkeeper if be for must never have got rascal to come forward at went out in one of fly wo let charge for on job like suppose will charge for bringing cousin henry into court said auctioneer have got to call cousin henry since idea have got abroad that have robbed cousin isabel 'd bring too for nothing stand lunch into bargain rather than that must have pleasure of meeting mr cheekey cheekey will get out of if there be anything to get said mr evans belief be that mr cheekey will about strike dumb if have got anything in bosom to conceal will be so awe struck that wo be able to open mouth wo be got to say did wo be able to say did be mr geary opinion what must amount to asked mr powell be afraid must give place back to young lady because of that jury must acquit mr evans be about what must amount to said attorney cousin henry must go back to llanfeare have trouble over remarked mr jones deemed to be disastrous termination to trouble be taking one seemed by mean improbable agreed that even mr cheekey must hardly be able to extract from man acknowledgment that have with own hand destroyed will such termination a to cross examination have never be known under hand of most expert of advocate that cousin henry might be stricken dumb that might faint that might be committed for contempt of court event be possible perhaps not impossible that must say yes did burnt will yes with own hand that declared to be impossible if so cousin henry must go back again to llanfeare confirmed in possession of property will only laugh at in sleeve when be over said auctioneer little knew torment man be enduring how unlikely be that must laugh in sleeve at one be too apt to forget when think of sin fault of men how keen may be conscience in spite of sin while be thus talking of cousin henry be vainly endeavouring to console with reflection that have not committed great crime that there be still road open to for repentance that if only might be allowed to escape repent in london must be too glad to resign llanfeare glory reader will hardly suppose that cousin henry will return after trial to laugh in sleeve in own library in own house few day afterwards mr apjohn be up in town have interview with mr balsam barrister client of mine doe not seem to be nice sort of country gentleman said mr balsam anything that will understand mr balsam that only object in persuading to indict paper have be to put into witness box told so of course explained to that unless must appear there must never hold up head took advice very unwillingly must have given right hand to escape gave alternative so put before that must not refuse to do a bade without owning to be rascal will tell what think will come of will come of will not appear feel certain that will not have courage to show in court when day come perhaps day two before will run away what will do then ah be question what will do then be bound to prosecute will have to pay penalty in such case a think must have found brought into court for next assize what must do then though be ever so rough to in way of contempt of court rest of can not take property away if have got hold of will destroyed hidden can hing a to property a long a be strong enough to hold tongue if can be made to speak then think will get at mr balsam shook head be quite willing to believe that client be a base a mr apjohn represented to be be not willing to believe that mr cheekey be a powerful a have be assumed chapter xviii cousin henry go to carmarthen on return from london mr apjohn wrote following letter to client sent to llanfeare by clerk who be instructed to wait there for answer dear sir have just returned from london where saw mr balsam who will be employed on behalf at assize be necessary that must come into office so that may complete instruction be to be given to counsel a must not very well do at llanfeare without considerable inconvenience must give trouble clerk who take out to will bring back answer saying whether eleven in morning to morrow three in afternoon will best suit arrangement can tell also whether must wish to send fly for believe that still keep uncle carriage in case must perhaps be unnecessary message sent by clerk will suffice so that may be saved trouble of writing yours truly nicholas apjohn clerk have made way into book room in cousin henry be sitting stood there over while be reading letter felt sure that have be arranged by mr apjohn that must be so in order that might not have moment to consider reply must send mr apjohn have calculated traitor that be to cause of client so thought cousin

clear must not now send will in lieu of why have not possessed presence of mind to say to clerk at once that further step need be taken further step need be taken have found will here be found very

carry with to carmarthen in pocket when attempted to enclose in envelope for purpose mind misgave restored hateful a be property to odious a be house thing about sooner did doing of act by be to release from come within touch of finger than abandoned idea at such moment estate must again have charm for must remember that deed when once done must admit of recall be glad to see mr jones said attorney a client entered inner office there be few word must be settled between before day come time have to be lost sit down mr ricketts write heading of question answer then mr jones can initial afterwards mr ricketts be clerk who have come out to llanfeare cousin henry sat silent a mr ricketts folded long sheet of folio paper with double margin here be new terror to a saw preparation almost made up mind that must on account sign name to anything instruction to be given to mr balsam be in fact very simple need not here be recapitulated uncle have sent for to llanfeare have told that be to be heir have informed that new will have be made in favour after uncle death subsequent to funeral have heard will read under will have inherited property a far a believed at rate a far a knew that be uncle last will testament be instruction under mr apjohn advice be to be given to mr balsam a to cousin henry direct evidence then cousin henry remembering last communication to farmer griffith remembering also that two cantor must prove added something on own account saw old man writing up in room said copying something knew to be will be sure then be going to make change take property from asked question thought very cruel be of use for to say anything no did tell what be about knew be will must condescend to ask question when cantor said that have witnessed will never doubted when came there to read will supposed must be found like enough be there now if proper search be made can tell to mr balsam if want to know why did tell before said mr apjohn be much to tell be only what thought if what cantor said what believed yourselves did bring to will nothing must say must help doe amount to more than thinking after then mr apjohn be again confused again in doubt must be possible after that conduct on part of man have be so prejudicial to in eye of men have be produced simply by annoyance to have be subjected be still possible that old man have destroyed document have be tempted to make that have of be most unjust to poor fellow added however detail of new story to instruction be to be given to mr balsam to cousin henry did attach signature then came further conversation about mr cheekey however did not take official form what question mr cheekey might ask must be between mr cheekey other attorney formed part of mr apjohn direct business have intended to imbue client with something of horror with clerk have be before in creating believing that cause of truth must be assisted by reducing man to lowest condition of mean terror new story somewhat changed purpose if man be innocent if there be small probability of innocence be not duty to defend a client from ill usage on part of cheekey that cheekey must have way with be matter of course be if cousin henry appeared at word two of warning might be of service will be examined on other side by mr cheekey said intending to assume pleasant voice at hearing of awful name sweat broke out on cousin henry brow know what line will be know anything about will attempt to prove will be made deny have said that think will be made that be aware of existence here mr apjohn paused having resumed that stern tone of voice be so disagreeable to cousin henry ear that have destroyed what right have got to say have destroyed have destroyed nothing mr apjohn marked word well be again convinced that client be not innocent will endeavour to make jury believe from word coming out of own mouth possibly by silence that have destroyed deed have concealed cousin henry thought moment whether have concealed will not have not put within book man who hide thing be man who conceals thing not man who fails to tell that have found concealed repeated mr apjohn with peculiar voice of have not concealed said victim know where lie hidden ghastly pale became livid almost blue by degree though be fully determined to give up will must not yield to pressure now put upon must withstand question be a terrible to a though have entertained idea of abandoning property to acknowledge that knew all along where be hidden must be to confess guilt to give up to tormentor of law know where lie hidden repeated mr apjohn in low voice go out of room ricketts said know where lie hidden asked third time when clerk have closed door behind know nothing about gasped poor man have nothing beyond to say to nothing must rather that must be left to mr cheekey if there be anything further that can say must be more tender with than nothing here in room there be public to gaze upon nothing gasped again very well so be ricketts see if fly be there for mr jones few minute afterwards confidential clerk be alone with in room have learned so much ricketts said will be still in existence be sure of know whereabouts will have miss brodrick there before christmas yet chapter xix mr apjohn sends for assistance last word in last chapter be spoken by mr apjohn to confidential clerk in tone of triumph have picked up something further conscious that have done so by own ingenuity be for moment triumphant when came to think over alone spent many hour just at present in thinking of matter be le inclined to be self satisfied felt that great responsibility rested with that weighed upon peculiarly at present moment be quite sure not only that later will have be made that be in existence be concealed somewhere cousin henry knew secret of hiding place have existed at rate that morning now came terrible question whether man driven to last gasp in misery must not destroy not only have mr apjohn discovered secret be well aware that cousin henry be conscious that have done so yet not word have be spoken between must will now be destroyed must be taken a evidence that have ever existed let paper be once burnt cousin henry must be safe in possession of property mr cheekey might torment victim certainly must not extract from confession such a that hiding of will very place in be hidden might possibly be extracted be conceivable that ingenuity on one side abject terror on other might lead poor wretch to betray secret man who have committed felony will hardly confess deed in court of law something of must thought mr apjohn occur to cousin henry by very addition to fear might be driven to destroy will great object now must be to preserve document have lived a be charmed life through so many danger if anything be to be done with object anything new must be done at once even now while be thinking of cousin henry be being taken slowly home in mr powell fly might do deed a soon a found alone in book room mr apjohn be almost sure that will be concealed somewhere in book room that long continued sojourn in chamber of whole country have heard so much told that be so be there always watching hiding place must be well that searcher must again be sent out that must be instructed never to leave room till after cousin henry examination must be over if so must be right that man must be sent off instantly on horseback so a to prevent immediate destruction then have power to take step in reference to man house be question whether magistrate must give warrant seeing that search have already be made that on failure of such search that squire will have already be proved man house be castle let suspicion against be what may unless there be evidence to support be to apply to magistrate must only say that man own manner mode of speech have be evidence of guilt yet how much be there hanging perhaps on decision of moment whether property must go to hand of who be entitled to enjoy remain in possession of thief such a might so probably depend on action must be taken now at very instant mr ricketts confidential clerk be only person with whom have fully discussed detail of case only person to whom have expressed own thought a have occurred to have said word to clerk in triumph a cousin henry left few minute afterwards recalled with altered tone ricketts said man have got will with in book room at llanfeare in pocket sir suggested ricketts think wherever be at moment have not placed there squire put somewhere have found squire be very weak when made that will sir said clerk just at time be only coming down to dining room when sun shone in just for hour two in day if put will anywhere must probably be in bed room man occupies chamber asked attorney yes sir same room have before uncle died be in book room repeated mr apjohn then must have put there did from manner from word two that spoke feel sure that paper have be placed where be by other hand old man never went into book room heard detail of latter life from mr griffith when search be going on have be there for more than month if wanted anything out of book room after young lady went away sent mr griffith for did send for asked mr apjohn used to read little sometimes said clerk sermon suggested mr apjohn for many year past have read sermon to whenever have failed in going to church have seen volume there on table in parlour when have be with did search book have volume off shelf sir opened one of ca tell be there volume must have be shaken said mr apjohn be not too late yet sir said clerk how be to get in do have right to go into house man to search must dare to hinder sir then there be pause before anything further be said step be strong one to take said lawyer when one be guided only by one own inner conviction have tittle of evidence in favour to prove anything beyond fact that old squire in latter day of life did make will have not be found for have searched not finding have be forced to admit to probate last will made since nothing have come to knowledge guided partly by man way while have be at llanfeare partly by own manner hesitation have come to conclusion in own mind be one must hardly dare to propose to magistrate a ground for action if consented sir still must be hardly able to justify for such intrusion if nothing be found have right to crush poor creature because be so easily crushable feel already prick of conscience because be bringing down jack cheekey upon if all be a have suggested that will be hidden let say in volume of sermon there what probability be there that will destroy now must before trial think not at once think not will not allow to be driven to great crime till last moment be quite on card that conscience will even at last be too strong for owe something sir for not destroying when first found not doubt if be right in do owe something at rate charity enough to suppose that doing of deed must be very distasteful to when think of doubt whether will do at asked why did come search again did must wonder if poor devil must be glad enough to be relieved from will tell what will do ricketts will write to miss brodrick father ask to come over here before trial be much more concerned in matter than be must know a well what ought to be done letter be written urging mr brodrick to come at once have right to tell mr apjohn said in letter that there be ground for believing document a have described be still existing might too probably be raising false hope be to do so can only tell of own suspicion explaining to at same time on what ground be founded think must be well that must come over consult with whether further step must be taken if so come at once trial be fixed for friday th be written on thursday nd there be therefore not much more than week interval will come with said mr brodrick to rev william owen after showing to letter from attorney at hereford why must go with must wish to do so on isabel behalf isabel be nothing to other be sorry to hear say that be other day that declared that must be wife in spite of herself so will if mr henry jones be firmly established at llanfeare be explained to before why daughter a owner of llanfeare ought not to marry a altogether agreed with reason given must not become to take step in matter a owner of llanfeare will be nothing to can not therefore be right must look after interest in direction on other subject must do anything for father doubt felt that two young people be willed obstinate contradictory daughter must marry clergyman because have be deprived of property clergyman now refused to marry daughter because be presumed that property might be restored to a however must not induce mr owen to go with to carmarthen determined to go alone did not give much weight to new story seemed to certain that man must destroy will must already have destroyed if in first instance be wicked enough to conceal still matter be so great question so important to daughter interest that felt compelled to do a mr apjohn have proposed did not do altogether a mr apjohn have proposed allowed other matter to interfere postponed journey till tuesday th of month late on evening reached carmarthen at once went to mr apjohn house cousin henry journey into carmarthen have be made on previous thursday since day new step have be taken to unravel mystery none at least have reference to llanfeare further search have be made among book be known in carmarthen of cousin henry during day be that remained altogether within house be so minded ample time be allowed to for destruction of document in town preparation went on in usual way for assize at one case of interest be to be indictment of mr evans for defamation of character be now supposed by world at large that cousin henry must come into court because be believed of there be something of slight turn of public opinion in favour must hardly be case that man if really guilty must encounter mr cheekey during day have elapsed even mr apjohn have lost something of confidence if further step be to be taken why did not young lady father come take why have be so dilatory in matter be of so much greater importance to than to one else now two attorney be together be necessary that must decide upon doing something nothing hoped must have be here last week said mr apjohn must get away there be thing must possibly leave be so important said mr apjohn of course be important of most vital importance if there be hope have told exactly what think feel yes yes know how much more than kind how honourable have be in matter still think that will be hidden did think so something have changed opinion can hardly say that said mr apjohn there be ground on to form opinion know that there be ground for changing in such matter mind will vacillate did think that have found will shut up in volume of sermon in volume uncle have be reading during illness that have left book in place upon shelf that will say be conclusion too exact for man to reach without anything in shape of absolute evidence say so then a yet hardly know process by belief have be reached say so say be too exact there be more of imagination in than of true deduction certainly must not recommend person to proceed far on such reasoning see have be in way then explained to brother attorney process of little circumstance by have arrived at own opinion dislike of man to leave house clinging to one room manifest possession of secret a evinced by conversation with farmer griffith continual dread of something very clinging to llanfeare a residence must not have be case have destroyed will exaggerated fear of coming cross examination ready assertion that have destroyed nothing hidden nothing failure to reply when be asked whether be aware of such concealment then fact that book have not be searched that old squire have never personally used room have used book one two book have be taken from that book have be volume have certainly be close to in day when lost will be being written other little detail known to reader made process by mr apjohn have arrived at conclusion now endeavoured to explain to mr brodrick grant that chain be slight said mr apjohn so slight that feather may break strongest point in be look on man face when asked last question now have told everything must decide what ought to do mr brodrick be man endowed with lesser gift than of other attorney in such matter mr apjohn be sure to lead what do think must propose that must go together over to llanfeare to morrow ask to allow to make what further search may please about house if permitted must think must be not at sure what must wish to have will found if did must begin go through book in library must begin with sermon soon know whether be a have suggested if refused then think must make bold to insist on remaining there while went to magistrate have indeed already prepared mr evans of llancolly who be nearest magistrate must refuse to leave room must then return with search warrant policeman a for opening special book book must do with without permission while talk to will look round room see where be think much of mr brodrick when stake be so high be worth playing for if fail in can then only wait see what redoubtable mr cheekey may be able to do for thus be settled that mr brodrick mr apjohn must go out to llanfeare on following morning chapter xx doubt know nothing about cousin henry have gasped out when asked by mr apjohn when ricketts clerk have left room whether knew where will be hidden then when have declared have nothing further to say be allowed to go away a be carried back in fly felt certain that mr apjohn knew that there have be will knew that will be still in existence knew that have be hidden by accident knew also that henry jones be aware of place of concealment that man must have be so expert in reading secret of bosom be terrible to have man suspected of destroying will deed doing of might have be so naturally suspected that must have be le terrible have done nothing have committed crime be simply conscious of existence of paper be duty not of of others to find man by fearful ingenuity have discovered now be simply necessary that place must be indicated in order that might be forced to indicate mr cheekey be to be let loose upon how impossible how almost impossible have found to produce word in answer to one little question from mr apjohn know where be hidden have so answered a to make manifest that did know be conscious that have be thus weak though there have be nothing in mr apjohn manner to appal how must be with when hour after hour question after question must be demanded of when cruel tormentor must stand there glaring at in presence of court there must be need of such hour need of prolonged questioning be wanted of must be revealed at once whole secret must be screwed out of by first turn of tormentor engine there be one thing quite fixed in mind nothing must induce to face mr cheekey unless must have made comparatively safe by destroying will in way almost thought might be safe suffering must be great rack thumbscrew boot wheel must to delight of present be allowed to do work upon for hour must be day to terrible to anticipate terrible to endure terrible afterwards in memory thought that not even mr cheekey must be able to extract from admission of such deed a then by deed must undoubtedly acquire llanfeare place be not dear to there be rising in heart so strong feeling of hatred against who be oppressing that seemed to almost duty to punish by continued possession of property in way must triumph over if once must come down from mr cheekey grasp alive if must survive fearful hour must walk forth from court undoubted owner of llanfeare must be a though man must endure excruciating operation under hand of surgeon with assured hope that might enjoy perfect health afterwards for remainder of life to destroy will be only chance of escape there be nothing else left to knowing a did that be impossible for to put end to own life with own hand little plot of have planned for revelation of secret without acknowledgment of guilt have fallen to piece a attempted to execute began to be aware of that anything required skill in execution be impossible to to burn will be capable must surely take paper from hiding place hold down with poker when have thrust between bar a there be fire provided in summer month must consume by light of candle when dead hour of night have come upon have already resolved that when have done so must swallow tell tale ash believed of that must be within power if only must determine upon doing of thought that deed when done must give new courage very danger to must have exposed must make brave to avoid having destroyed will certain that eye have seen conscious that safety depended on own reticence be sure that must keep secret even before mr cheekey know nothing of will must say have seen hidden found destroyed knowing what must be consequence be to depart from assertion must assuredly cling to must be safer then much safer than in present vacillating half innocent position a be carried home in fly mind be so intent upon be so anxious to resolve to bring to do deed that hardly knew where be when fly stopped at hall door a entered house stared about a though doubtful of whereabouts then without speaking word made way into book room seated on accustomed chair woman came to asked whether money must not be given to driver what driver said let go to mr apjohn be mr apjohn business not mine then got up shut door violently a woman retreated yes be mr apjohn business thought that must put spoke into wheel of mr apjohn business mr apjohn be not only anxious to criminate now have be anxious when such anxiety on part have be intrusive impertinent mr apjohn have from first to last be enemy by enmity have created that fatal dislike uncle have felt for mr apjohn be now determined to ruin mr apjohn have come out to at llanfeare pretending to be lawyer friend advisor have recommended treacherous indictment merely that might be able to subject to torment of mr cheekey persecution cousin henry must see now so at least cousin henry told be clever fellow think that be fool perhaps be right will find that fool have be too many for be thus that communed with have dinner sat by during whole evening a have be practice day since uncle death yet peculiar night seemed to to be eventful felt to be lifted into unwonted eagerness of life something approaching to activity there be deed to be done though be not a yet doing though did not think that intended to do very night yet fact that have made up mind made in sort aware that dumb spirit must not speak have be exorcised that crushing dullness of latter day have passed away from must not do night be sure that must do have looked about for way of escape have be a though dead man while must not find have lived in terror of mr griffith housekeeper of farmer griffith of two cantor of mr apjohn of tyrant cheekey of own shadow while will be existing together in same room must be so no longer there be one way of escape must take then went on thinking of what good thing might be in store for spirit have hitherto be so quenched by vicinity of will that have never dared to soar into thought of enjoyment of money there have be so black pall over everything that have not a yet realised what be that llanfeare might do for of course must not live there though must have to leave house untenanted altogether must matter little there be law to make man live on own estate calculated that must be able to draw l year from property l year must be clearly own on one must lay finger what enjoyment must not buy with l year with great resolve to destroy will went to bed slept through night a best must in dark of chamber when candle be out be not yet protected by bed there came qualm upon deed be not yet done qualm be kept under slept even repeated lord prayer to when be under clothes struggling however a did so not to bring home to petition a to leading into temptation deliverance from evil next day friday saturday be passed in same way resolution be still there qualm came night salve to qualm be always same remembrance that deed have not be done yet prayer be always said morning night with same persistent rejection of word in present condition be so damning to rejection from intelligence though with whispering voice word be spoken still there be resolve same a ever there be other way of escape stag when brought to bay will trample upon hound must trample upon llanfeare must be own must not return to clerk desk to be scorn of men to have known that have fraudulently kept will hidden then revealed not of grace because be afraid of mr cheekey mind be quite made up deed need not be yet done fewer night that must have to pas in house after doing of deed better trial be to be on friday must not postpone deed till last day a might be then emissary might come to watching to see that did not escape yet must be well for to keep hand clean from doing of up to last moment be quite resolved there be other escape yet yet yet who must say what might not happen till deed must have be done there must yet be path open to sweet easiness of innocence when must have be done there must be final adieu to innocence there must be no return to white way possibility of repentance how must man repent while be still holding guilty prize have won how must give up prize without delivering a criminal to law nevertheless be resolved determined that deed must be done on tuesday night during whole tuesday be thinking of must bring to believe that story of soul tormented for wickedness in everlasting fire be old woman tale if must bring to believe that if must do then must master qualm why not religious thought have hitherto little troubled life church service have be nothing to have lived neither with fear with love of god at heart knew that be little disposed to think that line of conduct have never be hitherto adopted by must be embraced in later life must not think of a being even desirous to be religious why then must qualm afflict that prayer be accustomed to repeat to a went to rest be trick of youth have come down to from old innocent day though be seldom omitted without shiver nevertheless be repeated with contempt in broad daylight when boon companion have be with round candle blasphemy have never frightened now now in trouble remembered that there be hell must not shake from idea for unrepented sin there be eternity of torment must last for ever such sin a premeditated must remain unrepented there must be torment for for ever nevertheless must do after did not many of wise one of earth justify in thinking that threat be old woman tale tuesday night came late hour of tuesday night midnight hour at be sure that woman be in bed will be taken out from hiding place have already trimmed wick placed candle on outspread newspaper so that fragment of ash must fall where might not be collected have walked round room to make sure that aperture might possibly be open put out candle so a to see that gleam of light from source be making way into room then relighted moment have come for destruction of document read through yet again why knew not in truth craving excuse for further delay with what care dying old man have written word completed letter sat there contemplating old man work telling that be for to destroy utterly by just motion of wrist turned round trimmed candle again still sat there with paper in hand must be that so great result must come from so short act damning of own soul must in truth be giving up of own soul to eternal punishment god must know that have not meant to steal property god must know that did not wish to steal now god must know that be doing a only mean of escape from misery others be plotting for god must know how cruelly have be used god must know injustice with old man have treated then came moment in almost taught to believe that in destroying will must be doing more than act of rough justice that god must certainly condemn one to eternal punishment for just act still whenever must turn round to candle hand must refuse to raise paper to flame when done must not be undone whether eternal flame must must not get possession of there must be before life agonised by dread of must mr cheekey do worse for than that wednesday must at rate do a well why rob of comfort of one day during soul must not be irretrievably condemned now might sleep for night at rate might sleep doubted whether must ever sleep again after doing of deed to be commonly wicked be nothing to nothing to break through ordinary rule of life parent teach child pastor flock a to world be so careless to covet other men good to speak evil of neighbour to run after neighbour wife if came in path to steal little in ordinary way such a selling lame horse looking over adversary hand at whist to swear to lie to ridicule memory of parent peccadillo have never oppressed soul that not telling of will have be burdensome to only because of danger of discovery to burn will thereby clearly to steal l year from cousin to commit felony to do for might be confined at dartmoor life with hair cut dirty prison clothes hard food work to do thought must be well to have day of life in have not done deed therefore put will back into book went to bed chapter xxi mr apjohn success early on wednesday morning mr apjohn mr brodrick be on foot preparing for performance of very disagreeable day work mr brodrick did not believe at in day work in discussing matter with mr apjohn after have determined upon line of action made mind known very clearly to be simply apparent that if will have fallen into power of dishonest person if dishonest man must achieve purpose by destroying will must be destroyed of cousin henry knew nothing cousin henry might might not be ordinarily honest a be other ordinary people there might be such will a spoken of there might be will accidentally hidden will might have be found destroyed that must be able to find will hiding place of must be known to cousin henry be to thinking out of question subtler intellect of other lawyer appreciating intricacy of weak man mind saw more than companion when found that mr brodrick did not agree with perceived that other attorney mind be not speculative in such matter a ceased to try to persuade simply said that be duty of of to leave stone unturned so started will take about mile out of way to show mr evans gate mr apjohn said after have started house be not above twenty minute from llanfeare must be necessary to ask assistance will know about will find policeman there ready to come back with impression be that cousin henry will not attempt to prevent search may endeavour to make be about ten when reached house on being shown into book room found cousin henry at breakfast front door be opened for by mr griffith housekeeper when mr apjohn expressed desire to see mr jones made difficulty in admitting at once be part of misery of cousin henry position that everybody around near to be against mr griffith be aware that be purpose of mr apjohn to turn present master out of llanfeare if possible be quite willing to aid by mean in power therefore gave master notice of arrival of two stranger ushered into room at once cousin henry breakfast be frugal meal have be frugal since have become owner of llanfeare be not that did not like nice eating a well a that be too much afraid of own servant to make known own taste then general discomfort of position have be too great to admit of relief from delicate dish there be tea pot on table solitary cup bread butter nearly naked bone of cold joint of mutton thing be not set after fashion of well to do gentleman table be put on a might be in third rate london lodging with tumbled tablecloth dish plate cup unlike other mr jones said attorney from carmarthen be uncle mr brodrick from hereford then two men who be so nearly connected have never known other shook hand of course matter continued mr apjohn be of great moment mr brodrick have come over to look after daughter interest be very glad to see uncle said cousin henry turning eye involuntarily towards shelf on volume of sermon be resting be afraid ca offer much in way of breakfast breakfasted before left carmarthen said mr apjohn if mind going on will talk to whilst be eating cousin henry said that did not mind going on found impossible to eat morsel did that endured during interview have to do have to endure fasting have better tell at once continued mr apjohn what want to do now what be want to do now suppose have got to go into assize same on friday that depends be just possible that must turn out to be unnecessary a said looked into cousin henry face thought that discerned something of satisfaction when made suggestion understood well how great be temptation offered in prospect of not having to encounter mr cheekey mr brodrick think probable that uncle last will may yet be concealed somewhere in house cousin henry eye a be said again glanced up at fatal shelf when mr apjohn say that in name said mr brodrick opening mouth for first time must understand that personally know nothing of circumstance be guided in opinion only by what tell exactly said mr apjohn a father of young lady who must be heiress of llanfeare if be not heir have of course told everything even down to most secret surmise of mind right said cousin henry position continued mr apjohn be painful very peculiar find specially bound to act a lawyer of deceased to carry out be in truth last will testament thought be proved at carmarthen said cousin henry doubt will be proved will be very genuine if subsequent will be found a have be told repeatedly proving of will amount to nothing if subsequent one be forthcoming great question be doe subsequent will exist how be to know anything about nobody say do suppose must come here bring uncle brodrick down on giving notice coming into house just when be at breakfast without saying word to one unless thought so see what right have to be here at be trying to pluck up spirit in order that might get rid of why oh why have not destroyed that document when on previous night have be brought out from hiding place purposely in order that might be burned be common mr jones for one gentleman to call upon when there be business to be done said mr apjohn not common to come to gentleman house accuse of making away with will nobody have done said brodrick be very like will allow to search again two of clerk will be here just now will go through house with if will permit cousin henry sat staring at not long ago have asked one of mr apjohn clerk why did not search again then framing of thought have be different at moment have be desirous of surrendering llanfeare altogether so that might also get rid of mr cheekey now have reached bolder purpose now be resolved to destroy will enjoy property face barrister idea came across mind that must hardly insist upon searching instantly if refused petition to effect have already be made petition implies power of refusal on part of petitioned where do want to look asked upon mr brodrick allowed eye to wander round room cousin henry eye followed of uncle seemed to to settle exactly upon one shelf to search house generally uncle bed room for instance said mr apjohn oh

must think of own comfort said mr apjohn severely comfort indeed what comfort can have while idea be present to that house in live may possibly be property of cousin be very little comfort have left among face out then like man when have allowed to do that can on behalf then enjoy own talk of comfort will have men in go on with search a propose if be to find a certainly must then surely must not accuse of having hidden must be enabled to act show of surprise must not dare to contradict even must feel sure in heart that have be aware of concealment there must be great relief there must be end of so many trouble then how weak must have be to have have prize altogether within grasp to have lost burst of foul courage swelled in heart changing very colour of character for time a resolved that must not be so men must not search there so told without further authority than mr apjohn must give wo be treated in way said in what way do mean mr jones wo have house searched a though be swindler thief can go into man house search just a please merely because be attorney told man other day said mr apjohn that might renew search if pleased so may must get order first from somebody be nobody be

rate must not be cross examined by mr cheekey at rate must not be brought to trial there be almost promise too that a little must be said a possible there must supposed be legal form of abdication on part be willing to execute that a quickly a possible on simple condition that must be allowed to depart without being forced to speak further on matter to one in wale not to have to see tenant not to have to say even word of farewell to servant not to be carried into carmarthen above not to face mr cheekey court be asked now from kind fate at about two mr griffith came into room ostensibly to take away breakfast thing have seen triumphant face of mr apjohn knew that victory have be gained when saw that breakfast have not be touched heart became soft way to melt heart of mr griffith be to eat nothing law mr jones have not have mouthful will do broil assented to broil ate when be cooked with better appetite than have enjoyed since uncle death gradually came to feel that great load have be taken from off shoulder will be no longer hidden in book nothing have be done of must not repent there be prospect of life before made horrid by one great sin must not be squire of llanfeare must be felon felon always in own esteem upon whole though hardly admitted a much to man condition have be improved by transaction of morning quite agree with have done morning said mr apjohn a soon a two lawyer be in fly together be lost in admiration at clearness of insight ah come of giving one undivided thought to matter have be turning over in mind till have be able to see be odd be must have foretold to happened almost to volume quite to volume well yes to volume of sermon brother in law read nothing sermon thought must have asked question like making man criminate said mr brodrick do if mean to criminate too object be to let off to enable to do that must know exactly what knew what have done will tell occurred to when shook will out of book how must be if declared that have brought with if have be sharp enough for that very fact of having gone to book at once must have be evidence against be not up to poor devil be inclined to think that have got a bad a deserves might have be so much worse owe ever so much for not destroying will cousin will have to give l be to have given certainly certainly have be hardly used know by uncle upon word have have bad time of for last month must have be hated insulted a have be by people up there not for llanfeare twice over think have quenched now so that will run smooth if so will let off easily if have treated le hardly just now might have gathered courage turned upon then must have be necessary to crush altogether be thinking through how might let off easiest chapter xxiii isabel petition news be soon about carmarthen new will have be found in accordance with miss brodrick be to become owner of llanfeare be of more importance to carmarthen at present moment there be to be trial story a told publicly be a follows mr apjohn by sagacity have found will have be concealed in volume of sermon mr apjohn remembering suddenly that old man have be reading sermon shortly before death have gone at once to book there will have be discovered have at once be admitted to be true formal document by unhappy pseudo proprietor henry jones have acknowledged cousin to be heiress under circumstance have conceived to be useless to go on with trial such be story told mr apjohn fully aware that story went very lame on one leg did best to remedy default by explaining that must be unreasonable to expect that man must come into court undergo examination by mr cheekey just when have lost fine property of course know said mr apjohn when editor of paper remarked to that libel if libel must be just a much libel whether mr henry jones be be not owner of llanfeare of course know be hardly to expect that man be to come assert amidst cloud of difficulty when have just undergone misfortune a that have have fling be not to be punished for ought to satisfy who will pay expense asked mr evans well said mr apjohn scratching head of course will have to pay nothing geary will settle that with that poor devil at llanfeare ought to pay wo have money at rate will make right with geary so need trouble question a to expense be much discussed by others in carmarthen who in truth must pay complicated lawyer bill must have be occasioned including fly out to llanfeare in spite of mr apjohn good natured explanation public of carmarthen be quite convinced that henry jones have in truth hidden will if so ought not only to be made to pay for everything be sent to prison also tried for felony opinion concerning cousin henry in carmarthen on thursday friday be very severe indeed have shown in town must almost have be pulled in piece to kill to sell carcase for what might fetch towards lessening expense have incurred must not be too bad for mr apjohn be of course hero of hour a far a carmarthen must see mr apjohn must have to pay bill spoken a be by many mouth reached mr brodrick ear induced to say word two to mr apjohn affair said will of course become charge upon property what affair trial be not to take place rest of trial will have nothing to do with estate said mr apjohn have everything to do with only mention now to let know that a isabel father will make business to look after truth be brodrick said carmarthen attorney with gleam of triumph in eye have be so often seen there since will have tumbled out of volume of sermon in book room whole of matter have be pleasure to that care straw about cost if paid for from beginning to end out of own pocket must have have whack for money perhaps miss isabel will recompense by letting make will day such be feeling such be word spoken at carmarthen need only be said further in regard to carmarthen that operation necessary for proving later will annulling former one for dispossessing cousin henry for putting isabel into full fruition of honour went on a quickly a must be effected by concentrated energy of mr apjohn clerk cousin henry to whom may be now allowed to bid farewell be permitted to remain within seclusion of house at llanfeare till signature have be obtained to last necessary document one spoke word to one came to see if there be intruder about place anxious to catch glimpse of pseudo squire be disappointed mr griffith under attorney instruction be more courteous to than have be when be master endeavoured to get thing nice to eat trying to console by titbit none of tenant appeared before be there rough word spoken to even by young cantor in cousin henry did feel consolation be greatly comforted when heard from office in london that stool at desk be still kept open for carmarthen herald in final allusion to state of thing at llanfeare simply declared that proper will have be found at last that miss isabel brodrick be to be restored to right guided by statement director in london be contented to regard clerk a having be unfortunate rather than guilty for man reader be hoped will feel compassion have be dragged away from london by false hope after so great injury a inflicted on by last change in squire purpose be hardly unnatural that idea of retaliation must present to when opportunity came in way not to do justice demand be so much easier to conscience than to commit deed be palpably fraudulent at last conscience saved mr apjohn will perhaps be thought to have be right in declaring that much be due to in that have not destroyed will forbearance be recompensed fully a soon a money must be raised on property full sum of l be paid to that having be amount with squire have intended to burden property on behalf of niece when be minded to put out of inheritance may be added that notorious a whole

remain till will be known a oldest inhabitant of carmarthenshire mr apjohn took to carmarthen hence on to llanfeare at station there be many to meet so that triumph a got into carriage be almost painful to when heard bell ring from tower of parish church must hardly believe that peal be intended to welcome back to old home be taken somewhat out of way round by creek coed so that little tinkling of own parish church might not be lost upon if return of hers to estate be so important to others a to justify sign what must be to how deep must be conviction a to own duty at gate of coed farmyard carriage stopped old farmer came out to say few word to god bless miss isabel be happy sight to see be so kind of mr griffith have have bad time of miss isabel not that wished to quarrel with dear uncle judgment that have right to say much against poor gentleman who have gone expected went against grain with to have expectation disappointed will always look up to miss at same time wish joy with heart of new landlord be going to set over of course be to be expected will be here with time isabel while tear ran down cheek must only press old man hand at parting now dear said mr apjohn a went on to house have only said just what have be feeling of course have be stronger with tenant servant than with others round country have be same man if estate belong to personally can do what like with a can with half crown in pocket where land be concerned feeling grow up must not be treated rudely in one sense llanfeare belonged to uncle to do what liked with in sense shared only with around when be induced by theory did not quite understand to bring cousin henry down among people outraged best conviction meant to do duty mr apjohn certainly mistook did not understand root of idea of male heir object have be to keep old family old adherence old acre together england owes much to manner in have be done custom a to male heir have availed much in doing of in case in sticking to custom must have lost spirit a far a be concerned must have gone against practice wished to perpetuate there dear be sermon for of dare say understand word understand syllable of mr apjohn answered soon arrived at house there found not only mr griffith old cook who have never left premise old butler also who have taken off in disgust at cousin henry character have now returned a though there have be no break in continuous service received with triumphant clamour of welcome to coming of cousin henry death of old squire then departure of young mistress have be a though whole world have come to end for to serve be only ambition to serve to be made comfortable while be serving to serve cousin henry be to altogether ignominious old squire have done something though acknowledged to be worse on part than mistake have to be cruelly severe suddenly to be told that be servant to such one a cousin henry servant to such man without contract agreement on part to be handed over like chair table to disreputable clerk from london whom in heart regarded a very much inferior to too like mr griffith tenant have be taught to look for future reign of queen isabel a thing of course in there must have be implied contract understanding on part that have be consulted have agreed to destination of cousin henry now gross evil to to around have be remedied justice be done have be strongly convinced that squire have made have left behind will butler have be quite certain that have be destroyed by cousin henry have sworn that must not stand behind chair of felon gardener have be equally violent have declined even to cut cabbage for cousin henry use woman in house have only suspected have felt sure that something be wrong have doubted between various theory now everything be right now proper owner have come now great trouble have be vanquished llanfeare must once again be fitting home for oh miss isabel oh miss isabel said mr griffith absolutely sobbing at young mistress foot up in bed room did say that must never go on like did use to think that lord almighty must never let go on like that must be that mr henry jones be to remain always landlord of llanfeare when came downstairs took seat a did by chance in old arm chair uncle have be used to occupy mr apjohn preached to sermon rather sang loud paean of irrepressible delight now dear must go leave happily in own house can hardly realise how great joy have be to how great joy be know well how much owe from first moment in intimated to wish to make change in will became so unhappy about a almost to lose rest knew that went beyond what ought to have done in thing said to bore kindly be always kind must turn told what told to day on road have effect on well have nothing to do to obey order did most grudgingly be heartbreak to not only because of dear for sake of property because have heard something of cousin then came rumour of last will must have set about a soon a have left house never told that be going to do never told one be quite certain show how mind must have be at work perhaps what said may have have effect at last then heard from cantor what have be asked to do need not tell felt then must have be better for to send for oh yes so much better for poor young man sake poor young man be of course cousin henry must not interfere must only hear what did hear wait then dear old man died knew then that have made knew that have thought that have done how be one to be sure of vacillating mind of old dying man when searched for one will read other be very sure that cantor have be called upon to witness signature who must doubt a to who have so privately drawn out deed might a privately destroy by degree there grew upon conviction that have not destroyed that still existed that cousin have destroyed latter never quite believed be not man to do brave enough bad enough think not bad enough too small in way altogether yet be clear a sun at noonday that be troubled in conscience shut up in misery not knowing how strong tale own unhappiness told against why did not rejoice in glory of position then said to myself that be conscious of insecurity condition must have be pitiable indeed yes pitied from bottom of heart contumely with be treated by went to heart even after knew that be misbehaving knew that be misbehaving how must only be by hiding will by being conscious that be hidden though be knave be not cunning failed utterly before slightest cunning on part of others when asked whether knew where be hidden told weak lie told truth openly by look of eye be like little girl who pause blush confesses truth before half murmur naughty fib who can be really angry with child who lie after unwilling fashion have to be severe upon till be made clear pitied from bottom of heart have be good to of at last became clear to that uncle have put somewhere then came chance remembrance of sermon used to read by degree hiding place be suggested to when at last welcomed to go search in uncle bed room forbade to touch anything in book room then be convinced have to look along shelf till found set almost knew that have got prize father have told how flew at when attempted to lift hand to book agony of last chance gave moment of courage then father shook document out from among leaf must have be moment of triumph to yes be did feel little proud of success be proud a see sitting there
