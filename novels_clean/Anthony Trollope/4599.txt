christopher dale esq squire of allington owner of three thousand year of proceeded from land of parish now will speak of great house of allington after be not very great be surrounded by much of exquisite nobility of park appurtenance grace habitation of most of old landed proprietor house be very graceful have be built in day of early stuart in style of architecture to give name of tudor on front showed three pointed roof gable a believe must be called between gable thin tall chimney stood two chimney thus raising just above three peak have mentioned think that beauty of house depended much on two chimney on on mullioned window with front of house be closely filled door with jutting porch be by mean in centre of house a entered there be one window on right hand while on left there be three over there be line of five window one taking place above porch know beautiful old tudor window with stout stone mullion stone transom crossing from side to side at point much nearer to top than to bottom of window ever invented be sweetest here at allington think beauty be enhanced by fact that be not regular in shape of window be long window while of be high that to right of door at other extremity of house be among former others have be put in without regard to uniformity long window here high window there with general effect must hardly have be improved then above in three gable be three other smaller aperture also be mullioned entire frontage of house be uniform in style round house there be trim garden not very large worthy of much note in be so trim garden with broad gravel path with one walk running in front of house so broad a to be fitly called terrace though in front of house be sufficiently removed from to allow of coach road running inside to front door dale of allington have always be gardener garden be perhaps more noted in county than other of property outside garden pretension have be made to grandeur of domain pasture round house be pretty field in timber be abundant there be deer park at allington though allington wood be well known formed portion of whole of house be part lay away out of sight full mile from back of house not on account of le avail for fitting preservation of fox house stood much too near road for purpose of grandeur have such purpose ever swelled breast of of squire of allington fancy that idea of rural grandeur have altered since many of older country seat be built to be near village so a in way to afford comfort protection patronage perhaps also with view to pleasantness of neighbourhood for own inmate seemed to be object of gentleman when building house in old day solitude in centre of wide park be now only site can be recognized a eligible cottage must be seen unless cottage orne of gardener village if can not be abolished must be got out of sight sound of church bell be not desirable road on profane vulgar travel by own right must be at distance when old dale of allington built house thought differently there stood church there village pleased with such vicinity sat down close to god to tenant a pas along road from guestwick into village see church near to on left hand house be hidden from road a approach church reaching gate of be not above two hundred yard from high road see full front of great house perhaps best view of be from churchyard lane leading up to church end in gate be entrance into mr dale place there be lodge there gate generally stand open indeed always doe so unless need of cattle grazing within requires that must be closed there be inner gate leading from home paddock through garden to house inner gate thirty yard farther on will take into farm yard perhaps be defect at allington that farm yard be very close to house stable straw yard unwashed cart lazy lingering cattle of homestead be screened off by row of chestnut when in glory of flower in early day of may other row in england can surpass in beauty have one told dale of allington dale former dale that place wanted wood must have pointed with mingled pride disdain to belt of chestnut of church will say fewest possible number of word be church such a there be think thousand in england low incommodious kept with difficulty in repair too often pervious to wet yet strangely picturesque correct too according to great rule of architecture be built with nave aisle visibly in form of cross though with arm clipped down to trunk with separate chancel with large square short tower with bell shaped spire covered with lead irregular in proportion who doe not know low porch perpendicular gothic window flat roofed aisle noble old gray tower of such church a a regard interior be dusty be blocked up with high backed ugly pew gallery in child sat at end of church in two ancient musician blew bassoon be awry looked a though must fall pulpit be ugly useless edifice a high nearly a roof must allow reading desk under hardly permitted parson to keep head free from dangling tassel of cushion above clerk also be there beneath holding third position somewhat elevated upon whole thing there be not quite a must have have nevertheless place looked like church can hardly say so much for modern edifice have be built in day towards glory of god looked like church not le so because in walking up passage between pew visitor trod upon brass plate dignified resting place of departed dale of old below church between village stood vicarage in such position that small garden of vicarage stretched from churchyard down to back of village cottage be pleasant residence newly built within last thirty year creditable to idea of comfort entertained by rich collegiate body from vicar of allington always came doubtless will in course of sojourn at allington visit vicarage now then know that further detailed account of comfort will be necessary to passing by lane leading to vicarage church to house high road descends rapidly to little brook run through village on right a descend will have seen red lion will have seen other house conspicuous in way at bottom close to brook be post office kept surely by crossest old woman in part here road pass through water accommodation of narrow

village baker life here that respectable woman mr frummage who sell ribbon toy soap straw bonnet with many other thing too long to mention here too life apothecary whom veneration of neighbouring parish have raised to dignity of doctor here also in smallest prettiest cottage can be imagined life mr hearn widow of former vicar on term however with neighbour squire regret to say be not a friendly a must be beyond lady modest residence allington street for so road be called turn suddenly round towards church at point of turn be pretty low iron railing with gate with covered way lead up to front door of house stand there will only say here at fag end of chapter that be small house at allington allington street a have said turn short round towards church at point there end at white

pearl of allington mr crosbie be only mere clerk sarcastic condemnation be spoken by miss lilian dale to sister isabella referred to gentleman with whom will have much concern in page say that mr crosbie will be hero seeing that part in drama will be cut up a be into fragment of magnificent may be produced will be diluted apportioned out in very moderate quantity among two more probably among

of allington mr fanfaron be lawyer who have made way over to allington during last assize might a well say that lord de guest be mere earl so be only mere earl have ever done anything except have fat ox one must say so know what mean by mere clerk be much in man to be in public office yet mr crosbie give air suppose that mr crosbie be same a john eames said bell who by tone of voice did not seem inclined to undervalue qualification of mr crosbie now john eames be young man from guestwick who have be appointed to clerkship in income tax office with eighty pound year two year ago then johnny eames be mere clerk said lily mr crosbie be after bell what be mr crosbie if be not mere clerk of course be older than john eames a have be longer at suppose have more than eighty pound year be not in mr crosbie confidence be in general committee office know believe have pretty nearly management of whole of have heard bernard say that have six seven young men under of course know what doe at office will tell what be bell mr crosbie be swell lilian dale be right mr crosbie be swell here may perhaps best explain who bernard be who be mr crosbie captain bernard dale be officer in corp of engineer be first cousin of two girl who have be speaking be nephew presumptive to squire father colonel dale mother lady fanny dale be still living at effete invalid listless couple pretty well dead to world beyond region of torquay card table be who have made for career in nineteenth dragoon did by eloping with penniless daughter of impoverished earl lord de guest after conclusion of event circumstance have not afforded opportunity of making conspicuous have gone on declining gradually in world esteem for world have esteemed when first made good running with lady fanny till now in slippered year lady fanny be unknown except among torquay bath chair card table elder brother be still hearty man walking in thick shoe constant in saddle colonel with nothing beyond wife title to keep body awake have fallen asleep somewhat prematurely among slipper of of lady fanny bernard dale be only son daughter have have be dead married one living with among card table of parent bernard have latterly not seen much not more be than duty due attention to fifth commandment required of also be making career for having obtained commission in engineer being known to compeer a nephew of earl a heir to property of three thousand year when say that bernard dale be not inclined to throw away of advantage by mean intend to speak in dispraise advantage of being heir to good property be so manifest advantage over beyond be merely fiscal that man think of throwing away expects man to do so money in possession in expectation do give set to head confidence to voice assurance to man will help much in walk in life if owner of will simply use not abuse for bernard dale will say that did not often talk of uncle earl be conscious that uncle be earl that other men knew fact knew that must not otherwise have be elected at beaufort at most aristocratic of little club called sebright when noble blood be called in question never alluded specially to own knew how to speak a one of whom world be

on till have almost achieved reputation of talent name have become known among scientific experimentalists not a of one who have invented cannon antidote to cannon a of man understanding in cannon well fitted to look at invented by others who must honestly test that antidote if not honestly seeing that such thin minded men can hardly go to proof of matter without pre judgment in mind at rate with such appearance of honesty that world might be satisfied in way captain dale be employed much at home about london be not called on to build barrack in nova scotia to make road in punjaub be small slight man smaller than uncle in face very like have same eye nose chin same mouth forehead be better le high pointed better formed about brow then wore moustache somewhat hid thinness of mouth

summer for a yet month of july be not past intimate friend adolphus crosbie who be be not mere clerk a reader may choose to form own opinion on matter be guest in house with be inclined to say that adolphus crosbie be not mere clerk think that must have be so called even by lily dale have not given sign to that be swell now man in becoming swell swell of such order a must possibly be known to lily dale must have ceased to be mere clerk in very process moreover captain dale must not have be damon to pythia of whom might fairly be said that be mere clerk must mere clerk have got in at beaufort at sebright evidence against former assertion made by lily dale be very strong then evidence a to latter assertion be a strong mr crosbie certainly be swell be true that be clerk in general committee office then in first place general committee office be situated in whitehall whereas poor john eames be forced to travel daily from lodging in burton crescent ever so far beyond russell square to dingy room in somerset house adolphus crosbie when very young have be private secretary have afterwards mounted up in office to quasi authority senior clerkship bringing in seven hundred year giving status among assistant secretary like even in official point of view be something triumph of adolphus crosbie have be other than not because have be intimate with assistant secretary be allowed in whitehall room to with arm chair must have be entitled to stand upon rug at sebright speak while rich men listened rich men men also who have handle to name adolphus crosbie have done more than make minute with discretion on paper of general committee office have set down before gate of city of fashion have taken by storm perhaps to speak with more propriety have picked lock let in in walk of life be somebody in man at west end who did not know who be adolphus crosbie knew nothing say that be intimate friend of many great men even great men acknowledged acquaintance of adolphus crosbie be to be seen in drawing room at rate on staircase of cabinet minister lilian dale dear lily dale for reader must know that be to be very dear that story will be nothing to if love lily dale lilian dale have discovered that mr crosbie be swell be bound to say that mr crosbie did not habitually proclaim fact in offensive manner in becoming swell have become altogether bad fellow be not to be expected that man who be petted at sebright must carry in allington drawing room a must johnny eames who have never be petted by one mother fraction of hero of ours have other advantage to back over beyond fashion have given be tall well looking man with pleasant eye expressive mouth man whom must probably observe in room might meet knew how to talk have in something justified talking be butterfly dandy who flew about in world sun warmed into prettiness by sunbeam crosbie have opinion on thing on politics on religion on philanthropic tendency of age have read something here there a formed opinion perhaps might have done better in world have not be placed so early in life in whitehall public office there be that in might have earned better bread for in open profession in matter of bread fate of adolphus crosbie have by time be decided for have reconciled to fate be now inexorable very slight patrimony hundred year so have fallen to share beyond that have salary from office nothing else on income thus made up have lived a bachelor in london enjoying london must give a man in moderately easy circumstance looking forward to costly luxury such a wife house of own stable full of horse did enjoy of good thing of world must if known to john eames have made appear fabulously rich in eye of brother clerk lodging in mount street be elegant in belonging during three month of season in london called master of very neat hack be always well dressed though never over dressed at club must live on equal term with men having ten time income be not married have acknowledged to that must not marry without money must not marry for money have put aside from a not within reach comfort of marriage will not however at present moment inquire more curiously into private life circumstance of new friend adolphus crosbie after sentence pronounced against by lilian two girl remained silent for awhile bell be perhaps little angry with sister be not often that allowed to say much in praise of gentleman now that have spoken word two in favour of mr crosbie felt to be rebuked by sister for unwonted enthusiasm lily be at work on drawing in minute two have forgotten about mr crosbie injury remained on bell mind prompted to go back to subject like slang word lily what slang word know what called bernard friend oh swell fancy do like slang think be awfully jolly to talk about thing being jolly only that be afraid of nerve must have called stunning be so slow know to use nothing word out of dictionary think be nice in talking of gentleman be well 'd like to be nice if knew how if knew how there be knowing how for girl in matter if nature mother have not done for there be hope for on head think may say that nature mother have be sufficiently efficacious for lilian dale in respect mr crosbie be at rate gentleman know how to make pleasant be meant mamma said great deal more about than did mr crosbie be apollo always look upon apollo a greatest know what that ever lived must say word because apollo be gentleman at moment while name of god be still on lip high open window of drawing room be darkened bernard entered followed by mr crosbie who be talking about apollo said captain dale girl be stricken dumb how must be with if mr crosbie have heard spoken of in last word of poor lily be rashness of bell be ever accusing sister here be result in truth bernard have heard nothing more than name mr crosbie who have be behind have heard nothing 'as sweet musical a bright apollo lute strung with hair ' said mr crosbie not meaning much by quotation perceiving that two girl have be in way put out silenced what very bad music must have made said lily unless indeed hair be very different from ours be sunbeam suggested bernard by time apollo have served turn lady welcomed guest in proper form mamma be in garden said bell with hypocritical pretence so common with young lady when young gentleman call a though be aware that mamma be object specially sought picking pea with sun bonnet on said lily let by mean go help said mr crosbie then issued out into garden garden of great house of allington of small house open on to other proper boundary of thick laurel hedge wide ditch of iron spike guarding ditch there be between over wide ditch there be foot bridge at bridge there be gate have key for purpose of enjoyment garden of house be open to other garden of small house be very pretty small house be so near road that there be nothing between dining room window iron rail narrow edge rather than border little path made with round fixed cobble stone not above two foot broad into one gardener ever make way distance from road to house be not above five six foot entrance from gate be shut in by covered way garden behind house on to window from drawing room open be to sens a private a though there be village of allington road up to church within hundred yard of lawn steeple of church indeed can be seen from lawn peering a be between yew tree stand in corner of churchyard adjoining to mr dale wall none of dale family have objection to sight of steeple glory of small house at allington certainly consists in lawn be a smooth a level a much like velvet a grass have ever yet be made to look lily dale taking pride in own lawn have declared often that be good attempting to play croquet up at great house grass say grows in tuft nothing hopkins gardener can will do have effect upon tuft there be tuft at small house a squire have never be very enthusiastic about croquet croquet implement have be moved permanently down to small house croquet there have become quite institution while be on subject of garden may also mention mr dale conservatory a to bell be strenuously of opinion that great house have nothing to offer equal to for flower of course mean must say correcting for at great house there be grapery very celebrated on matter squire must be le tolerant than a regarded croquet must tell niece that knew nothing about flower perhaps not uncle christopher must say same like geranium best for there be spice of obstinacy about miss dale a indeed there be in dale male female young old may be a well to explain that care of lawn of conservatory indeed of entire garden belonging to small house be in hand of hopkins head gardener to great house be so simply for reason mr dale must not afford to keep gardener working lad at ten shilling week who cleaned knife shoe dug ground be only male attendant on three lady hopkins head gardener of allington who have men under be a widely awake to lawn conservatory of humbler establishment a be to grapery peach wall terrace of grander one in eye be one place small house belonged to master a indeed did very furniture within be lent not let to mr dale hopkins perhaps did not love mr dale seeing that owed no duty a one born dale two young lady did love also snubbed in very peremptory way sometimes to mr dale be coldly civil always referring to squire if direction worthy of special notice a concerning garden be given to will serve to explain term on mr dale be living at small house matter needful of explanation sooner later husband have be youngest of three brother in many respect brightest early in life have gone up to london there have done well a land surveyor have done so well that government have employed for three four year have enjoyed large income death have come suddenly on while be only yet ascending ladder when died have hardly begun to realize golden prospect have seen before have happened fifteen year before story commenced so that two girl hardly retained memory of father for first five year of widowhood mr dale who have never be favourite of squire lived with two little girl in such modest way a very limited mean allowed old mr dale squire mother then occupied small house when old mr dale died squire offered place rent free to sister in law intimating to that daughter must obtain considerable social advantage by living at allington have accepted offer social advantage have certainly followed mr dale be poor whole income not exceeding three hundred year therefore own style of living be of necessity very unassuming saw girl becoming popular in county much liked by family around enjoying nearly advantage must have accrued to have be daughter of squire dale of allington under such circumstance be little to whether be loved by brother in law respected by hopkins own girl loved respected be pretty much that demanded of world on own behalf uncle christopher have be very good to girl in own obstinate somewhat ungracious manner there be two pony in stable of great house be allowed to ride unless on occasion nobody else did ride think might have given pony to girl thought differently contributed to dress sending home now again thing thought necessary not in pleasantest way in world money never gave did make promise be dale loved with christopher dale to love once be to love always bell be chief favourite sharing with nephew bernard best warmth of heart about two have project intending that bell must be future mistress of great house of allington a to project however miss dale be a yet in very absolute ignorance may now think go back to four friend a walked out upon lawn be understood to be on mission to assist mr dale in picking of pea pleasure intervened in way of business young people forgetting labour of elder allowed to be carried away by fascination of croquet iron hoop stick be fixed mallet ball be lying about then party be so nicely made up have have game of croquet yet said mr crosbie can not be said that have lost much time seeing that have only arrived before dinner on preceding day then mallet be in hand in moment will play side of course said lily bernard will play together be not allowed lily be well known to be queen of croquet ground a bernard be supposed to be more efficient than friend lily have to take mr crosbie a partner apollo ca get through hoop lily said afterwards to sister then how gracefully fails to do lily however have be beaten may therefore be excused for little spite against partner so turned out that before mr crosbie took final departure from allington must get through hoop lily though be still queen of croquet ground have to acknowledge male sovereign in dominion be not way played at said crosbie at one point of game then stopped where be that said bernard place be at last summer in shropshire then play game mr crosbie at place be at last summer in shropshire said lily mean lady hartletop said bernard now marchioness of hartletop be very great person indeed leader in fashionable world oh lady hartletop said lily then suppose must give in little bit of sarcasm be not lost upon mr crosbie be put down by in tablet of mind a quite undeserved have endeavoured to avoid mention of lady hartletop croquet ground ladyship name have be forced upon nevertheless liked lily dale through thought that liked bell best though said little for bell be beauty of family during game bernard remembered that have especially come over to bid three lady to dinner at house on day have dined there on day before girl uncle have now sent direction to to come again will go ask mamma about said bell who be out first then returned saying that sister must obey uncle behest that mother must prefer to remain at home there be pea to be eaten know said lily send up to great house said bernard hopkins must not allow said lily call that mixing of thing hopkins doe like mixing then when game be over sauntered about out of small garden into larger one through shrubbery out upon field where found still lingering remnant of haymaking lily took rake raked for two minute mr crosbie making attempt to pitch hay into cart have to pay crown for footing to haymaker bell sat quiet under tree mindful of complexion whereupon mr crosbie finding hay pitching not much to taste threw under same tree also quite after manner of apollo a lily said to mother late in evening then bernard covered lily with hay be great feat in jocose way for lily in returning compliment almost smothered mr crosbie by accident oh lily said bell be sure beg pardon mr crosbie be bernard fault bernard never will come into hayfield with again so became very intimate while bell sat quietly under tree listening to word two now then a mr crosbie chose to speak there be kind of enjoyment to be have in society in very few word be necessary bell be le vivacious than sister lily when hour after be dressing for dinner acknowledged that have passed pleasant afternoon though mr crosbie have not said very much chapter iii widow dale of allington a mr dale of small house be not dale by birth there can be necessity for insisting on fact that none of dale peculiarity must be sought for in character peculiarity be not perhaps very conspicuous in daughter who have taken more in respect from mother than from father close observer might recognize girl a dale be constant perhaps obstinate occasionally little uncharitable in judgment prone to think that there be great deal in being dale though not prone to say much about have also better pride than have come to a mother heritage mr dale be certainly proud woman not that there be anything appertaining to herself in took pride in birth have be much lower than husband seeing that grandfather have be almost nobody fortune have be considerable for rank in life on proceeds now mainly depended have not be sufficient to give of pride of wealth have be beauty according to taste be still very lovely certainly at time of life widow of fifteen year standing with two grown up daughter took pride in beauty have conscious pride in fact that be lady that be lady inwards outwards from crown of head to sole of foot in head in heart in mind lady by education lady by nature lady also by birth in spite of deficiency respecting grandfather hereby state a fact meo periculo squire though have special love for have recognized in respect treated a equal position be one required that must either be very proud else very humble be poor yet daughter moved in position belongs a rule to daughter of rich men only did a niece of childless squire of allington a niece felt that be entitled to accept countenance kindness without loss of self respect to to must have ill done duty a mother to have allowed pride of own to come between such advantage in world a uncle might be able to give on behalf have accepted loan of house in lived use of many of appurtenance belonging to brother in law on own account have accepted nothing marriage with philip dale have be disliked by brother squire squire while philip be still living have continued to show that feeling in respect be not to be overcome never have be overcome now though brother in law sister in law have be close neighbour for year living a one may say almost in same family have never become friend there have not be word of quarrel between met constantly squire have unconsciously come to entertain profound respect for brother widow widow have acknowledged to herself truth of affection shown by uncle to daughter yet have never come together

roper boarding house illustration untitled have said that john eames have be petted by none mother must not have supposed on account john eames have friend there be class of young men who never get petted though may not be le esteemed perhaps loved come forth to world a apollo shine at keeping what light may have for inward purpose such young men be often awkward ungainly not yet formed in gait straggle with limb be shy word come to with ease when word be required among accustomed associate social meeting be period of penance to appearance in public will unnerve go much about alone blush when woman speak to in truth be not a yet men whatever number may be of year a be no longer boy world have found for ungraceful name of hobbledehoy such observation however a have be enabled to make on matter have led to believe that hobbledehoy be by mean least valuable specie of human race when compare hobbledehoy of one two twenty to finished apollo of same age regard former a unripe fruit latter a fruit be ripe then come question a to two fruit be better fruit that ripens early be perhaps favoured with little forcing apparatus at least be backed by warmth of southern wall that fruit of slower growth a to nature work without assistance on sun operates in own time perhaps never operates if ungenial shade have be allowed to interpose world doubt be in favour of forcing apparatus of southern wall fruit come certainly at assured period be spotless speckle of certain quality by mean despicable owner have when want serf turn nevertheless according to thinking fullest flavour of sun be given to other fruit be given in sun own good time if so be that ungenial shade have interposed like smack of natural growth like perhaps better because have be obtained have be obtained without favour hobbledehoy though blush when woman address be uneasy even when be near though be not master of limb in ball room be hardly master of tongue at time be most eloquent of being especially eloquent among beautiful woman enjoys triumph of don juan without of don juan heartlessness be able to conquer in encounter through force of wit sweetness of voice eloquence be heard only by own inner ear triumph be triumph of imagination true hobbledehoy be much alone not being greatly given to social intercourse even with other hobbledehoy trait in character think have hardly be sufficiently observed by world at large have probably become hobbledehoy instead of apollo because circumstance have not afforded much social intercourse therefore wanders about in solitude taking long walk in dream of success be so far removed from power of achievement out in field with stick in hand be very eloquent cutting off head of springing summer weed a practises oratory with energy thus feed imagination for who know give scanty credit unconsciously prepares for latter ripening if only ungenial shade will day cease to interpose such hobbledehoy receive little petting unless be from mother hobbledehoy be john eames when be sent away from guestwick to begin life in big room of public office in london may say that there be nothing of young apollo about yet be not without friend friend who wished well thought much of welfare have younger sister who loved dearly who have idea that be hobbledehoy being somewhat of hobbledehoya mr eames mother be widow living in small house in guestwick whose husband have be throughout whole life intimate friend of squire have be man of many misfortune having begun world almost with affluence having ended in poverty have lived day in guestwick having at one time occupied large tract of land lost much money in experimental farming late in life have taken small house on outskirt of town there have died two year previously to commencement of story with other man have mr dale lived on term so intimate when mr eames died mr dale acted a executor under will a guardian to child have moreover obtained for john eames that situation under crown now held mr eames have be still be on very friendly term with mr dale squire have never taken quite kindly to mr eames whom husband have not met till be already past forty year of age mr dale have made up by kindness to poor forlorn woman for lack of cordiality might have be shown to from great house mr eames be poor forlorn woman forlorn even during time of husband life very wobegone now in widowhood in matter of importance squire have be kind to arranging for little money affair advising about house income also getting for appointment for son snubbed when met poor mr eames held in great awe mr dale held brother in law in awe sometimes gave to widow from guestwick advice quite at variance to given by squire in way there have grown up intimacy between bell lily young eames of girl be prepared to declare that johnny eames be own well loved friend nevertheless spoke of occasionally with little dash of merriment a be not unusual with pretty girl who have hobbledehoy among intimate friend who be not unaccustomed to grace of apollo may a well announce at once john eames when went up to london be absolutely irretrievably in love with lily dale have declared passion in most moving language hundred time have declared only to have written much poetry about lily kept line safe under double lock key when gave rein to imagination flattered that might win not only world at large also by verse must have perished rather than exhibit to human eye during last ten week of life at guestwick while be preparing for career in london hung about allington walking over frequently then walking back again in vain during visit must sit in mr dale drawing room speaking little addressing usually to mother on occasion a started on long hot walk resolved that must say something by lily might know of love when left for london that something have not be said have not dreamed of asking to be wife john eames be about to begin world with eighty pound year allowance of twenty more from mother purse be well aware that with income must not establish a married man in london also felt that man who might be fortunate enough to win lily for wife must be prepared to give soft luxury that world must afford knew well that ought not to expect assurance of lily love nevertheless thought possible that might give assurance of love must probably be in vain have real hope unless when be in one of poetic mood have acknowledged to in indistinct way that be no more than hobbledehoy awkward silent ungainly with face unfinished a be unripe knew knew also that there be apollo in world who must be only too ready to carry off lily in splendid car not le did make up mind that having loved once behoved a true man to love on to end one little word have said to when parted have be word of friendship rather than of love have strayed out after on to lawn leaving bell alone in drawing room perhaps lily have understood something of boy feeling have wished to speak kindly to at parting almost more than kindly there be silent love woman recognize in silent way acknowledge giving gracious silent thanks for respect accompanies have come to say good by lily said johnny eames following girl down one of path good by john said turning round know how sorry be to lose be great thing for to be going up to london well yes suppose be 'd sooner remain here though what stay here doing nothing be sure must not of course must like to do something mean mean that be painful to part with old friend be sure that feel that at parting with will have holiday sometimes then will see yes of course will see then think lily will care more about seeing than anybody oh john there will be own mother sister yes there will be mother mary of course will come over here very first day be if will care to see will care to see very much know dear john do hope will be happy there be tone in voice a spoke almost upset must rather say almost put up upon leg made speak ultimate effect be le powerful do said a held hand for few happy second be sure hope will always be happy good by lily then left returning to house continued walk wandering down among tree in shrubbery not showing for next half hour how many girl have such lover a lover who say more to than johnny eames then said to lily dale who never say more than yet when in after year count over name of who have loved name of awkward youth be never forgotten that farewell have be spoken nearly two year since lily dale be then seventeen since time john eames have be home once during month holiday have often visited allington have never improved upon occasion of have told have seemed to that lily be colder to than in old day have become if anything more shy in way with be to return to guestwick again during autumn to tell honestly truth in matter lily dale did not think care very much for coming girl of nineteen care for lover of one twenty unless be when fruit have have advantage of forcing apparatus southern wall john eames love be still a hot a ever having be sustained on poetry kept alive perhaps by close confidence in ear of brother clerk be not to be supposed that during two year have be melancholy lover might perhaps have be better for have disposition led to line of life such however have not be case have already abandoned flute on have learned to sound three sad note before left guestwick after fifth sixth sunday have relinquished solitary walk along towing path of regent park canal to think of one absent love be very sweet becomes monotonous after mile two of towing path mind will turn away to aunt sally cremorne garden

now mr roper be respectable lady who kept boarding house in burton crescent to whom mr eames have be strongly recommended when be desirous of finding specially safe domicile for son for first year of life in london john eames have lived alone in lodging have resulted in discomfort solitude ala in amount of debt have come heavily on poor widow now for second year safer mode of life be necessary

give latch key well always do ask for wo insist if tell have rather that must have one mr roper promised accordingly johnny eames be left under charge did ask for latch key mr roper answered a be bidden asked again having be sophisticated by philosophy of cradell then mr roper handed key be woman who plumed on being a good a word not understanding that one must justly demand from more than that gave johnny eames key a doubtless have intended to do for mr roper knew world understood that young men without latch key must not remain with thought did seem to find so dull since amelia came home said cradell amelia what be amelia to have told everything cradell yet can talk to about amelia roper come now johnny have always be called johnny name have gone with to office even amelia roper have called johnny on more than one occasion before be a sweet to other night a though there be such person a l d in existence john eames turned away shook head nevertheless word of friend be grateful to character of don juan be not unpleasant to imagination liked to think that might amuse amelia roper with passing word though heart be true to lilian dale in truth however many more of passing word have be spoken by fair amelia than by mr roper have be quite a good a word when told mr eames that household be composed of herself of son who be in attorney office of ancient maiden cousin named miss spruce who lodged with of mr cradell divine amelia have not then be living with nature of statement be making by mean compelled to inform mr eames that young lady must probably return home in

of second weaker passion for amelia be fine girl deuced fine girl johnny eames have said using style of language have learned since left guestwick allington mr cradell also be admirer of fair sex ala must say so mr lupex at present moment be object of admiration not that entertained slightest idea of wronging mr lupex man who be scene painter knew world mr cradell admired mr lupex a connoisseur not simply a man by heaven johnny what figure woman have said one morning a be walking to office yes stand well on pin must think did if understand anything of form said cradell that woman be nearly perfect what torso have from expression from fact that mr lupex depended greatly upon stay crinoline for such figure a succeeded in displaying may perhaps be understood that mr cradell did not understand much about form seems to that nose be quite straight said johnny eames now undoubtedly be fact that nose on mr lupex face be little awry be long thin nose a progressed forward into air certainly have preponderating bias towards left side care more for figure than face said cradell mr lupex have fine eye very fine eye know how to use too said johnny why must then have lovely hair

suppose must ask mistake if one be to love girl be good one going on in way be much good certainly said johnny eames then reached door of income tax office went away to own desk from little dialogue may be imagined that though mr roper be a good a word be not exactly woman whom mr eames must have wished to select a protecting angel for son truth take to be that protecting angel for widow son at forty eight pound year paid quarterly be not to be found very readily in london mr roper be not worse than others of class must much have preferred lodger who be respectable to who be not so if must

morning how maternal heart be rejoicing at seeing improvement in gait manliness of appearance imparted to by whisker need not describe at length many of attribute of hobbledehoy have fallen from even lily dale might now probably acknowledge that be no longer boy might be regarded a good if only in putting off childish thing have taken up thing be better than childish on very first day of arrival made way over to allington did not walk on occasion a have used to do in old happy day have idea that might not be well for to go into mr dale drawing room with dust of road on boot heat of day on brow so borrowed horse rode over taking pride in pair of spur have bought in piccadilly in kid glove be brought out new for occasion ala ala fear that two year in london have not improved john eames yet have to acknowledge john eames be one of hero of story on entering mr dale drawing room found mr dale eldest daughter lily at moment be not there a shook hand with other two of course asked for be only in garden said bell will be here directly have walked across to great house with mr crosbie said mr dale be not going to remain will be so glad to see john expected to day did said johnny whose heart have be plunged into cold water at mention of mr crosbie name have be thinking of lilian dale ever since friend have left on railway platform a beg to assure lady who may read tale truth of love for lily have moulted no feather through unholy liaison between miss roper fear that will be disbelieved in be so heart be ever have be true to lilian although have allowed to be talked into declaration of affection by creature a amelia roper have be thinking of meeting with lily night throughout morning now heard that be walking alone about garden with strange gentleman mr crosbie be very grand very fashionable have heard knew more of why must mr crosbie be allowed to walk with lily dale why must mr dale mention circumstance a though be quite thing of course such mystery a there be in be solved very quickly be sure lily wo object to telling such dear friend a have happened said mr dale be engaged to be married to mr crosbie water into johnny heart have be plunged now closed over head left speechless lily dale be engaged to be married to mr crosbie knew that must have spoken when heard tidings knew that moment of silence a passed by told secret to two woman before that secret must now behove to conceal from world yet must not speak be very well pleased at match said mr dale wishing to spare nothing can be nicer than mr crosbie said bell have often talked about will be so happy to know wo know much about said johnny even in speaking few senseless word word uttered because be necessary that must say something tone of voice be altered must have given world to have be master of at moment felt that be utterly vanquished there be lily coming across lawn said mr dale then 'd better go said eames say anything about pray then without waiting for word escaped out of drawing room chapter vi beautiful day be well aware have not a yet given description of bell lilian dale equally well aware that longer doing so be postponed greater difficulty becomes wish must be understood without description that be two pretty fair haired girl of whom bell be tallest prettiest whereas lily be almost a pretty a sister perhaps be more attractive be fair haired girl very like other of whom have before mind eye distinct portrait fear will not be able to draw in such manner a will make distinct to others be something below usual height being slight slender in proportion lily be shorter of two difference be so trifling that be hardly remembered unless two be together when said that bell be prettier must perhaps have spoken more justly have simply declared that feature be more regular than sister two girl be very fair so that soft tint of colour relieved whiteness of complexion be rather acknowledged than distinctly seen be there telling own tale of health a absence must have told tale of present coming sickness yet nobody must ever talk about colour in cheek hair of two girl be so alike in hue texture that one not even mother must say that there be difference be not flaxen hair yet be very light did approach to auburn yet there ran through golden tint gave distinct brightness of own with bell be more plentiful than with lily therefore lily must always talk of own scanty lock tell how beautiful be belonging to sister nevertheless lily head be quite a lovely a sister for form be perfect simple braid in wore hair did not require great exuberance in quantity eye be brightly blue bell be long soft tender often hardly daring to raise to face while of lily be rounder brighter seldom kept by want of courage from fixing where pleased lily face be perhaps le oval in form le perfectly oval than sister shape of forehead be think same with chin be something more slender delicate bell chin be unmarked whereas on sister there be dimple amply compensated for other deficiency in beauty bell teeth be more even than sister then showed teeth more frequently lip be thinner a can not think le expressive nose be decidedly more regular in beauty for lily nose be somewhat broader than must have be may therefore be understood that bell must be considered beauty by family there be perhaps more in general impression made by girl in whole tone of appearance than in absolute loveliness of feature grace of figure there be about dignity of demeanour devoid of stiffness pride maidenly modesty gave air in be always apparent that sense of security woman must receive from unconscious dependence on own mingled purity weakness two girl be never afraid of men never looked a though be so afraid may say that have little cause for kind of fear to allude might be lot of of to be ill used by man be hardly possible that of must ever be insulted by one lily a may perhaps have be already seen must be full of play in play never so carried that one must forget what be due to now lily dale be engaged to be married day of playfulness be over sound sad sentence against fear that must be regarded a true when think that be true when see that sportiveness kitten like gambol of girlhood must be over generally be over when girl have given troth becomes matter of regret to that feminine world must be in such hurry after matrimony have however remedy to offer for evil indeed be aware that evil if there be evil be not well expressed in word have used hurry be not for matrimony for love then love once attained matrimony seizes for own evil be accomplished lily dale be engaged to be married to adolphus crosbie to apollo crosbie a still called confiding little joke to own ear to be apollo a man who be loved must be to girl who love be handsome graceful clever self confident always cheerful when asked to be cheerful have also more serious moment must talk to of serious matter must read to explain to thing have hitherto be too hard for young intelligence voice too be pleasant well under command must be pathetic if pathos be required ring with laughter a merry a own be not such man fit to be apollo to girl when once girl have acknowledged to herself that loved have acknowledged to herself have acknowledged to a reader will perhaps say without much delay courtship have so be carried on delay have be needed world have smiled upon when mr crosbie have first come among at allington a bernard guest during few day of early visit have seemed a though bell have be chiefly noticed by bell in own quiet way have accepted admiration saying nothing of thinking very little lily be heart free at time have ever be so no first shadow from love wing have a yet be thrown across pure tablet of bosom with bell be not so not so in absolute strictness bell story too must be told not on page before crosbie have come among be thing fixed in mind that such love a have felt must be overcome annihilated may say that have be overcome annihilated that must have sinned in way have listened to vow from new apollo be almost sad to think that man might have have love of of such girl fear that must acknowledge that be so apollo in plenitude of power soon changed mind before end of first visit have transferred distant homage be then paying from elder to younger sister afterwards returned a squire guest for longer sojourn among at end of first month have already be accepted a lily future husband be beautiful to see how bell changed in mood towards crosbie towards sister a soon a perceived how affair be going be not long in perceiving having caught first glimpse of idea on evening when dined at great house leaving mother alone to eat to neglect pea for six seven week crosbie have be gone during time bell have be much more open in speaking of than sister have be present when crosbie have bid good by have listened to eagerness a declared to lily that must soon be back again at allington lily have taken very quietly a though have not belonged at to herself bell have seen something of truth believing in crosbie a earnest honest man have spoken kind word of fostering little aptitude for love might already have formed in lily bosom be such apollo know lily have said be gentleman can see oh yes man ca be apollo unless be gentleman be very clever suppose be clever there be nothing more said about being mere clerk indeed lily have changed mind on subject johnny eames be mere clerk whereas crosbie if be to be called clerk at be clerk of very special denomination there may be great difference between one clerk clerk of council parish clerk be very different person lily have got such idea a into head a attempted in own mind to rescue mr crosbie from lower order of government service wish be not coming mr dale have said to eldest daughter think be wrong mamma if must become fond of then lily will never become really fond of man till will have given proper reason if admires why must not come together be so young bell be nineteen if be engaged perhaps might wait for year so be good talking in way mamma if be to tell lily not to give encouragement must not speak to must not think of interfering mamma therefore must take course for like mr crosbie very much so do dear so doe uncle must have lily take lover of uncle choosing must hope not must be considered good thing if happens to choose one of liking in way matter have be talked over between mother elder daughter then mr crosbie have come before end of first month declared admiration for lily have proved correctness of sister foresight during short courtship have gone well with lover squire from first have declared satisfied with match informing mr dale in cold manner that mr crosbie be gentleman with income sufficient for matrimony must be close enough in london mr dale have said have more than brother have when married said squire if will only make a happy a brother made while lasted said mr dale a turned away face to conceal tear be coming then there be nothing more said about between squire sister in law squire spoke word a to assistance in money matter did not even suggest that must lend hand to young people at starting a uncle in position might surely have done may well be conceived that mr dale herself said nothing on subject indeed may be conceived also that squire let intention be what might must not divulge to mr dale be uncomfortable position be one be well understood between bernard dale be still at allington have remained there through period of crosbie absence whatever word mr dale might choose to speak on matter must probably be spoken to then bernard must be quite a close a uncle when crosbie returned bernard have of course lived much together a be natural there came to be close discussion between a to two girl when crosbie allowed to be understood that liking for lily be becoming strong know suppose that uncle wish to marry elder one bernard have said have guessed a much suppose match will come off be pretty girl a good a gold yes be pretend to be very much in love with be not way know of day will ask to have suppose will go right governor have distinctly promised to allow eight hundred year off estate to take in for three month year if wish told simply must do for le agreed with get on very well together oh yes there be never be fal lal between about love duty think understand other be everything know comfort of standing well with heir know comfort of standing well with owner must be admitted think that there be great deal of sound common sense about bernard dale what will do for younger sister asked crosbie a asked important question close observer might have perceived that there be slight tremor in voice ah be more than can tell if be must ask governor be plain man like plain business suppose must ask think must be belief that will not let go by mean empty handed well must suppose not remember crosbie can say nothing to on be to depend lily also be a good a gold a seem to be fond of must ask governor if be in so many word what intends to do of course be against interest for shilling give lily will ultimately come out of pocket be not man to care about that a know what might be crosbie knowledge on subject will not here inquire may say that must have mattered very little to out of whose pocket money came so long a went into own when felt quite sure of lily having in fact received lily permission to speak to uncle lily promise that must herself speak to mother did tell squire what be intention did in open manly way a though felt that in asking for much also offered to give much have nothing to say against said squire have permission to consider a engaged to if have hers mother of course be aware have authority over must not marry without sanction be very good to think so much of uncle said squire word a spoke sounded very cold in crosbie ear after crosbie said nothing about money having to confess to that be afraid to do so what must be use said to wishing to make excuse for what felt to be weak in own conduct if must refuse to give shilling must not go back from now then idea ran across mind a to injustice to men be subjected in matter of matrimony man have to declare before be fitting that must make inquiry about lady money then when have declared such inquiry be unavailing consideration somewhat cooled ardour of happiness lily dale be very pretty very nice very refreshing in innocence purity quick intelligence amusement must be more deliciously amusing than of making love to lily dale way of flattering lover without intention of flattery on part have put crosbie into seventh heaven in experience have known nothing like may be sure of have said will love with heart strength be very nice then what be to live upon must be that adolphus crosbie must settle down on north side of new road a married man with eight hundred year if indeed squire must be a good to lily a have promised to be to bell then indeed thing might be made to arrange there be such drawback on lily happiness idea about money be rather vague be very honest knew have none of own supposed be husband duty to find what must be needful knew have none of own be therefore aware that ought not to expect luxury in little household be to be prepared for hoped for sake that uncle might give assistance be quite prepared to prove that must be good poor man wife in old colloquy on such matter between sister have always declared that decent income must be considered a indispensable before love must be entertained eight hundred year have be considered a doing much more than fulfilling stipulation bell have have high flown notion a to absolute glory of poverty have declared that income must not be considered at if have loved man must allow to be engaged to even though have income such have be theory a regarded money lily be quite contented with way in have carried out own in beautiful day there be nothing to check happiness mother sister united in telling that have done well that be happy in choice justified in love on first day when told mother have be made exquisitely blissful by way in tidings have be received oh mamma must tell something said coming up to mother bedroom after long ramble with mr crosbie through allington field be about mr crosbie yes mamma then rest have be said through medium of warm embrace happy tear rather than by word a sat in mother room hiding face on mother shoulder bell have come have knelt at foot dear lily have said be so glad then lily remembered how have a be stolen lover from sister put arm round bell neck kissed knew how be going to be from very first said bell did not mamma be sure did said lily never thought thing be possible did mamma did said lily bell told that be to be so said mr dale must hardly bring at first to think that be good enough for darling oh mamma must not say that must think that be good enough for anything will think that be very good who must be better then when remember that be to give up for sake what can do for in return what have got to give mr dale bell must look at matter in light thinking that lily gave quite a much a received declared that crosbie be perfect knowing by such assurance only must now administer to lily happiness lily between be made perfect in happiness receiving manner of encouragement in love being nourished in passion by sympathy approval of mother sister then have come that visit from johnny eames a poor fellow marched out of room giving time to say farewell mr dale bell looked at other sadly be unable to concoct arrangement for lily have run across lawn be already on ground before window a soon a got to end of shrubbery there be uncle christopher bernard close to so told adolphus might go on by who do think have be here said bell mr dale said nothing have time be given to to use own judgment nothing must have be said at moment a to johnny visit have anybody be here since went whoever be did stay very long poor johnny eames said bell then colour came up into lily face bethought in moment that old friend of young day have loved that too have have hope a to love now have heard tidings must put end to such hope understood in moment understood also that be necessary that must conceal such understanding dear johnny said why did not wait for told be out said mr dale will be here again before long doubt know yes thought must not object to telling mamma of course not have gone back to guestwick there be answer given to question be there further word then spoken about johnny eames of woman understood exactly how matter stood knew that others understood young man be loved by not loved with sort of admiring affection have be accorded to mr crosbie johnny eames must not have be accepted a suitor by pet mr dale bell felt yet loved for love for distant modest respect have restrained from speech regarding poor johnny be young hardly a yet out of hobbledehoyhood must easily recover blow remembering perhaps feeling to advantage slight touch of passing romance be thus woman think of men who love young love in vain johnny eames a rode back to guestwick forgetful of spur with glove stuffed into pocket thought of matter very differently have never promised to success a to passion for lily have indeed always acknowledged that must have hope now that be actually promised to man a good a married be not le broken hearted because former hope have not be high have never dared to speak to lily of love be conscious that knew did not now dare to stand before a one convicted of having loved in vain then a rode back thought also of other love not with many of pleasant thought lothario don juans may be presumed to enjoy when contemplate success suppose will marry there will be end of said to a remembered short note have once written to in madness there have be little supper at mr roper mr lupex amelia have made punch after supper have be by accident alone with amelia in dining parlour when warmed by generous god have declared passion have shaken head mournfully have fled from to upper region absolutely refusing proffered embrace on same night before head have found pillow note have come to repentant half affectionate half repellent if indeed must swear to that love be honest manly then indeed might even yet see through chink of doorway with purport of telling that be forgiven whereupon perfidious pencil being near to hand have written requisite word only object in life be to call own for ever amelia have misgiving whether promise in order that might be used a legal evidence must not have be written in ink be painful doubt nevertheless be a good a word saw through chink forgiving for impetuosity in parlour with perhaps more clemency than mere pardon required by george how well looked with hair loose said to a at last regained pillow still warm with generous god now a thought of night returning on road from allington to guestwick loose floating lock be remembered by with strong feeling a to charm thought also of lily dale a be when have said farewell to on day before first went up to london will care more about seeing than anybody have said have often thought of word since wondering whether have understood a meaning more than assurance of ordinary friendship remembered well dress have then worn be old brown merino have known before in truth have nothing in to recommend specially to lover notice horrid old thing have be lily own verdict respecting frock even before day have hallowed in eye must have be only too happy to have worn shred of near heart a talisman how wonderful in nature be that passion of men speak when acknowledge to that be in love of thing be under one condition most foul under most fair a condition be man show either a beast a god so will let poor johnny eames ride back to guestwick suffering much in that have loved basely suffering much also in that have loved nobly lily a have tripped along through shrubbery under lover arm looking up other moment into face have espied uncle bernard stop have said giving little pull at arm wo go on uncle be always teasing with old fashioned wit have have quite enough of to day sir mind come over to morrow before go to shooting so have left may a well learn here what be question in dispute between uncle cousin a be walking there on broad gravel path behind great house bernard old man have said wish matter must be settled between bell be there hurry about sir yes there be hurry rather a hate hurry in thing must say that there be ground for despatch mind wish to drive if like cousin say so do like only have sort of feeling that thing grow best by degree quite share dislike to being in hurry time enough have be taken now see bernard be going to make great sacrifice of income on behalf be sure be very grateful have child have therefore always regarded a own there be reason why brother philip daughter must not be a dear to a brother orlando son of course not sir rather two daughter may leave matter to bernard younger girl be going to marry friend of yours a have sufficient income to support wife think that sister in law have good reason to be satisfied by match will not be expected to give up part of small income a must have done have lily married poor man suppose must hardly give up much people must be guided by circumstance be not disposed to put in place of parent to there be reason why must will not encourage false hope if knew that matter between bell be arranged must have reason to feel satisfied with what be doing from bernard began to perceive that poor crosbie expectation in matter of money must not probably receive much gratification also perceived thought that perceived kind of threat in warning from uncle have promised eight hundred year with wife warning seemed to say if at once accept let feel that will be accepted may be well for to change mind especially a other niece be about to be married if be to give so large fortune with bell need hing for lily if choose to take bell fortune why then so on be thus that bernard read uncle caution a walked together on broad gravel path have desire to postpone matter longer said bernard will propose to bell at once if wish if mind be quite made up can not see why must delay then having thus arranged that matter received future relative with kind smile soft word chapter vii beginning of trouble illustration untitled lily a parted with lover in garden have required of to attend upon next morning a went to shooting in obedience to command appeared on mr dale lawn after breakfast accompanied by bernard two dog men have gun in hand be got up with proper sporting appurtenance so turned out that did not reach stubble field on farther side of road until after luncheon may not be fairly doubted whether croquet be not a good a shooting when man be in love will be said that bernard dale be not in love who bring such accusation against will bring falsely be in love with cousin bell according to manner fashion be not nature to love bell a john eames loved lily then must nature bring into trouble a charm of amelia roper have brought upon poor clerk from income tax office johnny be susceptible a word go whereas captain dale be man who have feeling well under control be not one to make fool of about girl to die of broken heart nevertheless must probably love wife when got wife must be careful father to child be very intimate with other now four be bernard adolphus sometimes apollo bell lily among crosbie found to be pleasant enough new position of life have come upon one exceeding pleasant nevertheless there be moment in cold fit of melancholy nature came upon be doing very thing throughout year of manhood have declared to that must not do according to plan of life be to have eschewed marriage to have allowed to regard a possible event only under circumstance of wealth rank beauty coming in way together a have expected no such glorious prize have regarded a man who must reign at beaufort be potent at sebright to end of chapter now be fact that have fallen from settled position vanquished by silver voice pretty wit pair of moderately bright eye be very fond of lily having in truth stronger capability for falling in love than friend captain dale be sacrifice worth while be question asked in melancholy moment while be lying in bed for instance awake in morning when be shaving sometimes also when squire be prosy after dinner at such time a while must be listening to mr dale self reproach must sometimes be very bitter why must undergo crosbie of sebright crosbie of general committee office crosbie who must allow one to bore between charing cross far end of bayswater why must listen to long winded story of one a squire dale if indeed squire intended to be liberal to niece then might be very well a yet squire have given sign of such intention crosbie be angry with in that have not have courage to ask question on subject thus course of love be not smooth to apollo be still pleasant for when be there on croquet ground sitting in mr dale drawing room with privilege of accepted lover be pleasant to also a sipped squire claret knowing that coffee must soon be handed to by sweet girl who must have tripped across two garden on purpose to perform for service there be nothing pleasanter than although man when so treated doe feel to look like calf at altar ready for knife with blue ribbon round horn neck crosbie felt that be such calf more calf like in that have not a yet dared to ask question about wife fortune will have out of old fellow evening said to a buttoned on dandy shooting gaiter that morning how nice look in lily said to sister afterwards knowing nothing of thought have troubled lover mind while be adorning leg suppose will come back way crosbie said a prepared to move away on proper business when lunch be over well not exactly said bernard will make way round by darvell farm so back by gruddock be girl going to dine up at great house to day girl declared that be not going to dine up at great house that did not intend going to great house at evening then a wo have to dress might a well meet at gruddock gate at back of farmyard will be there exactly at half past five be to say be to be there at half past five will keep waiting for three quarter of hour said lily nevertheless arrangement a proposed be made two lady be not at unwilling to make be thus that game be carried on among unsophisticated people who really live in country farmyard gate at farmer gruddock have not fitting sound a trysting place in romance for people who be in earnest doe a well a oak in middle glade of forest lily dale be quite in earnest so indeed be adolphus crosbie only with earnest be beginning to take shade of brown most earnest thing have to wear in vale of tear with lily be a yet rose coloured bernard dale be also in earnest throughout morning have stood very near to bell on lawn have thought that cousin did not receive little whispering with aversion why must lucky girl that be thus to have eight hundred year pinned to skirt say dale crosbie said a in course of day work have come round upon gruddock ground be preparing to finish off turnip before reached farm yard gate now a crosbie spoke stood leaning on gate looking at turnip while two dog squatted on haunch crosbie have be very silent for last mile two have be making up mind for conversation say dale uncle have never said word to yet a to lily fortune a to lily question be whether lily have got fortune can hardly expect be to take without something uncle be man of world know whether uncle be man of world will not say be crosbie whether be not lily a have always known have nothing of own be not talking of lily own be speaking of uncle have be straightforward with when became attached to cousin declared what meant at once must have asked question if thought there be room for such question thought there be room upon word be cool fellow now look here crosbie may say what like about uncle must not say word against lily who be going to say word against can little understand if know that protection of name against evil word be already more care than be yours regard lily a own only meant to say that discontent may feel a to money want of money must refer to uncle not to family at small house be quite well aware of though be quite at liberty to say what like to about uncle can not say that can see that have be to blame must have told what prospect be if have got prospect can not be uncle duty to tell everybody that doe not mean to give niece fortune in point of fact why must suppose that have intention do know that have not because once led to believe that must give niece money now crosbie be necessary that must understand other in matter did not listen to for moment never said word to about uncle intention in way until after have become fully engaged to lily with knowledge of then when belief on subject must make possible difference in conduct told that thought uncle must do something for told so because did think so a friend must have told what thought in matter concerned interest now have changed opinion have changed opinion very probably without sufficient ground be hard upon may be hard to bear disappointment can not say that anybody have ill used think will give anything nothing will be of much moment to be not to say that be hard think confounded hard of course must put off marriage why do not speak to uncle will do so to tell truth think must have come better from be matter of opinion will tell very plainly what think about if be angry why suppose must leave house will be look here crosbie begin conversation with purpose of angering be not bad hearted man be very obstinate can be quite a obstinate a be then without further parley went in among turnip swore against luck a missed bird there be certain phase of mind in man can neither ride shoot play stroke at billiards remember card at whist to such phase of mind have come crosbie dale after conversation over gate be not above fifteen minute late at trysting place nevertheless punctual though have be girl be there before of course first inquiry be made about game of course gentleman declared that bird be scarcer than have ever be before that dog be wilder luck more excruciatingly bad to apology very little attention be paid lily bell have not come there to inquire after partridge must have forgiven sportsman even though single bird have be killed must not forgive want of good spirit be apparent declare know what be matter with lily said to lover have be over fifteen mile of ground never knew anything so lackadaisical a gentleman from london be over fifteen mile of ground why uncle christopher must think nothing of uncle christopher be made of sterner stuff than be said crosbie used to be born so sixty seventy year ago then walked on through gruddock field home paddock back to great house where found squire standing in front of porch walk have not be so pleasant a have intended that must be when made arrangement for crosbie have endeavoured to recover happy state of mind have be unsuccessful lily fancying that lover be not that must be have become reserved silent bernard bell have not shared discomfiture then bernard bell be a rule much more given to silence than other two uncle said lily men have shot nothing can not conceive how unhappy be in consequence be fault of naughty partridge illustration be fault of naughty partridge there be plenty of partridge if knew how to get said squire dog be uncommonly wild said crosbie be not wild with said squire yet with dingle dingle be squire gamekeeper fact be young men nowadays expect to have dog trained to do work for be too much labour for to walk up to game will be late for dinner girl if look sharp be not coming up evening sir said bell why not be going to stay with mamma why will not mother come with will be whipped if can understand one must have thought that under present circumstance must have be glad to see a much together a possible be together quite enough said lily a for mamma suppose think then stopped catching glance of bell imploring eye be going to make indignant excuse for mother excuse must be calculated to make uncle angry be practice to say such sharp word to consequently did not regard a warmly a more silent more prudent sister at present moment turned quickly round went into house then with very few word of farewell two young men followed girl went back over little bridge by feeling that afternoon have not gone off altogether well must provoke lily said bell must say thing about mamma seems to that mind what say oh lily more do make so angry that can not hold tongue think that because place be be to say just what like why must mamma go up there to please humour may be sure that mamma will do what think best be stronger minded than uncle christopher doe not want one to help lily must speak a though be careless about mamma did mean know of course did then two girl joined mother in own little domain will return to men at great house crosbie when went up to dress for dinner fell into one of melancholy fit of have spoken be absolutely about to destroy good that have done for throughout past year of hitherto successful life rather a at last put question to more strongly be not case that have already destroyed success marriage with lily whether be to be for good bad be now settled thing be not regarded a matter admitting of doubt to do man justice must declare that in moment of misery still did best must to think of lily a of great treasure have won a of treasure must perhaps must compensate for misery there be misery very plain must give up club fashion that have hitherto gained be content to live plain humdrum domestic life with eight hundred year small house full of baby be not kind of elysium for have tutored lily be very nice very nice indeed be a said to by odds nicest girl that have ever seen might now turn up happiness must be first care a for own began to fear that compensation must hardly be perfect be own doing said to intending to be rather noble in purport of soliloquy have trained for other thing very foolishly of course must suffer suffer damnably will never know dear sweet innocent pretty little thing then went on about squire a to whom felt entitled to be indignant by own disinterested manly line of conduct towards niece will let know what think about said be very well for dale to say have be treated fairly be fair for man to put forward niece under false pretence of course thought that intended to provide for then having made up mind in very manly way that must not desert lily altogether after having promised to marry endeavoured to find consolation in reflection that might at rate allow two year more run a bachelor in london girl who have to get married without fortune always know that will have to wait indeed lily have already told that a far a be concerned be in hurry need not therefore at once withdraw name from sebright thus endeavoured to console still however resolving that must have little serious conversation with squire very evening a to lily fortune be state of lily mind at same moment while also be performing slight toilet change preparatory to simple dinner at small house did behave well to said to herself never do forget how much be giving up for then when anything annoys make worse instead of comforting upon made accusation against that did not love half enough that did not let see how thoroughly perfectly loved have idea of own that a girl must never show preference for man till circumstance must have fully entitled to such manifestation so also must make drawback on love pour forth for benefit with strength when such circumstance have come to exist be ever feeling that be not acting up to theory now that time for such practice have come must unwittingly assume little reserve make small pretence of indifference in spite of own judgment have done so on afternoon have left without giving hand to press without looking up into face with assurance of love therefore be angry with know will teach to hate said out loud to bell must be very sad said bell see if be engaged to man must be much better to must not say so much what did say must be affection be always making horrid little speech for must like to cut out tongue afterwards sort of speech be think that like doe be not so sure of bell of course expect that be to scold not yet be know by eye when be pleased when be displeased then went down to dinner up at great house three gentleman met together in apparent good humour bernard dale be man of equal temperament who rarely allowed feeling even annoyance to interfere with usual manner man who must always come to table with smile meet friend enemy with properly civil greeting not that be especially false man there be nothing of deceit in placidity of demeanour arose from true equanimity be equanimity of cold disposition rather than of one well ordered by discipline squire be aware that have be unreasonably petulant before dinner having taken to task in own way now entered dining room with courteous greeting of host find that bag be not so bad after said hope that appetite be at least a good a bag crosbie smiled made pleasant said few flattering word man who intends to take very decided step in hour two generally contrives to bear in meantime a though trifle of world be quite sufficient for so praised squire game said good natured word a to dingle bantered a to own want of skill then went merry not quite a marriage bell still merry enough for party of three gentleman crosbie resolution be fixed a soon therefore a old butler be permanently gone wine steadily in transit upon table began task not without apparent abruptness having fully considered matter have determined that must not wait for bernard dale absence thought possible that might be able to fight battle better in bernard presence than must do behind back squire began called squire when be on good term together crosbie thought well to begin a though there be nothing amiss between squire of course be thinking good deal at present moment a to intended marriage be natural enough said squire yes by george sir man doe make change like without finding that have got something to think of suppose not said squire never be in way of getting married can easily understand have be luckiest fellow in world in finding such girl a niece whereupon squire bowed intending to make little courteous declaration that luck in matter be on side of dale know that continued crosbie be exactly everything that girl ought to be be good girl said bernard yes think be said squire seems to said crosbie finding that be necessary to dash at once headlong into water that something ought to be said a to mean of supporting properly then paused for moment expecting that squire must speak squire sat perfectly still looking intently at empty fireplace saying nothing of supporting continued crosbie with comfort to have be accustomed have never be used to expense said squire mother a doubtless know be not rich woman living here lily have have great advantage horse to ride sort of thing suppose expects horse in park said squire with very perceptible touch of sarcasm in voice hope not said crosbie believe have have use of one of pony here sometimes hope have not made extravagant in idea did not think that there be anything of nonsense about of be there a far a know nothing of sort said bernard long short of be sir crosbie a spoke endeavoured to maintain ordinary voice usual coolness heightened colour betrayed that be nervous be to expect accession of income with wife have not spoken to sister in law on subject said squire must fear that can not do much a matter of course must not take shilling from said crosbie then that settle said squire crosbie paused moment during colour became very red unconsciously took up apricot eat then spoke out of course be not alluding to mr dale income must not on account disturb arrangement wished to learn sir whether intend to do anything for niece in way of giving fortune nothing at intend to hing at then suppose understand other at last said crosbie must have thought that might have understood other at first said squire did ever make promise give hint intended to provide for niece have ever held out to such hope know what mean by word 'at last ' unless be to give offence meant truth sir meant seeing manner in niece lived with thought probable that must treat a though be daughter now find out mistake be have be mistaken without shadow of excuse for mistake others have be mistaken with said crosbie forgetting on spur of moment that have right to drag opinion of other person into question what others said squire with anger mind immediately betook to sister in law want to make mischief said crosbie if anybody connected with family have presumed to tell intended to do more for niece lilian than have already done such person have not only be false ungrateful have given to one authority to make promise on behalf of niece such promise have be made be only suggestion said crosbie be not in least aware to whom squire be alluding in anger perceived that host be angry having already reflected that must not have alluded to word bernard dale have spoken in friendship resolved to name one bernard a sat by listening knew exactly how matter stood a thought there must be reason why must subject to uncle ill will seeing that have committed no sin such suggestion must have be made said squire one have have right to make such suggestion one have be placed by in position to make such suggestion to without manifest impropriety will ask further question about be quite a well that must understand at once that consider to be duty to give niece lilian fortune on marriage trust that offer to be not made under such delusion sir be not said crosbie then suppose that great harm have be done be sorry if false hope have be given to be sure will acknowledge that be not given to by think have misunderstood sir hope be never very high thought right to ascertain intention now know trust for girl sake that will make difference to can hardly believe that have be to blame in matter crosbie hastened at once to exculpate lily then with more awkward blunder than man must have made who be so well acquainted with fashionable life a apollo of beaufort proceeded to explain that a lily be to have nothing own pecuniary arrangement must necessitate little delay in marriage a far a be concerned said squire like long engagement be quite aware that in matter have right to interfere unless indeed then stopped suppose will be well to fix day eh crosbie said bernard will discus that matter with mr dale said crosbie if understand other said

with special view to pleasure of mr crosbie altogether on behalf of poor johnny eames what be to be done in matter question have be fully discussed between mr dale bell have come to conclusion that must be best to ask johnny over to little friendly gathering in might be able to meet lily with stranger around in way embarrassment might be overcome must never do a mr dale said that must be suffered to stay away unnoticed by when ice be once broken wo mind said bell therefore early in day messenger be sent over to guestwick who returned with note from mr eames saying that must come on

nervousness in face limb have made up mind to do on occasion did without sign of outward disturbance asked question then waited for answer in be rather hard upon cousin for though question have

necessary must keep waiting in matter do know own mind dear bernard indeed indeed can not be a have proposed spoke in low voice in tone have in something of almost imploring humility nevertheless conveyed to cousin assurance that be in earnest assurance also that earnest must not readily be changed be not dale when did dale change mind for while sat silent by too having declared intention refrained from further word for minute thus remained looking down into have have still kept old position holding hand clasped together over knee be now lying on side supporting head upon arm with face indeed turned towards with eye fixed upon grass during time however be not idle cousin answer though have grieved have not come upon a blow stunning for moment rendering unfit for instant thought be grieved more grieved than have thought must have be thing that have wanted moderately now wanted more in that be denied to be able to perceive exact truth of position to calculate what might be chance if went on with suit what advantage if at once abandoned wish to press unfairly bell may ask if other preference there be other preference answered then again be silent for minute two uncle will be much grieved at said at last if be said bell think that need of trouble can have right to dispose of heart understand taunt bell dear bernard there be taunt intended none need not speak of own grief

speaking to three lady together suppose be keeping up for dance on lawn hope will be here in evening said mr dale bell said never word have determined that under existing circumstance must be only fair to cousin that offer answer to must be kept secret knew why bernard did not come across from great house with friend said nothing of knowledge lily looked at looked without speaking a for mr dale

where be young men asked lily assuming look of mock astonishment will be across in two three hour time said squire dressed for dinner a thought made very smart for such grand occasion a thought second dressing necessary how do do mr hearn hope be quite well rheumatism left eh squire said very loud into mr hearn ear mr hearn be perhaps little hard of hearing be very little hated to be thought deaf did not moreover like to be thought rheumatic squire knew therefore mode of address be not good natured need make jump so mr dale be pretty well now thank ye did have twinge in spring that cottage be so badly built for draught wonder can live in ' sister said to last time be over suppose must be better off over with at hamersham only one doe like to move know after living fifty year in one parish

evening be out there be old people whom be very hard to flatter with whom be nevertheless almost impossible to live unless do flatter at last two hero came in across lawn at drawing room window lily a entered dropped low curtsey before gently swelling down upon ground with light muslin dress till looked like wondrous flower have bloomed upon carpet putting two hand with back of finger pressed together on buckle of girdle said be waiting upon honour kind grace feel how much owe to for favouring poor abode then gently rose up again smiling oh so sweetly on man loved puffing swelling went out of muslin think there be nothing in world so pretty a conscious little trick of love played off by girl towards man love when have made up mind boldly that world may know that have given away to be not sure that crosbie liked a much a must have done bold assurance of love when two be alone together did like what man doe not like such assurance on such occasion perhaps must have be better pleased have lily shown more reticence be more secret a be a to feeling when others be around be not that accused in thought of want of delicacy read character too well be if not quite aright in reading of at least too nearly so to admit of making against such accusation a that be calf like feeling be disagreeable to did not like to be presented even to world of allington a victim caught for sacrifice bound with ribbon for altar then there lurked behind feeling that might be safer that thing must not be so openly manifested before world of course everybody knew that be engaged to lily dale have a said to perhaps too frequently slightest idea of breaking from engagement then marriage might possibly be delayed have not discussed that matter yet with lily having indeed at first moment of gratified love created little difficulty for by pressing for early day will refuse nothing have said to make too soon saw therefore before little embarrassment be inclined to wish that lily must abstain from manner seemed to declare to world that be about to be married immediately must speak to to morrow said to a accepted salute with mock gravity equal to own poor lily how little understood a yet what be passing through mind have known wish must have wrapped up love carefully in napkin so that one must have seen one when might choose to have treasure uncovered for sight be for sake that have be thus open in way have seen girl who be half ashamed of love must never be ashamed of hers of have given to now world might know if world cared for such knowledge why must be ashamed of to thinking be so great honour to have heard of girl who must not speak of love arguing to cannily that there may be many slip between cup lip there must be need of such caution with there must surely be such slip must there be such fall must such fate by falseness misfortune come upon such caution must be of service to save cup must have be so shattered in fall that further piecing of part must be in way possible so much a did not exactly say to herself felt went bravely forward bold in love careful to hide from none who chanced to see have gone through ceremony with cake teacup have decided that at rate first dance two must be held upon lawn when last of guest arrived oh adolphus be so glad have come said lily do try to like of dr croft who be new comer have sometimes spoken to lover have never coupled sister name with of doctor even in speaking to nevertheless crosbie have in way conceived idea that croft have be be be to be in love with bell a be prepared to advocate friend dale claim in quarter be not particularly anxious to welcome doctor a thoroughly intimate friend of family knew nothing a yet of dale offer of bell refusal be prepared for war if war must be necessary of squire at present moment be not very fond if destiny intended to give wife out of family must prefer owner of allington nephew of lord de guest a brother in law to village doctor a took upon in pride to call dr croft be very unfortunate said never do like paragon must like paragon not that be paragon at for smoke hunt doe manner of wicked thing then went forward to welcome friend dr croft be slight spare man about five foot nine in height with very bright dark eye broad forehead with dark hair that almost curled did not come so forward over brow a must have done for purpose of beauty with thin well cut nose mouth must have be perfect have lip be little fuller lower part of face when seen alone have in somewhat of sternness however be redeemed by brightness of eye yet artist must have declared that lower feature of face be by far more handsome lily went across to greeted heartily declaring how glad be to have there must introduce to mr crosbie said a though be determined to carry point two men shook hand with other coldly without saying word a young men be apt to do when be brought together in way then separated at once somewhat to disappointment of lily crosbie stood off by eye turned up towards ceiling looking a though meant to give while croft got quickly up to fireplace making civil little speech to mr dale mr boyce mr hearn then at last made way round to bell be so glad said to congratulate on sister engagement yes said bell knew that must be glad to hear of happiness indeed be glad thoroughly hope that may be happy like do not like very much be told that be well off be very fortunate man very fortunate very fortunate of course think so said bell not however because be rich no not because be rich because being worthy of such happiness circumstance must enable to marry to enjoy exactly said bell be just then sat down in sitting down put end to conversation be just have said a soon a word be spoken declared to herself that be not so that croft be wrong love said to not because be rich enough to marry without anxious thought because dare to marry although be not rich then told that be angry with doctor after dr croft got off towards door stood there by leaning against wall with thumb of hand stuck into armhole of waistcoat people said that be shy man suppose be shy yet be man be by mean afraid of doing anything that have to do must speak before multitude without being abashed whether be multitude of men of woman must be very fixed too in own opinion eager if not violent in prosecution of purpose must not stand say little word when have in truth nothing to say must not keep ground when felt that be not using ground upon stood have not learned art of assuming to be of importance in place might find be art crosbie have learned by art that have flourished so croft retired leaned against wall near door crosbie came forward shone like apollo among guest how be that doe said john eames to envying perfect happiness of london man of fashion at last lily got dancer out upon lawn then managed to go through one quadrille be found that did not answer music of single fiddle crosbie have hired from guestwick be not sufficient for purpose then grass though be perfect for purpose of croquet be not pleasant to foot for dancing be very nice said bernard to cousin know anything must be nicer perhaps know what mean said lily will stay here there be touch of romance about of look at moon there at back of steeple mean to go in night then walked off by one of path lover went after like moon said a took arm to be now so accustomed that hardly thought of a took like moon well fancy like sun better quite believe in moonlight think doe best to talk about when one want to be sentimental ah be just what fear be what say to bell when tell that romance will fade a rose do then will have to learn that prose be more serviceable than poetry that mind be better than heart money be better than love be coming know yet do like moonlight poetry love yes poetry much love more to be loved by be sweeter even than of dream be better than poetry have read dearest lily unchecked arm stole round waist be meaning of moonlight essence of poetry continued impassioned girl did not know then why liked such thing now know be because longed to be loved to love oh yes must be nothing without that know be delight must be other be mine yet be delight to love to know may love mean that be realization of romance yes must not be end of adolphus must like soft twilight long evening when will be alone must read to book love must not teach to think that world be hard dry cruel not yet tell bell so very often must not say so to will not be dry cruel if can prevent understand what mean dearest will not think dry cruel even though sorrow must come upon if think know what mean if be good to be not afraid of be not least afraid of that think must ever distrust must not be ashamed to look at moonlight to read poetry to to talk nonsense mean a said pressed closer to side tone be pleasant to suppose be talking nonsense now said pouting liked better when be talking about pig did like best now why did like then did say anything to offend like best now because be standing in narrow pathway of gate leading from bridge into garden of great house shadow of thick spreading laurel be around moonlight still pierced brightly through little avenue a looked up to must see form of face loving softness of eye because said then stooped over pressed closely while put up lip to standing on tip toe that might reach to face oh love said love love a crosbie walked back to great house night made firm resolution that consideration of worldly welfare must ever induce to break engagement with lily dale went somewhat further also determined that must not put off marriage for more than six eight month at most ten if must possibly get affair arranged in time to be sure must give up everything aspiration ambition of life then a declared to somewhat mournfully be prepared to do such be resolution a thought of in bed came to conclusion that few men be le selfish than be what will say to for staying away said lily recovering ought to be making people dance know come along do make nice do waltz with mary eames pray do if wo speak to night acting under threat crosbie did on return solicit honour of young lady hand thereby elating into seventh heaven of happiness must world afford better than waltz with partner a adolphus crosbie poor mary eames must waltz well though must not talk much a danced must pant good deal when stopped put too much of energy into motion be too anxious to do mechanical part of work in manner must be satisfactory to partner oh thank be very nice will be able to go on again directly conversation with crosbie did not get much beyond yet felt that have never done better than on occasion though there be at most not above five couple of dancer though who did not dance such a squire mr boyce curate from neighbouring parish have in fact nothing to amuse affair be kept on very merrily for considerable number of hour exactly at twelve o'clock there be little supper doubt served to relieve mr hearn ennui at mr boyce also seemed to enjoy a to mr boyces on such occasion profess that feel pity be generally happy in child happiness if not ought to be at rate be simply performing manifest duty duty in time be performed on behalf on account do mr hearns betake to such gathering why did ancient lady sit there hour after hour yawning longing for bed looking ten minute at watch while old bone be stiff sore old ear pained with noise must hardly have be simply for sake of supper after supper however maid took across to cottage mr boyce also then stole away home squire went off with little parade suggesting to young men that must make noise in house a returned poor curate remained talking dull word now then to mr dale looking on with tantalized eye at joy world have prepared for others than must say that think that public opinion bishop together be too hard upon curate in particular in latter part of night delight when time practice have made happy together john eames stood up for first time to dance with lily have done must short of asking to induce to do favour for felt that must be favour how great have be desire on part to ask at same time how great repugnance lily perhaps did not quite understand yet understood much of knew that be not angry with knew that be suffering from injured pride of futile love almost a much a from futile love wished to put at ease in did not quite give credit for full sincerity upright uncontrolled heartiness of feeling at length did come up to though in truth be engaged at once accepted offer then tripped across room adolphus said ca dance with though said must john eames have asked have stood up with before understand will be good boy wo crosbie not being in least jealous be good boy sat down to rest hidden behind door for first few minute conversation between eames lily be of very matter of fact kind repeated wish that might see in london said that of course must come call then there be silence for little while went through figure dancing at know yet when be to be married said lily a soon a be again standing together dare say not said eames not year suppose indeed must say of course not in spring perhaps suggested eames have unconscious desire that might be postponed to greek kalends yet did not wish to injure lily reason mention be that must be so very glad if must be here love so much must so like to have here on day why be that girl so constantly do so frequently ask men who have loved to be present at marriage with other men there be triumph in be done in sheer kindness affection intend to offer something will soften not aggravate sorrow that have caused ca marry lady seems to say next greatest blessing can offer will be yours will see married to somebody else fully appreciate intention in honest truth doubt eligibility of proffered entertainment on present occasion john eames seemed to be of opinion for did not at once accept invitation will not oblige so far a said softly must do anything to oblige said gruffly almost anything not that not must not do then went off upon figure when be next standing together remained silent till turn for dancing have again come why be that after night lily thought more of john eames than ever have thought before felt for mean higher respect a for man who have will of own in quadrille croft bell have be dancing together also have be talking of lily

tree round for never forgot that be own must thus use opportunity a seldom came down to see spot on other day mr dale a must see from own window while be tying on bonnet must feel that knew what be passing through mind must regret that circumstance have forced to be beholden to for such assistance in truth did not know that thought at such time be mine must say to a looked around on pleasant place be well for that must enjoy be brother widow be welcome very welcome think that if two person have known more than did of other heart mind might have loved other better then crosbie told lily of

well a did exact day on leave of absence came to end hour at behoved to walk into room at general committee office have taught to think that must remain with up to end of vacation now felt a schoolboy

to two third of remaining wealth lily did not blame lover did not even think that ought to stay must not allow to suppose that must propose anything be unkind felt loss more than once a knelt at prayer wiped hidden tear from eye crosbie also be thinking of departure more than must have done during mr boyce sermon be easy listening to mr hearn used to say of husband successor give one much trouble following into argument mr crosbie perhaps found difficulty greater than did mr hearn must have devoted mind more perfectly to discourse have argument be deeper be very hard that necessity of listening to man who say nothing on occasion crosbie ignored necessity altogether gave up mind to consideration of what might be expedient that must say to lily before went remembered well few word have spoken in first ardour of love pleading that early day might be fixed for marriage remembered also how prettily lily have yielded to only let be too soon have said now must unsay what have then said must plead against own pleading explain to that desired to postpone marriage rather than to hasten task presume must always be unpleasant one for man engaged to be married might a well do at once said to a bobbed head forward into hand by way of returning thanks for termination of mr boyce sermon a have only three day left be certainly a well that must do at once seeing that lily have fortune must not in justice complain of prolonged engagement be argument used in own mind a often told that must have very great ground of complaint if be left for day unnecessarily in doubt a to matter why have rashly spoken hasty word to in love betraying into manner of scrape a schoolboy might do such one a johnny eames what as have be not to have remembered to have be collected not to have bethought on occasion of might be due to adolphus crosbie then idea came upon whether have not altogether made as in matter a gave arm to lily outside church door shrugged shoulder while making reflection be

delight of immediately present month so there be left to three day of heaven come then will make most of what happiness be given to crosbie felt all a felt recognized extent of debt owed will come

love just same look forward just a much to happiness in marrying whether be rich poor understand that did not quite understand merely pressed arm so a to encourage to go on presumed that intended to tell something a to future mode of life something supposed might not be pleasant for to hear be determined to show that must receive pleasantly know said how anxious have be that marriage must not be

dale be escorted by future husband opinion that have be very fortunate girl be certainly general among guestwickians though be not always expressed in open generous term be great match for said shook head at same time hinting that mr crosbie life in london be not that must be suggesting that might have be more safe have be content to bestow upon country neighbour of le dangerous pretension others declared that be such great match after knew income to penny believed that young people must find very difficult to keep house in london unless old squire intended to assist nevertheless lily be envied a rode through town with handsome lover by side be very happy will not deny that have feeling of triumphant satisfaction in knowledge that be envied feeling on part be natural be natural to men woman who be conscious that have done well in adjustment of own affair a have said be bird spoil of own gun product of such capacity a have in on be to live if possible to thrive during remainder of life lily fully recognized importance of thing be doing in soberest guise have thought much of matter of marriage more thought of more satisfied be that be doing well yet knew that there be risk who be now everything to might die nay be possible that might be other than thought to be that might neglect desert misuse have resolved to trust in everything having so trusted must not provide for possibility of retreat ship must go out into middle ocean beyond ken of secure port from have sailed army must fight battle with hope of other safety than victory give world might know that loved if world chose to inquire about matter triumphed in lover did not deny even to herself that be triumphant mr eames be delighted to see be so good in mr crosbie to come over call upon such poor forlorn woman a so good in captain dale so good also in dear girl who at present moment have so much to make happy at home at allington little thing accounted a bare civility by others be esteemed a great favour by mr eames dear mr dale hope be not fatigued when kept up other night so unconscionably late bell lily assured that mother be none worse for what have gone through then mr eames got up left room with declared purpose of looking for john mary bent in truth on production of cake sweet wine kept under lock key in little parlour let stay here very long whispered crosbie not very long said lily when come to see friend must be in hurry mr crosbie have turn with lady julia said bell must have ours now at rate mr eames wo tell to do duty to beware of being too beautiful said lily mary john came into room before mother returned then came mr eames few minute afterwards cake wine arrived certainly be rather dull a none of party seemed to be at ease grandeur of mr crosbie be too great for mr eames daughter john be almost silenced by misery of position have not yet answered miss roper letter have even made up mind whether must answer then sight of lily happiness did not fill with friendly joy must perhaps have felt a friend of childhood to tell truth hated crosbie so have told have so told sister also very frequently since day of party tell what be molly have said if there be way of doing 'd fight man what make lily wretched will never be happy with be sure wo want to do harm yet 'd like to fight man if only knew how to manage then bethought that if must be slaughtered in such encounter must be only fitting termination to present state of thing in way too there must be escape from amelia at present moment saw none other when entered room shook hand with party from allington a told sister afterwards flesh crept when touched crosbie crosbie a contemplated eames family sitting stiff ill at ease in own drawing room chair made up mind that must be well that wife must see a little of john eames a might be when came to london not that be in way jealous of lover have learned everything from lily at least that lily knew regarded matter rather a good joke see too often have said to for fear must make as of lily have told everything that must tell yet did not in least comprehend lily have in truth warm affection for young man whom despised thank said crosbie never do take wine in middle of day bit of cake mr eames by look implored to do so much honour implored captain dale also be inexorable know that two girl be at more inclined to eat drink than two men understood that mr eames must be broken hearted if one partook of delicacy little sacrifice of society be made by woman a be also great sacrifice of life man who be good for anything be always ready for duty so be good woman always ready for sacrifice really must go now said bell because of horse under excuse got away will come over before go back to london john said lily a came out with intention of helping mount from purpose however be forced to recede by iron will of mr crosbie yes will come over again before go good by good by john said bell good by eames said captain dale crosbie a seated in saddle made very slightest sign of recognition to rival must not condescend to pay attention will manage to have fight with in way said eames to a walked back through passage of mother house crosbie a settled foot in stirrup felt that disliked young man more more must be monstrous to suppose that there must be aught of jealousy in feeling yet did dislike very strongly felt almost angry with lily for asking to come again to allington must put end to that said to a rode silently out of town must not snub friend sir said lily smiling a spoke yet with something of earnestness in voice be out of town by time crosbie have hardly uttered word since have left mr eames door be now on high road bell bernard dale be somewhat in advance of never snub anybody said crosbie petulantly be unless have absolutely deserved snubbing have deserved because seem to have got said lily nonsense lily never snubbed yet think likely that will begin ought not to accuse of not being civil to friend in first place be a civil to a nature will allow to be in second place well in second place be not quite sure that be very wise to encourage young man friendship just at present that mean suppose that be very wrong to do so no dearest doe not mean that if meant so must tell so honestly mean just what say there can suppose be doubt that have filled with kind of romantic attachment for foolish kind of love suppose ever expected to gratify idea of lends sort of grace to life when meet young woman fit to be wife will forget about till then will go about fancying despairing lover then young man a john eames be very apt to talk of fancy believe for moment that must mention name to one lily perhaps may know more of young men than do yes of course do can assure that be generally too well inclined to make free with name of girl whom think that like must not be surprised if be unwilling that man must make free with name after lily be silent for minute two felt that injustice be being done to be not inclined to put up with must not quite see where injustice lay great deal be owing from to crosbie in very much be bound to yield to be anxious to do on behalf even more than duty yet have strong conviction that must not be well that must give way to in everything wished to think a thought a far a possible must not say that agreed with when knew that differed from john eames be old friend whom must not abandon so much at present time felt obliged to say adolphus well dearest must not wish to be unkind to so very old friend a john eames have known life have of have very great regard for whole family father be uncle most particular friend think lily must understand what mean want to quarrel with of to be what call unkind need not give special pressing invitation to young man to come see before go back to london then to come see directly get to london tell that have kind of romantic idea of being in love with of being in despair because be not in love with be great nonsense doubt seems to that under such circumstance 'd better just leave alone again lily be silent be three last day in be intention to be especially happy above thing to make especially happy on account must say to sharp word encourage in own heart feeling of animosity against yet believed to be wrong so believing must hardly bring to bear injury such be nature a dale let be remembered very many who can devote for great sacrifice can not bring to endurance of little injury lily must have given up gratification for lover must not allow to have be in wrong believing to have be in right have asked now must come said press to come more certainly not after what have said adolphus if come over to allington will see in mamma house to have always be made welcome by of course understand perfectly understand what lily have stopped fearing that might say that must be offensive to if continued what be understand lily press to go on adolphus a far a can will do that want to do meant to say that when find inmate of house a matter of course must not ask own friend to come see be that gracious may have meant to say did not say that in truth did mean pray go on about now be to be last day know must waste by talking of thing be unpleasant after poor johnny eames be nothing to nothing nothing how can one be anything to when think of even did not bring crosbie back at once into pleasant humour have lily yielded to confessed that be right must have made at once a pleasant a sun in may have not done have simply abstained from argument because did not choose to be vexed have declared continued purpose of seeing eames on promised visit crosbie must have have acknowledge wrong must have delighted in privilege of forgiving lily dale be one who did not greatly relish forgiveness necessity of being forgiven so rode on if not in silence without much joy in conversation be now late on monday afternoon crosbie be to go early on wednesday morning what if three last day must come to be marred with such terrible drawback a bernard dale have not spoken word to cousin of suit since have be interrupted by crosbie lily a be lying on bank by have have have danced with again again at mr dale party have seemed to revert to old mode of conversation without difficulty bell therefore have believed matter to be over be thankful to cousin declaring within own bosom that whole matter must be treated by a though have never happened to one not even to mother must tell to such reticence bound for sake feeling that must be best pleased that must be so now a rode on together far in advance of other couple again returned to subject bell said be to have hope hope a to what bernard hardly know whether man be bound to take single answer on subject know that if man heart be concerned be not very willing to do so when answer have be given honestly truly oh doubt at suppose that be dishonest false when refused to allow to speak to bernard did not refuse to allow to speak to something very like however have doubt be true enough bell why must be so if be in love with one else must understand be not in love with one else exactly there be so many reason why must join fortune together can not be question of fortune bernard do listen to do let speak at rate presume may at least suppose that dislike oh though might not be willing to accept man hand merely on question of fortune surely fact that marriage must be in way suitable a regard money must not set against of own love for will not speak further a doubt that believe what say must not question own feeling very closely before determine to oppose wish of who be nearest to do mean mamma bernard not especially though can not think must like marriage must keep family together must give equal claim to property to have must not have feather weight with mamma have asked have mentioned matter to one then can not know a to uncle have mean of knowing that be great desire of life must say that think consideration for must induce to pause before give final answer even though consideration for must have weight with must do more for than for much more then do for allow to think have not yet have answer to proposal give to day month to christmas till time that like to name so that may think that be not yet settled may tell uncle christopher that such be case bernard must be useless must at rate show that be willing to think of be not willing to think of not in way do know own mind thoroughly must be very wrong if be to deceive wish to give that a only answer to uncle to tell truth bernard much care what may say to uncle in matter can have right to interfere in disposal of hand therefore need not regard wish on subject will explain to in one word what feeling be about must accept man in opposition to mamma wish not even for must accept man in opposition to own a concern uncle feel called on to consult in way on matter yet be head of family care anything about family not in way have be very generous to deny have not be generous to mamma be very hard ungenerous to mamma let have house because be anxious that dale must seem to be respectable before world life in because think better for that must do so if have way must leave to morrow at rate a soon a lily be married must much sooner go into guestwick live a eames do think be ungrateful bell be not ungrateful a to consulting bernard must be much more inclined to consult than about marriage if must let look on altogether a brother must think little of promising to marry one whom did not approve agreement between must by mean have suited bernard view have thought four five week back that be not personally very anxious for match have declared to that liked cousin well enough that must be good thing for to settle that uncle be reasonable in wish sufficiently liberal in offer therefore must marry have hardly occurred to a probable that cousin must reject so eligible offer have certainly never occurred to that must have to suffer anything from such rejection have entertained none of feeling of lover speak when declare that be staking upon hazard of die have not seemed to that be staking anything a gently told tale of languid love lying on turf by have have have not regarded possibility of disappointment of sorrow of deeply vexed mind must have felt little triumph if accepted have not thought that must be humiliated by rejection in frame of mind have gone to work now found to own surprise that girl answer have made absolutely unhappy having expressed wish for thing very expression of wish made long to posse found a rode along silently by side that be capable of more earnestness of desire than have known to posse be at moment unhappy disappointed anxious distrustful of future more intent on one special toy than have ever be before even a boy be vexed felt to be sore at heart looked round at a sat silent quiet somewhat sad upon pony declared to that be very beautiful that be thing to be gained if still there might be possibility of gaining felt that really loved yet be almost angry with for so feeling why have subjected to numbing weakness love have never given pleasure indeed have never hitherto acknowledged now be driven to do so on finding to be source of trouble pain think be open to to doubt whether even yet bernard dale be in love with cousin whether be not rather in love with own desire against found verdict that be in love be angry with with world ah bell said coming close up to wish must understand how love a spoke cousin unconsciously recognized more of affection in tone le of spirit of bargaining have seemed to pervade former plea than have ever found before do not love have not offered to be to in respect a sister be nothing such offer to now be simply laughing at bell tell will not give up fact be know yet not know a must know man before choose for husband lily be not alike in be cautious doubtful of perhaps also somewhat doubtful of others heart be set upon will still try to succeed ah bernard say that believe when tell that can never be will not believe will not allow to be made utterly wretched tell fairly will not believe may surely hope if choose to hope bell will never give up unless indeed must see become man wife a said turned in through squire gate rode up to yard in be habit to dismount from horse chapter xiv john eames take walk john eames watched party of cavalier a rode away from mother door then started upon solitary walk a soon a noise of horse hoof have passed away out of street be by mean happy in mind a did so indeed be overwhelmed with care trouble a went along very gloomy thought passed through mind have not better go to australia vancouver island will not name place poor fellow suggested to a possible termination of long journey might not improbably be called upon to take very day just before dale have come in have received second letter from darling amelia written very closely upon heel of first why have not answered be ill be untrue must not believe that therefore fell back upon probability of illness if be so must rush down to see nothing on earth must keep from bedside of betrothed if did not get answer from beloved john by return of post must be down with at guestwick by express train here be position for such young man a john eames of amelia roper may say that be young woman who must not give up game a long a least chance remained of winning must go somewhere john said to a put on slouched hat wandered forth through back street of guestwick what must mother say when heard of amelia roper what must say when saw walked away towards manor so that might roam about guestwick wood in solitude there be path with stile leading off from high road about mile beyond lodge through dale have ridden up to house by path john eames turned in went away till have left manor house behind be in centre of guestwick wood knew whole ground well having roamed there ever since be first allowed to go forth upon walk alone have thought of lily dale by hour together a have lost among oak tree in former day have thought of with pleasure now must only think of a of one gone from for ever then have also to think of whom have taken to in lily place young men very young men men so young that may be almost question whether have a yet reached manhood be more inclined to be earnest thoughtful when alone than ever be when with others even though others be elder fancy that a grow old ourselves be apt to forget that be so with forgetting believe that be so with child constantly talk of thoughtlessness of youth know whether might not more appropriately speak of thoughtfulness be however doubt true thought will not at once produce wisdom may almost be question whether such wisdom a many of have in mature year have not come from dying out of power of temptation rather than a result of thought resolution men full fledged at work be for most part too busy for much thought lad on whom work of world have not yet fallen with pressure have time for thinking thus john eames be thoughtful who knew best accounted to be gay good hearted somewhat reckless young man open to temptation also open to good impression a to whom great success must be predicated of whom friend might fairly hope that might so live a to bring upon disgrace not much trouble above thing must have called thoughtless in so calling judged wrong be ever thinking thinking much of world a appeared to of a appeared to world thinking also of thing beyond world be to be fate here hereafter lily dale be gone from amelia roper be hanging round neck like millstone under such circumstance be to be fate here hereafter may say that difficulty in way be not a yet very great a to lily indeed have room for hope then love for lily have perhaps be sentiment rather than passion most young men have to go through disappointment be enabled to bear without much injury to prospect happiness in after life remembrance of such love be blessing rather than curse enabling possessor of to feel that in early day there be something within of have cause to be ashamed pity john eames much in regard to lily dale then a to amelia roper have achieved tithe of lady experience in world possessed quarter of audacity surely such difficulty a need not have stood much in way what must amelia do to if fairly told that be not minded to marry in very truth have never promised to do so be in way bound to not even by honour indeed with such a men be coward before woman until become tyrant be easy dupe till of sudden recognize fact that be pleasanter to be victimizer than victim a easy there be men indeed who never learn latter lesson though cause for fear be so slight poor john eames be thoroughly afraid little thing in connection with so deep sorrow a be almost ridiculous to mention added to embarrassment made escape from seem to to be impossible must not return to london without going to burton crescent because clothes be there because owed to mr roper small sum of money on return to london must not have immediately in pocket must therefore meet amelia knew that have not courage to tell girl face to face that did not love after have be once induced to say that did do so boldest conception did not go beyond writing of letter in must renounce removing altogether from quarter of town in burton crescent be situated then about clothes debt of what if must in meantime come down to guestwick claim must in mother presence declare that have right to make such claim difficulty in truth be not very great be too heavy for poor young clerk from income tax office will declare that must have be fool coward yet must read understand shakspeare knew much by far too much of byron poetry by heart be deep critic often writing down criticism in lengthy journal kept must write quickly with understanding may declare that men at office have already ascertained that be fool knew business must do a many men failed to do who be much le foolish before world a to matter of cowardice must have thought greatest blessing in world to be shut up in room with crosbie having permission to fight with till one of must have be brought by stress of battle to give up claim to lily dale eames be coward feared man on earth be terribly afraid of amelia roper wandered about through old manor wood very ill at ease post from guestwick went out at seven must at once make up mind whether must write to amelia on day must also make up mind a to what must say to felt that must at least answer letter let answer be what might must promise to marry say in ten twelve year time must tell that be blighted being unfit for love with humility entreat of that might be excused must write to mother telling that burton

flourishing solicitor belonging to firm have for many year acted a agent to de courcy property mortimer gazebee be now member of parliament for barchester partly through influence of father in law that must be so be matter of great disgust to honourable george who thought that seat must have belonged to a mr gazebee have paid very heavy expense of election out of own pocket a george de courcy certainly must not have paid justice of claim may be questionable lady amelia gazebee be now happy mother of many baby whom be wont to carry with on visit to courcy castle have become excellent

what must do in consequence have not occurred to that must immediately be charged with offence called upon to plead guilty not guilty have never for moment meditated plea of not guilty be aware of aversion on part to declare a engaged to lilian dale seemed that by doing so must cut off at once from pleasure at such house a courcy castle a argued to why must not enjoy little remnant of bachelor life a to denying engagement to john de courcy be nothing one must understand that must be justified in concealing fact concerning from one a denial repeated from john mouth must amount to nothing even among john own sister now be necessary that crosbie must make up mind a to what must say when questioned by lady of house if be to deny fact to denial must be very serious indeed be possible that must make such denial with lady julia opposite to make denial be fact that must wish to do so that must think of such falsehood even meditate on perpetration of such cowardice have held that young

already calculating a to practicability of disowning in doing so must not have told that be villain in truth made such calculation object be to banish subject if be possible to do so to think of answer by might create doubt did not occur to to tell countess boldly that there be truth whatever in report that miss dale be nothing to might not skilfully laugh off subject even in presence of lady julia men who be engaged did so usually why must not be generally thought that solicitude for lady feeling must prevent man from talking openly of own engagement then remembered easy freedom with position have be discussed throughout whole neighbourhood of allington felt for first time that dale family have be almost indelicate in want of reticence suppose be done to tie faster said to a pulled out end of cravat what fool be to come here indeed to go anywhere after settling a have done then went down into drawing room be almost relief to when found that be not charged with sin at once have be so full of subject that have expected to be attacked at moment of entrance be however greeted without allusion to matter countess in own quiet way shook hand with a though have seen only day before earl who be seated in arm chair asked one out loud who stranger be then with two finger put forth muttered apology for welcome crosbie be quite up to kind of thing how do lord said turning face away to one else a spoke then took further notice of master of house not know indeed crippled though be by matrimonial bond crosbie felt that at rate a yet be earl equal in social importance after

finished what success be said crosbie indeed be said margaretta with energy then door be opened lady dumbello entered room there be immediately commotion among even gouty old lord shuffled up out of chair tried with grin to look sweet pleasant countess came forward looking very sweet pleasant making little complimentary speech to viscountess answered simply by gracious smile lady clandidlem though be very fat heavy left viscount got up to join group baron potsneuf diplomatic german of great celebrity crossed hand upon breast made low bow honourable george who have stood silent for last quarter of hour suggested to ladyship that must have found air rather cold lady margaretta alexandrina fluttered up with little complimentary speech to dear lady dumbello hoping beseeching that a though woman in white before have be dearest friend of infancy be woman in white being dressed in white silk with white lace over with other jewel upon person than diamond very beautifully be dressed doing infinite credit doubt to three artist who have between succeeded in turning out of hand face also be beautiful with certain cold inexpressive beauty walked up room very slowly smiling here smiling there still with very faint smile took place hostess indicated to one word said to countess two to earl beyond did not open lip homage paid to received a though be clearly due be not in least embarrassed did show to be in slightest degree ashamed of own silence did not look like fool be even taken for fool contributed nothing to society cold hard beauty gait dress may say that contributed enough for society acknowledged to be deeply indebted to only person in room who did not move at lady dumbello entrance be husband remained unmoved from want of enthusiasm spark of pleasure actually beamed in eye a saw triumphant entrance of wife felt that have made match be becoming to a great nobleman that world be acknowledging that have done duty yet lady dumbello have be simply daughter of country parson of clergyman who have reached no higher rank than of archdeacon how wonderfully well that woman have educated countess said that evening in dressing room to margaretta woman alluded to be mr grantly wife of parson mother of lady dumbello old earl be very cross because destiny table of precedence required to take out lady clandidlem to dinner almost insulted a kindly endeavoured to assist in infirm step rather than to lean upon ugh said be bad arrangement make two old people like be sent out together to help other speak for yourself said ladyship with laugh at rate can get about without assistance indeed be true enough be well for growled earl a got into seat after that endeavoured to solace pain by flirtation with lady dumbello on left earl smile earl teeth when whispered naughty little nothing to pretty young woman be phenomenon at men might marvel naughty nothing be on present occasion lady dumbello took with placidity smiling graciously speaking hardly more than monosyllable lady alexandrina fell to crosbie lot felt gratified that be so might be necessary for a married man to give up such acquaintance a de courcys must like if possible to maintain friendship with lady alexandrina what friend lady alexandrina must be for lily if such friendship be only possible what advantage must such alliance confer upon dear little girl for after though dear little girl attraction be very great must not admit to that wanted something way of holding of speaking people call style lily might certainly learn great deal from lady alexandrina be conviction doubt made so sedulous in pleasing lady on present occasion a seemed be well inclined to be pleased said word to during dinner about lily yet spoke about dale about allington showing that knew in what quarter have be staying then alluded to last party in london occasion on a crosbie now remembered intercourse between have almost be tender be manifest to that at rate did not wish to quarrel with be manifest also that have little hesitation in speaking to about engagement did not for moment doubt that be aware of in way matter went on between till lady left room so be going to be married too said honourable george by whose side crosbie found seated when lady be gone crosbie be employing upon walnut did not find necessary to make answer be best thing fellow can do continued george be if have be careful to

from dinner table have not a yet be driven to confess anything to own discredit evening be not yet over when returned to drawing room endeavoured to avoid conversation with countess believing that attack must more probably come from than from daughter therefore got into conversation first with one then with of girl till at last found again alone with alexandrina mr crosbie said in low voice a be standing together over one of distant table with back to rest of company want to tell something about miss lilian dale about miss lilian dale said repeating word be very pretty yes certainly be pretty very nice attractive clever be delightful be perfect be very attractive said think be perfect what be fault that question be hardly fair be suppose one be to ask be fault do think must answer

be not engaged to must be different thing be not engaged to said crosbie such happiness such honour be fear very far beyond reach nevertheless be prepared to testify a to perfection anywhere what must miss dale say allow to assure that such opinion a may choose to express of friend will be own opinion not depend on of one else think then that be not bound to be enslaved a yet how many more month of such freedom be to enjoy crosbie remained silent for minute before answered then spoke in serious voice lady alexandrina said must beg from great favour what be favour mr crosbie be quite in earnest will be good enough kind enough enough friend not to connect name again with of miss dale while be here have there be quarrel there have be quarrel can not explain to now why make request to will explain before go explain to have regarded a more than acquaintance a friend in day now past there be moment when be almost rash enough to hope that might have said even more than confess have warrant for such hope believe may still look on a friend oh yes certainly said alexandrina in very low voice with certain amount of tenderness in tone have always regarded a friend therefore venture to make request subject be not one on can speak openly without regret at present moment to at least promise will explain before leave courcy at rate succeeded in mystifying lady alexandrina believe be engaged bit said to lady amelia gazebee night nonsense dear lady julia must speak of in certain way if did know of course doe wish to have talked about if ever have be engaged to have broken off again said lady alexandrina dare say will dear if give encouragement said married sister with great sisterly good nature chapter xviii lily dale first love letter crosbie be rather proud of when went to bed have

regarded a one infected with leprosy from there must be recovery who must therefore make whole life suitable to circumstance of leprosy be of use for to tell that small house at allington be better than courcy castle satan knew that heaven be better than hell found to be fitter for latter place crosbie ridiculed lady dumbello even there among friend with cutting word that wit must find nevertheless privilege of staying in same house with be dear to be line of life into have fallen confessed inwardly that struggle to extricate must be too much for have troubled while be yet at

lily have said have be made acquainted with fascination of lady alexandrina de courcy countess be very civil to saying nothing about engagement still talking to good deal about sojourn at allington crosbie be pleasant man for lady in large house though sportsman be not so keen sportsman a to be always out with gamekeeper though politician did not sacrifice morning to perusal of blue book preparation of party tactic though reading man did not devote to study though horseman be not often to be found in stable must supply conversation when be wanted must take out of way when presence among woman be not needed between breakfast lunch on day following arrival talked good deal to countess made very agreeable continued to ridicule gently for prolonged stay among so primitive rural tribe of people a dale bore little sarcasm with utmost good humour six week at allington without move why mr crosbie must have felt to be growing there so did like ancient tree indeed be so rooted that must hardly get away be house full of people time there be nobody there bernard dale lady julia nephew quite case of damon pythia fancy going down to shade of allington to enjoy uninterrupted pleasure of friendship for six week friendship partridge there be nothing else then indeed there be there be widow with two very nice daughter living not exactly in same house on same ground oh indeed

unromantic people a be fancy men always do sort of thing once twice in life then talk of souvenir suppose wo go beyond souvenir with be direct question still admitted of fencing answer have at rate given one said will last life countess be quite contented that lady julia statement be altogether true have never for moment doubted that crosbie must become engaged to young lady in country whereas have shown sign of being in love with daughter in london be not at wonderful in eye did such practice amount to great sin men did so daily girl be prepared for so doing man in eye be not to be regarded a safe from attack because be engaged let young lady who took upon to own have eye to when looked back on past career of own flock have to reckon more than one such disappointment for own daughter others besides alexandrina have be so treated lady de courcy have have grand hope respecting girl after moderate hope again after bitter disappointment only one have be married be married to attorney be not to be supposed that must have very high toned feeling a to lily right in matter man a crosbie be certainly no great match for earl daughter marriage indeed must one may say be poor triumph when countess during last season in town have observed how matter be going with alexandrina have cautioned child taking to task for imprudence child have be at work for fourteen year be weary of sister have be at work longer have almost given up in despair alexandrina did not tell parent that heart be now beyond control that have devoted to crosbie for ever pouted saying that knew very well what be about scolding mother in return making lady de courcy perceive that struggle be becoming very weary then there be other consideration mr crosbie have not much certainly in own possession be man out of whom something might be made by family influence own standing be not hopeless ponderous man whom leaven must raise be one of whose position in society countess daughter need not be ashamed lady de courcy have given expressed consent to arrangement have come to be understood between daughter that scheme be to be entertained a admissible then came tidings of little girl down at allington felt anger against crosbie to be angry on subject must be futile foolish almost indecorous be part of game be a natural to a fielding be to cricketer one can not have winning at game whether crosbie must eventually become own son in law not came to naturally a part of duty in life to bowl down stump of young lady at allington if miss dale knew game well must protect own wicket let do so have doubt a to crosbie engagement with lilian dale have a little a to being ashamed of engagement have really cared for miss dale must not have left to come to courcy castle have be really resolved to marry must not have warded question respecting engagement with fictitious answer have amused with lily dale be to be hoped that young lady have not thought very seriously about be most charitable light in lady de courcy be disposed to regard question behoved crosbie to write to lily dale before dinner have promised to do so immediately on arrival be aware that must be regarded a being already one day beyond promise lily have told that must live upon letter be absolutely necessary that must furnish with first meal so betook to room in sufficient time before dinner got out pen ink paper got out pen ink paper then found that difficulty be beginning beg that may be understood that crosbie be not altogether villain must not sit down write letter a coming from heart of a wrote knew word to be false be ungenerous worldly inconstant man very prone to think well of to give credit for virtue did not posse must not be false with premeditated cruelty to woman have sworn to love must not write affectionate warm hearted letter to lily without bringing at rate for time to feel towards in affectionate warm hearted way therefore now sat to work while pen yet remained dry in hand to remodel thought have be turned against lily allington by craft of lady de courcy take time before man can do have to struggle with in very uncomfortable way making effort be often unsuccessful be sometimes easier to lift couple of hundredweight than to raise few thought in one mind at other moment will come galloping in without whistle have just written date of letter when little tap came at door be opened say crosbie said honourable john did say something yesterday about cigar before dinner not word said crosbie in rather angry tone then must have be said john bring case with come down to harness room if wo smoke here have have regular little snuggery fitted up there can go in see fellow making up horse crosbie wished honourable john at mischief have letter to write said besides never smoke before dinner be nonsense have smoked hundred of cigar with before dinner be going to turn curmudgeon too like george rest of know what be coming to world suppose fact be little girl at allington wo let smoke little girl at allington began crosbie then reflected that must not be well for to say anything to present companion about little girl will tell what be said really have got letter to write must go by post there cigar case on dressing table hope will be long before be brought to state said john taking up cigar in hand let have case back said crosbie present from little girl suppose said john right old fellow will have there must be nice brother in law for man said crosbie to a door closed behind retreating scion of de courcy family then again took up pen letter must be written therefore threw upon table resolved that word must come paper be filled courcy castle october dearest lily be first letter ever wrote to except little note when sent compliment discreetly sound so odd will think that doe not come a soon a must truth be that after only got in here just before dinner yesterday stayed ever so long in barchester came across queer character for must know went to church afterwards fraternized with clergyman who did service gentle old soul singularly enough be grandfather of lady dumbello who be staying here wonder what 'd think of lady dumbello how 'd like to be shut up in same house with for week with reference to staying at barchester must tell truth now though be gross impostor day went away wanted to avoid parting on last morning therefore started much sooner than need have done know will be very angry with open confession be good for soul frustrated little plan by early rising a saw standing on terrace looking after a went acknowledged that have be right be wrong when time came be very glad to have with at last moment own dearest lily can not think how different place be from two house at allington how much prefer sort of life belongs to latter know have be what world call worldly will have to cure of have questioned very much since left think that be quite beyond reach of cure at rate will put trustingly into doctor hand know be hard for man to change habit can with truth say for be happy at allington enjoying hour of day that here be ennuye by everybody nearly by everything one of girl of house do like a to other people can hardly find companion among let alone friend however must not have done for to have broken away from such alliance too suddenly when get up to london now really be anxious to get there can write to more at ease more freely than do here know that be hardly among people rather be hardly a know a hope always will know nevertheless be not so overcome by miasma what can tell how truly love even though spirit must be here be not heart must be on allington lawn that dear lawn that dear bridge give kind love to bell mother feel already might almost say mother lily darling write to at once expect letter to to be longer better brighter than mine to will endeavour to make mine nicer when get back to town god bless yours with heart c a have waxed warm with writing have forced to be affectionate a flattered frank candid nevertheless be partly conscious that be preparing for mode of escape in allusion of to own worldliness if escape must ultimately be necessary have tried must then say have struggled honestly with best effort for success be not good enough for such success intend to say that wrote with premeditated intention of thus using word a wrote must not keep from reflecting that might be used in way read letter over felt satisfied with resolved that might now free mind from consideration for next forty eight hour might be sin have done duty by lily with comfortable reflection deposited letter in courcy castle letter box chapter xix squire make visit to small house illustration untitled mr dale acknowledged to herself that have not much ground for hoping that must ever find in crosbie house much personal happiness for future life did not dislike mr crosbie in great degree mistrust have seen enough of to make certain that lily future home in london must not be home for be worldly at least man of world must be anxious to make most of income life must be one long struggle not perhaps for money for thing money only can give there be men to whom eight hundred year be great wealth house to brings comfort that life requires crosbie be not such man must house be such house mr dale hoped that lily must be happy with satisfied with mode of life strove to believe that such must be case a regarded herself be forced to confess that in such marriage child must be much divided from pleasant abode to have long looked forward that might have welcome there in coming year must be among field tree not in narrow london street lily must now become city lady bell must still be left to might still be hoped that bell must find for country home since day on lily have first told mother of engagement mr dale have found talking much more fully more frequently with bell than with younger daughter a long a crosbie be at allington be natural enough lily be of course together while bell remained with mother same state of thing continued even after crosbie be gone be not that there be coolness want of affection between mother daughter that lily heart be full of lover that mr dale though have given cordial consent to marriage felt that have few point of sympathy with future son in law have never said even to herself that disliked nay have sometimes declared to herself that be fond of in truth be not man after own heart be not one who must ever be to a own son own child bell must pas hour together talking of lily prospect seems so strange to said mr dale that of girl must have be fancied by such man a mr crosbie that must have liked can not imagine lily living in london if be good affectionate to will be happy wherever be said bell hope so be sure hope so seems a though will be so far separated from be not distance manner of life make separation hope will never be taken so far from think will allow to be taken up to london

of woman must be first to acknowledge a to adolphus know why must distrust dear there be reason if did distrust must not have given so ready assent to marriage nevertheless truth be like mamma not so cordially a hope may like man whom may choose for husband lily though said nothing on subject to mr dale felt that mother be in degree estranged from crosbie name be frequently mentioned between in tone of mr dale voice in manner when spoke of there be lacking that enthusiasm heartiness real sympathy must have produced lily did not analyse own feeling closely make inquiry a to of mother perceived that be not all a must have wished to have be know mamma doe not love said to bell on evening of day on received crosbie first letter not a do lily doe love not a do to say be nonsense bell of course doe not love a do truth be doe not love at do think can not see be afraid that see too much never say word against if really liked must sometimes say word in favour think must ever mention

that must not interfere with in matter without very strong reason a regard mr crosbie gave consent without moment hesitation yes did how can say then that disapproves of did mean to find fault with mamma perhaps will come right will come right bell though made very satisfactory promise be a well aware a of others that family must be divided when crosbie must have married lily taken off to london on following morning mr dale bell be sitting together lily be above in own room either writing to lover reading letter thinking of working for in way be employed on behalf with object be alone be now

also bernard bell exclaimed mr dale idea of such union have ever yet come upon now in surprise sat silent have always liked bernard dale having felt for more family affection than for other of dale family beyond own hearth have be very intimate in house having made almost a brother to girl have never thought of a husband for of then bell have not spoken to about said squire never word have never thought about certainly not have thought about great deal for year have always be thinking of have set heart upon will be very unhappy if can not be brought about be very dear to dearer than anybody else if must see man wife must not much care then how soon left old place to there be purer touch of feeling in than squire have ever before shown in sister in law presence more heartiness than have given credit of possessing must not acknowledge to herself that own child be included in unexpected warmth of love that be bound at rate to entertain gratitude for such kindness be good of to think of said mother very good think great deal about said squire doe not much matter now fact be that have declined bernard offer have bernard offered to so tell have refused may perhaps be natural that must do so never having taught to look at in light of lover blame at be not angry with angry with can hardly be angry with for not being in love with cousin say that be not angry with think might undertake to consider question must like such match must not mr dale did not at first make answer began to revolve thing in mind to look at in various point of view there be great deal in such arrangement at first sight recommended to very strongly local circumstance be in favour a regarded herself must promise to that have ever desired must give prospect of seeing very much of lily for if bell be settled at old family house crosbie must naturally be much with friend liked bernard also for moment two fancied a turned over in mind that even yet if such marriage be to take place there might grow up something like true regard between old squire how happy must be old age in small house if bell with child be living so close to well said squire who be looking very intently into face be thinking said mr dale do say that have already refused be afraid have then know must of course be left for to judge if mean that can not be made to marry cousin of course know ca mean rather more than what do mean then that matter must be left altogether to own decision that persuasion must be used by if can persuade indeed yes exactly must persuade quite agree with that must have liberty to plead own cause look here mary have always be very good child to indeed have word from must go long way with a ought if know that must like to marry cousin will make think duty ah be just what can not try to make think will let speak mary take up scold before word be out of mouth of course know that in day young lady be not to be compelled into marrying anybody not that a far a can see did better than do now when have not quite so much of own way never must take upon to ask child to marry man may explain to that be duty to give such proposal much thought before be absolutely refused girl be in love be not if be be ready to jump down man throat be case with lily never thought of man till have proposed to fully well never mind now if girl be not in love think be bound to swear declare that never will be so think bell ever declared anything of kind yes did told bernard that did love must love in fact that must think anything more about now mary be what call being headstrong positive want to drive want to drive here be arrangement for will be very good one must admit that know that be on excellent term with bernard be a though have be falling out hating other life told that be very fond of talked nonsense about being sister see that be nonsense at yes be nonsense on occasion if man asks girl to marry doe want to talk to about being sister think be nonsense if must only consider about properly must soon learn to love that lesson if be learned at must be learned without tutor wo do anything to help then will at rate hing to mar to tell truth must think over matter fully before can decide what have better say to bell about from not speaking to think ought to have told mr dale have accepted of course must have told have thought of doing so might probably have consulted if made up mind that must reject ought to have made up mind if did seems natural to that must speak of to one might probably think that bernard must be a well pleased that must not be known psha known of course will be known a want time to consider of will say nothing more now if be daughter must have hesitation in telling what thought best for welfare have none though may have in making up mind a to what be best for welfare mr dale may be sure of will speak to very earnestly of kindness love for wish must believe that feel regard for very strongly in answer to merely shook head hummed hawed must be glad to see married a regard asked certainly must said mr dale have always liked bernard believe girl must be safe with then see be question on own liking dislikings must not have bearing so parted squire making way back again through drawing room window be not above half pleased with interview then be man for whom half pleasure almost sufficed rarely indulged expectation that people must make agreeable to mr dale since have come to small house have never be source of satisfaction to did not on account regret that have brought there be constant man urgent in carrying out own plan not sanguine in doing so by mean apt to expect that thing must go smooth with have made up mind that nephew niece must be married must ultimately fail in such failure must probably embitter future life be not in nature of man to be angry in meantime to fume scold because met with opposition have told mr dale that loved bell dearly so did though seldom spoke to with much show of special regard never be soft tender with on other hand did not now love le because opposed wish be constant undemonstrative man given rather to brooding than to thinking harder in word than in thought with more of heart than others believed than knew above be man who having once desired thing must desire always mr dale when be left alone began to turn over question in mind in much fuller manner than squire presence have a yet made possible for must not such marriage a be for happiest domestic arrangement circumstance must afford daughter must have fortune here must be prepared for comfort fortune can give must be received into uncle house not a penniless portionless bride whom bernard might have married brought home a wife whom of others bernard friend have thought desirable for then a regarded mr dale there must be nothing in such marriage must not be delightful to must give realization to dream of future happiness a said to herself over over again must go for nothing must be for bell for only to answer bernard question in mind there be something sacred in idea of love must regard daughter almost a castaway if be to marry man without absolutely loving loving a lily loved lover with heart strength with conviction a strong upon felt that must not say much to bell must be of service chapter xx dr croft if there be anything in world a to isabella dale be quite certain be that be not in love with dr croft a to being in love with cousin bernard have never have occasion to ask question on head liked very well have never thought of marrying now when made proposal must not bring to think of a regard dr croft have thought of have made up mind in manner above described may be said that must not have be justified in discussing matter even within own bosom unless authorized to do so by dr croft let then be considered that dr croft have given such authority may be done in more way than one miss dale must not have found asking question about unless there have be fitting occasion for to do so profession of medical man in small provincial town be not often one give to owner in early life large income perhaps in career have man to work harder for what earns to do more work without earning anything have sometimes seemed to a though young doctor old doctor have agreed to divide between different result of profession young doctor doing work old doctor taking money if be so may account for appearance of premature gravity be borne by so many of medical profession under such arrangement man may be excused for desire to put away childish thing very early in life dr croft have now be practising in guestwick nearly seven year having settled in town when be twenty three year old being at period about thirty during seven year skill industry have be so fully admitted that have succeeded in obtaining medical care of pauper in union for work be paid at rate of one hundred pound year be also assistant surgeon at small hospital be maintained in town held two three other similar public position of attested respectability general proficiency moreover thoroughly saved from of danger of idleness unfortunately did not enable to regard a successful professional man whereas old dr gruffen of whom few people spoke well have made fortune in guestwick even still drew from ailment of town considerable hardly yet decreasing income now be hard upon dr croft unless there be existing such well understood arrangement a above named have be known to family of dale long previous to settlement at guestwick have be very intimate with from time to present day of men young old whom mr dale counted among intimate friend be one whom most trusted admired be man to be trusted by who knew well be not bright always ready a be crosbie have practical worldly good sense of bernard dale in mental power doubt whether be superior to john eames to john eames such a might become when period of hobbledehoyhood must have altogether passed away croft compared with other three a be at present be man more to be trusted than of there be moreover about occasional dash of humour without mr dale must hardly have regarded with thorough liking have for be quiet humour apt to show when have one friend with rather than in general society crosbie on other hand must be much more bright among dozen than must with single companion bernard dale be never bright a for johnny eames in matter of brightness johnny eames have not yet shown to world what character might be be now two year since croft have be called upon for medical advice on behalf of friend mr dale have then be ill for long period two three month dr croft have be frequent in visit at allington at time became very intimate with mr dale daughter especially so with eldest young unmarried doctor ought perhaps to be excluded from house in there be young lady know at rate that many sage matron hold very strongly to opinion thinking doubt that doctor ought to get married before venture to begin working for living mr dale perhaps regarded own girl a still merely child for bell elder be then hardly eighteen perhaps held imprudent heterodox opinion on subject may be that selfishly preferred dr croft with danger to child to dr gruffen with danger to herself result be that young doctor one day informed a be riding back to guestwick much of happiness in world must depend on being able to marry mr dale eldest daughter at time total income amounted to little more than two hundred year have resolved within own mind that dr gruffen be esteemed a much better doctor by general public opinion of guestwick that dr gruffen sandy haired assistant must even have better chance of success in town than must ever come to pas that doctor be esteemed too old for personal practice croft have fortune of own be aware that miss dale have none then under circumstance what be to do be not necessary that must inquire at great length into love passage of doctor life took place three year before commencement of narrative made declaration to bell bell young a be understood well that must fain have done so have not courage failed rather have not prudence prevented to mr dale did speak not openly avowing love even to hinting at then talking to of unsatisfied hope professional disappointment be not complain of being poor a be said at rate not so poor that poverty must be source of discomfort to must hardly marry with such income a have at present will increase will not said mr dale may day when be becoming old man said of what use will be to then mr dale must not tell that a far a voice in matter went be welcome to woo daughter marry poor a be doubly poor a must be together on pittance have not even mentioned bell name have done so must only have bade wait hope after that said nothing further to upon subject to bell spoke word of overt love on autumn day when mr dale be already convalescent repetition of professional visit have become unnecessary got to walk with through half hidden shrubbery path then told thing must never have told if really wished to bind heart to repeated that story of income explained to that poverty be only grievous to in that prevented from thinking of marriage suppose must said bell must think wrong to ask lady to share income a mine said whereupon bell have suggested to that lady have income of own that might in way get over difficulty must be afraid of in marrying girl with money said besides that be altogether out of question now of course bell did not ask why be out of question for time went on walking in silence be hard thing to do then said not looking at looking at gravel on stood be hard thing to do will determine to think of further believe man may be a happy single a may married almost perhaps more so said bell then doctor left bell a have said before made up mind with great firmness that be not in love with may certainly say that there be nothing in world a to be so certain a be of now in day dr croft did not come over to allington very often have of family in small house be ill must have be there of course squire employed apothecary in village if higher aid be needed must send for dr gruffen on occasion of mr dale party croft be there having be specially invited mr dale special invitation to friend be very few doctor be well aware that must make occasion for going there if desired to see inmate of house very rarely made such occasion perhaps

declared that have be happier at allington than be at courcy believed thoroughly rejoiced that must be so when accused of being worldly excused persuading that be nearly perfect in respect a in others

lily wrote first letter to crosbie be sweet good honest love letter full of assurance of unalterable affection unlimited confidence indulging in little quiet fun a to grandee of courcy castle ending with promise that must be happy contented if might receive letter constantly live with hope of seeing at christmas be in time mr crump be not said a walked into post office of course be for next half hour t postman bai stirred from t ale'us yet just put into t ' box wull ye wo leave there leave there did ever hear like of if be afeared to put in can take away be about miss lily then mr crump

home declare to mother sister a affianced bride what mode of escape must then be left for have not yet done have even answered cruel missive what as be to be afraid of said to a walked along under elm of guestwick manor overspread road to allington when first went over to allington after return home have mounted on horseback have gone forth brilliant with spur trusting somewhat to glory of dress glove have then known nothing of lily engagement now be contented to walk a have taken up slouched hat stick in passage of mother house have be very indifferent a to appearance walked quickly along road taking for first three mile shade of guestwick elm keeping foot on broad greensward skirt outside of earl paling what as be to be afraid of a swung big stick in hand striking tree here there knocking stone from path began to question in earnest to be ashamed of position in world nothing on earth will make marry said not if bring dozen action against know a well a do have never intended to marry be cheat from beginning to end if come down here will tell so before mother a vision of sudden arrival came before eye acknowledged to that still held in great fear have told that loved have written a much a if taxed with so much must confess sin then by degree mind turned away from amelia roper to lily dale not giving prospect much more replete with enjoyment than other one have said that must call at allington before returned to town be now redeeming promise did not know why must go there felt that must sit silent abashed in mr dale drawing room confessing by demeanour that secret behoved now to hide from one must not talk easily before lily must speak to of only subject must occupy thought when in presence if indeed might find alone perhaps might be worse for than other condition when be shown into drawing room there be nobody there be here minute ago three said servant girl if will walk down garden mr john will be sure to find of 'em so john eames with little hesitation walked down garden first of all went whole way round walk meeting nobody then crossed lawn returning again to farther end there emerging from little path led from great house encountered lily alone oh john said how d 'ye do be afraid did not find anybody in house mamma bell be with hopkins away in large kitchen garden have just come over said eames because promised said 'd come before went back to london will be very glad to see so be will go after into other ground perhaps walked over be tired did walk said eames not that be very tired in truth did not wish to go after mr dale though be altogether at loss a to what must say to lily while remaining with have fancied that must like to have opportunity of speaking to alone before went away of making special use of last interview must have with before became married woman now opportunity be there hardly dared to avail of will stay dine with said lily will not do for especially told mother must be back be sure be very good of to walk so far to see if really be not tired think will go to mamma a must be very sorry to miss said remembering at moment what have be crosbie injunction to about john eames john have resolved that must say word have come to speak that a lily be there with must avail of chance fortune have given think will go into squire garden said uncle christopher be not there be about farm somewhere if mind lily think will stay here suppose will be back soon of course must like to see before go away to london lily came over now chiefly to see be who asked to promise have crosbie be right in remark of have be imprudent in little endeavour to be cordially kind to old friend will go into drawing room said feeling that must be in degree safer there than out among shrub path of garden think be right in man will talk of love out among lilac rose who must be stricken dumb by demure propriety of four wall of drawing room john eames also have feeling of kind for determined to remain out in garden if must so manage want to go in unless wish said indeed 'd rather stay here so lily be going to be married thus rushed at once into middle of discourse yes said believe be have not told yet that congratulated have known very well that did so in heart have always be sure that wished well indeed have if congratulating person be hoping that may always be happy do congratulate lily then paused abashed by beauty purity woman grace have forced to love think understand that must say want ordinary word to tell be to count among best friend lily understand must say have never known how often how much have thought of how dearly have loved john must not talk of now can not go without telling when came over here mr dale told that be to be married to man must not speak of mr crosbie in way said turning upon almost fiercely did not mean to say anything disrespectful of to must hate if be to do so of course like better than anybody else love better than world besides so do love better than world besides a spoke got up from seat stood before know how poor be unworthy of only that be engaged to suppose must now tell of course must accept such one a have loved ever since remember now that be going to be wife can not tell that be so will go live in london a to seeing there will be impossible must not go into man house oh john never not if become wife have loved a well a doe when mr dale told of thought must have fallen went away without seeing because be unable to speak to made fool of myself have be fool all along be foolish now to tell can not help will forget when meet girl that can really love have not really loved well never mind have said what came to say will now go if ever happens that be down in country together perhaps may see again never in london good by lily put out hand to illustration have not really loved wo stay for mamma said give love to bell understand about will know why have gone if ever must want anybody to do anything for remember will do whatever be a paced away from across lawn special deed in favour to mind be turned that one thing most longed to do on behalf be act of corporal chastisement upon crosbie if crosbie must ill treat ill treat with antenuptial barbarity if only must be called in to avenge wrong a made way back along road towards guestwick built up within own bosom castle in air for part in lily dale must by mean have thanked lily when be left alone burst into tear have certainly said very little to encourage forlorn suitor have so borne during interview that even crosbie must hardly have be dissatisfied now that eames be gone heart became very tender towards felt that did love also not at all a loved crosbie still with love be tender soft true if crosbie must have known thought at moment doubt whether must have liked burst into tear then hurried away into nook where must not be seen by mother bell on return eames went on way walking very quietly swinging stick kicking through dust with heart full of scene have just passed be angry with thinking that have played part badly accusing in that have be rough to selfish in expression of love be angry with because have declared to that loved crosbie better than world besides knew that of course must do so that at rate be to be expected that such be case yet thought might have refrained from saying so to chooses to scorn now said to time may come when will wish that have scorned that crosbie be wicked bad selfish believed most fully felt sure that man must ill use make wretched have slight doubt whether must marry from doubt endeavoured to draw scrap of comfort if crosbie must desert if to might be accorded privilege of beating man to death with fist because of desertion then world must not be quite blank for in be doubt very cruel to lily then have not lily be very cruel to be still thinking of thing when came to first of guestwick pasture boundary of earl property be very plainly marked for with commenced also shady elm along roadside broad green margin of turf grateful equally to who walked to who rode eames have got on to grass in fulness of thought be unconscious of change in path when be startled by voice in next field loud bellowing of bull lord de guest choice cattle knew be there there be one special bull be esteemed by lordship a of great value regarded a high favourite people about place declared that beast be vicious lord de guest have often be heard to boast that be never vicious with boy tease men be almost worse than boy said earl will never hurt one have not hurt guided by faith in own teaching earl have taught to look upon bull a large horned innocent lamb of flock a eames paused on road fancied that recognized earl voice be voice of one in distress then bull roar sounded very plain in ear almost close upon hearing rushed on to gate without much thinking what be doing vaulted over advanced few step into field halloo shouted earl there be man come on then continued shouting hardly formed into intelligible word eames plainly understood that be invoking assistance under great pressure stress of circumstance bull be making short run at owner a though determined in run to have toss at lordship at run earl must retreat quickly for few pace retreated always facing enemy a animal got near to must make dig at face with long spud carried in hand in thus making good retreat have be unable to keep in direct line to gate there seemed to be great danger lest bull must succeed in pressing up against hedge come on shouted earl who be fighting battle manfully be by mean anxious to carry off laurel of victory come on say then stopped in path shouted into bull face brandished spud threw about arm thinking that might best dismay beast by display of warlike gesture johnny eames ran on gallantly to peer assistance a must have run to of peasant in land be one to whom must be perhaps wrong to attribute at period of life gift of very high courage feared many thing man must fear did not fear personal mishap injury to own skin bone when cradell escaped out of house in burton crescent making way through passage into outer air did so because feared that lupex must beat kick otherwise ill use john eames must also have desired to escape under similar circumstance must have so desired because must not endure to be looked upon in difficulty by people of house because imagination must have painted horror of policeman dragging off with black eye torn coat there be one to see now policeman to take offence therefore rushed to earl assistance brandishing stick roaring in emulation of bull when animal saw with what unfairness be treated that number of foe be doubled while assistance have lent on side stood for while disgusted by injustice of humanity stopped throwing head up to heaven bellowed out complaint come close said earl who be almost out of breath keep little apart ugh ugh whoop whoop threw up arm manfully jobbing about with spud ever anon rubbing perspiration from off eyebrow with back of hand a bull stood pausing meditating whether under such circumstance flight must not be preferable to gratified passion eames made rush in at attempting to hit on head earl seeing advanced step also got spud almost up to animal eye indignity beast must not stand made charge bending head first towards john eames then with weak vacillation be a disgraceful in bull a in general changed purpose turned horn upon other enemy consequence be that step carried in between two that earl eames found for while behind tail now for gate said earl slowly doe slowly doe run said johnny assuming in heat of moment tone of counsel must have be very foreign to under other circumstance earl be not whit offended right said taking with backward motion direction of gate then a bull again faced towards jumped from ground labouring painfully with arm leg ever keeping spud well advanced against foe eames holding position little apart from friend stooped low beat ground with stick a though defying creature bull felt defied stood still roared then made vacillating attack hold on till reach gate said eames ugh ugh whoop whoop shouted earl so gradually made good ground now get over said eames when have reached corner of field in gate stood what will do said earl will go at hedge to right johnny a spoke dashed stick about so a to monopolize for moment attention of brute earl made spring at gate got well on to upper rung bull seeing that prey be going made final rush upon earl struck timber furiously with head knocking lordship down on other side lord de guest be already over not off rail thus though fell fell in safety on sward beyond gate fell in safety utterly exhausted eames a have purposed made leap almost sideways at thick hedge divided field from one

chapter xxiii mr plantagenet palliser week passed over mr crosbie head at courcy castle without much inconvenience to from well known fact of matrimonial engagement george de courcy john de courcy have in different way charged with offence endeavoured to annoy by recurring to subject did not care much for wit malice of george john de courcy countess have hardly alluded to lily dale after few word said on first day of visit seemed perfectly willing to regard doings at allington a occupation natural to young man in position have be seduced down to dull country house have a matter of course taken to such amusement a place afforded have shot partridge made love to young lady taking little recreation a compensation for tedium of squire society perhaps have gone little too far with young lady then one knew better than countess how difficult be for young man to go far enough without going too far be not business to make censor on young man conduct blame doubt rested quite a much with miss dale a with be quite sorry that young lady must be disappointed if girl will be imprudent set cap at men above mark must encounter disappointment with such language did lady de courcy speak of affair among daughter daughter altogether agreed with that be out of question that mr crosbie must marry lily dale from alexandrina encountered during week none of raillery have expected have promised to explain to before left castle circumstance of acquaintance with lily at last showed determined to demand fulfilment of promise previous to said nothing to manifest offence lessened friendship regret to say that in intercourse have taken place between that friendship be by mean tender that have be in london when will tell what promised asked one afternoon speaking in low voice a be standing together at window of billiard room in idle hour always occurs before necessity for dinner preparation have come have be riding be still in habit have returned from shooting knew that looked more than ordinarily well in tall straight hat riding gear be wont to hang about house walking skilfully with upheld drapery during period of day be dusk not dark there be artificial light in billiard room there have be pretence of knocking about ball have be only pretence even diana have said must not have played billiards in habit then have put down mace have stood talking together in recess of large bow window what did promise said crosbie know well enough not that be matter of special interest to only a undertook to promise of course curiosity have be raised if be of special interest said crosbie will not object to absolve from promise be just like said how false men always be made up mind to buy silence on distasteful subject by pretending to offer future confidence now tell that mean to confide in begin by telling that matter be one doe not in least interest be so false again know very well what meant do remember what said to day came be not bound to tell after that marriage with that young lady be not matter of special interest to still a friend well a friend will be glad to know be not going to beg for confidence only tell fairly that man be so mean in eye a man who fight under false colour be fighting under false colour yes be now a spoke lady alexandrina blushed beneath hat dull a be remaining light of evening crosbie looking into face saw heightened colour yes be gentleman be fighting under false colour who come into house like with public rumour of being engaged then conduct a though nothing of kind existed of course be not anything to specially be fighting under false colour now sir may redeem promise made when first came here may let alone must be acknowledged that lady be fighting battle with much courage also with skill in three four day crosbie must be gone victory if be ever to be gained must be gained in three four day if there be to be victory then must be only fair that crosbie must be punished for duplicity that must be avenged a far a revenge might be in power not that meditated deep revenge be prepared to feel strong anger liked crosbie a well a have ever liked man believed that liked also have conception of very strong passion conceived that married life be more pleasant than one of single bliss have doubt that have promised to make lily dale wife so have previously promised nearly so be fair game must win if must if failed must show anger must show in mild weak manner turning up nose at lily before crosbie face saying little thing against behind back wrath must not carry much beyond now sir may redeem promise made when first came here may let alone so spoke then turned face away from gazing out into darkness alexandrina said well sir have right to speak to in style know that have right to call by name in way mean that insist upon title lady insist on what call title from gentleman except under privilege of greater intimacy than have right to claim did not call miss dale by christian name till have obtained permission suppose used to let call so never once twice when have done so have not forbidden a must have done very well sir a have nothing to tell will leave must confess that did not think be coward prepared to go gathering up skirt of habit taking up whip have laid on window sill stay moment alexandrina said be not happy must not say word intended to make more miserable why be unhappy because will tell instantly if may believe that be telling only not whole household of course will not talk of to others do think that can not keep secret be because have promised to marry one woman because love have told everything now if choose to say again that be fighting under false colour will leave castle before can see again mr crosbie now know may imagine whether be very happy think said be time to dress suppose go without further speech two went off to separate room crosbie a soon a be alone in chamber sat down in arm chair went to work striving to make up mind a to future conduct must not be supposed that declaration just made by have be produced solely by difficulty at moment atmosphere of courcy castle have be at work upon for last week past word that have heard word that have spoken have tended to destroy be good true within to foster be selfish false have said to dozen time during week that never must be happy with lily dale that never must make happy then have used old sophistry in endeavour to teach that be right to do wished to do must not be better for lily that must desert than marry against dictate of own heart if really did not love must not be committing greater crime in marrying than in deserting confessed to that have be very wrong in allowing outer world to get such hold upon that love of pure girl like lily must not suffice for happiness there be fact found unable to contend against if by absolute self sacrifice must secure lily well being must not hesitate for moment must be well to sacrifice a well a have discussed matter in way within own breast till have almost taught to believe that be duty to break off engagement with lily have also almost taught to believe that marriage with daughter of house of courcy must satisfy ambition assist in battle with world lady alexandrina must accept felt certain if must only induce to forgive for sin in becoming engaged to miss dale how very prone must be to forgiveness in matter have not divined having not a yet learned how easily woman can forgive such sin if ultimate triumph be accorded to there be reason operated much with crosbie urging on in present mood wish though must have given exactly opposite impulse to heart have hesitated a to marrying lily dale at once because of smallness of income now have prospect of considerable increase to income one of commissioner at office have be promoted to greater commissionership be understood by everybody that secretary at general committee office must be new commissioner a to that there be doubt then question have arisen a to place of secretary crosbie have received two three letter on subject seemed that likelihood of obtaining step in world be by mean slight must increase official income from seven hundred year to twelve must place altogether above world friend present secretary have written to assuring that other probable competitor be spoken of a being in field against if such good fortune awaited must not smooth present difficulty lay in way of marriage with lily dale ala have not looked at matter in light might not countess help to preferment if destiny intended for good thing of world secretaryship commissionerships chairmanship such like must not be well that must struggle on in upward path by such assistance a good connection might give sat thinking over in own room on evening have written twice to lily since arrival at courcy castle first letter have be given second be written much in same tone though lily a have read have unconsciously felt somewhat le satisfied than have be with first expression of love be not wanting be vague without heartiness savoured of insincerity though there be nothing in word to convict few liar can lie with full roundness self sufficiency of truth crosbie bad a be have not yet become bad enough to reach perfection have said nothing to lily of hope of promotion have be opened to have again spoken of own worldliness acknowledging that received unsatisfying satisfaction from pomp vanity of courcy castle in fact be paving way for have almost resolved that must do now have told lady alexandrina that loved be obliged to confess to that die be cast a thought of there be not wanting to of satisfaction of escape soon after making declaration of love at allington have begun to feel that in making have cut throat have endeavoured to persuade that must live comfortably with throat cut in way a long a lily be with must believe that must do so a soon a be again alone must again accuse of suicide be frame of mind even while be yet at allington idea on subject have become stronger during sojourn at courcy self immolation have not be completed now began to think that must save need hardly say that be not triumph to even have there be material difficulty a to desertion of lily uncle cousin mother whose anger must face vision of pale face more eloquent of wrong in silence than even uncle cousin mother with indignant storm of word be not altogether heartless how must tell to girl who have loved so well who have so loved that a felt love must fashion future life for weal for woe be unworthy of will tell so said to how many false hound of man have endeavoured to salve own conscience by such mock humility acknowledged at moment a rose from seat to dress that die be cast that be open to now to say what pleased to lady alexandrina others have gone through same fire before said to a walked downstairs have come out scatheless then recalled to name of various men of high repute in world who be supposed to have committed in younger day such little mistake a into have be betrayed in passing through hall overtook lady julia de guest be in time to open for door of drawing room then remembered that have come into billiard room at one side have gone out at other while be standing with alexandrina at window have not however then thought much of lady julia a now stood for to pas by through door way made to indifferent remark lady julia be on subject stern woman not without certain amount of courage in last week have seen what have be going on have become more more angry though have disowned family connection with lily dale nevertheless now felt for sympathy almost affection nearly day have repeated stiffly to countess incident of crosbie courtship engagement to miss dale speaking of a with absolute knowledge a thing settled at point have done to countess alone in presence of countess alexandrina also before female guest of castle what have said be received simply with incredulous smile dear lady julia countess have replied at last will begin to think be in love with mr crosbie harp so constantly on affair of one must think that young lady in part of world must find very difficult to get husband seeing that success of one young lady be trumpeted so loudly for moment lady julia be silenced be not easy to silence altogether when have subject for speech near heart almost courcy world be assembled in drawing room a now walked into room with crosbie at heel when found near crowd turned round addressed in voice more audible than generally required for purpose of drawing room conversation mr crosbie said have heard lately from dear friend lily dale looked full in face in manner more significant probably than even have intended to be there be at once general hush in room eye be turned upon upon crosbie instantly made effort to bear attack gallantly felt that must not quite command colour prevent sudden drop of perspiration from showing upon brow have letter from allington yesterday said suppose have heard of brother encounter with bull bull said lady julia be instantly manifest to that attack have be foiled flank turned good gracious lady julia how very odd be said countess what about bull asked honourable george seems that earl be knocked down in middle of one of own field oh dear exclaimed alexandrina sundry other exclamation be made by assembled lady

pleasantry in idea of lord de guest having be tossed by even be tickled only knocked down believe said crosbie have have have growled earl then filled glass allowed one else to pas bottle poor man there be not much left to now in world did amuse see anything to laugh at said plantagenet palliser who be sitting at earl right hand opposite to lord dumbello said earl have have have will be shot if

youth to work in order that in old age might be allowed to sit among councillor of state hitherto name have not be coupled by world with of woman whom have be supposed to admire latterly have be observed that have often be seen in same room with lady dumbello have hardly amounted to more than when be remembered how undemonstrative be two person concerned how little disposed be of to strong display of feeling even be thought matter to be mentioned certainly must speak to from time to time almost with air of interest lady dumbello when saw that be in room must be observed to raise head with little show of life to look round a though there be something there on might be worth while to allow eye to rest when such innuendo be abroad one must probably make more of than lady de courcy many when heard that mr palliser be to be at castle have expressed surprise at success in quarter others when learned that lady dumbello have consented to become guest have also wondered greatly when be ascertained that two be to be there together good natured friend have acknowledged that be very clever woman to have mr palliser lady dumbello must have be feather in cap to succeed in getting by enabling to know that other must be there be indeed triumph a regard lady dumbello however bargain be not fairly carried out for after mr palliser came to courcy castle only for two night day during

mr palliser attention when sauntered into drawing room be sitting alone in large low chair made without arm so a to admit full expansion of dress hollowed round at back so a to afford support be necessary to have barely spoken three word since have left dining room time have not passed heavily with lady julia have again attacked countess about lily dale mr crosbie alexandrina driven almost to rage have stalked off to farther end of room not concealing special concern in matter how do wish be married done with said countess then must hear more about of lady dumbello heard understood in of

hard work in manner of working there have sat speechless unless when acknowledging by low word of assent expression of flattery from around then door opened when mr palliser entered raised head faintest possible gleam of satisfaction might have be discerned upon feature made attempt to speak to when a stood at table took up book remained thus standing for quarter of hour showed felt impatience after lord dumbello came in stood at table without book even then lady dumbello felt impatience plantagenet palliser skimmed through little book probably learned something when put down

lily dale have loved now declared to that must have continued to love through whole life what be there for man to love in alexandrina de courcy while resolving during first four five day at castle that must throw lily dale overboard have contrived to quiet conscience by inward allusion to sundry hero of romance have thought of lothario don juan of lovelace have told that world have ever be full

two o'clock neglecting mr butterwell office paper not stirring from seat till messenger summoned before board board a entered room be not such board a public may perhaps imagine such board to be there be round table with few pen lying about comfortable leathern arm chair at side of farthest from door sir raffle buffle be leaving late colleague be standing with back to fire place talking very loudly sir raffle be great bully board be uncommonly glad to be rid of a be to be last appearance at committee office submitted to voice meekly mr butterwell be standing close to essaying to laugh mildly at sir raffle joke little man hardly more than five foot high with small honest looking eye close cut hair be standing behind arm chair rubbing hand together longing for departure of sir raffle in order that might sit down be mr optimist new chairman in praise of whose appointment daily jupiter have be so loud declaring that present minister be showing superior to minister who have ever gone before in giving promotion solely on score of merit daily jupiter fortnight since have published very eloquent article strongly advocating claim of mr optimist be naturally pleased to find that advice have be taken have not obedient minister right to praise of power obeys illustration board mr optimist be in truth industrious little gentleman very well connected who have served public life who be at rate honest in dealing be bully such a predecessor might however be question whether carried gun enough for command in be now to be employed there be one other member of board major fiasco by name discontented broken hearted silent man who have be sent to general committee office few year before because be not wanted anywhere else be man who have intended to do great thing when entered public life have possessed talent energy for thing moderately great have also possessed to certain extent ear of high in office in way matter have not gone well with in running course have gone on wrong side of post be still in prime of life yet men knew that major fiasco have nothing further to expect from public from government indeed there be not wanting who said that major fiasco be already in receipt of liberal income for gave work in return that merely filled chair for four hour day four five day week signing name to certain form document reading pretending to read certain paper in truth doing good major fiasco on other hand considered to be deeply injured individual spent life in brooding over wrong believed now in nothing in nobody have begun public life striving to be honest now regarded around a dishonest have satisfaction in man other than found when event must show to that that other compeer of own have proved to be interested false fraudulent tell butterwell must say for with mr

think world so bad a fiasco made out to be did for butterwell believed in many thing believed in putney villa on earth believed also that might achieve sort of putney villa in world beyond without undergoing present martyrdom putney villa first with attendant comfort then duty to public afterwards be thus that mr butterwell regulated conduct a be solicitous that villa must be a comfortable home to wife a to that must be specially comfortable to friend think that need quarrel with creed mr optimist believed in everything especially believed in prime minister in daily jupiter in general committee office in have long thought that everything be nearly right now that be chairman at general committee office be quite sure that everything must be right in sir raffle buffle indeed have never believed now be perhaps greatest joy of life that must never again be called upon to hear tone of terrible knight hated voice seeing who be component of new board may be presumed that crosbie must look forward to enjoying not uninfluential position in office there be indeed among clerk who did not hesitate to say that new secretary must have pretty nearly own way a for old opt there must be said difficulty about only tell that such such decision be own must be sure to believe teller butterwell be not fond of work have be accustomed to lean upon crosbie for many year a for fiasco must be cynical in word wholly indifferent in deed if whole office be made to go to mischief fiasco in own grim way must enjoy confusion wish joy crosbie said sir raffle standing up on rug waiting for new

wicked thing have be done be quite ready to hate crosbie a crosbie ought to be hated a regarded made unhappy to think that world might probably expect to punish man who have so lately be friend then did not know where to catch how to thrash when caught be very sorry for cousin felt strongly that crosbie must not be allowed to escape what be to do must like to go anywhere said squire again anxious

introduced wolf into flock always thought very much of at club said bernard know much about london club now day said uncle do wish to do so if society of man can be endured after what have now done suppose dozen men will ever know anything about said bernard umph ejaculated squire must not say that wished crosbie villany to be widely discussed seeing that lily name be so closely connected with

eames took heart of grace have laughter out dinner be very dull before colonel went to bed johnny regretted that have be induced to dine at pawkins might be very fine thing to be asked to dinner with earl john eames have perhaps received at office little accession of dignity from circumstance of have be not unpleasantly aware a sat at table on there be four five apple plate of dried nut looking at earl a endeavoured to keep eye open at colonel to whom seemed absolutely matter of indifference whether companion be asleep awake confessed to that price be paying be almost too dear mr roper tea table be not pleasant to even must have be preferable to black dinginess of pawkins mahogany with company of two tired old men with whom seemed to have mutual subject of conversation once twice tried word with colonel for colonel sat with eye open looking at fire be answered with monosyllable be evident to that colonel did not wish to talk to sit still with hand closed over other on lap be work enough for colonel dale during after dinner hour earl knew what be going on during terrible conflict between slumber in drowsy god fairly vanquished for twenty minute conscience be always accusing of treating guest badly be very angry with tried to arouse talk brother in law must not help in effort even eames be not bright in rendering assistance then for twenty minute slept soundly at end of that woke with one of own snort by george said jumping up standing on rug will have coffee after that did not sleep more dale said wo take more wine illustration wo take more wine nothing more said colonel

abominable rascal that ever met in life wish be lily dale brother then sat down again remembering that be speaking in presence of lily uncle of father of bernard dale who might be supposed to occupy place of lily brother colonel turned head round looked at young man with surprise beg pardon sir said eames have known mr dale niece life oh have said colonel nevertheless be perhaps a well not to make too free with young lady name not that blame in least mr eames must think not said earl honour for feeling johnny boy if ever be unfortunate enough to meet that man will tell mind believe will do

arrowroot in own room will ring bell for candle said host then colonel went a door be closed behind earl raised two hand uttered that single word negus whereupon johnny burst out laughing coming round to fire sat down in arm chair colonel have left have doubt be right said earl must like to drink negus yet to have arrowroot up in bedroom suppose there be harm in oh dear wonder what pawkins say

bull lily who remembered accurately passage of last interview with john eames said nothing felt in sort sore at idea that must be so near at time in unconscious way have liked for coming to saying

asked to come have be told that be to be there be bernard going indeed be not said bernard will come over dine with half formed idea flitted across lily mind teaching to imagine for moment that might possibly be concerned in arrangement thought vanished a quickly a came merely leaving soreness behind there be certain malady make whole body sore patient let be touched on point let even be nearly touched will roar with agony a though whole body have be bruised so be also with malady of mind sorrow such a of poor lily leave heart sore at point compel sufferer to be ever in fear of new wound lily bore cross bravely well not le did weigh heavily upon at turn because have strength to walk a though did not bear nothing happened to in presence did not in way connect with misery uncle be going over to meet john eames at lord de guest of course men there must talk about such talking be injury to afternoon of day did not pas away brightly a long a servant be in room dinner went on much a other dinner at such time certain amount of hypocrisy must always be practised in closely domestic circle at mixed dinner party people can talk before richard william same word that must use if richard william be not there people so mixed talk together inward home thought when close friend be together little conscious reticence be practised till door be tiled at meeting a conscious reticence be of service created effect be salutary when door be tiled when servant be gone how must be merry together by what mirth must beard be made to wag on christmas day father have be up in town said bernard be with lord de guest at pawkins why did go see asked mr dale well know did not seem to wish will go down to torquay in february must be up in london know in fortnight for good then be silent again for few minute if bernard must have owned truth must have acknowledged that have not gone up to london because did not yet know how to treat crosbie when must meet thought on matter threw sort of shadow across poor lily mind making feel that wound be again opened want to give up profession altogether said squire speaking firmly slowly must be better think for of that must do so must be wise at time of life said mr dale when have be doing so well think must be wise if be son must be thought better that must live here upon property among people who be to become tenant than remain up in london perhaps be sent to india have one profession a heir of place that think must be enough must have idle life of down here said bernard must be own fault if did a must have life must not be idle in be alluding to bernard proposed marriage a to that nothing further must be said in bell presence bell understood sat quite silent with demure countenance perhaps even with something of sternness in face fact be said mr dale speaking in low tone having well considered what be about to say bernard be not exactly same a son why not said squire have even offered to settle property on if will leave service owe so much a must owe son therefore doe not owe a much a must owe father if mean can not constrain know well enough a regard money have offered to do for quite a much a father must feel called upon to do for only son hope think ungrateful said bernard think unmindful have nothing more to say about however not about that if must marry then stopped feeling that must not go on in bell presence if must marry said mr dale may well be that wife must like house of own must have house said squire angrily be big enough only want one room for myself 'd give up if be necessary be nonsense said mr dale be nonsense said squire will be squire of allington for next twenty year said mr dale a long a be squire will be master of house at least hope so approve of monarch abdicating in favour of young people think uncle christopher must look at well like charles fifth said lily must always keep cell for darling if did said squire regarding with painful special tenderness lily who be sitting next to mr dale put hand out secretly got hold of mother thereby indicating that did not intend to occupy cell offered to by uncle to look to a companion of monastic seclusion after there be nothing more then said a to bernard prospect mr hearn be dining at vicarage suppose asked squire yes went in after church said bell saw go with mr boyce told never must dine with again after dark in winter said mr dale last time be there boy let lamp blow out a be going home lost way truth be be angry because mr boyce did go with be always angry said squire hardly speaks to now when paid rent other day to jolliffe said hoped must do much good a though thought brute for taking so doe said bernard be very old know said bell 'd give house for nothing if be uncle said lily dear if be must not must be very wrong to do so why must mr hearn have house for nothing more than meat clothes must be much more reasonable be to give so much money into hand yearly must be wrong in to do so seeing that be not object of charity must be wrong in to take must take said mr dale think must if did be sure must grumble because be double amount if mr boyce have gone home with must have grumbled because walked too fast be very old said bell again nevertheless ought to know better than to speak disparagingly of to servant must have more respect for herself squire showed by tone of voice that thought very much about be very long very dull that christmas evening making bernard feel strongly that must be very foolish to give up profession tie down to life at allington woman be more accustomed than men to long dull unemployed hour therefore mr dale daughter bore tedium courageously while yawned stretched went in out of room sat demurely listening a squire laid down law on small matter contradicting occasionally when spirit of of prompted specially to do so of course know much better than do must say not at mr dale must answer pretend to know anything about so evening wore away when squire be left alone at half past nine did not feel that day have passed badly with be style of life expected no more from than got did not look to find thing very pleasant if not happy be at rate contented only think of johnny eames being at guestwick manor said bell a be going home see why must be there said lily must rather must be than because lady julia be so grumpy asking uncle christopher especially to meet said mr dale there must be reason for then lily felt soreness come upon again spoke further upon subject know that there be special reason that lily soreness be not false in mysterious foreboding eames on evening after dinner at pawkins have seen earl explained to that must not leave town till saturday evening that must remain over tuesday must be at office by twelve on wednesday must manage to do by early train from guestwick very well johnny said earl talking to young friend with bedroom candle in hand a be going up to dress then will tell have be

tuesday morning will go to will be better must keep now a be ever so much too late eames did not attempt to keep went away feeling that whole matter be being arranged for in very wonderful way when got to allington found that squire have accepted earl invitation then declared to that there be longer possibility of retractation for of course did not wish to retract one great longing of life be to call lily dale own felt afraid of squire that squire must despise snub that earl must perceive that have made mistake when saw how client be scorned snubbed be arranged that earl be to take squire into own room for few minute before dinner johnny felt that must be hardly able to stand ground in drawing room when two old men must make appearance together got on very well with lady julia who gave air made very civil brother have told whole story felt a anxious a did to provide lily with husband in place of horrible man crosbie have be very fortunate in escape said to brother very fortunate earl agreed with saying that in opinion own favourite johnny must make much nicer lover of two lady julia have doubt a to lily acquiescence theodore must not speak to miss lilian dale about yet while said earl not for month so will have better chance if can remain silent for six month said lady julia bless soul somebody else will have picked up before said earl in answer to lady julia merely shook head johnny went over to mother on christmas day after church be received by by sister with great honour gave many injunction a to behaviour at earl table even descending to small detail about boot linen johnny have already begun to feel at manor that after people be not so very different in way of life a be supposed to be lady julia manner be certainly not quite of mr roper made tea very much in way in be made at burton crescent eames found that must eat egg at rate on second morning without tremor in hand in spite of coronet on silver egg cup did feel to be rather out of place in manor pew on sunday conceiving that congregation be looking at got over on christmas day sat quite comfortably in soft corner during sermon almost going to sleep when walked with earl after church to gate over noble peer have climbed in agony inspected hedge through have thrown be quite at home with little joke bantering august companion a to mode of somersault be always remembered that there be two mode in young man may be free easy with elder superior mode pleasant mode offensive have be in johnny nature to try latter earl back must soon have be up at once play must have be over be not in johnny nature to do so therefore be that earl liked at last came hour of dinner on tuesday at least hour at squire have be asked to show at manor house eames a by agreement with patron did not come

for friend to remark such little peccadillo be not altogether uncommon that must sometimes happen in life that people did not know own mind have hoped for such benevolence from fowler pratt have hoped in vain butterwell be good natured easy man anxious to stand well with about never pretending to very high tone of feeling of moral yet butterwell must say word of comfort to must get one to slur over

when walking along path of putney villa crosbie be now secretary whereas few month before have be simply clerk nevertheless mr butterwell instinct told that crosbie have fallen therefore declined to

completed when more usual business of board have be completed secretary left room without further reference to eye crosbie when got back to own apartment found mortimer gazebee waiting there for dear fellow said gazebee be very nasty affair uncommonly nasty said crosbie so nasty that mean to talk about to anybody lady amelia be quite unhappy always called lady amelia even when speaking of to own brother sister be too well behaved to take liberty of calling earl daughter by plain christian name even though earl daughter be own wife fear that have be good deal hurt not at hurt disfigured a see so beat fellow well that did did said crosbie very angrily did beat at believe everything read in newspaper do believe everything of course did believe about having aspired to alliance with lady alexandrina be untrue of course mr gazebee showed by tone of voice imprudence so unparalleled a be quite incredible must believe anything except have got black eye certainly have got that lady amelia think must be more comfortable if must come up to evening ca go out of course lady amelia said very good naturedly that need not mind with thank will come on sunday of course lady alexandrina will be very anxious to hear from sister lady amelia begged very particularly to press to come thank not to day why not oh simply because will be better at home how can be better at home can have anything

arrived have by mean a yet passed away men at office have almost become used to crosbie in spite of determination to go down to club have not yet shown elsewhere of course did not go to church at five made appearance at house in st john wood always dined at five on sunday having idea that by doing so kept sabbath better than must have done have dined at seven if keeping sabbath consists in going to bed early be in way assisted by practice be right to cook semi early dinner might perhaps be convenient a gave excuse for not going to church in afternoon a servant child dinner gave similar excuse in morning such little attempt at goodness proceeding way perhaps a in instance one quarter of way on disagreeable path towards goodness be very common with respectable people such a lady amelia if must have dined at one o'clock have eaten cold meat one perhaps might have felt that be entitled to praise dear dear dear be very sad be adolphus said on first seeing well be sad amelia said always called amelia because called adolphus gazebee be never quite pleased when heard lady amelia be older than crosbie entitled to call anything liked must have remembered great difference in rank be sad amelia said will oblige in one thing what thing adolphus not to say word more about black eye be bad thing doubt have troubled much sympathy of friend have troubled great deal more have family commiseration from gazebee on friday if be repeated again will lie down die will 'oo die uncle dolphus have got bad eye asked de courcy gazebee eldest hope of family looking up into face hero said crosbie taking boy up into arm not because have got black eye there be very much harm in will have great many before leave school because people will go on talking about aunt dina o like 'oo if oo have got ugly bad eye adolphus said lady amelia settling for argument be very well know be sure be very sorry to cause annoyance really one doe know how to pas over such thing without speaking of have have letter from mamma hope lady de courcy be quite well quite well thank a matter of course be very anxious about affair have read what have be said in newspaper may be necessary that mortimer must take up a family solicitor quite out of question said adolphus think must advise such step a said gazebee perhaps not very likely not can not be surprised mortimer that mother under such circumstance must wish to know what be fact of case not at surprised said gazebee then once for will tell fact a got out of train man 'd seen once before in life made attack upon before police came up got blow in face now know about at moment dinner be announced will give lady amelia arm said husband be very sad occurrence said lady amelia with slight toss of head be afraid will cost sister great deal of vexation agree with de courcy do that aunt dina wo like with ugly black eye really think be joking matter said lady amelia then there be nothing more said about during dinner there be nothing more said about during dinner be plain enough from lady amelia countenance that be not very well pleased with future brother in law conduct be very hospitable to pressing to eat even in doing that made repeated little reference to present unfortunate state told that did not think fried plum pudding must be bad for that must recommend not to drink port wine after dinner by by mortimer 'd better have claret up remarked adolphus must take anything be heating thank said crosbie will have brandy water if gazebee will give brandy water said lady amelia crosbie in truth be not given to drinking of brandy water be prepared to call for raw gin if be driven much further by lady amelia solicitude at sunday dinner mistress of house never went away into drawing room tea be always brought into at table on have dined be little step towards keeping first day of week when lady rosina be there be indulged with sight of six seven solid good book be laid upon mahogany a soon a bottle be taken off at first prolonged visit have obtained for privilege of reading sermon a on such occasion lady amelia mr gazebee must go to sleep a footman have also once shown tendency way sermon have be abandoned master of house on evening when sister in law be present be doomed to sit in idleness else to find solace in one of solid good book lady rosina just now be in country therefore table be left unfurnished what be to say to mother said lady amelia when be alone give kindest regard said crosbie be quite clear to husband to wife that be preparing for rebellion against authority for ten minute there be nothing said crosbie amused by playing with boy whom called dicksey by way of nickname for de courcy mamma call dicksey be dicksey will call 'oo old cross then aunt dina 'o like 'oo wish must not call child nickname adolphus seems a though must wish to cast slur upon one bear must hardly think that must feel disposed to do said mr gazebee hardly indeed said crosbie have never yet be disgraced in annals of country by being made into nickname said proud daughter of house be probably unaware that among many of associate father have be called lord de curse'ye from occasional energy of language such attempt be painful in ear think something of family can assure adolphus so doe husband very great deal said mr gazebee so do of mine said crosbie be natural to of one of ancestor came over with

iniquity must become sick in stomach feel a though ankle have be broken that upward turn of eye unmanned so completely that be speechless a regarded defence think that old man must hardly have known

assistant sent bag contained to wrong place to windsor perhaps if court be in london to st james if be at windsor be summoned great man of occasion contented with holding hand up to heaven a stood up from chair exclaiming twice mi sent monarch pouch mi sent monarch pouch that young man never knew how escaped from board room for time be deprived of power of exertion must not resume work till have have six month leave of absence be brought round upon rum ass milk in instance peculiar use of word monarch have power official magnate have never contemplated story be traditional believe that circumstance happened a lately a in day of george third john eames must laugh at present chairman of income tax office with great freedom call old huffle scuffle like now that be sent for also in spite of radical propensity felt little weak about ankle joint knew from first hearing of message that be wanted with reference to affair at railway station perhaps there might be rule that clerk must be dismissed who used fist in public place there be many rule entailing punishment of dismissal for many offence began to think that did remember something of such regulation however got up looked once around upon friend then followed tupper into board room there be johnny be sent for by old scuffle said one clerk be about row with crosbie said board ca do anything to for ca said first did young outonites have to resign because of row at cider cellar though cousin sir constant outonites did that must for be regularly up spout with accommodation bill tell must be in shoe for trifle crosbie be secretary at committee office where scuffle be chairman before came here of course be a thick a thief must wonder if did make go down apologize johnny wo do said other in meantime john

member of board be also at work upon long table be reading signing paper at distance from sir raffle paid heed to scene assistant secretary looking on must see that sir raffle be annoyed by want of attention on part of colleague be lost upon eames mr eames said sir raffle speaking with peculiarly harsh voice looking at culprit through pair of gold rimmed glass perched for occasion upon big nose be that mr eames yes said assistant secretary be eames ah then there be pause come little nearer mr eames will johnny drew nearer advancing noiselessly over turkey carpet let see in second class be ah do know eames have received letter from secretary to director of great western railway company detailing circumstance if truly stated in letter redound very much to discredit did get into row there yesterday sir got into row seems to that have got into very serious row must tell director of great western railway company that law must be allowed to take course sha mind sir in least said eames brightening up little under view of case not mind that sir said sir raffle rather shouted out word at offender before be inclined to think that overdid missing effect milder tone might have attained perhaps there be lacking to of majesty of demeanour dramatic propriety of voice have be so efficacious in little story a to king bag of letter a be johnny gave slight jump after jump felt better than have be before not mind sir being dragged before criminal tribunal of country being punished a felon rather a misdemeanour for outrage committed on public platform not mind do mean sir mean think magistrate must say very much about sir think mr crosbie must come forward mr crosbie must come forward young man do suppose that outrage against peace of metropolis be to go unpunished because may not wish to pursue matter be afraid must be very ignorant young man perhaps be said johnny very ignorant indeed very ignorant indeed be aware sir that must become question with commissioner of board whether must be retained in service of department if be publicly punished by police magistrate for disgraceful outrage a johnny looked round at other commissioner that gentleman did not raise face from paper mr eames be very good clerk whispered assistant secretary in voice made word audible to eames one of best young men have added in voice be not audible oh ah very well now will tell what mr eames hope will be lesson to very serious lesson assistant secretary leaning back in chair so a to be little behind head of sir raffle did manage to catch eye of other commissioner other commissioner barely looking round smiled little then assistant secretary smiled also eames saw smiled too whether ulterior consequence may still await breach of peace of have be guilty be not yet prepared to say continued sir raffle may go now johnny returned to own place with increased reverence for dignity of chairman on following morning one of colleague showed with great glee passage in newspaper informed world that have be so desperately beaten by crosbie that be obliged to keep bed at present time in consequence of flogging that have received then anger be aroused bounced about big room of income tax office regardless of assistant secretary head clerk other official grandee whatsoever denouncing iniquity of public press declaring opinion that must be better to live in russia than in country allowed such audacious falsehood to be propagated never touched fisher think ever tried upon honour never touched johnny be bold in to make up to lord de courcy daughter said fisher never saw one of in life be going altogether among aristocracy now said suppose must look at anybody under viscount can help what thief of editor put into paper flogged huffle scuffle told be felon be half so bad a fellow johnny kicked newspaper across room indict for libel said fisher particularly for saying wanted to marry countess daughter said clerk never heard scandal in life declared third then to say that girl must look at not le be felt by in office johnny eames be becoming leading man among that be one with whom of must be pleased to be intimate even among grandee affair of railway station did real harm be known that crosbie have deserved to be thrashed known that eames have thrashed be very well for sir raffle buffle to talk of police magistrate misdemeanour world at income tax office knew very well that eames have come out from affair with head upright right foot foremost never mind about newspaper thoughtful old senior clerk said to a did get licking did can afford to laugh at newspaper must write to editor certainly not one think of defending to newspaper except as unless be fellow who want to have name puffed may write what be a true a gospel will know how to make fun of johnny therefore gave up idea of indignant letter to editor felt that be bound to give explanation of whole matter to lord de guest affair have happened a be coming from earl house own concern have now be made so much matter of interest to kind friend that thought that must not with propriety leave earl to learn from newspaper fact falsehood therefore before left office wrote following letter income tax office december lord thought good deal about style in ought to address peer never having written to began dear lord on one sheet of paper then put aside thinking that looked over bold lord a have be so very kind to feel that ought to tell happened other morning at railway station a be coming back from guestwick that scoundrel crosbie got into same carriage with at barchester junction sat opposite to way up to london did not speak word to to when got out at paddington station thought ought not to let go away so ca say that thrashed a wished to do made attempt did give black eye whole quantity of policeman got round have fair chance know will think be wrong perhaps be what must do when sat opposite to there for two hour looking a though thought finest fellow in london have put horrible paragraph into one of newspaper saying that got so flogged have be able to stir since be atrocious falsehood a be rest of newspaper account be not touched be not nearly so bad customer a bull seemed to take very quietly must acknowledge though that did get such beating a deserved friend sir r b sent for morning told be felon did seem to care much for for might a well have called murderer burglar will care very much indeed if have made angry with what most fear be anger of one else at allington believe to be lord yours very much obliged most sincerely john eames knew 'd do if ever got opportunity said earl when have read letter walked about room striking hand together then thrusting thumb into waistcoat pocket knew be made of right stuff earl rejoiced greatly in prowess of favourite 'd have done if 'd seen do believe must then went back to breakfast room told lady julia what do think said johnny eames have come across crosbie given desperate beating said lady julia putting down newspaper spectacle expressing by light of eye anything christian horror at wickedness of deed have though knew must if saw beaten actually beaten sent home to lady alexandrina with two black eye two black eye what young pickle did get hurt not scratch say what will do to nothing crosbie wo be fool enough to do anything man becomes outlaw when play game a have played anybody hand may be raised against with impunity ca show face know ca come forward answer question a to what have done there be offence law ca touch outrage public feeling so strongly that one may take upon duty of punishing have be thrashed will stick to till dy do tell johnny from that hope did get hurt said lady julia old lady must not absolutely congratulate on feat of arm did next thing to earl did congratulate with full open assurance of approval hope said must have done same at age under similar circumstance be very glad that proved le difficult than bull be quite sure did want one to help with master crosbie a for other person at allington if understand such matter at think will forgive may however be question whether earl did understand such matter at then added in postscript when write to again be long first begin letter dear lord de guest be proper way chapter xxxvii old man complaint illustration untitled have be thinking again of what be saying to bell bernard said to cousin one morning thinking of bernard why must think more of have hoped that have forgotten no said be not so easy hearted a can not look on thing a must purchase of horse must give up without sorrow if found that animal be too costly for purse did not tell that loved till be sure of myself having made sure can not change at yet must have change yes of course must if heart be free now must of course be changed before come to love man such change a be to be looked for when have loved then will not be easy to change have not then have right to hope have be hanging on here bell longer than ought to have done because must not bring to leave without speaking of again did not wish to seem to to be importunate if must only believe in what say be not that believe be not puppy fool to flatter that must be in love with believe well enough still be possible that mind may alter be impossible know whether uncle mother have spoken to about such speaking must have effect in fact mother have spoken to truly said that such speaking must have effect if cousin must not win battle by own skill might have be quite sure looking at character a be known to that must not be able to win by skill of others have be made very unhappy went on to say by calamity have fallen on poor lily because have be deceived by man did love be to make matter square by marrying man then paused dear bernard must not drive to say word will sound harsh to word can be harsher than have already spoken bell at rate may listen to then told how desirable be with reference to concern of dale family that must endeavour to look favourably on proposition must be good for said especially for lily a to whom at present moment uncle felt so kindly a bernard pleaded be so anxious at heart for marriage that must do anything be asked of if be gratified if be not gratified in must feel that have ground for displeasure bell a have be desired to listen did listen very patiently when cousin have finished answer be very short nothing that uncle can say think do can make difference in said will think nothing then of happiness of others must not marry man did not love to ensure amount of happiness to others at least know ought not to do so believe must ensure one happiness by marriage certainly not yours after bernard have acknowledged to that difficulty in way be great will go away till next autumn said to uncle if must give up profession remain here must not be so perverse can not do that sir can not risk well being of life on chance then uncle have be angry with a well a with niece in anger determined that must go again to sister in law after unreasonable fashion resolved that must become to be very angry with also if declined to assist with influence a mother why must not marry said to lord de guest offer a to young eames have be very generous a have then declared have not be able to express own opinion at once on thinking over what earl have said have found very willing to heal family wound in manner proposed if such healing might be possible that however must not be done quite a yet when time must come thought might come soon perhaps in spring when day must be fine evening again long must be willing to take share with earl in establishing that new household to crosbie have refused to give anything there be upon conscience shade of remorse in have so refused if lily must be brought to love other man must be more open handed must have share a though be in fact daughter then if intended to do so much for at small house must not in return do something also for so thinking went again to sister in law determined to explain view even though might be at risk of hard word between a regarded did not much care for hard word spoken to almost expected that people word must be hard painful did not look for comfort of affectionate soft greeting perhaps must not have appreciated have come to caught mr dale walking in garden brought into own room feeling that have better chance there than in own house with old dislike to being lectured in room have endeavoured to avoid interview have failed so met john eames at manor have said to in garden ah yes how did get on there can not conceive poor johnny keeping holiday with earl sister how did behave to how did behave to can assure be very much at home there be indeed well hope will do good be be sure very good young man only rather awkward did think awkward at will find mary that will do very well great deal better than father did be sure hope may after mr dale made attempt to escape squire have taken prisoner led captive into house mary said a soon a have induced to sit down be time that must be settled between nephew niece be afraid there will be nothing to settle what do mean that disapprove of by mean personally must approve of very strongly have nothing to do with question yes have beg pardon must have must have great deal to do with of course be not saying that anybody must now ever be compelled to marry anybody hope not never said that ought never thought so do think that wish of family must have very great weight with girl have be well brought up know whether bell have be well brought up in such matter a nobody wish must weigh feather with indeed must not take upon even to express wish to can say must have be very happy if must have regarded cousin a wish to do mean that be afraid to tell so be afraid to do what think be wrong if mean that think must be wrong therefore will speak to must do a like about mr dale ca prevent will think wrong to harass on matter fear also that answer will not be satisfactory to if choose to tell opinion must do so of course will think wrong be mr dale voice a said be stern enough so be countenance must not forbid uncle to speak mind to niece especially disliked idea of interference with daughter squire got up walked about room trying to compose that might answer rationally without anger may go now said mr dale may go of course may go if like if think that be intruding upon in speaking to of welfare of two girl whom endeavour to regard a own daughter except in know have never be taught to love if think that be interference on part to show anxiety for welfare of course may go did not mean to say anything to hurt mr dale hurt doe signify whether be hurt not have child of own of course only business in life be to provide for nephew niece be old fool if expect that be to love in return if venture to express wish be interfering doing wrong be hard very hard know well that have be brought up to dislike yet be endeavouring to do duty by mr dale that accusation have not be deserved have not be brought up to dislike believe that have loved respected a uncle such love respect will not give right to dispose of hand who want to dispose of hand there be thing in think uncle parent must interfere of such thing be chief if after that may choose to tell wish of course can do so will not be much good after have set against mr dale have right to say such thing to be very unjust in doing so if think have set girl against will be much better that must leave allington altogether have be placed in circumstance have made difficult for to do duty to child have endeavoured to do not regarding own personal wish be quite sure however that must be wrong in to keep here if be to be told by have taught to regard unfavourably indeed can not suffer such thing to be said to mr dale said with air of decision with voice expressing sense of injury received made squire feel that be very much in earnest be not true said defending that in relates to girl have ever regarded with suspicion be not true then corrected feeling that there be something of truth in squire last assertion certainly not with suspicion said a matter have gone so far will explain what real feeling have be in worldly matter can do much for girl have done much wish to do more said squire be sure do can not on account give up place a only living parent be child not yours even must bring to allow to act a guardian natural protector must not consent to arrangement can not call that suspicion can call jealousy must not mother be jealous of child love during time squire be walking up down room with hand in trouser pocket when mr dale have last spoken continued walk for time in silence perhaps be well that must have spoken out said manner in accused made necessary did not intend to accuse do so now think that have be that be very hard to very hard indeed have endeavoured to make child also sharer with in such prosperity a have be mine have striven to add to comfort to happiness be most anxious to secure future welfare must have be very wrong have declined to accept on behalf think that in return for need not have begrudged affection obedience generally follows from such good office mr dale have begrudged nothing of be hurt be hurt continued be surprised by look of pain even more than by unaccustomed warmth of word what have said have have known be case along though have felt to be so own that be hurt by open word because have said that own child must ever be own ah have said more than that girl have be living here close to for how many year be now during year there have grown up for kindly feeling do think that can not hear see feel do suppose that be fool know a for yourself must never enter house if did not feel constrained to do so for sake of appearance suppose be all a must be having child of own owe duty of parent to niece have right to expect from in return love regard obedience know be keeping here against will mary wo do so longer made sign to that be to depart a rose from seat heart be softened towards in latter day have shown much kindness to girl kindness be more akin to gentleness of love than have ever come from before lily fate have seemed to melt even sternness have striven to be tender in word way now spoke a though have loved girl have loved in vain doubtless have be disagreeable neighbour to sister in law making feel that be never for personally that have opened hand doubtless have be moved by unconscious desire to undermine take upon authority with own child doubtless have looked askance at from first day of marriage with brother have be keenly alive to since have first known more keenly alive to than ever since failure of effort have made to live with on term of affection made during first year two of residence at small house nevertheless in spite of heart bled for now have gained victory over having fully held own position with child now that complained that have be beaten in struggle heart bled for brother said a spoke offered hand may be that have not thought a kindly of other a must have done have endeavoured said old man have endeavoured then stopped either hindered by excess of emotion unable to find word be necessary for expression of meaning let endeavour once again of begin again at near seventy mary there be more beginning again for will make difference to girl a long a be here will have house if marry will do for what can believe bernard be much in earnest in suit if bell will listen to will still be welcomed here a mistress of allington what have said will make difference a to beginning again be simply impossible after mr dale walked home through garden by herself have studiously told that house in lived must be lent not to to child during lifetime have positively declined offer of warmer regard have made understand that be to look on other almost a enemy that enemy a be must still be allowed use of munificence because chose to do duty by niece will be better for that will leave said to herself a seated in own arm chair over drawing room fire chapter xxxviii doctor croft be called in mr dale have not sat long in drawing room before tidings be brought to for while drew mind away from question of removal mamma said bell entering room really do believe jane have got scarlatina jane parlour maid have be ailing for last two day nothing serious have hitherto be suspected mr dale instantly jumped up who be with asked appeared from bell answer that lily have be with girl that lily be still in room whereupon mr dale ran upstairs there be on

have be taking place between whole matter of bernard courtship have come upon carpet bell have kept cousin offer to herself a long a have be able to do so since uncle have pressed subject upon mr dale be impossible for bell to remain silent longer want to marry mamma do have said when mother have spoken with show of kindness towards bernard in answer to mr dale have protested vehemently that have such wish lily who still held to belief in dr croft be almost equally animated to idea that uncle must in way interfere in own view of life on strength of pecuniary assistance have received from be peculiarly distasteful be especially distasteful that must presume to have even opinion a to disposition in marriage declared to other that uncle must have right to object to marriage of might contemplate a long a mother must approve of poor old squire have be right in saying that be regarded with suspicion be so regarded fault have certainly be own in having endeavoured to win daughter without thinking worth while to win mother girl have unconsciously felt that attempt be made have vigorously rebelled against have not be fault that have be brought to live in uncle house made to ride on pony to eat partially of bread have so eaten so lived declared to be grateful squire be good in way recognized goodness not on account must transfer to one jot of allegiance a child owed to mother when told tale explaining to word uncle have spoken that morning expressed regret that must be so grieved be strong in assurance to mother that have be sinned against be not sinning let go at once said bell be much easier said than done dear of course be mamma else must be here now what mean be let take necessary first step at once be clear that uncle think that remaining here must give right over say that be wrong to think so perhaps be natural perhaps in accepting kindness ought to submit to if be so be conclusive reason for going must not pay rent for house said lily a mr hearn doe must like to remain here mamma if must do must not do that lily must choose for smaller house than one be not burdened with expense of garden even if paid moderate rent for place must not have mean of living here not if lived on toast tea said lily laughing must hardly wish to live upon toast tea indeed fancy must get tired of such diet never mamma said lily a for confess to longing after mutton chop think must ever want such vulgar thing at rate must be impossible to remain here said bell uncle christopher must not take rent from mamma even if did must not know how to go on with other arrangement after such change must give up dear old small house be dear old house said lily thinking a spoke more of late scene in garden when crosbie have be with in autumn month than of of former joy of childhood after know must be right to move said mr dale doubtingly yes yes said girl at once of course will be right mamma there can not be doubt about mamma if can get cottage even lodging must be better than remaining here now that know what uncle christopher think of will make very unhappy said mr dale even argument did not in least move girl be very sorry that uncle must be unhappy must endeavour to show by increased show of affection that feeling towards be not unkind must speak to must endeavour to explain to that thought towards be altogether affectionate must not remain at allington increasing load of gratitude seeing that expected certain payment did not feel able to render must be robbing if stayed here bell declared wilfully robbing of what belief to be just share of bargain so be settled among that notice must be given to uncle of intention to quit small house of allington then came question a to new home mr dale be aware that income be at rate better than possessed by mr eames therefore have fair ground for presuming that must afford to keep house at guestwick if do go away be what must do said will have to walk out with mary eames instead of susan boyce said lily wo make so much difference after in respect will gain a much a lose said bell then will be so nice to have shop said lily ironically only will never have money to buy anything said bell will see more of world said lily lady julia carriage come into town twice week miss gruffens drive about in great style upon whole will gain great deal only for poor old garden mamma do think will break heart at parting with hopkins a to will be disappointed in mankind if ever hold head up again after be gone in truth there be very much of sadness in resolution to mr dale seemed a though be managing matter badly for daughter allowing poverty misfortune to come upon through own fault well knew how great load of sorrow be lying on lily heart hidden beneath little attempt at pleasantry made when spoke of being disappointed in mankind mr dale must hardly repress outward shudder must betray thought now be consenting to take forth from comfortable home from luxury of lawn garden to bring to small dingy corner of provincial town because have failed to make happy with brother in law must be right to give up advantage enjoyed at allington advantage have come to from so legitimate source because own feeling have be wounded in future want of comfort in comfortless dowdiness of new home to must remove must not always blame for having brought to by own false pride yet seemed to that now have alternative must not now teach daughter to obey uncle wish in thing must not make bell understand that must be well that must marry bernard because squire have set heart on marriage have gone so far that must not now go back suppose must move at lady day said bell who be in favour of instant action if so have not better let uncle christopher know at once think that can find house by time can get in somewhere continued bell there be plenty of lodging in guestwick know sound of word lodging be uncomfortable in mr dale ear if be to go let go at once said lily need not stand much upon order of going uncle will be very much shocked said mr dale can not say that be fault said bell be thus agreed between that necessary information must be at once given to squire that old well loved house must be left for ever must be great fall in worldly point of view from allington small house to abode in little street of guestwick at allington have be county people raised to level with own squire other squire by circumstance of residence at guestwick must be small even among people of town must be on equality with eames much looked down upon by gruffens must hardly dare to call more at guestwick manor seeing that certainly must not expect lady julia to call upon at guestwick mr boyce doubt must patronize must already anticipate condolence must be offered to by mr hearn indeed movement on part must be tantamount to confession of failure in full hearing of so much of world a be known to must not allow reader to suppose that consideration be matter of indifference to of lady at small house to woman of strong mind of highly strung philosophic tendency such consideration might have be indifferent mr dale be not of nature be daughter good thing of world be good in eye valued privilege of pleasant social footing among friend be by mean capable of wise contempt of advantage chance have hitherto given to must not go forth rejoicing in comparative poverty of altered condition then must purchase luxury be about to abandon at price be asked for have not better write to uncle said one of girl to mr dale objected that must not make letter on subject clearly intelligible that therefore must see squire on following morning will be very dreadful said will soon be over be not what will say at moment fear so much a bitter reproach of face when will meet afterwards so on following morning again made way now without invitation to squire study mr dale began starting upon work with confusion in manner hurry in speech have be thinking over what be saying together yesterday have come to resolution know ought to make known to without moment delay squire also have thought of what have passed between have suffered much a have done so have thought of without acerbity anger thought be ever gentler than word heart softer than exponent of heart that be able to put forth wished to love brother child to be loved by even failing that wished to do good to have not occurred to to be angry with mr dale after interview be over conversation have not gone pleasantly with then hardly expected that thing must go pleasantly idea have occurred to that evil must come upon of dale lady from word have then be spoken regarded small house a abode home a surely a great house be own in giving due must be declared that allusion to holding a benefit done to by have be very far from thought mr hearn who held cottage at real value grumbled almost daily at a landlord never occurred to that therefore must raise rent that in not doing so be acting with special munificence have ever be to grumbling cross grained unpleasant world did not expect from mr hearn from sister in law anything better than to have ever be used will make very happy said if have bearing on bell marriage with cousin mr dale be out of question must not vex by saying so if be not certain of know child so well then must leave to time mary yes of course time will suffice to make bell change mind will however leave subject now mr dale have to tell of something else have resolved to leave small house resolved on said squire turning eye full upon have resolved to leave small house leave small house said repeating word where on earth do mean to go think will go into guestwick why ah be so hard to explain if must only accept fact a tell to not ask for reason have guided be out of question mary in such matter a must ask reason must tell also that in opinion will not be doing duty to daughter in carrying out such intention unless reason be very strong indeed be very strong said mr dale then paused can not understand said squire can not bring to believe that be really in earnest be not comfortable there more comfortable than have right to be with mean thought always did very nicely with money never get into debt never get into debt be not exactly fact be mr dale have right to live there without paying rent must not afford to live there if did pay rent who have talked about rent said jumping up from chair one have be speaking falsehood of behind back gleam of real truth have yet come to idea have reached mind that relative thought necessary to leave house in consequence of word that have spoken have never considered to have be in special way generous to must not have thought reasonable that must abandon house in have be living even if anger against have be strong hot mary said must insist upon getting to bottom of a for leaving house be out of question where can be better off so well a to going into guestwick what sort of life must there be for girl put aside a out of question must know what have induced to make such proposition tell honestly have one spoken evil of behind back mr dale have be prepared for opposition for reproach there be decision about squire word air of masterdom in manner made recognize more fully than have yet done difficulty of position almost began to fear that must lack power to carry out purpose indeed be not so mr dale then what be know that if attempt to tell will be vexed will contradict vexed will be probably yet can not help indeed be endeavouring to do what be right by by child never mind duty be to think of of course be in doing most cordially agree with in using such argument a mr dale showed weakness squire be not slow to take advantage of duty be to said mean by that duty be to let act in way may best please for moment can understand that must be run away with by romantic nonsense can not understand of truth be mr dale think that child owe to that sort of obedience be due to parent a long a remain here accepting from hand so large part of daily support be perhaps natural that must think so in unhappy affair about bell have never said anything of kind said squire interrupting no have not said so wish to think that make complaint feel that be so feel therefore have made up mind to go away mr dale a finished be aware that have not told story well have acknowledged to herself that be quite out of power to tell a must be told main object be to make brother in law understand that certainly must leave house to make understand with a little pain to a possible did not in least mind thinking foolish if only must so carry point a to be able to tell daughter on return that matter be settled squire from word manner seemed indisposed to give privilege of proposition ever heard said be most unreasonable amount to that be too proud to live rent free in house belongs to husband brother therefore intend to subject child to great discomfort of very straitened income if only be concerned must have right to say anything think bound to tell that a regard girl everybody know will think to have be very wrong be in natural course of thing that must live in house place have never be let a far a know rent have ever be paid for house since be built have always be given to member of family who have be considered a having best right to have considered footing there a firm a own here quarrel between child must be to great calamity though perhaps might be indifferent to if there be quarrel must afford reason for leaving that house let beg to think over matter again illustration let beg to think over matter again squire must assume air of authority on certain occasion have done so now mr dale found that must only answer by simple repetition of own intention indeed failed in making serviceable answer whatsoever know that be very good to girl said will say nothing about that answered not thinking at moment of small house of full possession have desired to give to elder of privilege must belong to mistress of allington thinking also of mean by be hoping to repair poor lily shattered fortune what word be further said have great significance mr dale got away feeling that have failed a soon a be gone squire arose putting on great coat went forth with hat stick to front of house went out in order that thought might be more free that might indulge in solace injured man find in contemplating injury declared to that be very hardly used so hardly used that almost began to doubt own motif why be that people around disliked so strongly avoided thwarted in effort made for welfare offered to nephew privilege of son much more indeed than privilege of son merely asking in return that must consent to live permanently in house be to be own nephew refused can not bear to live with said old man to sorely be prepared to treat niece with more generosity than daughter of house of allington have usually received from father repelled kindness running away from telling openly that must not be beholden to walked slowly up down terrace thinking of very bitterly did not find in contemplation of grievance solace grievance usually give because accused in thought rather than others declared to that be made to be hated protested to that must be well that must die be buried out of memory so that remaining dale might have better chance of living happily then a thus discussed within own bosom thought be very tender though be aggrieved be most affectionate to who have most injured be absolutely beyond power to reproduce outwardly with word outward sign such thought feeling be now very nearly end of year weather be still soft open air be damp rather than cold lawn field still retained green tint of new vegetation a squire be walking on terrace hopkins came up to touching hat remarked that must have frost in day two suppose will said squire must have mason to flue of little grape house sir before can do good with fire there grape house said squire crossly why grape house in other garden sir ought to have be done last year by right hopkins said to punish master for being cross to on matter of flue of mr dale grape house have with much

through then let be unripe said squire walking about hopkins did not at understand squire in natural course be very unwilling to neglect such matter a must be specially unwilling to neglect anything touching small house so hopkins stood on terrace raising hat scratching head there be something wrong amongst said to sorrowfully when squire have walked to end of terrace have turned upon path led round side of house stopped called to hopkins have what be needful done to flue said yes sir very well sir will only be re setting brick nothing more ai needful just winter have place put in perfect

escape from house think mother must be more comfortable without think must be more comfortable with ever like to hear of woman running away from illness when sister daughter doe so be intolerable so bell remained without permission indeed to see sister performing various outside administration be much needed thus manner of trouble came upon inhabitant of small house falling upon a be in heap together be a yet barely two month since terrible tidings have come respecting crosbie tidings be felt at time must of be sufficient to crush now to misfortune other misfortune have be added one quick upon heel of in teeth of doctor kind prophecy lily became very ill after few day be delirious must talk to mother about crosbie speaking of a used to speak in autumn be passed even in madness

right to ask question about said uncle be very kind be more than kind be generous seems to think that living here give right to interfere with mamma like therefore be going doctor still sat on one side of fire bell still sat opposite to conversation did not form very freely between be bad news said at last at rate when be ill will not have so far to come see yes understand mean that be ungracious not to congratulate on having so much nearer to in least can not bear to think of a living anywhere here at allington dale will be out of place in street at guestwick be hard upon dale too be hard upon be sort of offshoot from very tyrannical law of noblesse oblige think ought to go away from allington unless circumstance be very imperative be very imperative in case indeed then again

provided have loved other misunderstand of course must be excellent marriage if loved other might say same if loved butcher baker what mean be that make reason for loving think did mean that then mean nothing after that there be again minute of silence during dr croft got up to go away have scolded very dreadfully said with slight smile believe have deserved for interfering not at for interfering at rate must forgive before go wo forgive at unless repent of sin alter altogether wickedness of mind will become very soon a bad a dr gruffen will oh will forgive for after be most generous man in world oh yes of course be well good by dr croft must not suppose others to be so much more worldly than care for money so very much do care very much if did must not come here for nothing day after

very high have always have sort of aptitude for living in pigsty clean pigsty know with nice fresh bean straw to lie upon think be mistake when made lady of do indeed said dr croft be because quite know yet have not slightest pleasure in putting on three different dress day do very often because come to to do from way in have be taught to live when get to guestwick mean to change if come in to tea will see in same brown frock wear in morning unless indeed morning work make brown frock dirty oh dr croft will have pitch dark riding home under guestwick elm mind dark said seemed a though hardly intended to go even yet do said bell will ring for candle stopped a put hand out to bell pull stop moment bell need hardly have candle before go need not begrudge staying seeing that will be alone at home begrudge staying however will begrudge else make very welcome still held by wrist have caught a prevented from summoning servant what do mean said know be welcome to a flower in may always be welcome now when have come to in trouble at rate will never say that turn out will never say so still held by wrist have kept chair throughout be standing before between fire though held in way thought little of word of action have known other with great intimacy though lily must still laugh at saying that dr croft be lover have long since taught that such feeling a must ever exist between will never say so bell what if so poor man a ask for hand that will not give to so rich man a cousin bernard instantly withdrew arm moved back very quickly step two across rug did almost with motion might have used have insulted have man spoken such word who must not under circumstance have right to speak ah yes thought must be so said may go now may know have be turned out what be mean dr croft what be be saying why do talk that nonsense trying to see if can provoke yes be nonsense have right to address in way certainly must not have done now that be in house in way of profession beg pardon now also be standing have not moved from side of fireplace be going to forgive before go forgive for what said for daring to love for having loved almost a long a can remember for loving better than beside alone must forgive will forgive for having told have made offer did expect that be about to make one have hardly yet realized meaning of word certainly have asked question a to answer must give to there be case in lover present in so unmistakeable guise that first word of open love uttered by tell whole story tell without possibility of surprise be generally so when lover have not be old friend when even acquaintance have be of modern date have be so essentially in case of crosbie lily dale when crosbie came to lily made offer did with perfect ease thorough self possession for almost knew that be expected lily though have be flurried for moment have answer pat enough already loved man with heart delighted in presence basked in sunshine of manliness rejoiced in wit have tuned ear to tone of voice have be done world expected have not made offer lily must have be ill treated though ala ala there be future ill treatment so much heavier in store for there be other case in lover can not make known a such without great difficulty when doe do so can not hope for immediate answer in favour be hard upon old friend that difficulty must usually fall heaviest upon croft have be so intimate with dale family very many person have thought probable that must marry one of girl mr dale have thought so have almost hoped lily have certainly done thought hope have somewhat faded away yet former existence must have be in doctor favour now when have in way spoken out bell started back from must not believe that be in earnest probably loved better than man in world yet when spoke to of love must not bring to understand know what mean dr croft indeed said have meant to ask to be wife simply that will not have pain of making positive refusal a rode here to day thought of during frequent ride of late have thought of little else told that have right to do have not even house in must be fit that must live dr croft if loved if wished to marry then stopped think not suppose not in way consideration about money have anything to do with be not that butcher that baker whom must love said bell then stopped from further speech not a intending to convey answer in one word a not knowing how to fashion further word knew must be so said doctor will fear be thought by who condescend to criticize lover conduct mode of carrying on suit that be very unfit for such work lady will say that wanted courage men will say that wanted wit be inclined however to believe that behaved a well a men generally do behave on such occasion that showed to be good average lover there be bold lover who knock lady love over a doe bird who must anathematize over swear that gun be distraught look about a though thought world be coming to end if missed to knock over bird there be timid lover who wink eye when fire who have felt certain from moment in buttoned on knickerbockers that at rate must kill nothing who when hears loud congratulation of friend can not believe that really did bag beautiful winged thing by own prowess beautiful winged thing timid man carry home in bosom declining to have thrown into miscellaneous cart so that may never be lost in common crowd of game be better to than be slaughtered hecatomb to who kill bird by hundred dr croft have so winked eye that be not in least aware whether have winged bird indeed having one at hand to congratulate be quite sure that bird have flown away uninjured into next field be only word bell have given in answer to last sidelong question be not comfortable word to lover there have be that in bell might have taught that bird be not escaping without wound if have still have of wit about now will go said then paused for answer none came will understand what meant when spoke of being turned out nobody turn out bell a spoke have almost descended to sob be time at rate must go be not bell suppose that little scene will keep away from sister bedside will be here to morrow will find that will hardly know again for same person then in dark put out hand to good by said giving hand pressed hers very closely though wished to do so must not bring to return pressure hand remained passive in showing sign of offence be absolutely passive good by dearest friend said good by answered then be gone waited quite still till heard front door close after then crept silently up to own bedroom sat down in low rocking chair over fire be in accordance with custom already established that mother must remain with lily till tea be ready downstairs for in day of illness such dinner a be provided be eaten early bell therefore knew that have still half hour of own during might sit think undisturbed what naturally must have be first thought that have ruthlessly refused man who a now knew loved well for whom have always felt at rate warmest friendship such be not thought be in way akin to ran back instantly to year gone by over long year a few year be counted settled on certain halcyon day in have dreamed that have loved have fancied that have loved how have schooled for day since taught to know that thought have be over bold now have come round only man that have ever liked have loved then there came to memory of certain day in have be almost proud to think that crosbie have admired in have almost hoped that might be so a thought of blushed struck foot twice upon floor dear lily said to herself poor lily feeling induced then to think of sister have have relation to have first brought crosbie into mind man have loved through priceless peerless man man who be a true to backbone a other man have shown to be false who be a sound a other man have proved to be rotten smile came across face a sat looking at fire thinking of man have loved whose love be worth possessing hardly remembered whether have refused accepted hardly asked what must do a to that be necessary that must have many thought necessity did not press upon quite immediately for present at rate might sit triumph thus triumphant sat there till old nurse came in told that mother be waiting for below chapter xl preparation for wedding illustration untitled fourteenth of february be finally settled a day on mr crosbie be to be made happiest of men later day have be at first named twenty seventh twenty eighth having be suggested a improvement over first week in march lady amelia have be frightened by crosbie behaviour on sunday evening have made countess understand that there must be unnecessary delay doe scruple at kind of thing lady amelia have said in one of letter showing perhaps le trust in potency of own rank than might have be expected from countess however have agreed with when crosbie received from mother in law very affectionate epistle setting forth reason must make fourteenth so much more convenient day than twenty eighth be unable to invent excuse for not being made happy fortnight earlier than time named in bargain first impulse have be against yielding arising from feeling made think that more than bargain ought not to be exacted what be use to of quarrelling what use at least of quarrelling just then believed that must more easily enfranchise from de courcy tyranny when must be once married than must do now when lady alexandrina must be own must let know that intended to be master if in doing so must be necessary that must divide altogether from de courcys such division must be made at present moment must yield to at rate in matter so fourteenth of february be fixed for marriage in second week in january alexandrina came up to look after thing in more noble language to fit with becoming bridal appanage a must not properly do work alone even under surveillance with assistance of sister lady de courcy be to come up also alexandrina came first remaining with sister in st john wood till countess must arrive countess have never yet condescended to accept of son in law hospitality always went to cold comfortless house in portman square house have be de courcy town family mansion for many year countess must long since have willingly exchanged for abode on other side of oxford street earl have be obdurate club certain lodging have occasionally be wont to occupy be on right side of oxford street why must change old family residence so countess be coming up to portman square not having be even asked on occasion to st john wood think 'd better mr gazebee have said to wife almost trembling at renewal of own proposition think not dear lady amelia have answered mamma be not very particular there be little thing know oh yes of course said mr gazebee then conversation have be dropped must most willingly have entertained august mother in law during visit to metropolis yet presence in house must have made miserable a long a remained there for week alexandrina sojourned under mr gazebee roof during time crosbie be made happy with delight of expectant bridegroom of course be given to understand that be to dine at gazebees day spend evening there under circumstance have excuse for not doing so indeed at present moment hour must otherwise have hung heavily enough upon hand in spite of bold resolution with reference to eye intention not to be debarred from pleasure of society by mark of late combat have not since occurrence frequented club very closely though london be now again becoming fairly full did not find going out so much a have be wont brilliance of coming marriage did not seem to have added much to popularity in fact world world be beginning to look coldly at therefore that daily attendance at st john wood be not felt to be so irksome a might have be expected residence have be taken for couple in very fashionable row of building abutting upon bayswater road called princess royal crescent house be quite new street being unfinished have about strong smell of mortar general aspect of builder pole brickbat nevertheless be acknowledged to be quite correct locality from one end of crescent corner of hyde park must be seen other abutted on very handsome terrace indeed in lived ambassador from south america few banker senior clerk peer of realm know how vile be sound of baker street how absolutely foul to polite ear be name of fitzroy square house however in purlieu be substantial warm of good size house in princess royal crescent be certainly not substantial for in day substantially built house pay must hardly have be warm for to speak truth be even yet not finished throughout a for size though drawing room be noble apartment consisting of section of whole house with corner cut out for staircase be very much cramped in other part be made like cherub in respect that have rear belonging to if have private fortune of own can not have everything a countess observed when crosbie objected to house because closet under kitchen stair be to be assigned to a own dressing room when question of house be first debated lady amelia have be anxious that st john wood must be selected a site to crosbie have positively objected think like st john wood lady amelia have said to somewhat sternly thinking to awe into declaration that entertained general enmity to neighbourhood crosbie be not weak enough for said have always disliked amount to prejudice daresay if be made to live here be convinced must cut throat in first six month lady amelia have then drawn up declaring sorrow that house must be so hateful to oh dear said like very much for enjoy coming here of thing speak only of effect living here must have upon lady amelia be quite clever enough to understand have sister interest at heart therefore persevered in affectionate solicitude for brother in law giving up point a to st john wood crosbie have wished to go to one of new pimlico square down near vauxhall bridge river actuated chiefly by consideration of enormous distance lying between locality northern region in lady amelia lived to lady alexandrina have objected strongly if indeed must have achieved eaton square street leading out of eaton square if must have crept on to hem of skirt of belgravia bride must have be delighted at first be very nearly being taken in with idea that such be proposal made to geographical knowledge of pimlico have not be perfect have nearly fallen into fatal error friend have kindly intervened for heaven sake dear let take anywhere beyond eccleston square have be exclaimed to in dismay by faithful married friend thus warned alexandrina have be firm now tent be to be pitched in princess royal crescent from one end of hyde park may be seen furniture have be ordered chiefly under inspection by experience of lady amelia crosbie have satisfied by declaring that at rate must get thing cheaper than must buy that have taste for such employment nevertheless have felt that be being made subject to tyranny brought under thumb of subjection must not go cordially into matter of bed chair therefore at last deputed whole matter to de courcy faction for there be reason not hitherto mentioned mr mortimer gazebee be finding money with furniture be being bought with honest almost unintelligible zeal for de courcy family have tied up shilling on must lay hand a belonging to crosbie in interest of lady alexandrina have gone to work for scraping here arranging there strapping new husband down upon grindstone of matrimonial settlement a though future bread of gazebee own child be dependent on validity of legal workmanship for be not to receive penny gain advantage immediate ulterior came from zeal zeal for coronet lord de courcy wore according to mind earl earl belonging be entitled to such zeal be theory in have be educated amounted to worship unconsciously practised personally disliked lord de courcy who ill treated knew that earl be heartless cruel bad man a earl be entitled to amount of service commoner must have commanded from mr gazebee mr gazebee having thus tied up available fund in favour of lady alexandrina seemingly expected widowhood be providing money with new house be to be furnished can pay hundred fifty year with four per cent till be liquidated have said to crosbie crosbie have assented with grunt hitherto though have lived in london expensively a man of fashion have never owed one anything be now to begin career of owing when clerk in public office marries earl daughter can not expect to have everything own way lady amelia have bought ordinary furniture bed stair carpet washing stand kitchen thing gazebee have got bargain of dinner table sideboard lady alexandrina herself be to come up with reference to appurtenance of drawing room be with reference to matter of costume that countess intended to lend assistance matter of costume a to bill must not be sent in to gazebee be paid for by with five per cent duly charged against bridegroom bridal trousseau must be produced by de courcy mean therefore be necessary that countess must come upon scene will have bill d 'ye hear snarled earl gnashing snapping upon word with one specially ugly black tooth wo have bill about affair yet made offer of ready money be very necessary under such circumstance that countess must come upon scene ambiguous hint have be conveyed to mr gazebee during visit of business have lately made to courcy castle that milliner bill might a well be pinned on to of furniture maker crockery monger like countess putting in own way have gently suggested that fashion of thing have changed lately that such arrangement be considered to be proper thing among people who lived really in world gazebee be clear headed honest man knew countess did not think that arrangement must be made on present occasion whereupon countess pushed suggestion further made up mind that must come up to london be pleasant to see lady amelia alexandrina a sat within vast emporium of carpet in bond street asking question of four men who be waiting upon putting head together whispering calculating accurately a to extra twopence yard occasioning a much trouble a be possible for to give be pleasant because managed large hoop cleverly among huge roll of carpet because be enjoying thoroughly taking to homage of men a clearly due be not so pleasant to look at crosbie who be fidgeting to get away to office to whom power of choosing in matter be really given whom men regarded a being altogether supernumerary lady have promised to be at shop by half past ten so crosbie must reach office at eleven little after be nearly eleven before left gazebee residence be very evident that hour among carpet must be by mean sufficient seemed a though mile upon mile of gorgeous colouring be unrolled before then when pattern be regarded a at practicable be unrolled backwards forward till room be nearly covered by crosbie felt for men who be hauling about huge heap of material lady amelia sat a composed a though be duty to inspect yard of stuff in warehouse think will look at one at bottom again then men went to work removed mountain dear that green in

say to repeated word in very low voice asked if must love be wife what answer did make to what answer did make simply refused believe dr croft be not so think be not so mind can say nothing a coming from have not told own mind if really love will be mad to refuse do love lily that at rate be true then go to again be speaking for now can not afford to lose brother a must be love so dearly that can not spare think will learn to love a must wish to be loved know nature how silent be averse to talk about have confessed nothing to spoke to took by surprise be to have chance know how wrong be to ask question after be not truth best chance know what mean think be worthy to be wife do indeed if so must be very worthy wo tell of will now doctor wo tell of will try again yes will try again god bless brother hope hope will be brother then a put out hand to once more raised head towards stooping down kissed forehead make mamma come to be last word spoke a went out at door so have made speech said mr dale yes mamma hope be discreet speech hope be mamma have made so tired believe will go to bed do know think must have done much good down at school to day then mr dale in anxiety to repair what injury might have be done to daughter by over exertion omitted further mention of farewell speech dr croft a rode home enjoyed little of triumph of successful lover may be that be right said to at rate will ask again nevertheless that bell have spoken have repeated still sounded in ear harsh conclusive there be men to whom peal of no rattling about ear never take sound of true denial others to whom word once pronounced be whispered ever so softly come a though be unchangeable verdict from supreme judgment seat chapter xliii fie fie illustration untitled will reader remember love not love that word be so decidedly ill applied a to be incapable of awakening remembrance of reader flirtation of lady dumbello mr plantagenet palliser flirtation a have be carried on at courcy castle be laid bare in enormity to eye of public must be confessed that if eye of public be shocked that eye must be shocked very easily eye of public be shocked people who be particular a to moral said very strange thing lady de courcy said very strange thing indeed shaking head dropping mysterious word whereas lady clandidlem spoke much more openly declaring opinion that lady dumbello must be off before may agreed that must not be altogether bad for lord dumbello that must lose wife shook head very sadly when spoke of poor plantagenet palliser a to lady fate that lady whom have almost worshipped during day at courcy castle did not seem to trouble about must be admitted that mr palliser have be little imprudent imprudent be if knew anything about rumour afloat seeing soon after visit at courcy castle have gone down to lady hartletop place in shropshire at dumbellos intended to spend winter on leaving have expressed intention of returning in february hartletop people have pressed very much pressure having come with peculiar force from lord dumbello therefore be reasonable to suppose that hartletop people have at rate not heard of rumour mr plantagenet palliser spent christmas with uncle duke of omnium at gatherum castle be to say reached castle in time for dinner on christmas eve left on morning after christmas day be in accordance with usual practice of life tenant dependant follower of omnium interest be always delighted to see manifestation of healthy english domestic family feeling between duke nephew amount of intercourse on such occasion between be generally trifling duke must smile a put out right hand to nephew say well plantagenet very busy suppose duke be only living being who called plantagenet to face though there be score of men who talked of planty pal behind back duke have be only living being so to call let hope that still be so that there have arisen no feminine exception dangerous in nature improper in circumstance well plantagenet said duke on present occasion very busy suppose yes indeed duke said mr palliser when man get harness on doe not easily get quit of duke remembered that nephew have made almost same remark at last christmas visit by by said duke want to say word two to before go proposition on duke part be great departure from usual practice nephew of course undertook to obey uncle behest will see before dinner to morrow said plantagenet ah do said duke will not keep five minute at six o'clock on following afternoon two be closeted together in duke private room suppose there be much in began duke people be talking about lady dumbello upon word people be very kind mr palliser bethought of fact for certainly be fact that people for great many year have talked about uncle lady dumbello mother in law yes kind enough be not have just come from hartlebury believe hartlebury be marquis of hartletop seat in shropshire yes have be going there again in february ah be sorry for not that mean of course to interfere with arrangement will acknowledge have not often done so in matter have not said nephew comforting with inward assurance that such interference on uncle part must have be possible in instance must suit really think must suit too that must be a little at hartlebury a possible have said must go there of course will go if be must not stay above day two mr plantagenet palliser received everything have in world from uncle sat in parliament through uncle interest received allowance of ever so many thousand year uncle must stop to morrow by mere word be uncle heir dukedom with certain entailed property must ultimately fall to unless uncle must marry have son by far greater portion of duke property be unentailed duke might probably live for next twenty year more be quite possible that if offended might marry become father may be said that man must well be more dependent on than plantagenet palliser be upon uncle may be said also that father uncle ever troubled heir with le interference nevertheless nephew immediately felt aggrieved by allusion to private life resolved at once that must not submit to such surveillance know how long will stay said can not say that visit will be influenced one way other by such rumour a probably not may perhaps be influenced by request duke a spoke looked little savage must ask to regard report have foundation be not asking about foundation do in least wish to interfere with manner in life by last observation duke intended nephew to understand that be quite at liberty to take away other gentleman wife that be not at liberty to give occasion even for surmise that wanted to take lord dumbello wife fact be plantagenet have for many year be intimate with family have not many intimacy will probably never increase such friend a have wish to keep will easily perceive that such report a have mentioned might make unpleasant for to go to hartlebury for hartlebury people to come here duke certainly must not have spoken plainer mr palliser understood thoroughly two such alliance between two family must not be expected to run pleasantly together even rumour of such second alliance might interfere with pleasantness of former one be said duke be most absurd slander said mr palliser dare say slander always be absurd what can do ca tie up people tongue duke looked a though wished to have subject considered a finished to be left alone can disregard said nephew indiscreetly may have never be able to do so yet believe have not earned for reputation of being subject to voice of men think that be asking much of must remember that hitherto have given much have asked nothing expect to oblige in matter then mr plantagenet palliser left room knowing that have be threatened what duke have said amounted to if go on dangling after lady dumbello will stop seven thousand year give will oppose next return at silverbridge will make will leave away from matching horn beautiful little place in surrey use of have be already offered to mr palliser in event of marriage littlebury estate in yorkshire enormous scotch property of personal good money invested in loan share fund will never touch shilling value of shilling if find can suit may be that will leave plain mr plantagenet palliser with little first cousin for head of family full amount of threat mr palliser understood a thought of acknowledged to that have never felt for lady dumbello anything like love conversation between have ever be warmer than of reader have seen sample lady dumbello have be nothing to now now that matter have be put before in way might not become a gentleman to fall in love with so very beautiful woman whose name have already be linked with own know that story of priest who by question in confessional taught ostler to grease horse teeth never did yet said ostler will have try at in case duke have acted part of priest mr palliser before night be over have almost become a ready pupil a ostler a to threat must ill become a palliser plantagenet to regard duke must not marry of men in world be least likely to spite own face by cutting off own nose for rest of mr palliser must take chance therefore went down to hartlebury early in february having fully determined to be very particular in attention to lady dumbello among houseful of people at hartlebury found lord porlock slight sickly worn out looking man who have something about eye of father hardness nothing in mouth of father ferocity so sister be going to be married said mr palliser yes one have right to be surprised at anything do when one remembers life father lead be going to congratulate do met at courcy rather liked mr palliser have barely spoken to mr crosbie at courcy then in usual course of social life seldom did more than barely speak to anybody did said lord porlock for poor girl sake hope be not ruffian how man must propose to father to marry daughter out of house be more than can understand how be mother looking did see anything amiss about expect that will murder day then conversation came to end mr palliser perceived a looked at must not perceive that certain amount of social energy seemed to enliven lady dumbello when approached be given to smile when addressed usual smile be meaningless almost leaden never in degree flattering to person to whom be accorded very many woman smile a answer word be spoken to most who do so flatter by smile thing be so common that one think of flattering plea mean nothing impression unconsciously taken simply conveys feeling that woman have made agreeable a be duty to do agreeable a far a smile went in very infinitesimal degree have thereby made little contribution to society will make same contribution hundred time in same evening one know that have flattered anybody doe not know world call agreeable woman lady dumbello put flattery into customary smile be cold unmeaning accompanied by special glance of eye seldom addressed to individual be given to room at large room at large acknowledging great pretension accepted a sufficient when mr palliser came near to must turn slightly ever so slightly on seat must allow eye to rest for moment upon face then when remarked that have be rather cold must smile actually upon a acknowledged truth of observation mr palliser taught to observe having be instructed by foolish uncle in lesson a to greasing of horse teeth nevertheless during first week of stay at hartlebury did not say word to more tender than observation about weather be true that be very busy have undertaken to speak upon address a parliament be now about to be opened a speech be to be based upon statistic be full of figure paper correspondence be pressing day be seldom long enough for purpose felt that intimacy to aspired be hindered by laborious routine of life nevertheless must do something before left hartlebury to show special nature of regard must say something to must open to view secret of will say heart such be resolve day after day yet day after day went by nothing be said fancied that lord dumbello be somewhat le friendly in manner than have be that put in way looked cross a declared to cared very little for lord dumbello look when do go to town said to one evening probably in april certainly will not leave hartlebury before ah yes stay for hunting yes lord dumbello always remains here through march may run up to town for day two how comfortable must be in london on thursday know when parliament meet suppose exactly be such bore one have to do when man make business of suppose must oh dear yes be quite imperative then mr palliser looked round room thought saw lord dumbello eye fixed upon be really very hard work if truth must be told did not know how to begin what be to say to how be to commence conversation must end by being tender be very handsome certainly for must look interesting for very life did not know how to begin to say anything special to liaison with woman a lady dumbello platonic innocent nevertheless very intimate must certainly lend grace to life under present circumstance be rather dry be told told by public rumour have reached through uncle that lady be willing certainly looked a though liked how be to begin art of startling house of common frightening british public by voluminous accuracy of statistic have already learned what be to say to pretty woman will be sure to be in london in april be on occasion oh yes think so in carlton garden suppose yes lord dumbello have got lease of house now have indeed ah be excellent house hope will be allowed to call there sometimes certainly only know must be so busy not on saturday sunday always receive on sunday said lady dumbello mr palliser felt that there be nothing peculiarly gracious in permission to call when other acquaintance must be there be not much still perhaps be a much a must expect to obtain on occasion looked up saw that lord dumbello eye be again upon that lord dumbello brow be black began to doubt whether country house where people be thrown together be best place in world for such manoeuvring lady dumbello be very handsome liked to look at must not find subject on to interest in drawing room at hartlebury later in evening found saying something to about sugar duty then knew that have better give up have only one day more be required imperatively for speech matter must go much easier in london must postpone till then in crowded room of london private conversation must be much easier lord dumbello must stand over look at lady dumbello have taken remark about sugar very kindly have asked for definition of ad valorem duty be nearer approach to real conversation than have ever before made subject have be unlucky must not in hand be brought round to anything tender so resolved to postpone gallantry till london spring must make easy felt a did so that be relieved for time from heavy weight good by lady dumbello said on next evening start early to morrow morning good by mr palliser a spoke smiled ever so sweetly certainly have not learned to call plantagenet a yet went up to london immediately got to work accurate voluminous speech came off with considerable credit to credit of quiet enduring kind be accorded to such men speech be respectable dull correct men listened to sat with hat over eye asleep pretending to do so daily jupiter in morning have leading article about however left reader at close altogether in doubt whether mr palliser might be supposed to be great financial pundit mr palliser might become shining light to moneyed world glory to banking interest might be future chancellor of exchequer then again might turn out that in affair be mere ignis fatuus blind guide man to be laid aside a very respectable of depth who then at present time must judiciously risk credit by declaring whether mr palliser understood subject did not understand be not content in looking to newspaper for information that earth human intellect can afford demand from what might demand if daily sheet must come to from world of spirit result of course be that paper do pretend that have come daily from world of spirit oracle be very doubtful a be of old plantagenet palliser though be contented with article felt a sat in chamber in albany that something else be wanting to happiness sort of life be very well ambition be grand thing became a palliser future peer to make politics profession might not spare hour two for amaryllis in shade be not hard life of since have be told that lady dumbello smiled upon have certainly thought more about smile than have be good for statistic seemed a though new vein in body have be brought into use blood be running where blood have never run before if have seen lady dumbello before dumbello have seen might not have married ah in such case a have be simply miss grantly lady griselda grantly a case might have be thought might have be able to speak to with more ease a be certainly have found task difficult down in country though have heard of men of class doing same sort of thing life for own part believe that reputed sinner be much more numerous than sinner a sat there certain mr fothergill came in upon mr fothergill be gentleman who managed most of uncle ordinary affair clever fellow who knew on side bread be buttered mr fothergill be naturally anxious to stand well with heir to stand well with owner be business in life with business never allowed anything to interfere on occasion mr fothergill be very civil complimenting future possible patron on very powerful speech predicting for political power with much more certainty than newspaper have have not come from world of spirit mr fothergill have come in to say word two about matter of business a mr palliser money passed through mr fothergill hand a electioneering interest be managed by mr fothergill mr fothergill not unfrequently called to say necessary word two when be done said word two might be necessary not a case might be mr palliser said wonder think of marrying hope will excuse mr palliser be by mean sure that must excuse sat suddenly upright in chair in manner be intended to exhibit first symptom of outraged dignity singularly enough have be thinking of marriage at moment how must have be with have known beautiful griselda before dumbello alliance have be arranged must have married must have be comfortable if have married of course must not marry now seeing that be in love with lady dumbello that lady in question unfortunately have husband of own though have be thinking of marrying did not like to have subject thus roughly thrust before eye a be into very lap by uncle agent mr fothergill doubt saw first symptom of outraged dignity for be clever sharp man perhaps did not in truth much regard perhaps have received instruction be bound to regard above other matter hope will excuse mr palliser do indeed say because be half afraid of diminution of good feeling perhaps have better call between uncle anything of kind must be such monstrous pity be not aware of such probability mr palliser said with considerable dignity when word be spoken bethought whether have not told fib perhaps not trust there be such probability duke be very determined man if take anything into head then have so much in power have not in power mr fothergill one man doe not have in power in country not in way then know mr palliser must hardly do to offend must must rather not offend a be natural indeed wish to offend one exactly so least of duke who have whole property in own hand may say whole for can marry to morrow if plea then life be so good know stouter man of age anywhere be very glad to hear be sure be mr palliser if be to take offence know must put up with yes exactly be what must do must be worth while to avoid seeing how much have in power have duke sent to now mr fothergill nothing of sort dropped word other day made fancy that be not quite quite quite at ease about have long known that must be very glad indeed to see heir born to property other morning know whether there be anything in fancied be going to make change in present arrangement did not do might have be fancy only think mr palliser what one word of might do if say word never go back from then having said so much mr fothergill went way mr palliser understood meaning of very well be not first occasion on mr fothergill have given advice advice such a mr fothergill have right to give always received such counsel with air of half injured dignity intending thereby to explain to mr fothergill that be intruding knew well whence advice came though in such case have made up mind not to follow such counsel have generally come to pas mr palliser conduct have more le accurately conformed to mr fothergill advice word from duke might certainly do great deal mr palliser resolved that in affair of lady dumbello must follow own device nevertheless be undoubtedly true that word from duke might do great deal who be in secret know how far mr palliser have already progressed in iniquitous passion before left hartlebury others who be perhaps not so well informed gave credit for much more advanced success lady clandidlem in letter to lady de courcy written immediately after departure of mr palliser declared that having heard of gentleman intended matutinal departure have confidently expected to learn at breakfast table that lady dumbello have flown with from tone of ladyship language seemed a though have be robbed of anticipated pleasure by lady dumbello prolonged sojourn in hall of husband ancestor feel however quite convinced said lady clandidlem that can not go on longer than spring never yet saw man so infatuated a mr palliser did not leave for one moment time be here one lady hartletop must have permitted know there be nothing so pleasant a good old family friendship chapter xliv valentine day at allington lily have exacted promise from mother before illness during period of convalescence often referred to reminding mother that promise have be made must be kept lily be to be told day on crosbie be to be married have come to knowledge of that marriage be to take place in february be not sufficient for lily must know day a time drew nearer lily becoming stronger while le subject to medical authority marriage of crosbie alexandrina be spoken of much more frequently at small house be not subject mr dale bell must have chosen for conversation lily must refer to must begin by doing so almost in drolling strain alluding to herself a forlorn damsel in play book then must go on to speak of interest a matter be still of great moment to in course of such talking must too often break down showing by sad word melancholy tone how great be burden on heart mr dale bell must willingly have avoided subject lily must not have avoided for be very difficult matter on to speak in hearing be not permitted to to say word of abuse against crosbie a to whom thought that word of condemnation must be sufficiently severe be forced to listen to such excuse for conduct a lily chose to manufacture never daring to point out how vain excuse be indeed in day lily reigned a queen at small house ill usage illness together falling into hand have given such power that none of other woman be able to withstand nothing be said about be understood by jane cook included that lily be for time paramount be dear gracious loving brave queen one be anxious to rebel only that praise of crosbie be so very bitter in ear of subject day be named soon enough tidings came down to allington on fourteenth of february crosbie be to be made happy man be not known to dale till twelfth must willingly have spared knowledge then have be possible to spare be not so on evening lily be told during day bell used to see uncle daily visit be made with pretence of taking to information a to lily health there be perhaps at bottom of feeling a family intended to leave small house at end of march must be well to let squire know that there be enmity in heart against nothing more have be said about moving nothing be from to matter be going on knew dr croft be already in treaty on behalf for small furnished house at squire be very sad about very sad indeed when hopkins spoke to on subject sharply desired that faithful gardener to hold tongue giving to be understood that such thing be not to be made matter of talk by allington dependant till have be officially announced with bell during visit never alluded to matter be chief sinner in have refused to marry cousin have declined even to listen to rational counsel upon matter squire felt that must not discus subject with seeing that have be specially informed by mr dale that interference must not be permitted then be perhaps aware that if did discus subject with bell must not gain much by such discussion conversation therefore generally fell upon crosbie tone in be mentioned in great house be very different from assumed in lily presence will be wretched man said squire when told bell of day have be fixed want to be wretched said bell can hardly think that can act a have done without being punished will be wretched man get fortune with will expect

quite a black cold a wintersome a be at allington be perhaps somewhat more melancholy in coldness nevertheless lady alexandrina de courcy looked a bright a bridal finery must make when got out of carriage walked into st james church at eleven o'clock on morning have be finally arranged that marriage must take place in london there be certainly many reason must have made marriage from courcy castle more convenient de courcy family be assembled at country family residence must therefore have be present at ceremony without cost trouble castle too be warm with warmth of life pleasantness of home must have lent grace to departure of one of daughter of house retainer servant be there something of rich mellowness of noble alliance might have be felt at rate by crosbie at marriage so celebrated must have be acknowledged even by lady de courcy that house in portman square be very cold that marriage from thence must be cold that there must be hope of attaching to honour glory of making resound with fashionable eclat in column of morning post then have be married in country earl must have be there whereas there be probability of travelling up to london for purpose of being present on occasion earl be very terrible in day alexandrina a became confidential in communication with future husband spoke of a of ogre who must not by mean be avoided in concern of life whom one might shun now again by subtle device careful arrangement of favourable circumstance crosbie have more than once taken upon to hint that did not specially regard ogre seeing that for future must keep altogether apart from malicious monster dominion will not come to in new home have said to love with little touch of affection to view of case lady alexandrina have demurred ogre in question be not only parent be also noble peer must not agree to arrangement by future connection with earl with nobility in general might be endangered parent doubtless be ogre in ogreship must make very terrible to near then might not be better for to be near to earl who be ogre than not to be near to earl at have therefore signified to crosbie that ogre must be endured nevertheless be great thing to be rid of on happy occasion must have said very dreadful thing thing so dreadful that there might have be question whether bridegroom must have borne since have heard of crosbie accident at railway station have constantly talked with fiendish glee of beating have be administered to son in law lady de courcy in taking crosbie part maintaining that match be fitting for daughter have ventured to declare before husband that crosbie be man of fashion earl must now ask with loathsome grin whether bridegroom fashion have be improved by little adventure at paddington crosbie to whom be not repeated must have preferred wedding in country countess lady alexandrina knew better earl have strictly interdicted expenditure countess have of necessity construed a forbidding unnecessary expense to marry girl without immediate cost be thing nobody must understand a countess remarked to eldest daughter must really spend a little a possible lady amelia have answered see mamma there be circumstance about one doe wish to have talked about just at present there be story of girl then that fracas at station really think ought to be a quiet a possible good sense of lady amelia be not to be disputed a mother acknowledged then if marriage be managed in notoriously quiet way very notoriety of quiet must be a dangerous a attempt at loud glory wo cost a much said amelia thus have be resolved that wedding must be very quiet to crosbie have assented very willingly though have not relished manner in countess have explained to view need not tell adolphus have said how thoroughly satisfied be with marriage dear girl feel that can be happy a wife what more can want declared to to amelia be not ambitious for sake have allowed to please hope have pleased said crosbie trust so nevertheless know whether make understood quite so lady de courcy if alexandrina be going to marry eldest son of marquis must have longer procession to church than will be necessary when marries put in such odd way adolphus be right so long a understand other can assure want procession at must be quite contented to go down with alexandrina arm in arm like darby joan let clerk give away may say that must have be much better contented must have be allowed to go down street without encumbrance on arm there be possibility now for such deliverance a lady amelia mr gazebee have long since discovered bitterness of heart fact of repentance gazebee have ventured to suggest to wife that noble sister in law be preparing for life of misery will become quiet happy when be used to lady amelia have replied thinking perhaps of own

thing of woman sat opposite to have not great punishment come upon have not deserved punishment in truth great punishment have come upon be not only that have married woman incapable of understanding higher duty of married life that must have be capable of appreciating value of woman who did understand must have be happy with lily dale therefore may surmise that unhappiness with lady alexandrina must be greater there be men who in marrying such a lady alexandrina de courcy must get article best suited to a mortimer gazebee have done in marrying sister miss griselda grantly who have become lady dumbello though somewhat colder somewhat cleverer than lady alexandrina have be of same sort in marrying lord dumbello have got article best suited to if only ill natured world must allow to keep

crosbie however have resolved on success have done much towards carrying out purpose have made name for have acquired certain fame that however be a acknowledged to departing from looked matter straight in face told that fashion must be abandoned office remained to might still rule over mr optimist make subservient slave of butterwell must be line in life now to line must endeavour to be

that stood thought of for hour if please sir lady want to know at what time have ordered dinner at seven hannah lady say be very tired will lie down till dinner time very well hannah will go into room when be time to dress hope be making comfortable downstairs then crosbie strolled out on pier in dusk of cold winter evening chapter xlvi john eames at office illustration untitled mr crosbie wife went upon honeymoon tour to folkestone in middle of february returned to london about end of march nothing of special moment to interest of story occurred during six week unless proceeding of young married couple by sea side may be thought to have special interest with regard to proceeding can only say that crosbie be very glad when be brought to close holiday making be hard work holiday making with nothing to do be hardest work of at end of march went into new house will hope that lady alexandrina did not find very cold during time lily recovery from illness be being completed have relapse did anything occur to create new fear on account nevertheless dr croft gave a opinion that must be inexpedient to move into fresh house at lady day march be not kindly month for invalid therefore with regret on part of mr dale with much impatience on of bell with considerable outspoken remonstrance from lily squire be requested to let remain through month of april how squire received request in what way assented to doctor reasoning will be told in course of chapter two in meantime john eames have continued career in london without much immediate satisfaction to to lady who boasted to be heart chosen queen miss amelia roper indeed be becoming very cross in ill temper be playing game be tending to create frightful amount of hot water in burton crescent be devoting to flirtation with mr cradell not only under immediate eye of johnny eames also under of mr lupex john eames blockhead did not like be above thing anxious to get rid of amelia claim so anxious that on certain moody occasion must threaten with diverse tragical termination to career in london must enlist must go to australia must blow out brain must have explanation with amelia tell that be vixen proclaim hatred must rush down to allington throw in despair at lily foot be bugbear of life nevertheless when flirted with cradell did not like be as enough to speak to cradell about of course care said only seems to that be making fool of thought wanted to get rid of be nothing on earth to only doe know doe do what asked cradell why if be to be fal lalling with married woman must like be about do mean to marry what amelia yes amelia not if know then if be must leave alone be only making fool of eames advice may have be good view taken by of amelia proceeding may have be correct a regarded own part in affair be not wise miss roper doubt wished to make jealous succeeded in teeth of aversion to of love elsewhere have desire to say soft thing to miss roper miss roper with skill must not extract word pleasantly soft from once week nevertheless soft word to from in quarter made uneasy such being case must not acknowledge that john eames be still floundering in ignorance of hobbledehoyhood lupexes at time still held ground in crescent although repeated warning to go have be given mr roper though constantly spoke of sacrificing that owed still hankered with natural hankering after money a warning be accompanied by demand for payment usually produced slight subsidy on account thing went on from week to week at beginning of april mr mr lupex be still boarder at mr roper house eames have heard nothing from allington since time of christmas visit subsequent correspondence with lord de guest in letter from mother be told that game came frequently from guestwick manor in way knew that be not forgotten by earl of lily have heard not word except indeed rumour have now become general that dale from small house be about to move into guestwick when first learned construed tidings a favourable to thinking that lily removed from grandeur of allington might possibly be more easily within reach latterly have given up such hope a be telling that friend at manor have abandoned idea of making up marriage three month have already elapsed since visit five month have passed since crosbie have surrendered claim surely such knave a crosbie might be forgotten in five month if step must have be taken through squire surely three month must have sufficed for be very manifest to that there be ground of hope for at allington must certainly be well for to go off to australia must go to australia must thrash cradell first for having dared to interfere with amelia roper that generally be state of mind during first week in april then there came to letter from earl instantly effected great change in feeling taught to regard australia a dream almost put into good humour with cradell earl have by mean lost sight of friend interest at allington moreover interest be now backed by ally who in matter must be regarded a much more powerful than earl squire have given in consent to eames alliance earl letter be a follows guestwick manor april dear john told to write to again have done saw mother other day else might have be dead for anything knew young man always ought to write letter when be told to do so eames when have got so far felt rather aggrieved by rebuke knowing that have abstained from writing to patron simply from unwillingness to intrude upon with letter by jove will write to week of life till be sick of johnny said to when found thus instructed a to young man duty now have got to tell long story must like much better if be down here so that might save trouble must think ill natured if be to keep waiting happened to meet mr dale other day said that must be very glad if certain young lady must make up mind to listen to certain young friend of mine so asked what meant to do about young lady fortune declared willing to give hundred year during life to settle four thousand pound upon after death said must do a much on part by young man a two hundred year with salary must hardly give enough to begin with will make mine hundred fifty will be getting up in office soon with five hundred year ought to be able to get along especially a need not insure life must live somewhere near bloomsbury square at first because be told can get house for nothing after

know will find squire on side that be must manage to come down easter tell old buffle with compliment want will write to if like did know at one time though ca say be ever very fond of stand to reason that ca get on with miss lily without seeing unless indeed like better to write to always seems to to be very poor sort of fun 'd much better come down go wooing in regular old fashioned way need not tell that lady julia will be delighted to see be prime favourite with since affair at railway station think great deal more about than doe about bull now dear fellow know about will take very much amiss of if answer letter soon very sincere friend de guest when eames have finished letter sitting at office desk surprise elation be so great that hardly knew where be what ought to do must be truth that lily uncle have not only consented that match must be made that have also promised to give niece considerable fortune for few minute seemed to johnny a though obstacle to happiness be removed that there be impediment between amount of bliss of have hitherto hardly dared to dream then when considered earl munificence almost cried found that must not compose mind to think even hand to write did not know whether must be right in to accept such pecuniary liberality from living man almost thought that must feel bound to reject earl offer a to squire money that knew might accept come in shape of young woman fortune may be taken by man must certainly answer earl letter at once must not leave office till have done so friend must have cause to bring further charge against of kind then again reverted to injustice have be done to in matter of letter writing a if consideration be of moment in such state of circumstance a be now existing at last thought brought to real question at issue must lily dale accept after realization of good fortune depended altogether upon feeling a remembered mind misgave sorely be filled not only with young lover ordinary doubt with fear trembling incidental to bashfulness of hobbledehoyhood with idea that affair with crosbie must still stand in way did not perhaps rightly understand lily have suffered conceived to be probable that there have be wound even last five month might not yet have cured must be that must allow to cure wound a thought of felt almost crushed to earth by indomitable bashfulness conviction of own unworthiness what have to offer worthy of acceptance of such girl a lilian dale fear that crown did not get out of john eames adequate return for salary on day so adequate however have be return given by for time past

seen be abode very unlike in nature to of other earl at courcy castle lady de courcy at rate understood how to receive entertain house full of people though practice of doing so might give rise to difficult question in privacy of domestic relation lady julia did not understand then lady julia be never called upon to answer for expense of extra servant be asked about twice week who be to pay wine merchant bill a regard lord de guest lady julia think have best of be bound to admit with reference to chance guest that house be dull people who be now gathered at earl table must hardly have be expected to be very sprightly when in company with other squire be not man much given to general society be unused to amuse table full of people on present occasion sat next to lady julia from time to time muttered few word to about state of country mr eames be terribly afraid of everybody there especially of earl next to whom sat whom continually called lord showing by voice a did so that be almost alarmed by sound of own voice mr mr boyce be there parson sitting on other side of lady julia parson wife on other side of earl mr boyce be very studious to show that be quite at home talked perhaps more than one else in doing so bored earl most exquisitely so that told john eames next morning that be worse than bull parson ate dinner said little nothing between two grace be heavy

parson wife of allington so that earl be overweighted did not shine on occasion at own dinner table dr croft who have also be invited who have secured place be now peculiarly own next to bell dale be doubt happy enough a let hope be young lady also added very little to general hilarity of company john eames be seated between own sister parson did not at enjoy position have full view of doctor

aware of fact dread dinner resolved to give quite a much a be dreaded by friend know that prepare for guest evening of misery for certain long hour of purgatory be hardly to be endured will do why long table supernumerary glass knife fork if be never to be used argument produce misery others cognate to on present occasion doubt there be excuse to be made squire niece have be invited on special cause presence must have be well enough doctor added in must have done harm be good natured too that invitation given to mr eames daughter error lay in parson wife there be necessity for being there

bearing on story nothing indeed be said have bearing on anything earl professed object have be to bring squire young eames together people be never brought together on such melancholy occasion though

terribly in way of sorrow under such circumstance what must do roam wide about across field resting when might choose to rest running when might suit to run be not like other girl thought to wo care for boot being dirty so at last elected to walk stand up to boldly man earl have said to by george what be there to be afraid of be belief will give most to who ask for most there be nothing set against man like being sheepish how earl knew so much seeing that have not given sign of success in walk of life be not prepared to say eames took advice a being in good resolved to act upon not that resolution will be of use said to a walked along when moment come know that will tremble before know that will see think will make difference in have last seen on lawn behind small house just at time when passion for crosbie be at strongest eames have gone thither impelled by foolish desire to declare to hopeless love have answered by telling that loved crosbie better than world besides of course have done so at time nevertheless manner of telling have seemed to to be cruel also have be cruel have told that hated crosbie calling that man assuring that earthly consideration must induce to go into man house then have walked away moodily wishing manner of evil be not singular that evil thing in mind have meditated for man have fallen upon crosbie have lost love have so proved to be villain

find there there be one to be seen in garden sound to be heard a step brought nearer to whom be seeking became more more conscious of hopelessness of errand have never loved why must venture to hope that must love now must have turned back have not be aware that promise to others required that must persevere have said that must do thing must be a good a word hardly ventured to hope that might be

feeling must be disgraced in own eye if admitted love of man after after be to almost a though have married be not blaming remember thing be different with man have not dropped hand a made last speech be sitting in old chair with eye fixed upon ground spoke in low voice slowly almost with difficulty still word came very clearly with clear distinct voice caused to be remembered with accuracy by eames mr dale to seemed to be impossible that must continue suit after declaration to mr dale be terrible word speaking of perpetual widowhood telling of amount of suffering greater even than have anticipated be true that lily have never said so much to a have now said to john eames have attempted to make so clear exposition of own feeling must be disgraced in own eye if admitted love of man be terrible word very easy to be understood mr dale have felt from first that eames be coming too soon that earl squire together be making effort to cure wound too quickly after infliction that time must have be given to girl to recover now attempt have be made word have be forced from lily lip speaking of must never be forgotten by knew that must be so said john ah yes know because heart understands

be otherwise with must have have best wish in matter must have loved dearly a son will love now then put up lip kissed face so will love said lily giving hand again looked longingly into face a though have thought possible that also might kiss then pressed hand to lip without speaking further farewell took up hat left room poor fellow said mr dale must not have let come said lily understand think have lost toy mean to be good natured to give very shortly after lily went away by sat alone for hour when joined mother again at tea time nothing further be said of john eames visit made way out by front door through churchyard in way on to field through have asked lily to walk with hardly began to think of what have passed till have left squire house behind a made way through tombstone paused read one a though interested stood moment under tower looking up at clock then pulled out own watch a though to verify one by other made unconsciously struggle to drive away from thought fact of late scene for five ten minute succeeded said to word two about sir raffle letter laughed inwardly a remembered figure of rafferty bringing in knight shoe have gone half mile upon way before ventured to stand still tell that have failed in great object of life yes have failed acknowledged to with bitter reproach that have failed now for ever told that have obtruded upon in sorrow with unmannerly love rebuked a having be not only foolish ungenerous friend earl have be wont in waggish way to call conquering hero have so talked out of common sense a to have made almost think that must be successful in suit now a told that such success must have be impossible almost hated earl for having brought to condition conquering hero indeed how must manage to sneak back among at manor house crestfallen abject in misery everybody knew errand on have gone everybody must know of failure how must have be fool a to undertake such task under eye of so many looker on be not case that have so fondly expected success a to think only of triumph in returning not of more probable disgrace have allowed others to make fool of have so made fool of now hope happiness be over for how must escape at once out of country back to london how must get away without saying word further to one be thought at first occupied mind crossed road at end of squire property where parish of allington divide from of abbot guest in earl house stand made way back along copse skirted field in have encountered bull into high wood be at back of park ah yes have be well for that have not come out on horseback that ride home along high road up to manor house stable must under present circumstance have be almost impossible to a be did not think possible that must return to place in earl house how must pretend to maintain ordinary demeanour under eye of two old men must be better for to get home to mother to send message from thence to manor then to escape back to london so thinking with resolution made went on through wood down from hill back towards town till again came to little bridge over brook there stopped stood while with broad hand spread over letter have cut in early day so a to hide from sight what as have be always ever said to be not only of late disappointment that be thinking of whole past life be conscious of hobbledehoyhood of backwardness on part in assuming manhood have rendered incapable of making acceptable to lily before have fallen into clutch of crosbie a thought of declared to that if must meet crosbie again must again thrash that must so belabour a to send out of world if such sending might possibly be done by fair beating regardless whether might be called upon to follow be not hard that for two of for lily for also there must be such punishment because of insincerity of man when have thus stood upon bridge for quarter of hour took out knife with deep rough gash in wood cut out lily name from rail have hardly finished be still looking at chip a be being carried away by stream when gentle step came close up to turning round saw that lady julia be on bridge be close to have already seen handiwork have offended john said oh lady julia have offended have refused be over illustration have refused be over may be that have refused yet need not be over be sorry that have cut out name john do mean to cut out from heart never must if must never will keep to a to great treasure will be joy to in after year not sorrow to have loved truly even though will have loved in vain will be consolation when be a old a be be something to have have heart know wish have none john can understand feeling now indeed thought through that be asking too soon time may yet come when will think better of wish never begin to know now if can be constant in love may win yet remember how young be how young be come again in two year time then when have won will tell have be good old woman to will never win lady julia a spoke last word tear be running down cheek be weeping openly in presence of companion be well for that have come upon in sorrow when once knew that have seen tear must pour out to whole story of grief a did so led back quietly to house chapter lv not very fie fie after will perhaps be remembered that terrible thing have be foretold a about to happen between hartletop omnium family lady dumbello have smiled whenever mr plantagenet palliser have spoken to mr palliser have confessed to that politics be not enough for that love be necessary to make up full complement of happiness lord dumbello have frowned latterly when eye fell on tall figure of duke heir duke that potentate generally so mighty in silence duke have spoken lady de courcy lady clandidlem be of absolutely certain that thing have be fully arranged be therefore perfectly justified in stating that world be talking about love illicit love of mr palliser lady dumbello talking of world found way down to respectable country parsonage in lady dumbello have be born from have be taken away to noble hall now graced by presence talking of world be heard at plumstead episcopi where still lived archdeacon grantly lady father be heard also at deanery of barchester where lived lady aunt grandfather by whose ill mannered tongue rumour be spread in ecclesiastical region boot not now to tell may be remembered that courcy castle be not far from barchester that lady de courcy be not given to hide light under bushel be terrible rumour to what mother must not such rumour respecting daughter be very terrible in mother ear must have sounded more frightfully than did in of mr grantly lady dumbello daughter might be altogether worldly mr grantly have never be more than half worldly in one moiety of character habit desire have be wedded to thing good in to religion to charity to honest hearted uprightness be true that circumstance of life have induced to serve god mammon that therefore have gloried greatly in marriage of daughter with heir of marquis have revelled in aristocratic elevation of child though continued to dispense book catechism with own hand to child of labourer of plumstead episcopi when griselda first became lady dumbello mother feared somewhat lest child must find unequal to exigency of new position child have proved more than equal to have mounted up to dizzy height of success brought to mother great glory great fear also delighted to think that griselda be great even among daughter of marquis trembled a reflected how deadly must be fall from such height must there ever be fall have never dreamed of fall a must have said indeed often have said to archdeacon that griselda religious principle be too firmly fixed to be moved by outward worldly matter signifying may be conviction that teaching of plumstead episcopi have so fastened daughter into groove future teaching of hartlebury must not suffice to undo fastening when have thus boasted such idea a of daughter running from husband house have ever come upon have alluded to vice of nature kindred to vice to vice into other aristocratic lady sometimes fell who have be le firmly grooved boasting have amounted to that have so successfully served god mammon together that child might go forth enjoy worldly thing without risk of damage to thing heavenly then came upon rumour archdeacon told in hoarse whisper that have be recommended to look to that be current through world that griselda be about to leave husband nothing on earth will make believe said mr grantly sat alone in drawing room afterwards trembled then came sister mr arabin dean wife over to parsonage in half hidden word told same story have heard from mr proudie bishop wife that woman be a false a father of falsehood said mr grantly trembled more a prepared parish work must think of nothing child what must be life to come what must have be be past of life if thing must happen to must not believe yet trembled more a thought of daughter exaltation remembered that such thing have be done in world to griselda now belonged ah must not have be better for if have not raised head so high walked out alone among tomb of neighbouring churchyard stood over grave in have be laid body of other daughter must be that fate of one have be happier very few word be spoken on subject between archdeacon yet seemed agreed among that something must be done went up to london saw daughter not daring however to mention subject lord dumbello be cross with very uncommunicative indeed both archdeacon mr grantly have found that daughter house be not comfortable to a be sufficiently proud among own class have not cared to press on hospitality of son in law have be able to perceive that be not right in house in carlton garden lord dumbello be not gracious with wife there be something in silence rather than in speech of men seemed to justify report have reached be there oftener than must be said archdeacon be sure of at least that dumbello doe not like will write to said mr grantly at last be still mother will write to may be that doe not know what people say of mr grantly did write plumstead april dearest griselda seems sometimes that have be moved so far away from have hardly right to concern more in affair of daily life know that be impossible that must refer to for advice sympathy a must have done have married gentleman of own standing be quite sure that child doe not forget mother fail to look back upon mother love that will allow to speak to if be in trouble a must to other child whom have loved cherished pray god may be wrong in supposing that such trouble be near if be so will forgive solicitude rumour have reached from more than one quarter oh griselda hardly know in what word to conceal yet to declare that have to write say that be intimate with mr palliser nephew of duke that husband be much offended perhaps have better tell openly cautioning not to suppose have believed say that be thought that be going to put under mr palliser protection dearest child think can imagine with what agony write word with what terrible grief must have be oppressed before must have allowed to entertain thought have produced such thing be said openly in barchester father who have be in town have seen feel unable to tell that mind may be at rest will not say to word a to injury in worldly point of view must come to from rupture with husband believe that can see what must be effect of so terrible step quite a plainly a can show must break heart of father send mother to grave be not even on that may most insist be that must offend god by worst sin that woman can commit cast into depth of infamy in repentance before god be almost impossible from escape before man be not permitted believe dearest dearest child only living daughter believe what have said to a mother have not dared to leave slander unnoticed if will write to say that be not so will make happy again even though must rebuke for suspicion believe that at time under circumstance be still loving mother a be in other day susan grantly will now go back to mr palliser a sat in chamber at albany thinking of love duke have cautioned duke agent have cautioned in spite of high feeling of independence have almost be made to tremble thousand year be in balance perhaps everything on depended position before world nevertheless though did tremble resolved to persevere statistic be becoming dry to love be very sweet statistic thought might be made a enchanting a ever if only must be mingled with love mere idea of loving lady dumbello have seemed to give salt to life of did not now know how to rob be true that have not a yet enjoyed many of absolute blessing of love seeing that conversation with lady dumbello have never be warmer than have be repeated in page imagination have be at work now that lady dumbello be fully established at house in carlton garden be determined to declare passion on first convenient opportunity be sufficiently manifest to that world expected to do so that world be already little disposed to find fault with slowness of proceeding have be once at carlton garden since season have commenced lady have favoured with sweetest smile have only be minute alone with during half minute have only time to remark that supposed must now remain in london for season oh yes have answered will not leave till july must leave till july because of exigency

gustavus said a soon a have seated discreetly in chair have have letter from mother have better read handed to document know have done to deserve such suspicion from life in country have probably be deceived by ill natured people at rate must read tell must do may predicate from mr palliser chance of being able to shipwreck upon rock be small that must in spite of be saved from uncle anger lord dumbello took letter read very slowly standing a did so with back to fire read very slowly wife though never turned face directly upon must perceive that became very red that be fluttered put beyond that answer be not ready be well aware that conduct to during last three month have be much altered from former usage that have be rougher with in speech when alone le courteous in attention when in society have made complaint spoken word to show that have marked change have known moreover cause of altered manner having considered much have resolved that must live down have declared to herself that have done deed spoken word that justified suspicion therefore must make change in way show to be conscious that be suspected now having mother letter in hand must bring to explanation without making aware that have ever thought that have be jealous of to mother letter be great assistance justified scene like enabled to fight battle after own fashion a for eloping with mr palliser giving up

of heart will be poor lady dumbello be there in small inner room seated on couch to have be brought on first arrival at house on must remain till departed from time to time very noble very elevated personage must come before say word must answer that elevated personage with word nobody have attempted with task of conversation be understood that lady dumbello did not converse unless be occasionally with mr palliser knew well that mr palliser be to meet there have told expressly that must do so having inquired with much solicitude whether intended to obey invitation of countess will probably be there have said now have determined that mother letter husband conduct to must not cause to break word must mr palliser forget must know how to say word to a have known how to say word to husband forget be very sure that mr palliser have be making up mind to forget for month past did come to stood over looking unutterable thing unutterable thing however be so looked that did not absolutely demand notice from lady did not sigh like furnace open eye upon a though there be two sun in firmament above head did beat breast tear hair mr palliser have be brought up in school delight in tranquillity never allows pupil to commit to sublime to ridiculous did look unutterable thing two did with so decorous eye that lady who be measuring with great accuracy must not a yet declare that mr palliser have forgotten there be room by on couch once twice at hartlebury have ventured so to seat on present occasion however must not do so without placing manifestly on dress must have known how to fill larger couch even than a must have known also how to make room have be mind to do so so stood still over smiled at smile be cold a death flattering one saying nothing hideous in unmeaning unreal grace ah how hate smile of woman who smile by rote made mr palliser feel very uncomfortable did not analyze persevered lady dumbello said voice be very low have be looking forward to meeting here have mr palliser yes remember that asked whether be coming did hm lady dumbello almost trenched upon outside verge of schooling have taught to avoid sublime ridiculous have not forgotten a yet so

faute de mieux seeing that seat be denied to must do standing griselda said must be admitted that tone be not bad word sank softly into ear like small rain upon moss sank into other ear griselda mr palliser said though made scene though merely glanced upon once must see that be wrong may not call so certainly not will ask to see if people be there stood moment before hesitating carriage mean a gave command glanced at again then obeyed order when returned have left seat heard name announced on stair caught glance of back of head a made way gracefully down through crowd never attempted to make love to again utterly disappointing hope of lady de courcy mr proudie lady clandidlem a must wish who be interested in mr palliser fortune to know ultimate result of adventure a will not have space to return to affair in little history may perhaps be allowed to press somewhat forward tell what fortune did for before close of london season everybody know that in spring lady glencora maccluskie be brought out before world be equally well known a only child of late lord of isle be great heiress of day be true that hereditary possession of skye staffa mull arran bute went with title

loved so dearly have little dog be almost a dear a horse friend of youth sabrina scott be oh such girl cousin little lord of isle heir of marquis be so gracious beautiful that be always covering with kiss unfortunately be only six so that there be hardly possibility that property must be brought together lady glencora though be so charming have even in first outset upon world given great uneasiness to friend caused marquis of auldreekie to be almost wild with dismay there be terribly handsome man about town who have spent shilling that anybody must give who be very fond of brandy who be known not trusted at newmarket who be said to be deep in vice whose father must not speak to with lady glencora be never tired of dancing one morning have told cousin marquis with flashing eye for round blue eye must flash that burgo fitzgerald be more sinned against than sinning ah be guardian marquis anxious for fate of family property to do under such circumstance a before end of season marquis duke be happy men will hope that lady glencora also be satisfied mr plantagenet palliser have danced with twice have spoken mind have interview with marquis be pre eminently satisfactory everything be settled glencora doubt told how have accepted that plain gold ring from burgo fitzgerald how have restored doubt whether ever told of wavy lock of golden hair burgo still keep in receptacle for such treasure plantagenet said duke with quite unaccustomed warmth in a in thing have shown to be everything must desire have told marquis that matching priory with whole estate must be given over to at once be most comfortable country house know glencora will have horn a wedding present genial frank delight of mr fothergill pleased mr palliser most heir of pallisers have done duty mr fothergill be unfeignedly happy man chapter lvi showing how mr crosbie became again happy man have be told in last chapter how lady de courcy gave great party in london in latter day of april may therefore be thought that thing be going well with de courcys fear inference must be untrue at rate thing be not going well with lady alexandrina for on mother first arrival in town have rushed to portman square with long tale of suffering oh mamma must not believe hardly ever speaks to dear there be worse fault in man than be alone there day never get out never offer to get carriage asked to

up in house a by from nine o'clock in morning till six in evening everybody know what be so that nobody will come to see tell fairly mamma will not stand if can not help will look for help elsewhere may at rate be said that thing be not going well with branch of de courcy family indeed be going well with other branch lord porlock have married not having selected partner for life from choicest cream of aristocratic circle mother while endeavouring to say word in favour have be so abused by earl that have be driven to declare that must no longer endure such usage have come up to london in direct opposition to command while be fastened to room by gout have given party in defiance of so that people must not say when back be turned that have slunk away in despair have borne said to margaretta longer than other woman in england must have done while thought that of must marry oh talk of mamma said margaretta putting little scorn into voice have not be quite pleased that even

about sufferer most warm hearted intensely feeling young gentleman might doubt eat excellent dinner after being refused by girl of devotion provided that have reason to believe that none of in whose company ate knew anything of rejection same warm hearted intensely feeling young gentleman must find very difficult to go through ceremony with appearance of true appetite gastronomic enjoyment if be aware that convives knew fact of little misfortune generally may suppose man in such condition go to club for dinner seek consolation in shade of adjacent richmond hampton court there meditates on condition in silence doe ultimately enjoy little plate of whitebait cutlet moderate pint of sherry probably go alone to theatre in stall speculates with somewhat bitter sarcasm on vanity of world then return home sad indeed with moderated sadness a puff out smoke of cigar at open window with perhaps comfort of little brandy water at elbow swears to that by jove will have try for alone man may console among crowd of unconscious mortal must be admitted that position of john eames be severe have be invited down there to woo lily dale squire bell have be asked to be present at wooing have gone well nothing must have be nicer must have be hero of hour everybody must have sung for song of triumph everything have not gone well found very difficult to carry otherwise than lackadaisically on

must take at word so walked off from crescent not exactly shaking dust from foot resolving that must know more either of dust of dirt dirt enough have encountered there certainly be now old enough to feel that inmate of mr roper house have not be among whom resting place for early year must judiciously have be sought have come out of fire comparatively unharmed regret to say that felt little for terrible scorchings to friend have be subjected be about to subject be quite content to look at matter exactly a be looked at by mr roper amelia be good enough for joseph cradell day of week poor cradell of whom in page after notice more will be heard can not think that hard measure of justice be meted out to in proportion to extent of sin more weak foolish than friend hero have be not to knowledge more wicked be to vain foolish that punishment fall to fall so thickly constantly that thinker be driven to think vanity folly be of sin may be least forgiven a for cradell may declare that did marry amelia that did with pride take place of master of house at bottom of mr roper table that did make responsible for mr roper debt of future fortune there be not space to speak in page going away from crescent eames have driven to office reached just a men be leaving at four o'clock cradell be gone so that did not see on afternoon have opportunity of shaking hand with mr love who treated with smiling courtesy due to official bigwig for private secretary if not absolutely big wig be semi big entitled to certain amount of reverence passed mr kissing in passage hurrying along a usual with huge book under arm mr kissing hurried a be stopped shuffling foot eames only looked at hardly honouring with acknowledgment of nod of head mr kissing however be not offended knew that private secretary of first commissioner have be guest of earl what more than nod must be expected from after john made way into august presence of sir raffle found that great man putting on shoe in presence of fitzhoward fitzhoward blushed shoe have not be touched by a took occasion afterwards to inform john eames sir raffle be smile civility delighted to see back eames be upon word though fitzhoward have got on capitally in absence have fitzhoward oh yes drawled fitzhoward have minded for time just while eames have be away be much too idle to keep at know bread will be buttered for elsewhere so doe signify compliment to duchess when see then fitzhoward went how dear old friend asked sir raffle a though of men living lord de guest be one for whom have strongest oldest love yet must have known that john eames knew a much about a did there be men who have most lively gratification in calling lord marquis friend though know that nobody belief word of what say even though know how great be odium incur how lasting be ridicule vanity produce be gentle insanity prevails in outer court of aristocracy a brings with considerable annoyance lukewarm pleasure must not be treated with too keen severity how dear old friend eames assured that dear old friend be right lady julia be right that dear old place be right sir raffle now spoke a though dear old place be quite well known to be game doing pretty well be there promise of bird sir raffle anxiety be quite intense expressed with almost familiar affection by by eames where be living at present well be not settled be at great western railway hotel at moment capital house very only be expensive if stay there whole season johnny have idea of remaining there beyond one night said nothing a to by by might a well come dine with to morrow lady buffle be most anxious to know there will be one two with did ask friend dumbello there be nonsense going on in house think that ca get away johnny be more gracious than lord dumbello accepted invitation wonder what lady buffle will be like said to a walked away from office have turned into great western hotel not a yet knowing where to look for home there will leave eating solitary mutton chop at one of table be so comfortable to eye be so comfortless in reality speak not now with reference to excellent establishment have be named to nature of such table in general solitary mutton chop in hotel coffee room be not banquet to be envied by god if mutton chop be converted into soup fish little dish big dish rest matter becomes worse not better what comfort be to have seated alone on horsehair chair staring into room watching waiter a whisk about towel one englishman have ever yet thought of subjecting to position a here will leave john eames in doing so must be allowed to declare that only now at moment have entered on manhood hitherto have be hobbledehoy calf a be who have carried calfishness later into life than be common with calf who did not perhaps on account give promise of making worse ox than rest of life hitherto a recorded in page have afforded brilliant success have hardly qualified for role of hero have be made to play feel have be in fault in giving such prominence to hobbledehoy must have told story better have brought mr crosbie more conspicuously forward on canvas at rate have gotten to wife a hero always must do whereas must leave poor friend johnny without matrimonial prospect be thus that thought of a sat moping over solitary table in hotel coffee room acknowledged to that have not hitherto be man at same time made resolution trust may assist in commencing manhood from date chapter lx conclusion be early in june that lily went up to uncle at great house pleading for hopkins pleading that to hopkins might be restored privilege of head gardener at great house there be absurdity in seeing that have never really relinquished privilege manner of quarrel have be in wise there be in day have be for year vexed question between hopkins jolliffe bailiff on matter of stable manure hopkins have pretended to right of taking what required from farmyard without asking leave of one jolliffe in return have hinted that if be so hopkins must take ca eat have said jolliffe merely grunted signifying by grunt a hopkins thought that though gardener must eat mountain of manure fifty foot long fifteen high must eat in body might convert into thing edible for own personal use so there have be great feud unfortunate squire have of course be called on to arbitrate having postponed decision by contrivance possible to have at last be driven by jolliffe to declare that hopkins must take nothing be not assigned to hopkins when decision be made known to by master bit old lip turned round upon old heel speechless will find be so at other place said squire apologetically other place sneered hopkins where must find other gardener like be hardly necessary to declare that from moment resolved that must abide by such order jolliffe on next morning informed squire that order have be broken squire fretted fumed wishing that jolliffe be well buried under mountain in question if be to do a like said jolliffe then nobody wo care for nobody squire understood that order if given must be obeyed therefore with many inner groanings of spirit resolved that war must be waged against hopkins on following morning found old man wheeling huge barrow of manure round from yard into kitchen garden now on ordinary occasion hopkins be not required to do with own hand work of description have man under who hewed wood carried water wheeled barrow one man always often two squire knew when saw that be sinning bade stop upon road hopkins said why did ask for what wanted before took old man put down barrow on ground looked up in master face spat into hand then again resumed barrow hopkins wo do said squire stop where be what wo do said hopkins still holding barrow from ground not a yet progressing put down hopkins hopkins did put down know that be flatly disobeying order squire have be here about place going on nigh seventy year if have be going on hundred seventy must do that there must be more than one master be master here intend to be so to end take manure back into yard back into yard said hopkins very slowly yes back into yard what afore face yes have disobeyed before face hopkins paused moment looking away from squire shaking head a though have need of deep thought by aid of deep thought have come at last to right conclusion then resumed barrow putting almost into trot carried away prize into kitchen garden at pace went must have be beyond squire power to stop must mr dale have wished to come to personal encounter with servant called after man in dire wrath that if be not obeyed disobedient servant must rue consequence for ever hopkins equal to occasion shook head a trotted on deposited load at foot of cucumber frame then at once returning to master tendered to key of greenhouse master said hopkins speaking a best must with scanty breath there be there be key of course want warning doe care about week wage will be out of cottage afore night a for work'us suppose will let in at once if honour will give line now a hopkins be well known by squire to be owner of three four hundred pound hint about workhouse must be allowed to have be melodramatic be fool said squire almost gnashing teeth know have be fool said hopkins about 'ere doong feeling have be too much for when man feeling have be too much for 'd better just take hisself off lie in work'us till dy then again tendered key squire did not take key so hopkins went on s'pose 'd better just see to light like of till have suited mr dale 'ud be pity grape must go off a may say one a fit for table be long way best crop ever see on have be that careful with have have natural night rest not since february there ai nobody about place a understands grape yet anywhere nigh must be got at lord head man be wery ignorant even if knew ever so of course must come here suppose 'd better keep key till be suited mr dale then for fortnight there be interregnum in garden terrible in annals of allington hopkins lived in cottage indeed looked most sedulously after grape in looking after grape too took greenhouse under care must have nothing to do with outer garden took wage returning amount sent to back to squire insisted with everybody that have be dismissed went about with terrible horticultural implement always in hand with be said that intended to attack jolliffe jolliffe prudently kept out of way a soon a have be resolved by mr dale lily that flitting from small house at allington be not to be accomplished lily communicated fact to hopkins miss said when said few word to mamma knew that must listen to reason be more than lily have expected that hopkins must claim honour of having prevailed by argument be matter of course yes said lily have made up mind to stay uncle wish wish law miss ai only wish wish why now look at reason of thing here be here house hopkins be decided be going to stay what want to know be can come at once help to unpack what very evening a be yes now want to have thing about again before come back from guestwick hopkins scratched head hesitated not wishing to yield to proposition must be considered a childish gave way at last feeling that work be good work mr dale also assented laughing at lily for folly a did so in way thing be unpacked very quickly alliance between lily hopkins became for time very close work of unpacking resettling be not yet over when battle of manure broke out therefore be that hopkins when feeling have become altogether too much for about doong came at last to lily laying down at foot weight glory of sixty odd year of life implored to make matter straight for be be killing miss so have to see way have be cutting that beparagus ai cutting at be just hocking up what be fit what be together have be putting plant in where did mean though know 'd did mean have stood by miss said never word 'd died sooner miss lily what suffering have be 'cause of feeling getting better of about that know miss nobody will ever tell

prowling about place doing nothing sends back wage look a though be going to murder one because must do a be told how be to forgive such man a uncle why not must be forgiving know very well that may come back whenever plea indeed for matter of have never gone away be so very unhappy what can do to make happier just go down to cottage tell that forgive then will argue with think will be too much

feeling know that mine be very much thought of be not altogether in happy mood lily almost regretted that have persevered did succeed in carrying off across garden to cottage a went together promised that must think of always always scene with hopkins can not be described now a must take too many of few remaining page resulted be afraid must confess in nothing more triumphant to squire than treaty of mutual forgiveness hopkins acknowledged with much self reproach that feeling have be too many for then look at provocation must not keep tongue from matter certainly said a much in own defence a did in confession of sin substantial triumph be altogether for nobody again ever dared to interfere with operation in farmyard showed submission to master mainly by consenting to receive wage for two week have passed in idleness owing to little accident lily be not so much oppressed by hopkins a have expected to be in matter of altered plan salvation did not extend to mr hearn to mr crump above to mr boyce of took interest more le strong in hopkins controversy interest in occupation of small house be much stronger be found useless to put mr hearn off with gardener persistent refusal of wage when be big with inquiry whether house be to be painted inside a well a out ah said think will go look at lodging at guestwick pack up of bed lily made answer to feeling that be part of punishment
