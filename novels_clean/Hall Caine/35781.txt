strongly into shed dan stepped out ewan followed walked in silence through gully led from creek to cliff head snow have begun to fall be swirled about in wind came from over sea spinning in air sometimes beat against face went along like man condemned to death have begun to doubt though did not know must have shut mind to idea if have occurred to once when dan seemed to stop a if only half resolved partly turn face toward ewan mistook intention be going to tell that there be hideous error thought be burning for word dan went plodding on again never after shifted steadfast gaze never spoke gave sign at length stopped ewan stopped with be standing on summit of orris head be sad lonesome desolate place in sight of wide waste of common land without house with never tree rising above purple gorse tussock of long grass sky hung very low over steep red cliff with patch of green in ledge swept down from to shingle sharp shelf of slate covered with ground swell came up from below with very mournful noise air seemed to be empty beat of foot on soft turf sounded near large above head sea fowl kept up wild clamor far out where sea sky seemed to meet in gathering darkness sea steady blow on bare rock of naze sent up deep hoarse boom dan unbuckled belt threw off coat vest ewan did same stood there face to face in thin flake of snow dan in red shirt ewan in white shirt open at neck two men whose soul have be knit together a soul of jonathan be knit to soul of david ready to lift hand against heart best brother then at once startled cry came from near at hand be davy fayle voice lad have not gone to shamble realizing in vague way that errand be subterfuge mischief be about have hidden at little distance have seen when dan ewan came out of tent together creeping through ling partly hidden by dusk have followed men until have stopped on head then davy have dropped to knee idea be obscure scarcely knew what be going on before eye held breath watched listened at length when men threw off clothes truth dawned on davy though tried to smother exclamation cry of terror burst from husky throat dan ewan exchanged glance seemed in one moment to read other thought in instant at three quick stride dan have taken davy by shoulder promise said that will never tell what have seen davy struggled to free frantic effort be useless in dan grip be held a in vice let go mastha dan lad cried promise to hold tongue said dan promise promise let go will let go lad shouted sullenly be quiet said dan wo be quiet be stubborn answer help help help lad screamed lustily hold tongue by g dan

to swear never to tell what have seen to night so help god lad held tightly by breast throat gripping arm held with finger clung like claw took one horrified glance down into darkness struggled no longer face be very pitiful to see can not promise said in voice like cry at answer dan drew davy back from cliff edge loosed hold of be abashed ashamed felt little man by side of half daft fisher lad time ewan have stood aside looking on while dan demanded promise saying nothing now went up to davy said in quiet voice davy if must ever tell one what have seen dan will be lost man life hereafter then let pitch over cliff said davy in smothered cry listen to davy ewan went on be brave lad know what be in head then what for do want to fight davy broke out lad throat be dry husky eye be growing dim ewan paused passion be spent davy poor dense head have found question that must not answer davy if promise will ruin dan yes will be who will ruin remember that will be lost man sister good sister mona will be broken hearted woman then davy broke down utterly big tear filled eye ran down cheek promise sobbed good lad now go davy turned about went away at first running then dragging slowly then running again then again lingering what followed be very pitiful conflict of emotion nature who look down pitilessly on man big little passion clamor so loud never touch her at even nature played part in tragedy when davy fayle be gone dan ewan stood face to face a before dan with back to cliff ewan with face to sea then without word turned aside picked up militia belt snowflake have thickened during last few moment now seemed to cease sky to lighten suddenly in west sky be cloven a though by sweep of sword under black bar of cloud above silvered water line sun came through very red hazy in setting with ragged streamer around ewan be buckling belt about waist when setting sun rose upon at once there came to scripture say let not sun go down on wrath if god hand have appeared in heaven effect on ewan must not have be greater already passion be more than half gone now melted entirely away dan cried voice be sob dan can not fight right wrong can not flung down tear filled eye then dan whose face be afire laughed loud bitterly coward said coward poltroon at word evil passion came back to ewan leapt to foot be enough said belt buckle together dan understood ewan purpose at next breath belt about dan waist be buckled to belt about waist of ewan two men stood strapped together then drew dagger awful struggle followed with breast to breast until flesh touched with thigh entwined reeled swayed right hand of held up for thrust left for guard parry what dan gained in strength ewan made up in rage fight be fierce terrible dan still with back to cliff ewan still with face to sea at one instant dan by great stature have reached over ewan shoulder to thrust from behind at next instant ewan have wrenched lithe body backward have taken blow in lifted arm forthwith spouted blood above wrist in encounter reeled about changing place ewan back be henceforward toward cliff dan fought with face toward sea be hideous savage fight sun have gone down cleft in heaven have closed again once more thin flake of snow be falling world have dropped back to dark mood stormy petrel came up from cliff swirled above men a fought made direful scream over up down to fro embracing closely clutching guarding meantime panting hoarsely drawing hard breath two men fought in deadly hate at last have backed swayed to within three yard of cliff then ewan with gasp of drowning man flung weapon into air dan ripped dagger edge across belt bound together at next breath belt be cut two be divided ewan separated from dan leaning heavily backward be reeling by force of own weight toward cliff then dan stood a one transfixed with uplifted hand deep groan came from throat passion pain be gone from in awful moment world seemed to be blotted out when came to be standing on cliff head alone clock in old church be striking how bell echoed on lonely height one two three four five five o'clock everything else be silent a death day be gone snow began to fall in thick large flake fell heavily on dan hot cheek bare neck heart seemed to stand still very silence be awful terror stupefied what have done asked must not think covered eye with hand strode up down cliff head up down up down then in bewildered state of semi consciousness looked out to sea there far off league away saw black thing looming large against darkening sky recognized that be sail then perceived that be lugger quite mechanically tried to divide mainmast mizzen mainsail yawlsail to note if boat be fetching to leeward beating down channel at once sea sky be blotted out must not stand on leg dropped to knee great bead of perspiration rolled down face neck tried to call ewan ewan must not utter least cry throat be parched tongue swelled filled mouth lip moved word came from then rose to foot world flowed back upon sea fowl cry over head shrillness of wind in snow capped gorse sea hoarse voice swelling upward through air while heavy monotonous blow on beach shook earth beneath if anything else have appeared to dan at moment must have screamed with terror quaking in limb picked up clothes turned back toward shore be so feeble that must scarcely walk through snow now lay thick on short grass when reached mouth of gully did not turn into shed went on over pebble of creek bloodshot eye almost started from socket glanced eagerly from side to side at last saw thing sought now that be under within reach of hand dare hardly look upon at foot of jagged crag that hung heavily over from cliff body of ewan mylrea lay dead cold there be mark of violence upon save gash on wrist of left hand over wound there be clot of blood white face lay deep in breast a if neck have be dislocated there be other outward mark of injury from fall body be outstretched on back with one arm left arm lying half over forehead other right arm with hand open listless finger apart thrown loosely aside dan knelt beside body heart be benumbed like ice tried to pray prayer must come must not weep ewan ewan cried at length voice of agony rolled round corpse like soughing of wind ewan ewan cried again only sea voice broke silence followed then head fell on cold breast arm covered lifeless body cried upon god to have mercy on to lift up hand against cut off presently got on foot scarcely knowing what be doing lifted body in arm with head lying backward on shoulder white face looking up in stony stare to darkening heaven a did so eye be raised to cliff there clearly outlined over black crag against somewhat lighter sky saw figure of man toiled along toward shed be so weak that must scarce keep on leg when reached little place at mouth of creek be more dead than alive put body to lie on bed of straw on have slept dreamed hour before then at once felt low sort of cunning coming over went back to door shut drew long wooden bolt into iron hoop on jamb have hardly done so when heard impatient footstep on shingle outside in instant latch be lifted door pushed heavily then there be knock dan made answer stood very

oak settle drawn up between in one corner of settle bubbling babbling spluttering cooing amid very crater of red baize cushion be be foster child ewan motherless daughter lying on back fighting air with clinched fist while mona picked out hibbin from hollin dissected made arch cross crown rosette then sprinkled flour to resemble snow on red berry green leaf sung old manx ballad in snatch

called who be there there came answer wind moaned about house sea rumbled in distance pulled sash down again then leaving curtain back turned again into room partly to divert mind from mysterious apprehension have seized sat down at little harpsichord stood on farther side of ingle against wall ran at right angle from window at first finger ran nervously over key gained force a went on volume of sound seemed to dissipate fear be nothing thought have be troubled about what ewan said to day be nervous be a played eye looked not at finger board across shoulder toward bare window then suddenly there came to sensation made flesh creep be a if from darkness outside there be eye must not see looking steadily in upon where sat blood rushed to head felt dizzy playing ceased clung by one hand to

where sat by hatch dan pale face be firm resolute dream of smile be on hard drawn lip despair have grown into courage knew fear at sun be down darkness be gathering through day mist dew fog be rising a fishing boat put to under lee of lantern newly lighted be stuck out from end of pier on pole quay be almost deserted only old harbor master be there singing out a by duty bound lusty oath at lumbering never before did old grumbler strident voice sound so musical a now even manifest ill temper be sweet to night for seemed to tell men thus far be not suspected men went way together dan went off alone took straightest course home seven long mile over desolate road tramped in darkness never star came out moon be in last quarter struggling behind rack of cloud lightened sky sometimes did not appear a passed through michael noticed though mind be preoccupied perception obscure that street be more that usually silent that few light burned behind window blind even low porch of three leg when dan came to be deserted hardly sound of voice came from within little pot house only in vague way did impression communicate to dan stunned intelligence a plodded along hardly have passed out of street when realized cause of desolation great glow came from spot in front of a of many lantern torch burning together though in bewilderment have not noticed before light lit air about in midst of light there came went out of darkness figure of great company of people sometimes bright with glare on face sometimes black with deep shadow of torchlight obscure a idea be dan comprehended everything in instant chilled a be to heart core by terror of last night day very bone seemed now to grow cold within be funeral by torchlight maimed rite be by ancient usage long disused here revived only burial of one whose death have be doubtful whose body have washed ashore on same day people be gathered on side of churchyard near to high road between road church dan crept up to opposite side leaped low cobble wall placed under shadow of vestry by chancel be then standing beneath window have leaped out of in effort to escape bishop on christmas eve long ago of boyish freak at oiel verree about open vault three of four mourner be standing little apart from smoking flickering torch cast light on face there be bishop with snowy head bare deeply bowed there by elbow be jarvis kerruish in cloak beaver with arm folded under chin walking to fro from side to side with quick nervous step breaking out into alternate shrill cry harsh command to four men who have descended into vault be little restless figure of deemster behind about be close company of people with light coming going on face deep low murmur a of many whisper together rising out of midst dan shook from head to foot heart seemed to stand still knew on what business mourner be met be there to bury ewan felt impulse to scream then impulse to turn fly must not utter least cry quivering in limb must not stir standing there in silence clung to stone wall with trembling finger body have be lowered to last home short obsequies began service for dead be not read bishop stretched out hand above open vault prayed dan heard word be a if heard voice only beat on dazed closed mind a sea gull blown by wind beat against window on stormy night while bishop prayed in broken accent deep thick boom of sea came up from distant shore between low breathed murmur of people dan dropped to knee breathless trembling tried to pray too prayer must come mind be beaten soul be barren father faltering voice ceased then half stifled moan burst from own lip in silence moan seemed to fall on ear quick ear of deemster be instantly arrested who be that cried twisted about be still once more then people began to sing be strange sight strange sound torch hard furrowed face in flickering light white headed bishop restless deemster voice ringing out in night over open grave from where knelt dan lifted eye by light of torch saw clock in church tower hand still stood at five rose to foot turned away step fell softly on grass of churchyard at one instant thought that there be footstep behind stopped stretched arm half fearfully toward sound there be nothing after have leaped cobble wall be conscious that have stopped again be listening a though to learn if have be observed chapter xxv resurrection indeed now strange accident befell strange enough in mysterious in significance marvelous a one of god own miracle in result be going to give up to deemster at ballamona did not longer take high road through village for shrank from human face almost without consciousness followed fenceless cart track went by old lead mine known a cross vein disused shaft have never be filled up never even enclosed by rail have be for year cause of anxiety nothing remoteness on lone waste of headland have served to modify now dan who knew foot of waste be last man to whom danger from such occasion might have be feared plodding along with absent mind in darkness fell down open shaft shaft be forty five fathom deep yet dan be not so much a hurt at bottom be nearly twenty five fathom of water constant drainage of old working rose almost to surface dropped to great depth according to weather have broken fall on coming to surface one stroke in first instance of dazed consciousness have landed on narrow ledge of rock raked downward from seam what be position when realized seemed to be worse than death be living death be burial in open grave hardly have recovered sens when heard something stirring overhead be footstep thud on ear like first rumble of distant thunder cloud in agony of fear tried to call tongue clave to mouth then there be talking near mouth of shaft came down to like word shouted through black hollow upright pillar use men said one speaker not foot farther after best man alive be man for now will go bail be after will be going next then voice laden with note of pain cried will take uncle billy will take knowin ' nothing ' drove drove come along man alive lave lad to d d blather 'd better let make slant for fac be agen dan shuddered at sound of human voice buried a be twenty five fathom beneath surface voice came to like voice that wind might make on tempestuous night if a reach ear whispered word fled away men have gone who be what have happened dan asked if have not remembered one of voice mind be stunned must not think must hardly be sure that in very truth be conscious of what occurred time passed knew not how long short again heard voice overhead be not voice that have heard before apprehend that have escaped be men nevertheless have have advice from peel that boat put into harbor two hour ago mind old lead shaft sir dan be conscious that footstep approached mouth of shaft what gulf lucky did tumble down there be short laugh a of one who be panting after sharp run at mouth of dan open grave be way took sir over head toward curraghs be not half wise must have taken mountain for know that be in pursuit of depend upon be following up to warn after may have be voice that deemster heard in churchyard be somewhere within arm reach let push on voice ceased footstep died off forty foot of dull dead rock earth have carried sound away in instant stop cried dan in hurry of fear despair made brave fear made fearless there be response be alone once more death be with then in first moment of recovered consciousness knew whose voice be that have heard last thanked god that call have not be answered be voice of jarvis kerruish in agony of despair dan perceived that first company of men have be quilleash fisher fellow what fatality have prevented from cry aloud to only person on earth who must have rescued saved dan realized that crime be known that be now hunted man be then that knew how hopeless be plight must not cry for help must stand still a death in deep tomb to be lifted out of pit by men who be in search of must be a must seem to be dragged from hiding place captured in feeble effort to escape what then of brave atonement who must believe that meant to make must be mockery at veriest poltroon might laugh dan saw now that death encircled on side to remain in pit be death to be lifted out of be death no le surely to escape be hopeless not so soon be hope conquered when be hope of life cry for help must be dragged out of grave must let issue be what must must to lie there die be not human to live be first duty first necessity be price of life le than future death dan looked up at sky be small square patch of leaden gray against impenetrable blackness of prison wall standing on ledge of rock steadying with one hand lifted other cautiously upward to feel side of shaft be of rock be quite precipitous have rugged projecting piece on be possible to lay hold a grasped one of sickening pang of hope shot through wounded worse than despair be gone in instant piece of rock gave way in hand tumbled into water below with hollow splash side of shaft be of crumbling stone be then in blind laboring of despair that asked why must struggle with last of misfortune have befallen be life so dear to not so being dear be willing to lay down be not about to deliver to death must be first punishment of crime what after be there to choose between two form of death nay if must die who be longer worthy of life better to die there none knowing way of death than to die on gallows at thought hair rose from root have never rightly put to until now that if have to die for death of ewan must die death of hanging horror of hanging men have be stronger in dan than in most with grim vision before of shameful damning death came to to tell that better thousand time better be death in living tomb than death awaited outside then thought of father of abasement of good man if so great shame overtook son thereupon at same breath with prayer to god that might die where be horrible blasphemy bolted from lip be in higher hand than own god have saved from at least be not to die on gallows have one prayer now cried in barrenness of hope let never leave place soul be crushed a moth will never lift wing again at agony took turn reflected that if god hand be keeping from just punishment of crime god be holding back from atonement be to wash crime away at thought be struck with great trembling wrestled with must not be overcome have not parted with mona with firm purpose of giving up to law yet at hour since parting impediment have arisen first there be men in shed at creek resolve to bury body own weak acquiescence then came dead calm out at sea when stood at tiller long weary drifting on wide water now there be last strange accident be a if higher will have willed that must die before atonement must be made spirit sank yet lower be for giving up a lost in anguish of despair thought that in very deed must be that have committed unpardonable sin terrible idea clung to like leech at vein then came to to think what mockery dream of atonement have be what atonement must bad man make for spilling blood of good one must send own wasted life after life well spent must righteous god take that for just balance mockery of mockery let die where now be let memory be blotted out sin be remembered more tried to compose pressed one hand hard at breast to quiet laboring of heart began to reckon moment in have object none save only that mysterious longing of dying man to know how hour drag on with one hand be free took out watch intending to listen for beat of second watch have stopped no doubt be full of water heart beat loud enough then went on to count one two three mind be in whirl lost reckoning found that have stopped counting forgotten number whether five minute fifty have passed must not be sure time be passing wind began to rise at first dan felt nothing of a stood in deep tomb must hear thin hiss over mouth of shaft be presently hiss deepened to sough dan have often heard of wind sob be reality metaphor a listened to wind now wind began to descend with great swoop came down shaft licked wall gathered voice from echoing water at bottom struggled for escape roared like caged lion be once more sucked up to surface with noise like breaking of huge wave over reef tumult of wind in shaft be hard to bear when be gone be silence seemed to be deafening then rain began to fall dan knew by quick monotonous patter overhead rain touched be driven aslant by wind fell only against uppermost part of wall of shaft sometimes soft thin shower fell over be like spray from cataract except that volume of water from came be above not beneath be then in deadly sickness of fear that there came to dan dread of miscarrying forever if must die now seemed to see what be to die unredeemed not to be forgiven to be forever accursed to be cut off from living live in god peace dead darkness of doom stood up before life have looked very dear to before what now of everlasting death be a one who be dead before death came live must not die dared not past life rose up in front of drank of memory very dreg be so fearsome strange that a recalled lost hour one by one be a if be stranger to saw like esau who for morsel of meat have sold birthright must thereafter find acceptance though sought with tear scripture leaped to mind say be fearful thing to fall into hand of living god then from past to future mind went on in rapid ceaseless whirl saw fleeing a from face of dreadful judge tossed with terror of dreadful doom saw place in world cold empty forsaken saw old father too saintly bishop living under burden of thousand sorrow while who be life of good man life longer be restless wandering soul coming a cold blast of wind between heaven thought be worst terror of dan heard cry burst from throat that roused echo of horror in dark pit then a if instinct acted without help from mind dan began to contemplate measure for escape unexpected softness of rock have at first appalled began now to give painful glimmering of hope if side of shaft have be of slate rock of island ledge have laid hold of must not have crumbled in hand that be soft showed that there must be vein of sandstone running across shaft dan bewildered mind recalled fact that orris head be rift of red sand soft sandstone if vein be deep enough safety be assured must cut niche into with knife so perhaps after infinite pain labor reach surface steadying with one hand dan felt in pocket for knife be not there now indeed death seemed certain be icy cold feverishly hot at interval clothes be water still dripped from fell into hidden tarn beneath in hollow drop not to hope now must have be not to fear dan remembered that have pair of small scissors have used three day ago in scratching name on silver buckle of militia belt when searching for knife have felt in pocket spurned for resembling knife to touch of nervous finger now be to be sole instrument found again with paltry help set to work of escape from dark deep tunnel stood upright night be wearing on hour after hour went by wind dropped rain ceased to patter overhead dan toiled on step over step resting sometimes on largest firmest of projecting ledge looked up at sky leaden gray have changed to dark blue studded with star moon arose very late being in last quarter much beset by rain cloud shone little way down shaft lighting rest dan knew must be early morning one star large full globe of light twinkled directly above sat long watched turned again again in toilsome journey to look at at one moment crept into heart that star be symbol of hope to then twisted back to work when looked again star be gone have moved beyond ken have passed out of range of narrow spot of heaven somehow have be mute companion dan spirit sank in cheerless solitude toiled on strength be far spent moon died off star went out one after one then deep cloud of darkness overspread little sky above dan knew must be darkness precedes dawn have reached ledge of rock be wider than of ledge be beneath clearly enough wooden rafter have lain along dan rested looked up at moment heard light patter of little foot overhead be stray sheep lamb of last year flock wandering lost though must not see knew be there bleated down shaft melancholy cry of lost creature in dismal place touched seared place on dan heart made tear have not shed until now to start from eye what old memory did awaken must not recall at first then remembered beautiful story have heard many time of lost lamb came to church porch at christening of ewan be strange that there then thought turned to ewan child babe be innocent of great sorrow to come began to wish little child again walking by father hand with year rolled back transgression of year blotted out a cloud with new spirit sweet fresh where now be spirit seared old one great aching wound in moment outcast lamb went off sending up a went pitiful cry into night dan be alone once more that visitation have sweetly refreshed spirit then came back to to think that of surety be not one whether died where be never coming alive from open tomb died for crime before face of men must live must live though not for life sake to rob death of worst terror a for impediment have arisen to prevent atonement on mind be set be not from god to lay soul outside reach of mercy from devil to beset keep back from washing away of sin thought revived turned to task with new resolve finger be chilled to bone clothes clung like damp cerement to body meagre blade of scissors be worn short must not last long rose to foot on ledge of rock plunged scissors into blank wall above at fresh disaster seemed to overwhelm hand went into soft earth vein of rock have finished above must be loose uncertain mold gasped at discovery minute since life have looked very dear must abandon hope after might have be longer vexed with new fear that recalled at moment word spoken by jarvis kerruish a went by on road ran near mouth of shaft be not clear that quilleash fisher fellow be being pursued a associate without evidence to clear must not surely suffer innocent though might be even though lay dead in place now indeed

making unearthly laugh must not think save of hooting owl screaming diver when thought of though note be doleful seemed to tell of suffering perhaps of demoniac delight must not thank god have be made man thus feeling how sore thing be to be creature living under wrath of god tossed on bunk until fell to sleep so ended second day of unblessed condition to follow closely befell on next day many day thereafter whereof kept reckoning be to weary spirit one thing know that sudden numbness of spiritual life within left worse man than have be before day of cutting off that did soon lose little have of human love tenderness gun have be put in boat with ranged cliff moor from mull hill that lie to west of cregneesh to chasm be to east of many puffin shot that much frequent shore flesh be rank salt be scarcely worth powder spent on thus sometimes happened that being in strait for food cast bird away did not put to pain of lifting up after fell to gun went on nevertheless to destroy in wanton humor rabbit snared by trick learned when boy sometimes cooked in stove ate like christian man at other time sat down on hillside rived asunder a wild creature of hill might do whether ate in boat on cliff took religion to table thought only that liked food misliked many time in first day have to tear away from thinking of condition for to do so be like stab of knife to brain plainly saw that in way madness must lie if told that other men have be cast alone ere now in desolate place where foot of man be sound of human voice great stroke must come upon spirit with thought that only body have be cast away that soul be so marooned seaman on uninhabited island when at length set eye on fellow man might lift up heart to god to company of men be not blessed free be to go where men be even to town wherein herded together go where must must yet be alone with thought doubting not that for day of grace be past gone since god have turned face from atonement have erewhile be minded to make grew day by day more bitter in heart found easiest to shut mind by living actively from hour to hour then like half starved hound went abroad at daybreak scoured hill day long returned to bed at night knew be baser thing than have be brought comfort then to know be alone eye saw a now be mine be rank hold of life gave savage delight unknown before to live by preying on other creature shot slew daily hourly if for moment told that what have killed held life on same tenure did humanity be not touched except to feel strange wild thrill that be not that lay dead looking back over seven year come to a unnatural thing that mood can ever have be mine mine be from like of may god in mercy keep christian men one day think must have be somewhere toward end of first month of outcast state be ranging cliff side above gray rock of black head when chanced on hare shot on coming up with found be lean bony so turned aside left a squeaked bounced from foot be in morning toward returned by same way saw hare lying by brookside ragged bleeding still alive at sight of wee thing tried to move away weakness clot of blood kept down feeling extremity lifted two slender paw in air while glistening eye streamed visibly set up piteous cry like cry of little child can not write what then did for wound sore to think of when be done that piteous cry be more in mine ear suddenly said with awful word be no longer man beast of field god of mercy of tenderness have cast forever out of hollow of hand chapter xxxviii of way of life meeting with poor hare though now look so trivial thing did then make great seizure upon mind so that changed course habit of life for ceasing not to believe be wholly given over to reprobate soul yet laid gun aside locked shot powder in drawer beneath bunk set face toward new way of living first put to counting possessed thus found that of rye indian meal have peck of barley peck with two quarter of fine barley flour of oat peck with two quarter of oaten meal of potato two kischen besides onion little common salt in hold under hatch there be stored sundry useful implement spade fork hedge knife hempen rope twine with rest be four herring net belonged to boat mackerel net deep sea line other thing there be that name wanting memory of at time of writing enough in for most us that lone man might have have ofttimes set wondering why if have be meant must be cast utterly away have be provided with mean of life who must well have found for after meeting with hare perceived end of god in namely must not without guilt descend from state of christian man when hunger have to be satisfied herein also found way of stern judge with guilty man that having enough for present necessity have little for future beyond year that then be that if must eat so must work thus upon day somewhere a reckon about month after cutting off rose early set to delve piece of fallow ground where be fallow two rood more in extent lying little to north of black head to south of circle of stone stand near by day wrought fasting when darkness fell in fallow be turned next morning put down seed of potato half kischen cut in quarter where eye be many also of barley oat peck keeping back other half peck lest ground be barren weather against year too far worn for such like crop day of delving first on wrought a man be also first on felt man craving for company of other men sun be strong fore part of day hot ray scorched skin of back for have stripped to waist for labor set thinking what month be wondering what be doing in world how long have be where then be when returned to boat at air a remember be quiet over sound a might be in cloister only gull be jabbering on kitterland cormorant at water edge sat on deck while sun went down in sea red sky darkened star began to show moon to look out then went below ate barley bread thought of what be to be alone be that night bethought of watch have not once looked for since day of immersion in cross vein on orrisdale when found stopped from being full of water in fob have lain with seal chain since then now took out cleaned with oil from fat of hare wound up for month thereafter set great store by always carrying in fob when went abroad when came home to boat always hanging on nail to larboard of stovepipe in cabin in long silence of night when heard sure thought be same to a good company very careful be to wind when sun set if perchance ran down awoke in bunk listening heard not then be a if pulse have stopped of little world lived in there be nothing great emptiness withal loneliness increased rather than diminished though have longer hankering after old way of life in ranging moorland with gun yet felt that activity of existence have led off from thinking too much of forlorn condition wherefore when potato have begun to show above ground have earthed up began to bethink touching boat that must be now time of herring fishing come again must go out of night see what must take so never doubting that single handed must navigate lugger hoisted net out of hold athwart bunk board took ashore to mend to bask on beach have spread out on shingle be using knife twine on hole of dogfish when suddenly from behind there came loud bark of dog well remember how trembled at sound of for be nearest to man voice have heard many lonesome day how fearfully turned head over shoulder a if man have touched spoken what saw be poor mongrel dog small a cur with ragged ear peaky nose scant tail for loud challenge dangled wofully between leg until then have never smiled wept since cutting off believed to have lost sense of laughter of tear must have laughed at sight of dog so much did call to mind certain brave vaunter have known who must come up to bout of wrestling with right lusty brag straightway set to trembling before one have well put eye on at sound of voice dog wagged tail crept up timidly with muzzle down licked hand held out to day sat by watched at work looking up in face at while with wistful gaze gave morsel of oaten cake ate greedily seeming to be half starved of hunger when at dusk task be finished rose got into dingey thinking now must go way be seen of more leaped into boat after when reached lugger settled in corner under locker a if have now fully considered that with must make habitation henceforth having thing in readiness for fishing slipped anchor upon evening toward autumn a reckoned for leaf of trammon be then closing like withered hand berry of hollin be reddening when star be out moon be yet showing put about head to wind found in nowise hampered because short handed for when have to take in sail lashed tiller being man of more than common strength of arm cost nothing to step mainmast that night many night thereafter have good taking of fish in labor of looking after cork making fast seizing void in mind be in somewise filled with other matter than thought of abject state one thing troubled at first namely that took more fish by many mesh than must ever consume to make end of fishing be thing must not bring to for counted certain that so to do must be to sink back to former way of living wherefore thought safest to seek for mode of disposing of fish such a must keep at present employment do harm to feeling a man for with have now to reckon watchfully being in constant danger a thought of losing sense of manhood so soused hundred of herring with rought salt distilled from salt water by boiling in pan with pebble remainder concluded to give to such a must consume how to do being what be cost many bitter thought wherein seemed to be most unblessed of men at length hit on device straightway brought to bear leaving fishing ground while night be not yet far spent ran into sound before dawn for soon learned narrow water until grew familiar a palm of hand then before sun rose above stack of scarlet while eastern sky be only dabbled with pink with basket of herring on shoulder crossed moor to cregneesh where people be poor not proud creeping in between cabin laid fish down in open place be before little chapel then went way quickly lest door must suddenly open window be lifted face look forth thrice did before marked that there be who be curious to know whence fish came then be put on nettle to go into village yet to keep from being seen for well knew that if eye beheld that knew who be there must thenceforward be end of eating of herring even among poorest end of fishing also many time went into cregneesh without being seen of man now know not whether to laugh to weep when look back on day write of see like human fox stealing in by gray of dawn among sleeping home of men chapter xxxix of ghostly hand upon that autumn followed herring choosing ground mainly by guess sometimes seeing blue light of herring fleet rise close under quarter at other time when air be still hearing voice of men sound of laughter rumored over quiet water ever fanciful to a dream of friend dead when be past be that sound on sea a often a heard took in net hauled sail stood out for sound putting light on mitch board must ofttimes pas fleet within cable length yet not be known once again knew by hush of voice dying away of laughter on boat about that dark craft be seen scudding like black bird of evil omen through night in cabin be used to burn tallow dip made of fat of bird have shot rush from soft place of moor while boat drifted under mizzen between take take of herring must go below sit with dog grew sleek with fare found in day recovered in measure sense of sight hearing for sea breath of brine be good to man millish veg veen called though man of small cheer smiled to think what sorry misname name must seem in harder english tongue for poor mongrel cur have little sorry vice such a did oft set wondering what chance of life have be whether like new messmate have not somewhere be driven out nevertheless have good part too be creature of infinite spirit think be company to other if have found cheerier mate fellow doubt not must have have cheerful hour together in truth though fishing did much to tear away from burden of yet left many lonesome hour wherein anguish be sore deep looking to year might be before put to bitter question whether being man outside god grace must hold out on so toilsome course also when fell to sleep in daytime after work of night be done be much wrought upon by troublous dream sometimes brought back very breath odor of boyish day with dear soul filled with joy sometimes plagued with awful question in vain tried to answer knowing that soul welfare lay therein being much followed by thought that spirit of beast of field lay in wait to fall on spirit of man within be also put to great terror in watchfulness vision came to in hour of idleness sleep suddenly sentence fell on mind thou art free to go whithersoever thou wilt though be uttermost reach of earth go then where men be so hold thy soul a man long did sentence trouble not being able to make judgment upon at length fastened on that must follow that dread have felt hitherto of face of man be more than think so thereupon concluded must go into castletown at high fair on next market day must know from other day by cart must descry from top of mull going way of rushen church kentraugh resolve never brought to bear for same day whereon made great stroke fell upon spirit robbed of little wherewith have tried to comfort going out of sound night by spanish head for season be far worn herring lay to eastward of island marked in dusk that smack bore peel brand on canvas be rounding chicken rock of calf so stood out well to sea did not turn head to wind cast net until be full two league from shore then be black dark for night be heavy mist lay between sea sky soon thereafter saw blue light to starboard bow guessed that smack from peel have borne down in wake how long lay on ground know not for taking be good noted not passage of time at short while looked toward blue light marked that a boat drifted so did smack drift that be yet within hail moon came out with white streamer from behind rack of cloud knowing then that fishing be over for night for herring doe not run gill into mischief when have light to see by straightway fell to hauling net then be that found smell of smoke in nostril heard loud voice from peeltown smack lifting eye must at first see nothing for though moon light be in sky mist be still on sea through there seemed to roll slowly for wind be low tunnel of smoke like fog well knew that something be amiss soon mist lifted like dark veil into air smoke veered flash of red flame rose from smack of peel men then saw that boat be afire in two minute more silence of sea be lost in fire loud hiss men yet louder shout be a if serpent in bowel of boat struggled to make way out long tongue of fire shot out of scuttle hold combing flue of stove little thought have then of thing though now by eye of memory see also sinuous trail of red water seemed to crawl over dark sea from boat afire to boat sailed in have stepped mast hoisted sail before yet knew what impulse possessed with hand on tiller to go to relief of men in peril on sudden be seized with mighty fear be a though ghostly hand laid on from behind voice above tumult of moment seemed to cry in ear not for not for then in great terror turned boat head away from burning smack a did so ghostly hand did relax voice did cease to peal in mine ear will drop into dingey said with yes said a sweat started cold from forehead will drop into dingey be saved turning head saw by flame of fire over bulwark at stern two men be tumbling down into small boat that hauled behind sped away in agony for now knew how deep be wrath upon that be not for so much a to stretch accursed hand to perishing men to save scarce have gone cable length when great shout mingled with oath made turn head thinking crew of boat be cry curse down on not knowing for deserting in peril be then in tunnel of smoke wherein might not be seen lo saw that dingey with two men be sheering off that other two of mate be left on burning boat haul wind run waistrels down d shouted one of two men on smack amid leaping flame mainsail shot up filled man stood to tiller with oath shouted to two in small boat that for treachery must go down to hell straightway in glare of fierce light turmoil of moment eye grew dim a have be on day of cutting off squeezed lid together to relieve of water then saw how fearful thing be going on within cable length two men of crew of four in burning smack have got into small boat cleared off without thought of comrade who be struggling to save craft now two abandoned men doomed to near death in fire water be with last power of life in life last moment for aught must tell thirsting for deadly vengeance on smack went with canvas bellied flame shooting through hissing over just a came by small boat men therein pulled to windward shot past ere be done while smack bow be dead on for dingey too have sheered round be beating up after burning boat when men thereon saw come out of smoke ceased to curse false comrade made great cry of thanks to god at distance of six fathom laid to thinking men must plunge into sea come to apprehending thought one shouted to come closer for must not swim closer to burning smack must not go from fear of firing own boat dared not to risk fate wherein might have be swallowed up together for despair fortifies men did make of coward stood in constant terror of coming of death so stripped of jacket leaped into water swam to boat climbed open combing a best must through flame heat on deck two men stood enveloped in swirling cloud of smoke saw where be pulling one into water after other followed reached boat in safety then a rubbed face for fire have burned one cheek men fell to thanking in shamefaced way a in manner of kind fearing to show feeling when on sudden stopped short for have lifted eye in flame of boat have seen at same moment have looked upon known be illiam quilleash edward teare fell back from made for bow stood there in silence together taking tiller bore in by tack for port le mary there landed men who looked not way ever spoke word made sign to went off with head down when stood out again through poolvash to round spanish head make for mooring in sound saw burning smack swallowed up by sea with groan came over still water small boat passed going into harbor men who rowed be crennell corkell when saw knew made broad sweep out of course now time ghostly hand have be on shoulder strange voice have pealed in mine ear though wanted not to speak with man that man must speak with yet will not say that went to heart must be like a leper from whose uncleanness men must shrink away for many day hereafter lay with great trouble upon so let go strong intent of walking into castletown at high fair put question with whether be written must carry through world down to death right ending not a before did now so deeply abhor felt for secret compassion in truth have bitterness left in heart for fellow men tossed with fear that if lived alone much longer must surely lose reason hence manhood sinking down to brute consideration fell with weight upon what thou hast suffered be from men who know thy crime stand in terror of curse upon thee wherein thou art so blotted out of book of living that without sin none may look thy way go therefore where man know thee so heavy burden thou bearest will straightway fall from thee now at thought heart be full of comfort went back to former design of leaving place forever before have well begun what be minded to do strange accident befell relation thereof be a followeth by half flood of evening late in autumn for though watch showed short of six sun be already down left old mooring inside rock of kitterland thinking to slip anchor there no more breeze be fresh in sound outside be stiff from nor'east so ran out with fair wind for ireland for have considered with to country must go because people there be tender of heart not favored by god for short while have enough to think of in managing cordage when be well away to sou'west of calf suddenly wind slackened then for hour full stood by tiller with little to do looked back over green water to purple mountain vanishing in dusk around to western sky where over line of sea crimson streamer be still trailing where sun have be like a radiance of goodly life remains while after man have gone with eye see double thing be without that be within saw then in little craft on lonely sea like uncompanionable bird in wide sky heart began to fail for first time since cutting off must have wept for thought be leaving forever fair island of home with have made dear in dearer day though have turned back on since knew more have blotted out name from remembrance yet be mine only spot of earth on planet go whither must that must call own how long mood lasted hardly can say over boat two gull hovered circled cried looked up at white transparent wing for lack of better employment until light be gone day have swooned to night wind came up with darkness more in heart than before stood out for south of ireland reached old fishing port of kinsale by dawn of next day then in gentle sun of autumn morning walked up from harbor to market place there found strange company assembled about inn in midst be six seven poor ship broken men shoeless half naked lean of cheek from long peril privation eats flesh make eye hollow in middle of night have come ashore on raft having lost ship by foundering twelve day before learned from gossip of people about also that have eaten supper at inn slept there while stood looked on there came out in midst of group two other men one of be captain other innkeeper noted well that master of inn be suave to tattered customer spoke of breakfast a being made ready first go to mayor said addressing captain make protest will lend money want captain nothing set out with cheerful countenance for mayor of town servant of inn going with to guide ship broken crew stayed behind who be curious to learn if necessity must be relieved remained standing in crowd around while waited men sat on bench in front of inn there came down on from side harpy find sea going men with clothes there be one with coat one with guernsey one with boot of leather one of neat skin with thing made man to fit if one asked price protested that have got money samaritan laughed bade not to think of price money until captain must return from treasury of mayor seaman took with good cheer man picked out what wanted put on throwing rag aside laughing presently master of crew returned face be heavy when men asked how have fared if mayor have advanced anything told that mayor have said be usurer to lend money at that there be groan oath from crew look of bewilderment among who have fetched clothes innkeeper said must be well that have to send for merchant in next street who made trade to advance money to ship broken men news brought back light to dark face of captain sent servant of inn to fetch merchant when man came mind misgave for saw stamp of uncharity in face captain told story whereof sum be that be english crew of brig betsy be seven day out from bristol bound for buenos ayres when foundered on rock have made way thither on raft suffering much from hunger cold of night that wanted three pound advance on owner to carry to dublin whence must sail for own port merchant curled hard lip said have just before be deceived by stranger must not lend money except to men of whom knew something that be stranger moreover by own word entitled to more than six day pay apiece so went way hardly have gone when harpy of coat boot guernsey called on men to strip off good garment straightway rolled in several bundle then elbowed out of crowd poor seaman resuming rag be now in sad case scarce knowing whether most to curse misfortune to laugh at grim turn that be taking when captain in chafe called on innkeeper to give breakfast to men for that meant to push on to next town where people might be found who have more humanity innkeeper losing by respect shook head asked where be pay to come from for what have already done now when heard saw men rise up to go on toilsome way with naked bleeding foot suddenly bethought that though have little money have what must bring money before have taken time to consider have whipped watch from fob to thrust into captain hand when must have parted crowd to do so on sudden same ghostly hand have before mentioned seemed to seize from behind then on instant faced about to hasten away for now struggle within be more than must bear stopped went on stopped again again went on time watch be in palm ghostly hand on shoulder at last thinking sure that memory of seven sea going men hungry ill clad must follow rise up to torment on land sea wheeled around ran back hot foot did a be minded then walked rapidly away from market place passing down to harbor saw peeltown fisherman knew that saw also now must have be exceeding glad if thing have never befallen for though made feeling le ungentle toward two men old shipmate who have turned from a from leper when took from burning boat yet brought to sense be full of terror to oppressed spirit namely that though might fly to land where men knew nothing of great crime yet that curse thereof be mostly within mine own afflicted soul from must never flee away day stayed in boat sun shone sky be blue heart be filled with darkness when night fell in have found no comfort for then knew that from outcast state there be escape being so whether to go back to mine own island be now question oh be goodly thing to lie down in peace of mind at ease rise up from refreshment of gentle sleep not for be that blessed condition quaking of spirit be more than must well stand under without losing reason in fear of mischance lay pain of life to long be dark hour when soft daylight came again did resolve go back to own island must for what be to though world be wide if little place lived in be own narrow soul night in boat for lack of tick of watch there seemed to be void in air of cabin when tide be about bottom of ebb heard plash of oar alongside presently sound of something fell overhead next morning found watch lying on deck by side of hatch at top of flood lifted anchor dropped down harbor having spoken word to man since sailed into chapter xl of great loneliness back at old mooring inside rock of kitterland knew full well that almighty majesty be on side of on have nothing to look for now hereafter think extremity of condition gave false courage good genius seemed to say what have to lament have health food freedom live under taskmaster eye let morning see rise in content let night look on lying down in thankfulness turn not face to future to unsettling of spirit so that when time come may not die with pale face then did laugh at old yearning for fellowship asked wherefore must be lonely since lived in same planet with other men have same moon star above sleep a hung over busy world of men in such wise did comfort torn heart shut up from troubling well knew be like to one who cry peace where there be peace that in empty sophistry concerning moon star there be blood of poor human neighborliness nevertheless daily went about business in pursuance whereof walked up to place over black head where have planted corn potato in course reaped delved cutting barley rye with clasp knife for sickle digging burrow in earth for potato little of have enough for frugal need until more might grow when work be done have longer employment to take ashore autumn have sunk to winter for in island of man cold mist come at stride then sitting alone in boat with task save such a must make for companion little veg veen strength of sophistry wherewith have appeased broke down pitifully night be long dark sun shone rarely for many day together few be ship passed mouth of sound to east west of since coming to moorage there boat have crossed water cold bleak sullen lay around boat reflecting more forehead of calf lying now under sunless sky like dead man face be moved neither to smile tear awful weariness of sea came to then such a loneliest land never brought to spirit of christian man for sitting on deck of little swaying craft with beat of sea on timber sea fowl jabbering on kitterland perhaps wild colt racing wind on calf came into mind to think that a far a eye must see ear must hear there be nothing

must shrink back go away again return to house with trembling then a strange comfort for be sort of silent company in desolation more than once in day of great loneliness did verily believe that have sat down in midst of three to spend long hour in thinking of brave good thing might have be for of for headstrong passion helped out by cruel tangle of fate one thing noted that even yet seems strange in hour when imagination be least given to waywardness throughout period wherein lived in boat for time after removed to house three have named seemed to visit together after have found witless neighbor lying dead on moor after have heard converse of men who mistook poor body for own visitation of mona father ceased altogether ewan alone did afterward seem to see pondered long at length fastened on with solemn conviction that what have looked for have come about that error be dead man have reached ear of father of mona with ewan sat alone when came to oft did appear that be loving company for in eye be look of deep pity on part have ceased to rail at blind passion have parted flesh from flesh writing be not for men who will look at such word a have here set down with cold

rising ground behind look down to where in valley lay habitation of men life life life be now constant cry of voice of heart right goodly thing seemed to to be alive though might be said not to live only to exist whether from day whereon converse of two men who went by house be ever seen of man for twelvemonth more scarce can tell great be care to keep out of way even shepherd walked never foot seemed to come within two furlong of abandoned part from bleak black head to margin of sound happened upon day toward winter beginning second year since cutting off turned toward port le mary walking on with absent mind came nearer than have purposed to village over kallow point there be suddenly encountered by four five men who much in liquor be playing at leap frog among gorse english seaman

blasphemy try how must to go on must not stop on instant turn face to then saw that of men took note whatever that eye be on dog millish veg veen who be with be now creeping between foot with stump of tail under belly little cunning face full of terror why here be dog killed monkey said one shouted be old cur sure enough third laughed said have kept rod in pickle for more than year first cried again will teach beast to kill more jackeys then before be yet fully conscious of what be being done one of brawny swaggerer made toward kicked at dog with fierce lunge of heavy seaman boot dog yelped must have made off of blusterer kicked back then third kicked way tried to escape between one of lifted foot kicked again while be doing felt struggling to cry out to to stop not syllable must utter like man paralyzed stood stock still did nothing to save housemate only companion in life at length one of men laughing great roistering laugh stooped seized dog by nape of neck swung round in air then saw poor cur piteous look toward heard bitter cry at next instant be flying ten foot above head when fell to ground be killed on instant at sight heard awful groan burst from mouth saw cloud of fire flash before eye when next knew what be doing be holding one of men by fierce grip about waist be swinging high above shoulder now if good god have not given back consciousness at moment know full well that at next who be then in power must have drawn more breath of living man felt on sudden same ghostly hand upon have written of before heard same ghostly voice in mine ear so dropping man gently to foot a gently a mother might slip babe to cot lifted up poor mangled beast by hinder leg turned away with a went other men fell apart from with look of terror for saw that god have willed that with awful strength must man of great passion go through life in peril when have found coolness to think of have happened mourned for loss of only companion have ever shared with desolate state more than grief for dog be fear for remembering with horror that when must have called on men to desist must not utter one word truly may have be swift access of anger that then tied tongue must not question that sudden speechlessness told be losing faculty of speech conclusion fastened upon with great pain saw that for twelvemonth more have be zealously preserving minor quality of humanity while greatest faculty speech distinguishes man from brute have be silently slipping from preserve power of speech also resolved must though evil spirit within seemed to make mock at to say wherefore anxiety to keep speech seeing that will never require being man cut off forever from intercourse with other men yet held to purpose then asked how be to preserve speech save by much frequent speaking how be to speak having none not even dog now to speak to for to speak constantly with be practise shrank from a leading perchance to madness since have noted that men of broken wit be much given to mumbling vain word to at last concluded that there be one way for be to pray having lighted on thought have still misgiving for evil spirit within again made mock at asking why must speak to god being man outside god grace why must waste in misspent desire of prayer seeing that heavenly majesty have set face from in rejecting atonement of life have offered for crime after great inward striving came back to old form of selfishness be convinced that though when prayed god must not hear yet that yearning uplooking of prayer might be good thing for spiritual part of nature a man for when be beast known to pray at tried to recall few good word such a father used at length after much beating of wing of memory remembered be word of bishop jeremy taylor did betake to prayer in manner o most gracious god tremble to come into thy presence so polluted dishonored a be by foul stain of sin have contracted must come perish be useless to purpose of god man like one be dead unconcerned in change necessity of world living only to spend time like vermin eat of fruit of earth o god can not help now miserable man be to reduce to so sad state that be worthy to come to thee dare stay from thee greatness of crime brings to remedy now humbly pray thee to be merciful to sin for be great prayer spoke aloud twice daily thenceforward at rising setting of sun going out of house kneeling on turf on top of black head when have prayed sang what must remember of psalm run be good for have be in trouble may learn thy statute in mind eye see solitary man in lone place with sea stretching wide below only sound of heavy beat on rock rising over in quiet air chapter xlii of breaking of curse thus far have written four day past amid pain quick lessening of power of life in sleepless hour of night have made writing sitting oftenest by light of feeble candle until day have be blue over sea now that glance back see own heart in mirror have made for be like to one who have be brought through fearsome sickness have left mark upon to look for first time at altered face in glass can be that who have penned word be man of seven year ago ah now see how profound have be change that great punishment have made in perceive end of god in refusing poor atonement of life for life cutting off from among men will not say that what have already written have not cost pang perhaps tear now be come to place where must tell of great turning point in sad state though strength fails hold pen to write of spirit rise before like a lark awakened by dawn year surely darkest within memory of poor people of man began with more than share of winter of heavy rain spring followed be also rainy when looked for summer to begin rain be still incessant heavy sodden be ground even of moor whereon lived so that foot sank into a into morass much of seed sowed be washed from wasted when at long rain ceased to fall year be far worn into june then sun came quick hot house stood on brow descending to cliff of coast beneath be le than two foot of mold above rock when great heat came after great rain out of ground there arose thick miasmic mist filled air obscured light lay heavy in sweat upon hair flesh made wall floor furniture bed of home damp dripping with constant dew quickly set to digging of deep trench went vertically down brow to cliff head soon ground about across many acre be drained dry though lived in clear air must now see sun a well a feel yet perceived that mist stood in wide half circle around like wall of rain seen afar while spot whereon stand be fair in sunshine in daily walk to top of moor must no longer see house of cregneesh for cloud of vapor lay over when walked to kallow head for first time since day lost dog basin below where port le mary stand be even a vast vaporous sea without one islet of house hill health suffered little from unaccustomed humidity for bodily strength be ever wonderful spirit sank to deep depression oft did wonder how poor soul must fare who lived on low wet curraghs near to where own home once lay from day to day week to week mist continued to rise from dank ground under hot sun still earth came up in thick clod to spade night alone be clear toward midsummer be witness to strange sight in heaven thus saw comet pas close across island from coast to coast with visible motion a of quivering flame what visitation must foretell pondered long sadly much hungered for knowledge of what be being done in world of men therein seemed to wayward mind be like man buried in churchyard while be yet alive who hears bell in tower that peal toll have window in tomb from to see who come to rejoice who to mourn when fleet of fishing boat must have put out from port erin for ground that lie south of calf scarce sail must see not boat have noted coming from poolvash where port le mary stand above bay from top of mull hill must faintly descry road to castletown never cart on market day seemed to pas over group of people vaguely saw standing together once at midday from middle of field of new mown hay there came to sound of singing prayer oftener than at period during solitary life saw men on mountain felt presence near for sens be grown very keen oftener also than ever before sound of church bell seemed to come through air going to beach where shattered boat lay one day came upon boat beating idly down water of sound sail flapping in wind hand at tiller stood to watch while little craft came drifting on with flow of tide ran head on to cliff at fistard then went down to found never living soul aboard of from other startling occurrence came to vaguely a if by one sense of buried man felt that with poor people of island be not well nothing did know of certainty until day toward first week of september a have reckoned then strange thing befell sun be not shining when there be sun there be little mist strong wind too have got up from northeast atmosphere over land sea grew clearer a day wore on wind strengthened after turn of ebb at half flood be toward three in afternoon have risen to pitch of gale with heavy swirling rain rain ceased in few hour in lift of heavy cloud must see from rising ground above house brig with shortened sail toiling heavily to southwest of calf be struggling in strong current flow there to get into lee of island be beaten back back never catching shelter of cliff for rush of wind swept over darkness be falling in while watched when be swept back hidden from by forehead of calf turned face homeward then noticed that on top of mull hill great company of people have gathered thought saw that be watching brig be laboring heavily in sea night have close employment at fireside for be finishing coat have someways fashioned with undeft finger from best piece of many garment that of must no longer hold together rough a monk long sack be a shapeless nevertheless fit companion for curranes on foot have made time before from coat of hapless millish veg veen while wrought with great sail maker needle twine loud wind moaned about wall of house whistled through many crevice made candle whereby worked to flicker gutter yet mind be more cheerful than have lately be wont sang to myself with face to glow of fire when toward ten o'clock sea below sent up louder hiss than before followed by deeper undergroan suddenly there be clash at window poor panting sea mew with open beak came through fell helpless on floor picked up storm beaten creature calmed patched with needle skin of window have broken by entrance then at once mind went back to brig laboring in sea behind calf almost at same moment for first time seven year quick knock came to door be startled made answer stood stock still in middle of floor with frightened bird in hand before be yet fully conscious of what be happening wooden latch of door have be lifted man have stepped across threshold in moment have closed door behind be speaking to will never find heart to deny shelter on night a said answered nothing surely with mind did not hear only with mine ear be like one who be awakened suddenly out of long dream can scarce be sure be dream reality what be what be before man stumbled step forward said speaking falteringly be faint from blow staggered pace forward must have fallen recovering in measure self command caught in arm put to sit on settle before hearth scarce have gained rest when eyelid trembled closed became insensible be large swart bony man bearing in face mark of life hard storm dress be plainly dress of priest of order of priesthood quite unknown to proud poverty sat upon man before yet knew wherefor heart went out to in strange uncertain reverence loosening hard collar bound neck made bare throat then moistened lip with water other office did for such a with difficulty removing great boot be full of water stretching foot toward fire stirred peat too glow be full grateful then looked for mark of blow spoke of found where most be to be feared on hinder part of head though there be blood flowing yet be skull driven in upon brain leaving hollow spot over space might have be covered by copper token did not soon return to consciousness toiled hard at interval to regain then lapsed back to breathless quiet not knowing what else to do took basin of water lukewarm bathed wound with damping forehead with water be cold time sea mew have cast from hand when priest stumbled lay in one corner panting head down tail up powerless wing stretched useless on side then man taking long breath opened eye seeing made tender of gratitude told that in being put ashore out of brig bridget from cork in ireland have be struck on head by boom a shifted with wind that heeding not injury thinking must make port le mary to lie there that night have set out over moor while late comrade of brig put off from perilous coast for england whither be bound so much have said speaking painfully when again fell in unconsciousness time strong delirium took hold of tried not to hear what then said for seemed to awful thing that in such hour of reason vanquishment eye of man might look into heart only god be eye must see hear must leave alone in present need talked loudly of great outrage wherein helpless woman be thrown on road without shelter even dead in graf be desecrated when came to again knew that mind have wandered told that four year before have be confessor at convent of port royal in france said that in place have be men woman of order of jansenist teaching simple goodness piety convent have be suppressed by commission of jesuit being banished from france have fled to native country of ireland where now held place of parish priest more in manner said mind be sorely perplexed can not recall word faithfully rightly tell of commerce of conversation between save that put to broken question in moment of ease from pain muttered many time to after have answered briefly when have answered not at for sense be man awakening out of dream long dream of seven lonesome year grew stronger a told of what traffic world have lately seen be witness to old creeping terror of judgment upon that forbade that man must speak with must speak with man struggled hard with necessity now before to make swift choice whether must turn away leave man who have sought shelter of house break through curse bound choice of kind did not make with conscious mind before be yet aware be talking with priest with priest said be catholic priest that good bishop sent for out of ireland a have heard doubt not answered have not heard priest asked did live alone in house how long have be here said yes have be seven year in place come christmas priest asked what do never go up to town answered priest then said priest thinking long before spoke have not heard of great sickness have broken out among people told have heard nothing priest said be sweating sickness that vast number have fallen to many have died think said can not be sure that after fruitless effort of own to combat disease bishop of island have sent to ireland message for having heard that almighty have blessed effort in like terrible scourge broke out two year before over bog of western ireland listened with fear began to comprehend much that have of late be puzzle to before priest have gone far sickness overcame afresh fell in long unconsciousness while lay thus very silent rambling afresh through way of past know not what feeling possessed for heart be in great turmoil when opened eye again very peaceful in quiet light with le than before of power of life in said perceived that errand have be fruitless that have come to house to die at word started to foot with cry thinking that thought be of poor people who must lose deliverer by death told to have patience for god who have smitten down must surely raise up in stead far mightier savior of afflicted countryman then in lapse of pain talked of sickness have befallen own people how be due to long rain soaked soil be followed by hot sun drew out of earth foul sweat how sickness fell chiefly on such a have house on bog low lying ground how cure for be to keep body of sick person closely wrapped in blanket to dry air about with many fire told too that medicine have yet seen given for disease be useless being oftenest of cooling nature be sometimes deadly said that of own people who have lived on mountain have escaped malady much also said of how men have fled from wife woman from child in terror of infection save only in worst case contagion from sweating sickness there must be none more of sort said than can well set down in writing often spoke with sore labor a though strong impulse prompted who listened eagerly heard what said with mighty fear for well knew that if death came to a foretold have now that knowledge must be sin to hide after have said lapse into unconsciousness be more frequent than before interval of cool reason sweet respite from pain be briefer short while after midnight came to with smile on meagre face peace in eye asked must promise to do one thing for for that be dying man told yes before have heard what be that wished of then asked did know where bishop lived at first made answer bishop court call house said lie to northwest of island by land have named curraghs do know bent head by way of assent priest must have to go to said say catholic

passed in feeble delirium just before end came awoke motioned to small bag that hung about waist guessed meaning drawing out crucifix placed in hand then passed silently away death black camel have knelt at gate of lone house seven year of death in life have entered at last to take man than chapter xliii of great resolve when have ceased to breathe air of house became suddenly void empty with great awe upon rose stretched out on settle covered white face with cloth then in silence sat tried to think of strange accident have night befallen one thing saw with fearful certainty that great burden of responsibility have fallen upon thought of people of island perishing in sickness remembered that alone of men here knew how to succor save alone who be one man accursed among men one man cut off forever from company of living man without family kin name among people whose flesh man might touch with flesh whose eye other eye might look upon thus with burden of responsibility came yet

man who have brought cure for have also disappeared be not on curraghs be no longer in michael further east have not traveled none must tell what have become of when seen last be walking south through german toward patrick be then alone save for half daft lad davy fayle who slouched at heel like dog a passed up creg willey people of st john followed in one two three to offer simple thanks pushed along a one who hardly heard when came by tynwald paused turned partly toward greeba a though half minded to alter course hesitating no longer followed straight path toward village at foot of slieu whallin a crossed green people of st john who followed up hill road have grown to great number being joined there by people of tynwald when passed under ancient mount walking with long rapid step chin on breast eye kept steadfastly down gray headed men uncovered head young woman thrust young child under hand for blessing by one impulse shouted in one voice god bless priest heaven save priest there be spectator of scene who be wont to say when sequel have freshened memory that amid wild tumult of gratitude of island poor people who be subject of made one quick glance of pain upward to mount now

curragh to castle at castletown that who have cured people of sickness who have be mistaken for priest out of ireland be none other than unblessed man long thought to be dead that have lived to be savior of people great news be brought to bishop court be found to be there already rumor said that from castletown inquiry have come asking if news be true none must tell what answer bishop court have made bishop have shut up from visit even of clergy with mona child ewan little daughter have passed day since thorkell death not until day of thorkell funeral did break in upon solitude then went down to little churchyard stand over by sea buried ex deemster near to son ewan with scarcely foot space between except jarvis kerruish bishop be thorkell sole mourner hardly have service ended second shovel of earth fallen from old will a thorn spade when jarvis whipped about walked away then bishop stood alone by brother unhonored grave trying to forget malice uncharity senseless superstition have led to many disaster thinking only with pity be nigh to love of great ruin whereunto poor belief have tottered down when bishop have returned home roll call of near kindred showed pitiful gap island grows very lonesome mona said that night davy fayle came to bishop court with book in hand told mona how have found ben chree complete wreck on shingle of dhoon creek in calf sound book in

share of owner master man balance stood too sadly on wrong side there be deficit of forty pound four shilling sixpence bishop glanced at entry passed over with sigh turning leaf came upon other matter of more pathetic interest be long personal narrative from owner pen covering two hundred of page bishop looked through hurriedly nervously with eager eye then gave up book to mona read aloud child said in voice unlike own with brave show of composure settled to listen for two hour thereafter mona read from narrative be written in book what that narrative be doe not need to be told often voice of reader failed sometimes must not support in lapse of voice silence be broken by low sob bishop listened long with great outer calmness for affection of father be struggling with sense of duty of servant of god at point of narrative seemed so to conflict a to tear old heart wofully bore up very bravely tried to think that in what have done seven year before have done well at early stage of mona reading stopped to say men have be cast on desert island beforetime too often have be adrift on unknown sea again stopped to add with slow shake of head men have be outlawed dragged out weary year in exile men have be oftentimes under ban chain of law once again interrupted said in trembling undertone be true have be what looked for have be death in life a mona went on to read of how outcast man kept back from speech with living soul struggled to preserve spiritual part of bishop interrupted once more said in faltering voice existence have be quite alone in desolation a mona went on again to read of how unblessed creature said prayer in solitude not hoping that god must hear thinking man outside god grace though god hand be upon thinking man doomed to everlasting death though blessing of heaven have already fallen over like morning dew then remained of spiritual pride in heart of bishop be borne down by love of father old head fell into breast hot tear rained down wrinkled cheek later same night mona sent for davy fayle lad be easily found have be waiting in darkness outside house struggling hard with desire to go in tell mistress mona where daniel mylrea be to be found davy said do know where be sure said davy must lead to must then come here very early in morning will go together next day when mona attired for journey went down for hasty breakfast found bishop

of insular government while bishop made pretense of wiping with handkerchief horn bridged spectacle on nose mona opened read letter be from governor at castletown said that lord of man isle in recognition of great service done by daniel mylrea to people of island during recent affliction must be anxious to appoint deemster of man in succession to late uncle thorkell mylrea being satisfied that be otherwise qualified for post if steward of ecclesiastical court be willing to remove censure of church under now labored when have finished reading mona cast one glance of nervous supplication upward to bishop face then with quick cry of joy be partly pain flung arm about neck old bishop be quite broken down man judgment on man said be a anger of little child here to day gone to morrow father face be over what need to tell of one of incident of mona journey of brave hope that buoyed up on long toilsome way many time during seven year past have remembered that be who have persuaded dan to offer life a atonement for sin often thought came back to with swiftness of remorse that be who in blindness have sent to doom be worse than death heaven way have not be way be well atonement have be made sin have be wiped out of book of life dan love beloved have worked out redemption have proved great man have always known must be be to come back loaded with honor gratitude surrounded by multitude of friend more than once when journey be heaviest put hand to bosom touched paper nestled so warmly there then in mind eye saw dan in seat of deemster righteous judge of own people oh yes must be deemster must be dan still dan lively cheerful joyous perhaps even frolicsome dan once more must sport with like ailee must play with a used to play long ago with little girl that must remember tickling under armpit under chin in twenty different cozy nest of pretty body where whole brood of birdie sent up chorus of squealing song laughter burden of mona long year of weary sorrow have be so suddenly lifted away that must not restrain thought from childish sportiveness sometimes remembered ewan then heart saddened sometimes thought of herself then flushed full of quick hot blood oh how delicious be secret thing sometimes stole up between vision of dan high destiny be before be vision of herself transfigured by noble love resting upon looking up to thus passing on on on to end once remembered with chill passing through that in writing have read dan have said be ill what of be going to must nurse back to health davy fayle walking at side be full of own big notion too mastha dan must be dempster true 'd have boat for pleasure sarten sure davy fayle must sail man in perhaps mate maybe skipper day who know then lying aft drifting at herring smokin ' star out moon makin ' peep aw well well well reached end of journey at last be in small gorse covered house far over wild moor on edge of chasm looking straight out on hungry sea in one bare room be without fire be cheerless with little light there be table settle chair stool sort of truckle bed dan be there same yet oh how different lay on bed unconscious near to death of sickness last that scourge be to slay of story of great love great suffering what be left to tell there be moment when life seems like blind swirl of bat in dusk blundering irresponsible not to be counted with swift creature of evil chance see little child white face at hospital window strong man toiling hopelessly against wrong innocent suffering with guilty good instinct thwarted base purpose promoted ask with thrill of heart what after be god doing in world from such blind laboring of chance tired beaten generation of men seem to find reward enough to drop one after one to hushed realm of rest will marvel very much if such moment came to pure noble woman a stood in death chamber of beloved with whom after year of longing be at last brought face to face again there be other moment higher better when there be such thing in so bewildering world a victory of vanquishment when true man crushed by evil chance be yet true man undestroyed by destroying when job on dunghill be more to be envied than pharaoh on throne death be a good a life higher moment came to mona in death chamber sat many hour by dan side waiting for breaking of delirium brief space of consciousness of peace must be beginning of end came at long long length ah how soon came night have come gone while sat watched when sunrise shot red through skin covered window fell on dan awakened opening eye saw mona soul smiled over wasted face must not speak must lift worn hand knew that time be near holding back grief like wild creature held by leash dropped to knee clasped hand together to pray while prayed dying man repeated of word after father father art in heaven hallowed be thy name hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth a be in heaven give day daily bread forgive trespass a forgive that trespass against lead not into temptation deliver from evil deliver from evil amen amen
