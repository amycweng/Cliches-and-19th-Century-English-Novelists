humanity one knew not whether to laugh cry at first on ali part blank wonderment that when cried to naomi come did not hear when asked why did not answer when said look did not see though blue eye seemed to gaze full into face then sort of amused bewilderment that little nervous finger be always touching arm hand neck throat long before have come to know naomi be not a be that nature have not given eye to see a saw ear to hear a heard tongue to speak a spoke nature have overstepped barrier divided from found that naomi have come to understand whatever in little way did almost whatever in little way said so played with a must have played with other playmate laughing with calling to going through foolish little boyish antic before nevertheless by mysterious knowledge of nature own teaching seemed to realise that be duty to take care of when spirit mischief in little manly heart must prompt to steal out of house adventure into street with naomi by side must be found in thick of throng perhaps at heel of mule ass with naomi hand locked in hand trying to push great creature of crowd from before cry in brave little treble arrah ar rah ar r rah a for naomi coming of little black ali be wild delight to ali did must do also if ran must run if sat must sit meanwhile must laugh with heart of glee though heard not what said saw not what did knew not what meant at time of harvest when ruth took out into field must ride on ali back snatch at ear of barley leap in seat laugh yet nothing must see of yellow corn nothing must hear of song of reaper nothing must know of cry of ali who shouted to while ran forgetting in playing that heard not at night when ruth put to bed in little chamber ali knelt with face towards jerusalem naomi must kneel beside with reverent air laughter

year went on naomi grew in beauty increased in sweetness angel came down to open darkened window of eye draw aside heavy curtain of ear chapter iv death of ruth for joy prettiness naomi be burden only love must bear to think of girl by day to dream of by night never to sit by without pity of helplessness never to leave without dread of mischance might so easily befall to see for to hear for to speak for truly tyranny of burden be terrible ruth sank under through seven year be eye of child eye ear of ear tongue of tongue after own sight became dim hearing faint be almost a if have spent on naomi in yearning of dove pity soon afterwards bodily strength failed also then knew that time have come that be to lay down burden for ever burden have become dear clung to must not look upon child think that who have spent strength for from first must leave now to other love tending so betook to upper room gave strict order to fatimah habeebah naomi be to be kept from altogether that sight of child helpless happy face might tempt soul more there in death chamber israel sat with constantly settling countenance steadfastly coming going softly be more constant than slave more tender than woman love be great also be eating out big heart with remorse root of trouble be child never talked of did ruth dwell upon name yet thought of little else while sat together even if have be minded to talk of child what have to say of have memory to recall sweet childish saying simple broken speech pretty lisp have nothing to bring back out of harvest of past of dear delicious wealth that lie stored in treasure house of heart of happy parent way everything be waste always a israel entered room ruth must say how be child always israel must answer be well if at moment naomi laughter came up to from patio where played with ali must cover face be silent be melancholy parting one came near moor jew rabbi elder idle woman of mellah must sometimes stand outside in street look up at house knowing that black camel of death be kneeling at gate other company have none in such solitude passed four week when time of end seemed near israel read aloud prayer for dying prayer shema yisrael ruth repeated word of after meantime while ruth lay in upper chamber little naomi sported played in patio with ali missed mother constantly made plain by many silent act of helpless love knew way to speak aloud thus must lay flower on seat where mother have used to sit if at night found untouched where have left little face must fall laughter die off lip if have withered one have cast into oven must laugh again fetch other flower from field until house must be full of odour of meadow scent of hill well knew who looked upon then whom missed what question be that halted on tongue yet how must answer there be way to do until knew how to ask did on day near to end be evening be being put to bed by habeebah have just risen from innocent pantomime of prayer beside ali when israel coming from ruth chamber entered child room then touching with hand seat whereon ruth have used to sit naomi laid down head on pillow then rose lay down again rose yet again rose yet again lay down then came to where israel be stood before at israel knew that soul of helpless child have asked a plainly a word of tongue can speak how often must lie to sleep at night rise to play in morning before mother came to again tear gushed into eye left child returned to wife chamber ruth cried call child to beseech cried ruth let come to touch kiss be with before be too late said israel miss fill house with flower for break heart to see will break mine also said ruth consented that naomi must be called fatimah be sent to fetch sun be setting through window looked out to west over river orange orchard palpitating plain beyond dying ray came into room in bar of golden light fell at instant on ruth face be white wasted through other window of room looked out over mellah into town across market place to mosque to battery on hill there came up from darkening street below shuffle of foot of crowd sound of many voice jew of tetuan be trooping back to own little quarter moorish master might lock into for night naomi be already in bed fatimah brought away in nightdress seemed to know where be to be taken for laughed a fatimah held by hand danced a be led to mother chamber when be come to door of suddenly laughter ceased little face sobered a if something in close abode of pain have troubled sens be left to be perhaps most touching experience of deaf blind that greeting can ever welcome when naomi stood like little white vision at threshold of room israel took hand in silence drew up to pillow of bed where mother rested in silence ruth brought child to bosom for moment naomi seemed to be perplexed touched mother finger be changed for have grown thin long then felt face be changed also for be become withered cold missing grasp of one smile of other first turned little head aside a one listens closely then gently withdrew from arm held ruth have watched with eye overflowed now burst into sob outright child doe not know cried did not tell must break heart try again said israel try again ruth devoured tear called on fatimah to bring child back to side then loosening necklace be about own neck bound about neck of naomi also bracelet be on wrist unclasped clasped on wrist of child did that naomi might remember hand have be kind to always when child felt ornament seemed only to know by quick instinct of girl that be decked out bravely giving thought to ruth who waited watched for grasp of recognition kiss of joy withdrew again from mother arm bounded into middle of room suddenly began to laugh to dance sun dying light have rested on ruth wasted face now glistened sparkled on jewel of child glowed on blind eye gleamed on fair hair reddened white nightdress while danced laughed to mother death nothing did child know of death more than adam before abel be slain be almost a if devil out of hell have entered into innocent heart possessed that might make mock of dying of dearest friend have known on earth on on danced to measure time not with child uncertain step break down at motion a tongue break down at speech wildly deliriously room be darkening fast still across nether end by foot of bed streamed dull red bar of sunlight with little red figure leaping prancing laughing in midst of with awful cry ruth fell back on pillow turned eye to wall black woman dropped head that might not see israel covered face groaned in tearless agony o lord god long hast thou chastised with whip now be chastised with scorpion ruth recovered quickly bring to again faltered once more fatimah brought naomi back to bedside then embracing kissing child seeming to forget in torment of trouble that naomi must not hear cried be mother naomi mother darling though so sick changed know naomi mother own mother sweet one dear mother who love so must leave now see more now what be in wild plea touched consciousness of child at last only god can say first naomi cheek grew pale at embrace of arm held then reddened then little nervous finger grasped at ruth hand again then little lip trembled then at length flung along ruth bosom nestled close in embrace ruth fell back on pillow now with cry of joy black woman stood wept by wall israel unable to bear up heart longer be melted unmanned sun have gone down room be darkening rapidly for twilight in land be short street be quiet mooddin of neighbouring minaret be chanting in silence god be great god be great after awhile little one fell asleep at mother bosom seeing fatimah must have lifted away carried back to own bed ruth said leave let have with while may one will take from said israel then gazed down at child face said be hard to leave never once to have heard voice be bitterest cup of said israel will not return to said ruth will come to then perhaps who know perhaps in resurrection will hear israel made answer ruth gazed down at child again said helpless darling who will care for when be gone rest rest sleep said israel ah yes know said ruth how foolish of be father love also yet promise promise for love tending will never lack said israel now lie still dearest lie still sleep stretched out hand to yes be what meant said smiled then shadow crossed face in gloom when be gone said will naomi ever know that mother who be dead have wronged have never wronged said israel have done oh have done god punished for prayer husband said ruth peace peace said israel god be good said ruth surely will not afflict child much longer hush hush will awaken said israel not thinking what said now lie still sleep dearest be tired also lay quiet for time gazing while light remained into face of sleeping child listening when light failed to gentle breathing then babbled crooned over with childish joy yes yes father be right must lie quiet very quiet so little naomi will sleep long very long wake happy well in morning how bonny will look how fresh rosy paused moment laboured breathing came quick fast will be here to see will paused again then a though to banish thought began to sing in low voice be like moan presently singing ceased spoke again time in broken whisper how soft glossy hair be wonder if fatimah will remember to wash day must twist around finger to keep in pretty curl oh why did god make child so beautiful dear morning frock wanted stitching at sleeve be chance if habeebah have seen to then there be underclothing will be deaf blind dumb always wonder if will see when say that angel be sent yes yes be when be there there will go to god say ' o lord little girl whom have left behind be must never think o lord how many thing may happen to one like let go only let watch over o lord let be guar ' weakness have conquered be quiet at last israel sat in silence by post of bed heart be surging out of choking breast black woman stood somewhere by wall after time ruth seemed to awake a from sleep be in great excitement israel israel cried in voice of joy have seen vision be naomi be no longer deaf blind dumb be grown to be woman knew instantly not woman either young maiden so beautiful so beautiful yes must see hear speak israel thought ruth have become delirious tried to soothe agitation be not to be overcome lord hath seen tear at last cried have put sin beneath foot be forgiven will be well with child yet israel did not try to gainsay at sight sound of joy seeing so beautiful yet thinking so vain must not help at last weep presently became quiet again then again after little while woke a from sleep be ready now said in whisper quite ready sweet heaven quite quite ready now then with one free hand felt in darkness for israel where sat beside touching forehead smoothed said very softly farewell husband israel answered farewell good night whispered israel drew down hand from forehead to lip sobbed said good night beloved then put white lip to child blind eye at moment spirit of lord came to lord took died when lamp have be brought into room fatimah saw that end have come must have lifted naomi from ruth bosom child awoke a be being moved clasped little

to ruth at death that naomi must not lack for love tending faithfully fulfilled from time forward became a father mother to child at outset of charge made survey of condition found more terrible than imagination of mind must think word of tongue express be easy to say that be deaf dumb blind be hard to realise what so great affliction implied implied that be little human sister standing close to rest of family of man yet very far away from be a much apart a if have inhabited different sphere human sympathy must reach in joy pain sorrow have part to play in life in midst of world of light be in land of darkness be in world of silence in midst of land of sweet sound be living buried soul of soul did israel know knew that have memory for naomi have remembered mother knew that have love for have pined for ruth clung to what be love memory without sight speech be more than magnet locked in casket idle useless to purpose of man world thinking of israel realised for first time how awful be affliction of motherless girl to be blind be to be afflicted once to be blind deaf be not only to be afflicted twice twice ten thousand time to be blind deaf dumb be not merely to be afflicted thrice beyond reckoning of human speech for though naomi have be blind yet if must have have hearing father might have spoken with if have sorrow must have soothed if have joy must have shared in beautiful world of god so full of thing to look upon to love must have be eye of eye must not see on other hand though naomi have be deaf yet if must have have sight father might have held intercourse with by light of eye if felt pain must have seen if have found pleasure must have known what man be what woman be what world what sea what sky must have be a open book for to read being blind deaf together by fault of being deaf being dumb a well what word be to describe desolation of state blank void of isolation cut off apart aloof shut in imprisoned enchained soul without communion with other soul alive yet dead thus realising condition in deep infirmity of nature israel set to consider how must reach darkened silent soul first tried to learn what good gift be left to that might foster to advantage nourish to own great comfort joy yet gift must find in one gift only whereof have known from beginning gift of touch feeling with must make to see else light must always be darkness with must make to hear silence must be speech for ever then remembered that during year in england have heard strange story of how dumb have be made to speak though must not hear blind deaf to understand to answer so sent to england for many book written on treatment of child of affliction when be come pondered closely be thrilled by marvellous work described when came to practise precept have given spirit flagged

way to mind so dense be wall of prison encompassed yes be mystery must not at first be revealed to be problem beyond power to apprehend smile frown be useless to teach discipline must be addressed to mind heart except mere bodily restraint control must be imposed upon be swayed by impulse alone israel did not despair if be broken down today strengthened hand for tomorrow at length have got so far after world of toil thought that naomi knew when patted head that be for approval when touched hand be for assent then stopped very suddenly hope have not drooped have energy failed conviction have fastened upon that such effort in case must be offence against heaven naomi be not merely infirm creature from left hand of nature be afflicted being from right hand of god be living monument of sin be not own be useless to go farther child must be left where god have placed meanwhile if naomi lacked sens of rest of human kind seemed to communicate with nature by other organ than possessed be a if spiritual world must have taught from source alone must have imbibed power to tell of must do to guide step to minister to pleasure to cherish affection must be to go beyond limit of belief truly seemed a if naomi being blind with bodily eye must yet look upon light one else must see being deaf with bodily ear must yet listen to voice that one else must hear thus if came skipping through

down to dwelling must only be simple human child sometimes have wish many throb of anguish with for often happened especially at season when wind be stirring blank peace doleful silence haunted air that naomi must seem to fall into sick longing from cause be beyond israel power to fathom then sweet face must sadden beautiful blind eye must fill pretty laughter must echo more through house sometimes in dead of night must rise from bed go through dark corridor for darkness light be a one to until came to israel room must awake from sleep to find like little white vision standing by

lamp lead back to bed more scalding than tear must be standing in naomi eye must be hot drop must gush into own poor darling must say can not tell trouble may comfort can not tell can not comfort darling darling most of when such thing befell must israel long for miracle out of heaven to find way to little maiden mind that might ask answer know yet dared not to pray for for still greater than pity for child be fear of wrath of god out of fear there came to at length awful terrible thought though so severed on earth child yet before bar of judgment must one day be brought together then how must stand with soul naomi knew nothing of god having way of speech with man must god condemn for cast out for ever god must not ask for good work in land of silence for labour in land of night have eye to see god beautiful world ear to hear holy word god have created so must not destroy what have made far rather must look with love pity on little one so long sorely tried on earth send at last to

radiantly happy in sweet innocency have alloy of pain from tree of knowledge of good evil israel took naomi by hand present with of followed child going past booth blind beggar leper shrieking arab lay about gate through iron clamped door into quadrangle where group of woman stood together closely covered in blanket mother sister of child permitted to see little one pas into kasbah allowed to go farther then down crooked passage past tiny mosque like closet bath like dungeon finally into pillared patio paved walled with tile be place of festival be filled already with great company of child father teacher moor arab berber jew clad in various costume of white blue black red be gorgeous voluptuous perhaps beautiful spectacle in morning sunlight a israel entered with naomi by hand be conscious that eye be on a passed through way be made for heard whispered exclamation of people shoof muttered moor see be said jew child said jew allah have smitten said arab blind dumb deaf said moor god be gracious to father said arab musician be playing in gallery that ran round court from flat roof above woman of governor hareem not yet dispersed four lawful mohammedan wife many concubine be gazing furtively down from behind haik there be fountain in middle of patio at farther end of within alcove opened out of horseshoe arch beneath ceiling hung with stalactite against wall covered with silken haities on rabat rug of many colour sat ben aboo christian bride be there that israel saw spaniard for first time at instant of recognition shivered a with cold be handsome woman plainly heartless one selfish vain vulgar ben aboo hailed israel with welcome peace blessing katrina drew naomi to side so be little maid of whom wonderful rumour be so rife said katrina israel bent head shuddered at seeing child at woman foot darling be a fair a angel said katrina kissed naomi kiss seemed to israel to smite own cheek like blow then performance of child began truly made pretty affecting sight white wall deep blue sky black shadow of gallery bright sunlight grown people massed around patio sweet little face coming going in middle of first line of moorish girl in embroidered hazzams dancing after native fashion bending rising twisting turning keeping foot in same place constantly then line of jewish girl in kilted skirt dancing after jewish manner tripping on slippered toe whirling turning around with rapid motion playing timbrel tambourine held high above head by shapely arm hand then passage of koran chanted by group of moorish boy in jellabs purple chocolate white peaked above red tarboosh then psalm by company of jewish boy in black skull cap brave old song of zion sung by silvery young voice in alien land finally little black ali led out by teacher with diminutive moorish harp in hand showing fear at only negro boy shy look of pleasure head aside eye gleaming white teeth glinting face aglow now down to moment naomi at foot of woman have be agitated restless sometimes rising then sinking back sometimes playing with nervous finger then pushing off slipper be a though be conscious of fine show be going forward knew that be child who be making perhaps breath of little one beat on level of cheek perhaps light air made by sweep of garment be wafted to sensitive body whatsoever sense whereby knowledge came to clearly be there in flushed twitching face be full of old hunger for child company israel knew too well when little ali be brought out began to play on kanoon harp be impossible to repress naomi excitement girl leaped up from place at woman foot with utmost rapidity of motion passed like gleam of light across patio to boy side being there touched harp a played then low cry came from lip again touched eye though blind seemed for instant to flame like fire then with hand clung to with lip tongue kissed while whole body quivered like reed in wind israel saw what did very soul trembled at sight with wild thought did not dare to take name of hope a well a must in confusion of own sens stepped forward to draw little maiden back wife of governor called on to leave leave cried let see what child will do at moment ali playing came to a end boy let harp pas to naomi clinging finger then half sitting half kneeling on ground beside girl took to herself caressed patted with hand touched string then faint smile crossed rosy lip laid cheek against touched string again then laughed aloud flung off slipper garment covered beautiful arm laid pure flesh against harp wheresoever flesh might cling touched string once more then very heart seemed to laugh with delight now what be to follow will seem to be no better than superstitious saying true be nevertheless simple sooth for sound so strange that though be deaf a grave have never yet heard music though be untaught knew nothing of note of harp to strike yet swept string to strange sound such a man have ever listened to before none must follow be not music that little maiden made to ear only motion to body just a deaf who be deaf alone be sometimes found to take pleasure in form of percussion to derive from of sensation of sound trembling of air after thunder quivering of earth after cannon quaking of vast wall after ringing of mighty bell so naomi who be blind a well have sense save touch found in finger have gathered up force of other sens power to reproduce on instrument of music movement of thing moved about patter of leaf of fig tree in patio of home swirl of great wind on hill top plash of rain on face rippling of levanter in hair be witchery of naomi playing yet because emotion in nature have harmony so there be harmony of wild sort in music be struck by girl finger out of string of harp more than music be perhaps only rhapsody of sound be frenzy of girl a made lifted head like bird throat swelled bosom heaved a played laughed again again there be something fascinating magical in spectacle of beautiful fair face aglow with joy rounded limb visible through robe clinging to side of harp delicate white finger flying across string there be something gruesome awful a well for face of girl be blind ear heard nothing of sound that finger be making eye be on in wide circle around mouth be agape when who looked on listened have recovered from first surprise very strange various be whispered word passed between where have learnt asked moor from master muttered jew who be asked moor beelzebub growled jew god pity evil eye be on said arab god will show said shereef from wazzan say mother be childless woman offered

played what did tell said looking toward husband child be not deaf blind oh be brave imposture brava brave still little maiden played now brow be clouded head dropped eyelash be downcast hung over harp sighed audibly good again cried woman very good clapped hand whereupon arab moor forgetting dread felt constrained to follow example cheered in wilder way jew continued to mutter beelzebub beelzebub israel saw at first amid commotion of mind confusion of sens heart melted at sight of what naomi did have god opened gateway to soul be poor wing of spirit to spread out at last be then way of speech that heaven have given hardly have israel overflowed with tenderness of such thought when bleating barking of face about awakened anger then like blow on brain came cry of wife of governor who cheered awakening of girl soul a be no better than vulgar show at israel wrath rose to throat brava brava cried woman again turning to israel said will leave child with must have with always israel throat seemed to choke at word looked at katrina saw that be woman lustful of breath vain of heart who have married ben aboo because be rich then looked at naomi remembered that heart be clear a water sweet a morning pure a snow at moment wife of governor cheered again again people echoed even woman on housetop made bold to take up cry with cooing ululation playing have ceased spell have

through court then parting arab with sweep of arm picked up unconscious maiden faced about on new wife of ben aboo madam cried israel ben oliel may belong to governor child belongs to so saying passed out of court carrying girl in arm in dead silence blank stupor of moment none seemed to know what have done until be gone israel went home in anger nevertheless out of event found courage in heart to begin task again let enemy bleat bark beelzebub yet child be angel though suffering for sin soul be with god be spirit song have played be air of paradise comforting so israel remembered vision of

footstep did not appear to know who approached led into street into feddan into walled lane to great gate into steep arcade leading to kasbah more a of old did thread way through people seeming to see through flesh of face to salute with laugh on lip only followed on on with helpless footstep took to hill above battery breath came quick a trod familiar way when be come to summit no longer did exult in lofty place drink new life from rush of mighty wind about only quaked like child in terror a faced world unseen beneath hearkened to voice rising out of heard breeze have once laved cheek now screaming in ear gave ali harp into hand same that have played so strangely at kasbah on marriage of ben aboo never again a on day did sweep string to wild rhapsody of sound such a none have heard before none must follow only touched fumbled with deftless finger knew music lost old power to guide footstep to minister to pleasure to cherish affection no longer did seem to communicate with nature by other organ than did rest of human kind be radiant joyous spirit maid more only beautiful blind girl sweet human sister be weak faint nevertheless israel recked nothing of weakness for joy at loss of power over enemy throughout seventeen evil year have bleated barked beelzebub if god in mercy have taken angel out of house so strangely gifted so strangely joyful have given instead for hunger of

walked through winding path of oleander between creeping fence of broom sprawling limb of prickly pear until came to stream tributary of marteel trickling down from wild height of akhmas over light pebble of narrow bed there by what impulse what chance israel never knew naomi have withdrawn hand from hand at next moment in scarcely more time than took to stoop to ground rise again suddenly a if have sunk into earth be lifted into sky naomi disappeared from sight israel pushed low bough apart expecting to find by side be nowhere near called by name thinking must answer with only language of

eye laughed in scorn of own word a if trying to carry off by silly show of braggadocio to make believe that have be no more than humorous pretence that man must be so simple a to think have truly meant after mockery turned to israel again being relieved of fear fell back to savage mood once more without disguise without shame pray sir said with ghastly smile what rich have gathered that be at last content to hoard more none said israel shortly ben aboo laughed lustily exchanged look of obvious meaning with katrina pray again said with curl of lip without office without rich how may hope to

u kabar finally slow melancholy wail rising falling on darkening air there be god god mohammed be prophet of god be solemn sound nay awful one with man alive to hear o gratitude be only death song o fame be only funeral israel listened smiled again ah god be great whispered god be great to ease labouring chest moment mahdi rose stepped to door then in distance must descry procession approaching moving black shadow against sky also over billowy head must see red glow far away in cloud be last smouldering of fire of modern sodom while stood there be startled by sound of thick voice behind be israel voice be speaking to naomi yes be saying be hard to part be going to be very happy must not cry listen when be there eh know there will want to say did well to hear prayer little daughter be happy be merry soul be sunshine ' so must not weep never never never remember ah be right be right simple hearted darling sunny merry happy girl naomi be trying to laugh in obedience to father will be combing white beard with finger be knotted tangled be labouring hard to speak again naomi do remember said then tried to sing even to lisp word a sang just a child might have done do remember within heart voice bid earth heaven rejoice sings ' strength be spent have to stop sing whispered with poor broken smile at own failure then brave girl courage strength quivering bow of steel took up song where have left though voice trembled tear started to eye a naomi sang israel made poor shift to beat time to though once again feeble hand fell back into breast when have done singing israel looked at mahdi then at smiled a if song be one to indeed naomi have hardly finished when wail came again now nearer than before louder israel heard be coming keep close muttered fumbled tugged with one hand at breast of kaftan mahdi thought throat wanted air naomi with instinct of help that woman have in scene like understood better in disarray of sens be way of trying to raise that might listen easier to song outside girl slid arm under neck then shrunken hand be at rest ah closer 'god be great ' murmured again 'god be great ' with word on lip smiled sighed sank back be now quite dark when mahdi returned to place at israel foot dying man seemed to have be feeling for hand taking now brought to breast where naomi hand lay under own trembling one with last effort look into girl face must have pursued home grand eye closed for ever in silence followed after departing spirit deep swell of funeral wail came rolling heavily on night air allah akbar al lah u kabar in few minute more procession of people of tetuan who have come out to bury israel ben oliel have arrived at house have gone said mahdi pointing down then lifting eye towards heaven added to king note italic text start end with
