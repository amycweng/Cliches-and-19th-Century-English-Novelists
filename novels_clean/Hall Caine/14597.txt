without quite losing consciousness to depth of abyss remember thought that what have just gone through differed in respect from signing of marriage settlement except in one case have given husband right over money father money whereas in case seemed to have given right over otherwise be so cold so drear so dead so unaffecting blue paper have slipped out of hand on to worn hearthrug when helpless meditation be interrupted by thrumming throbbing of motor car outside by father who be at office door saying in loud commanding voice come gel guess be time for to be back hour afterwards be in own room at home given over to dressmaker be still being moved automatically creature without strength will thirty first chapter have only indefinite memory of floating vaguely through sight sound of next two hour of everybody except being wildly excited of cousin railing repeatedly from unseen region of house of aunt bridget scolding indiscriminately of dressmaker chattering without ceasing a fitted on wedding dress of standing off from at interval with cry of delight at success of effort of wind roaring in chimney of church bell ringing in distance of ever increasing moaning of sea about st mary rock finally of rumbling of rubber wheel of several carriage plash of horse hoof on gravel of drive when dressmaker be done with be wearing ivory satin dress embroidered in silver with coronal of myrtle orange blossom under old limerick lace of family veil a well a string of pearl one big diamond of noble house be marrying into remember said black hair shone with blue lustre against sparkling gem dare say looked gay on outside anyway at last heard fluttering of silk outside room running stream of chatter going down stair followed by banging of carriage door then father deep voice saying bride ready good time to go guess alone have made effort to dress up for be still wearing day serge usual heavy boot there be not even flower in button hole did not speak very much on way to church found certain comfort in big warm presence a sat together in carriage with window shut for rising storm be beginning to frighten will be nothing said father just puff of wind slant of rain maybe little church be thronged with people even gallery be full of child from village school there be twittering overhead like of young bird in tree a walked up nave on father arm must not help hear over sound of organ whispered word of people in pew on side of dear heart alive straight like mother be bless goodness yes be poor misfortunate mother come to life again deed daughter in though lord raa be waiting for by communion rail looked yet more nervous than in morning though be trying to bear with usual composure there be thought there be certain expression of fear in face have never seen before friend witness mr eastcliff wearing carnation button hole be by side aunt lady margaret carrying sheaf of beautiful white flower be standing near own witness bridesmaid betsy beauty nessy macleod in large hat with soaring black feather be behind must hear rustle of rose coloured skirt indistinct buzz of whispered conversation a well a more audible reproof of aunt bridget who in crinkly black silk dress bonnet like half moon be telling to be silent to look placid at next moment be conscious that bell have be rung in chancel that organ have stopped that coughing hemming in church have ceased that somebody be saying stand here lord that lord raa with nervous laugh be asking here taking place by side that lighted altar laden with flower be in front of that bishop in vestment dan in surplice white stole clerk carrying book vessel of holy water be beginning service surely never be there sadder ceremony never did girl under similar circumstance feel more vivid presentiment of pain penalty follow on forced ill assorted marriage yet there came to in course of service startling change of thought a wiped out for while sadness made forget compulsion have be put upon lifted into realm of spiritual ecstasy bishop began with short litany asked god blessing on ceremony be to join together two of child in bond of holy wedlock while be going on be conscious of nothing except howling of wind about church window far off tolling of bell on st mary rock nothing voice within seemed to say again again love love hardly have actual ceremony commenced when began to be overawed by solemnity divine power of service by sense of god leaning over littleness guiding according to will what did matter how unworthy be preparation have led up to marriage if god be making god make marriage be blessed by church therefore overrules to own good end human impulse however sordid selfish may be after thought came to nothing else seemed to matter nothing however jarring incongruous be able to lower exaltation of spirit service have effect upon appeared to have exactly opposite effect on lord raa nervousness increased visibly though did best to conceal by lightness of manner that sometimes looked like derision thus when bishop stepped down to said james charles munster wilt thou take mary here present for thy lawful wife according to rite of holy mother church husband halted stammered over answer saying beneath breath thought be heretic when corresponding question be put to father dan thinking must be nervous leaned over whispered worry child take time replied loud clear unfaltering voice will again when husband have to put ring gold silver on salver fumbled dropped a did so fumbled dropped second time when have to take up after have be blessed laughing too audibly at own awkwardness then repeat after bishop with ring thee wed gold silver thee give with body thee worship with worldly good thee endow tendered ring slowly with obvious effort took without trembling because be thinking that in spite of have heard of way of life solemn sacred sacrament made mine one else be very mysterious can not account for only know be so that everything considered be perhaps strangest fact of life remember that more than once during ceremony father dan spoke to softly caressingly a if to child felt need of comforting for strength be from higher source also remember that be afterwards said that through ceremony eye of newly wedded couple seemed sedulously to shun other if did not look at husband be because marriage be like prayer to carrying back with sense of purity sanctity to little sunlit church in rome where mildred bankes have taken vow after marriage service there be nuptial mass benediction special dispensation from rome raised to still higher pitch spiritual exaltation sustained father dan read epistle beginning let wife be subject to husband then bishop read gospel concluding therefore now be not two one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder have trembled when thought of solemn sonorous word in solitude of own room now that be spoken before congregation have fear no misgiving nothing sense of rapture consecration last word being spoken lord raa being man wife stepped into sacristy to sign register not even there did spirit fail took up pen signed name without tremor hardly have done so when heard rumbling murmur of voice about first bishop voice in such worldly tone then father then husband then voice of many others in light conversation mingled with trill of laughter then in moment in twinkling a fast a snowflake melt upon stream spell of marriage service seemed to break have heard since eye be wet at moment seemed to have be cry through ceremony know nothing about do know felt kind of internal shudder that be just a if soul have suddenly awakened from intoxicating drug organ began to play wedding march husband putting arm through said come there be much audible whispering

over everything again yet again must have done so far into night even when wing of memory be weary of fluttering be dropping off at last thought heard martin calling shipmate said yes quite loud a if have be with still in vague beautiful shadow land lie on frontier of sleep how mysterious how magical how wonderful looking back can not think strange that even down to moment did not really know what be happening to being only conscious of great flood of joy can not think strange that though nature have be whispering to for month did not know what have be saying can not think strange that though have be looking for love so long without finding did not recognise immediately when have come to of when awoke early in morning very early while sunrise be filling bedroom with rosy flush thought of martin be first be springing from mist of sleep to conscious mind be asking how happened that be feeling so glad while have so many cause for grief then suddenly suddenly a sun stream through cloud scud over sea knew that what have long be predestined have happened that wondrous new birth great revelation joyous mystery come to happy woman in world have come at last to be in love be in love with martin conrad fifty second chapter joy be short lived sooner have become aware that loved martin conrad than conscience told have right to do so be married to love than husband be sin must be impossible to say with what terror thought possessed took sunlight out of sky moment before have seemed so bright came on like storm of thunder lightning sweeping happiness into abyss religion everything have be taught about sanctity of sacrament of marriage seemed to rise up accuse be not be conscious of sin against husband be thinking only of sin against first effect be to make realise that be no longer possible for to speak to martin about husband alma to do now that knew loved must be deceitful mean almost treacherous next effect be to make see that thought of separation must now be given up how must accuse husband when be in same position if loved woman loved man in distress fright saw only one mean of escape from filthy burden to be bound consciousness of sinful heart be to cure of passion determined to do so determined to fight against love for martin conrad to conquer to crush first attempt to do be feeble enough be effort to keep out of reach of temptation by refusing to see martin alone for three four day did best to carry out purpose making one poor excuse after when a happened several time day came down to see be just going out have just come in be tired unwell be tearing heart out to deny so think must have borne pain if have not realised that be causing pain to also maid whose head be always running on martin must come hack to room after delivering one of lying excuse say must have seen face when told be ill be just a if 'd driven knife into everybody seemed to be in conspiracy to push into martin arm alma above others being woman read secret must see

same hotel too when saw be struggling hard reminded husband of intention of asking martin to dinner thereupon night be fixed party invited martin came be only too happy to meet in company though pain humiliation of contrast between husband friend difference of atmosphere in lived from to thought be doomed for ever be almost more than must bear think must have felt for though usual conversation be of horse dog race meeting noticed be silent while martin in rugged racy poetic way for explorer be poet talked of beauty of great polar night cloudless polar day midnight calm moonlight on glacier be loveliest weirdest most desolate yet most entrancing light world must show wonder think of going back to antarctic if be so fascinating said alma do bet life do said martin then told what have told on launch more fully even more rapturously story of great scheme for saving life otherwise benefiting humanity for hundred of year man prompted merely by love of adventure praise of achievement desire to know globe lived on have be shouldering way to hitherto inviolable region of pole now time have come to turn knowledge to account how said husband by putting into position said martin that will be able to predict six eight ten day ahead weather of vast part of navigable habitable world by establishing installation of wireless telegraphy a near a possible to long ice barrier about pole from ice floe iceberg blizzard come so that can say in ten minute from side of mount erebus to southern hemisphere 'look out be coming down thus save million of life from shipwreck hundred of million of money splendid by jove said mr eastcliff yes ripping by jingo said mr vivian ridiculous dream muttered husband not until martin have gone then alma seeing be aglow said what lovely man wonder see more of mary love will be going to end of earth soon then will be sorry missed chance word hurt like sting of wasp must not resist when day later martin called to take to geographical society where commander lieutenant be to give account of expedition must not find in heart to refuse to go oh difference of world from in have be living for past six month be best in england seemed to be there men who be doing work of world woman who be wife partner theatre be like inside of dish sat by martin side on bottom row of seat just in front of platform face to face with commander lecture be illustrated by many photographic lantern slide of exploring party including one have be shown to on ship be very interesting terribly pathetic when described hardship have gone through in prolonged blizzard on high plateau with food fuel running low certainty that must ever see home again found feeling for martin hand to make sure that be there towards end commander spoke very modestly of saying must never have reached th parallel if have not have crew of finest comrade that ever sailed on ship though be splendid fellow said there be one can specially mention without doing wrong to rest be young doctor of expedition martin conrad martin have scheme of own for going down to antarctic again to make great experiment in interest of humanity if when go say 'good luck to god bless ' at generous word there be much applause during martin sat blushing like big boy when be introduced to girl friend of sister a for did not think speech must have be so beautiful felt a if must have cried for joy when got back to hotel did cry be for reason be thinking of father wondering why did not wait why why why asked fifty third chapter next day martin came rushing down to sitting room with sheaf of letter in hand saying be jolly good of bos look what have let in for be request from various newspaper for portrait interview particularly from one great london journal for special article to contain account of nature object of proposed experiment what be to do said be right for stringing gabble must write anything to save soul now must be sure must must write like robinson crusoe why must write article will tell what to put into there be resisting that down at bottom of secret heart be glad of excuse to conscience must not longer run away from martin because be necessary to help so sat together day long though be like shooting rapid to follow martin impetuous imaginative speech did best to translate disconnected outburst into more connected word when article be written read aloud to be delighted stunning did say must write like robinson crusoe in due course be published made deep impression for went people be talking of though said fudge others like husband said dream practical result be that great newspaper started public subscription with object of providing fund for realisation of martin scheme brought immense correspondence so that morning came down with armful of letter piteous appeal to to help to reply to knew must be dangerous to put in way of so much temptation end of be that day after day sat together in sitting room answering inquiry of sceptical congratulation of convinced offer of assistance came from people who wished to join in expedition what joy be be like dawn of new life to highest happiness of be to protect martin against to save from over generous impulse in word to mother many of letter received be mere mendicancy be not rich yet must not resist pitiful appeal especially if came from woman be a much a must do to restrain from ruining sometimes must see smuggle letter into side pocket with h be will do later what be must ask oh nothing nothing must answer hand out sir must say then must find fierce delight in sending six freezing word of refusal to impudent woman who be trying to play upon tender side of big hearted boy oh be delightful whole being seemed to be renewed if only dear sweet hour must go on on for ever sometimes husband alma must look in upon at work then while colour mounted to eye martin must say be fishing with man float see see husband must reply fixing monocle showing front teeth in painful grin just what dear mary love though alma must say do believe must rather sitting in sunless room writing letter for mr conrad than wearing coronet at king coronation just so ma'be there be woman like martin must answer looking hard at when have gone laughing lightly with frightened look have seen before must say a if speaking to hate that woman be like snake feel a if want to put foot on at climax came one day martin rushed

picture of great people of kind duke marquis lord count a well a photograph of fashionable lady in low dress inscribed in several language to dear father in god lord bishop of ellan bishop came to after few minute smiling apparently at peace with world except that wore biretta be dressed a in rome in long black soutane with innumerable button silver buckled shoe heavy gold chain jewelled cross welcomed in smooth suave manner asking if must offer little refreshment too full of mission to think of eating drinking plunged immediately into object of visit monsignor said be in great trouble be about marriage smile be smitten away from bishop face by announcement be sorry said nothing serious trust told be very serious straightway began on spiritual part of grievance that husband did not

dear lady doe indeed provide alleviation in case of dire necessity provides relief of separation always deploring necessity hoping for ultimate reconciliation to sanction separation of wife from husband because pardon say be case find that doe not please because again say be case fancy that somebody else plea better monsignor said feeling hot dizzy need not discus separation be thinking of something much more serious never will forget expression of bishop face looked aghast good lady surely be not thinking of divorce think head must have dropped a in silent assent for in peremptory condemnatory manner bishop took to task asking if did not know that catholic church did not recognise divorce under circumstance if have forgotten what holy father pointing up to portrait have said to that when entered into solemn contract of holy matrimony be to do so in full consciousness that must not be broken by death love in husband wife contract to hold other in holy wedlock be typified by love of christ for church a one can never be broken can other husband doe not love said do love therefore contract between be broken already bishop be very severe with for telling that a good child of church must never never say again for though marriage be contract differed from other contract whatsoever when married husband dear lady be bound to not by own act alone by mysterious power from of can ever free power that united be god whom god have joined together man may put asunder felt head drooping bishop be saying what have always be taught though in torment of trouble fierce fire of temptation have forgotten civil law might divorce continued bishop know can say nothing about must have right to do so because law can have right to undo what god have done oh be cruel felt a if future of life be darkening before a if iron bar of prison be closing upon fetter be being fixed on limb even if civil law must must divorce said bishop think of injury must be inflicting on church

standing once more where martin have stood together little while ago be alone now low thunder be still rolling along cliff hardly heard white sheet lightning be still pulsing in sky rising a seemed out of sea hardly saw at one moment caught glimpse of solitary fishing boat under brown lugger sail heading towards blackwater at next moment eye be dazzled a by flashlight from unseen battleship leaning over balcony gazing into intermittent darkness pictured to myself barren desolation of martin life after have left loving so much might fall into excess perhaps vice if happened what must be measure of responsibility losing might lose faith in god have read of men becoming spiritual castaway after have lost anchorage in great love asked what must do if martin became infidel when told must only save martin soul by sacrificing own be overwhelmed by love so great that thought must do even that martin martin forgive forgive cried felt so hot that opened dressing gown to cool bare breast after while began to shiver then fearing might take cold went back to boudoir sat down looked at cuckoo clock be half past twelve only hour since martin have left seemed like hour hour what of year

fragment belong to schooner of south pole expedition left akaroa few week ago character of of remnant being vital part of ship structure lead to inference that vessel must have foundered well well said old clergyman with mouth full of buttered toast wall of room seemed to be moving around must scarcely see must scarcely hear naturally there can be absolute certainty that becotia may not be still afloat that member of expedition may not have reached place of safety presence of large piece of ice attached to of fragment seem to best authority to favour theory that unfortunate vessel be struck by one of huge iceberg have lately be floating up from direction of admiralty mountain in case fate will probably remain one of many insoluble mystery of ocean now be what one might call irony of fate said old clergyman seeing that object of expedition hush while sympathy of public will be extended to family of explorer who have apparently perished in brave effort to protect mankind from one of worst danger of great deep entire world will mourn loss a fear may be of heroic young commander doctor martin conrad who certainly belonged to ever diminishing race of dauntless intrepid soul who seem to be born will sacred courage lead men to render up life at lure of unknown call of great idea felt a if be drowning at one moment there be shrieking of wave about face at next rolling of

sometimes seemed to go with foot of lead sometimes with galloping footstep remember that clock outside seemed to strike few minute then not to strike at at one moment heard bell of neighbouring church ringing merrily by knew be christmas morning did not sleep during first hour of night somewhere in blank reach of short space between night day like slack water between ebb flow be only time when london rest fell into troubled doze wish have not done so for at first moment of returning consciousness have that sense so familiar to bereaved one of memory rushing over like surging tide did not

when isabel be three week old began to wean at first contented with hour of night keeping feeding bottle in bed with cow milk warmed to heat of own body when baby cried for breast during day must not

of first week found have made ten shilling be delighted after have paid for room food there be not enough for baby board so second week worked later in evening earned fourteen shilling be still insufficient therefore determined to take something from other end of day morning will be better thought remembering painful noise at night especially about midnight when people be being thrown out of public house higher up street where there be placard in window saying ale sold there must be guaranteed to make anybody drunk for fourpence unfortunately being little weak be always heavy in morning by great luck room faced east so conceived idea of moving bed up to window drawing blind to top so that earliest light might fall on face waken device succeeded splendidly for many week of late summer early autumn be up before sun a soon a dawn have broadened while leaden london daylight be filtering through smoke of yesterday by mean increased earnings to sixteen shilling a finger learned to fly over work to seventeen even eighteen be maximum though left narrow margin for other need enabled at end of month to pay pound for baby board to put away little towards shortening mr oliver be always

top room be really happy saw baby day between six nine night broke off work to go to ilford saying nothing about errand to anybody leaving family of jew to think be time for recreation generally trammed from bow church because be so eager to get to journey end usually returned on foot for though distance be great thought slept better for walk what joyful evening be perhaps be not altogether satisfied about oliver did not matter very much on closer acquaintance found baby nurse to be heedless feckless woman though told that allowance must be made for in having bad husband knew in secret heart be deceiving ought to listen to voice be saying child be being neglected sometimes seemed to that baby have not be bathed that only gave excuse for bathing sometimes thought clothes be not a clean a might be that only gave joy of washing sometimes be sure that feeding bottle have not be rinsed milk be not quite fresh that only gave pleasure of scalding one boiling other more than once flashed upon be paying mr oliver to do then what deep delight be to be mothering own baby thus week month passed be only now know how many for in day time have nothing in for except child new day brought new joy of watching baby development oh how wonderful be to see little mind soul coming out of unknown out of silence darkness of womb into world of light sound first sense of sight with never ending interest in dear little toe then sens of touch hearing gift of speech beginning with sort of crow ending in ma ma ma first time heard went prancing through through be more heavenly to ear than

into ear just a if understood telling what great man father have be how loved of must have done if have lived longer dare say be very foolish yet can not think be foolishness many many time since have wondered if holy saint who knew what have really happened to martin be whispering in ear a mean of keeping love for a much alive a if have be constantly by side climax came when isabel be about five month old for then feeling about baby martin reached higher phase hardly dare to speak of lest must seem silly when be really so sacred so exalted idea have have before baby be born that be being sent to console to be link between lost one developed into startling rapturous thought that very soul of martin have passed into child so martin be not dead at thought not really dead because life in baby be impossible to say how thought stirred how filled heart with thankfulness how prayed that little body in soul of martin have come to dwell might grow beautiful strong worthy of how felt charged with still greater responsibility to guard protect with life if need be yes yes very life thought perhaps be sort of delirium born of great love hard work failing strength did not know did not care

fifth chapter there must be physical power in fierce emotion to deprive of use of sens of hearing even of sight for memory of what happened after left jew have blank place in trying to recall incident of night be like travelling on moorland road under flying moon with whitest light in everything be clearly seen then blackest darkness remember taking electric car going west seeing whitechapel road shooting by with surging crowd of pedestrian public house cinema show jewish theatre remember getting down at aldgate pump walking through dead belt of city lying between east west be alive like beehive by day silent deserted by night remember seeing old man with face like rat picking up cigar end from gutter before dark bank then flock of sheep bleating before barking dog a be driven through echoing street from river side towards slaughter house near smithfield market remember that when came to st paul precinct of cathedral be very quiet big clock be striking nine on ludgate hill traffic be thick when reached fleet street crowd of people be standing in front of newspaper office reading large placard in written character be pasted on window remember that did not look at placard thinking news be nothing to who have not seen newspaper for month for whom world be now eclipsed that a stepped round one of crowd extended to middle of street somebody said have landed at southampton seems remember that when reached charing cross found on fringe of much larger crowd that people who seemed to be waiting for somebody be chatting with noise like crackling of thorn under pot be saying train be fifty minute late so have hour to wait yet then remember that walking at random round st martin church into leicester square came upon three public woman who be swinging along with high step laughing loudly that one of be angela that stopped on seeing cried hello here be again see giovanni dead care damn remember that said something else be about sister mildred mind did not take in at next moment left heard laughter once more a swept round corner hardly know what happened next for here come one of blank place in memory with nothing to light except vague thought of martin that soulless night in bloomsbury when newspaper announced that be lost until wandering aimlessly through street street of people such multitude of people end of people found back at charing cross waiting crowd be now larger more excited than before traffic at side of station be stopped be coming be coming here be people cried then there be deafening shout cheer recall sight of line of policeman pushing people back be pushed back recall sight of big motor car containing three men woman ploughing way through sight of one of men raising cap of crowd rushing to shake hand with then of car swinging away of people running after with noise like of racing of noisy river be literal truth that never once did ask what tumult be about that for time after be over full hour at least have sense of walking in sleep a if body be passing through street of west end of london while soul be somewhere else altogether thus at one moment a be going by national gallery thought caught sound of martin name felt a if be back in glen raa be who have be calling at moment when be standing at edge of pavement in piccadilly circus be ablaze with electric light thronged with people for theatre music hall be emptying men in uniform be running about with whistle policeman be directing traffic stream of carriage be flowing by felt a if be back in native island where be alone on dark shore while sea be smiting again after brusque voice have said move on please followed current of pedestrian down piccadilly must have be piccadilly saw line of public woman chiefly french belgian sauntering along heard men throwing light word to a went by be thinking of bleating sheep barking dog again when be passing men club place where have met angela dazed mind be harking back to ilford with frightened sense of length of time since have be there good heaven must be five hour at least wondering if mr oliver be giving baby drop of brandy spoonful of diluted milk somewhere about midnight soul seemed to take full possession of body saw thing clearly sharply a turned out of oxford street into regent street traffic be then rapidly dying down street be darker cafe be closing men woman be coming pout of supper room smoking cigarette getting into taxi driving away london day be passing into night people spoke to made answer at one moment elderly woman said something to replied hurried on at moment foreign looking man addressed pushed past without replying then string of noisy young fellow stretching across broad pavement arm in arm encircled cried here be dear let have kissing bee with angry word gesture compelled to let go whereupon one of foreign woman who be sauntering by said derisively what doe think be out for wonder at length found standing under kind of loggia at corner of piccadilly circus be now half dark theatre music hall being closed only one group of arc lamp burning on island about statue there be few people now where there have be so dense crowd awhile ago policeman be tramping leisurely along horse cab be going at walking pace taxi be moving slowly few gentleman walking home from club apparently be passing at interval often looking at sometimes speaking a went by then plainly pitilessly taunt of foreign woman came back to what be there for knew quite well yet saw that not only be not doing what came out to do time opportunity have offered

reverend mother with pale spiritual face saint like eye except habit be now blue white instead of black seemed hardly changed in respect since day at sacred heart finding be in bed put up at plough came day to nurse be naturally agitated at seeing again after so many year such various experience being uncertain how much knew of remembering martin warning be also fairly certain that have be sent for uneasiness on head soon wore off noiseless step soft voice sweet smile soothed comforted began to feel afresh influence have exercised over when be child to wonder why during dark time in london have never thought of writing to during first day of visit said nothing about painful thing never mentioning marriage what have happened since saw last talk be generally about old school old schoolfellow many of whom came to convent for retreat be under spiritual direction of one of pope domestic prelate sometimes must laugh about mother of novice who have become old naggledy sometimes about little fat maestro of pope choir who have cried when first sang hymn to virgin go on little angel sometimes about two old lay sister now quite toothless who still said might have be wonderful washerwoman if have put mind to hate to think that dear reverend mother be doing consciously in order to break down defence effect be same little by little during few day be with bridged space back to

talked of benediction if be in rome must be in church singing os pro nobis let sing now will said at next moment deep majestic contralto accompanied by own thin quavering soprano be sending out into

alive have nothing to say against martin except fact concerned have never heard word to discredit must even understand fact though must not condone perhaps have seen position married to cruel unfaithful husband pity have developed into love have heard of such happening only think child what abyss be driving to asks to break marriage vow oh yes yes can see what will say that pressure be put upon be too young to know what be doing may be true be everything thought wrong cruelly wrong that father must choose husband for without regard to wish will be not father who made marriage vow can never get away from never marriage vow be sacred blessed saviour have said must never be broken holy church have taken commandment for law think child only think what must happen to world if woman who have made unhappy marriage be to do a think of doing what chaos what uprooting of sacred tie of home family how woman must suffer woman child above see that daughter security of society lay in sanctity of marriage sanctity of marriage lay in indissolubility indissolubility centred in fact that god be party to perhaps be told that marriage will be own concern only that god church have nothing to do with if woman have believed that in age how different world must be to day oh believe marriage vow be sacred can not break without sin mortal sin daughter moral of be must renounce

impossible to say how affected how shook to heart core how in spite of effort to act on darling warning seemed to penetrate to inmost part of being to waken slumbering instinct in soul for long time sat without speaking again only listening with fluttering heart to what reverend mother be saying that be one of object of religious life to offer refuge to tortured soul must not trust to resist temptation that taking vow a nun to god must be only way known to acknowledged by church of cancelling vow a wife to husband will be bride still child bride of christ be that better far better used to wish to be nun know if father have not come for on most unhappy errand might have be one of already think of child mother of convent will be glad to welcome if can come a willing contented sister how
