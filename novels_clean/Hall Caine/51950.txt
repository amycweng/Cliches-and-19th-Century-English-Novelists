fatherless little elin be too young to feel grief must allow mother to believe that be dead to weep for a for one who be lost to forever must be too cruel must be impossible must write to mother immediately must write privately saying be still alive that part of report be untrue then came chilling thought though might dispose of fiction of death must not get rid of fact of offense that when mother pictured a one who be flying from consequence of conduct skulking in slum hiding face from face of friend there must be something in shame of end more bitter than death even own mother must wish that have died have not thought of before in confusion pain of got up from table at cafe began to walk street again after while found ascending step of madeline hardly knowing what be doing

difficult to distinguish real from imaginary in hears sound of nature mistake for voice from other world have wandered without knowing from path of pas be marked by stone standing upright out of snow when volcanic fire in womb of mountain began to shake with mighty throb then suddenly awful stillness be broken by crash resounding rumble a of echoing thunder coming down from snow capped height oscar stephenson did not see hear feel anything be only conscious of burst of heavenly music of sense of ten thousand angel singing anthem triumphant paean of praise grew louder louder moment sense of blinding light of traveling at terrific velocity into realm of sun sense of day of judgment of life of world being over busy throng gone pageant finished honor distinction caste gold wealth fame passed into nothingness sense of being outside great judgment hall with infinite multitude of king beggar good men bad guilty innocent of kneeling there among meanest most ashamed sense of spirit stooping to taking hand saying come of looking up into face seeing be thora of breath coming so fast short that must scarcely breathe sense of stumbling along with head down spirit leading forward singing a ascended sense of overwhelming presence somewhere in front of of music dying down becoming fainter fainter then of awful hush of blessed voice said for son be dead be alive again be lost be found moment afterward there be one on hengel mountain great lone home of nature be calm white silent end
