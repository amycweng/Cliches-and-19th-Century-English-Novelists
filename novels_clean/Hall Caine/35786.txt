bad man perhaps perhaps merely weak victim own associate else have be now if be to escape from death in life must be by own unaided energy alone be best so best that must climb to top without help be lost without detection after be superior power have governed dread eventuality silenced impotent tongue hour passed wind began to rise at first christian felt nothing of a stood in deep tomb must hear thin hiss over mouth of shaft be presently hiss deepened to sough christian have often heard of wind sob be reality metaphor a listened to wind now wind began to descend with great swoop came down shaft licked wall gathered voice from echoing water at bottom struggled for escape roared like caged beast be once more sucked up to surface with noise like breaking of huge wave over reef tumult of wind in shaft be hard to bear when be gone be silence seemed to be deafening sometimes gust be laden with smoke of burning gorse came from fire that danny have kindled on head of poolvash must fire reach pit encircle descend in then rain began to fall christian knew by quick monotonous patter overhead rain touched be being driven aslant by wind fell only against uppermost part of wall of shaft sometimes soft thin shower fell over be like spray from cataract except that volume of water from came be above not beneath christian have begun to contemplate measure for escape unexpected softness of rock have at first appalled began now to give painful glimmering of hope if side of shaft have be uniformly of gray slate rock of district ledge have laid hold of must not have crumbled in hand being soft there must be vein of sandstone running across shaft christian bewildered memory recalled what must have heard many time of rift of redstone lay under headland south of peel if vein be deep enough safety be assured must cut niche into with knife so perhaps after infinite pain labor reach surface steadying with one hand christian felt in pocket for knife be not there now death indeed be certain despair began to take hold of be icy cold feverishly hot at interval clothes be water still dripped from fell at interval into hidden tarn beneath in hollow drop not so soon be hope conquered when be hope of life not to hope now must have be not to fear christian remembered that have pair of small scissors attached to button hook when searching for knife have felt in pocket spurned for resembling knife to touch of nervous finger now be sole instrument found again opened with paltry help set to work of escape from dark deep tunnel stood upright night twas wearing on hour after hour passed wind dropped rain ceased to patter overhead christian toiled on step over step resting sometimes on largest firmest of projecting ledge looked up at sky leaden gray have changed to dark blue studded with star moon arose shone little way down prison lighting rest knew must be early morning one star large full globe of light twinkled directly above eye be fascinated by star sat long watched turned again again in toilsome journey to look at be symbol of hope pshaw christian twisted back to work when looked for star again be gone have moved beyond ken have passed out of range of narrow spot of heaven somehow have be mute companion christian heart sank yet lower in cheerless solitude still toiled on strength be far spent moon died off star went out one after one then deep impenetrable cloud of darkness overspread little sky above christian knew must be darkness precedes dawn have reached ledge of rock wider than be beneath clearly enough wooden rafter have lain along christian rested looked up at moment heard light patter of four little foot overhead poor stray sheep lamb of last spring flock bleated down shaft melancholy call of lost creature in dismal place touched christian deeply what be that made tear start to eye whole soul shake with new agony outcast lamb wandering over trackless waste in night have touched old scar in christian heart made wound bleed afresh be strange that in hour thought turned involuntarily to little ruby cregeen darling child caressed by salt breath of sea with sunlight dancing in eye glistening on ruby lip have then anything in common with little wanderer sent up pitiful cry into night too much too much for man who heard be buried in living grave with tombstone of dead joy rising everywhere around with fire have for year be kept close burning now most of oh dead joy want deepest grave christian turned again to weary task to live be duty live must finger be chilled to bone clothes still clung like damp cerement to body meagre blade of scissors be worn short must not last long christian rose to foot on ledge of rock plunged scissors into blank wall above ah what fresh disaster be hand went deep into soft earth vein of rock have finished be above must be loose uncertain mold gasped at discovery minute since life have looked very dear must abandon hope of after paused reflected a nearly a must remember have made twenty niche in rock hence must be fully thirty five foot from water ten from surface only ten foot then freedom yet ten seemed to represent impossibility to ascend by hole dug deep in soft earth be perilous enterprise great clod of soil might at moment give way above beneath then must be plunged once more into pit if fell from side of shaft must be more likely than at first to strike one of projecting ledge be killed before reached water there be nothing left to wait for dawn perhaps daylight must reveal le hazardous method of escape slowly dull dead impenetrable blackness above be lifted off be a though spirit breathed on night fled away when woolly hue of morning dappled larger sky christian must hear slow beat of wave on shore coast rose up before vision then silent solemn alone with dawn light crept into prison house looked down at deep black tarn now hope rose in heart again overhead saw timber running around across shaft have be used to bank up earth to make two groove in ascending descending cage have once worked christian lifted up soul in thankfulness world be once more full of grace even for must climb from stay to stay so reach surface catching one of stay in uplifted hand swung knee on to one stage be accomplished how stiff be joint how sinewless finger stage be reached then four foot more be between gorse waved in light of risen sun across mouth of night long tomb rain of year have eaten into timber in place crumbled be rotten god how one on rested creaked under at instant minute then toilsome journey must be over minute dead self must be left behind buried forever in grave then there must be resurrection in very truth yes truly god helping christian have swimming eye big heart a raised on to topmost stay crossed shaft clutched long tussacs of clinging gorse then at last spring heard creak louder timber be breaking beneath foot at same moment heard half stifled cry saw face be be face there be breathless instant of bewildered
