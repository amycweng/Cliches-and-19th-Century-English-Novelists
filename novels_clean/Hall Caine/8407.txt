receiving discharge for officer of hospital presenting weekly report on morning in august matron report have closed with startling item recommended immediate suspension of nurse on ground of gross impropriety of conduct usual course in such case be for board of hospital to depute matron to act for in private chairman in instance be peppery person with stern mouth solid under jaw be most serious matter said think being public institution really think board must investigate case for ought to assure that in fact other irregularity be going on in hospital may please lordship said rotund voice from one of side table must suggest that case like of grievous moral delinquency come directly within dispensation of chaplain if have done duty by unhappy girl a doubt have must have statement to make to board with regard to be canon wealthy may mention added that mr storm have now returned to duty be at present in hospital send for said chairman when john storm entered board room be remarked that looked better for holiday cheek be thinner eye more hollow there be strange pallor under swarthy skin business be explained to be asked if have statement to make with regard to nurse whom matron have reported for suspension said have statement do mean to tell board said chairman that know nothing of matter that case be too trivial for attention perhaps that have never even spoken to girl on subject be so never have said john then will do so now said chairman put hand on bell beside messenger appeared can not intend sir to examine girl here said john why not before so many of men save one surely matron canon rose to foot again young brother be naturally sensitive lord assure delicate feeling be wasted on girl like forgets that shame lie in girl sin not in just necessary punishment bring in said chairman matron whispered to messenger left room pardon sir said john storm if be expectation must question nurse on sin a canon say can not do so can not well will not be that idea of duty a chaplain be matron duty not chaplain to matron matron be parish sir parish great public institution be in danger of disgraceful scandal who be responsible for spiritual welfare really gentleman again canon rose with conciliatory smile think understand young friend said lordship hoard will appreciate feeling however may disapprove of judgment what generous heart can not sympathize with sensitive spirit of youthful clergyman who shrink from spectacle of guilt shame in young perhaps beautiful woman if will relieve lordship from embarrassing position be willing thank said chairman then girl be brought into room in charge of sister allworthy be holding head down trying to cover face with hand name girl said canon mary elizabeth love faltered be aware mary elizabeth love that excellent indulgent matron here bowed to stout lady who sat in open space have be put to painful duty of reporting for suspension be equivalent to immediate discharge now can not hold out hope that board will not ratify recommendation may perhaps qualify term of 'character ' if can show gentleman that unhappy lapse from good conduct brings to position of shame disgrace be due in measure to irregularity practised perhaps within hospital to temptation of one connected with girl began to cry speak nurse if have anything to say gentleman be willing to hear girl cry deepened into sob useless said chairman impossible said canon one suggested that perhaps nurse have girl friend in hospital who must throw light on difficult situation then sister allworthy whispered to matron who said bring

place by side of when religious have gathered in church be seen that three of stall be vacant brother paul brother andrew father minister service have hardly begun when bell be heard to ring again with louder clangour than before whereupon religious concluded that brother andrew have awakened from sleep be remembering with remorse belated duty be father minister silent severe person have oftentimes rebuked lay brother for sleepiness morning have be overcome by same infirmity awakening suddenly little after six by watch that hung by bed have thought that lazy fellow be late again will teach lesson leaping to foot monk sleep in habit have hastened to bell rung furiously then snatched up taper hurried down stair to light candle in church when appeared at sacristy door with lighted taper in hand confusion on face brother understood everything at glance not even solemnity of service must smother snufflings of laughter incident be trivial one diverted attention for time from fact of paul absence when religious went back to house found brother andrew returned to old duty a doorkeeper laughter be renewed there be playful banter monk be so far child that least thing happening in
