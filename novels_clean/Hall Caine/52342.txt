quadrangle ascended many flight of stair until reached chancellor room in highest roof where droning murmur in court below must be only faintly heard clear voice of muezzin struck level with face when came out of minaret near by sent into upper air north south east west call to evening prayer have hardly entered silent room with thick carpet on slippered foot made noise when chancellor came to

england in egypt oh peace son said chancellor ishmael ameer be mahdi claim divinity then tell o sheikh said gordon tell what ishmael ameer be may know what to do when becomes duty to deal with leisurely chancellor took snuff leisurely opened folded handkerchief dusted nostril then in soft voice said ishmael ameer be koranist be to say one who take koran a basis of belief keep open mind about tradition know said gordon have people like among christian people who take bible a basis of faith turn back on dogma ishmael ameer read koran by spirit not letter have people like too letter killeth know spirit maketh alive ishmael ameer think islam must advance with advancing progress there again be with o sheikh have people of same kind in christianity ishmael ameer think slavery seclusion of woman divorce polygamy be a much opposed to teaching of mohammed a to progress of society excellent father say same thing wallahi assure rather hold that islam can never take place a religion of great progressive nation until rids of evil ishmael ameer think corruption of islam be work of partisan of old barbaric idea who be associating cause of religion with own interest passion splendid do know consul general be always saying that sir ishmael ameer belief that if god will praise be to exalted one day be not distant when appeal to prophet own word will regenerate islam banish caliph sultan whose selfishness sensuality keep in bondage to power of darkness really said gordon rising impetuously to foot if ishmael ameer say be man egypt india whole mohammedan world be waiting for wonder men like cadi be trying to destroy though be only instinct of self preservation father consul general what be there in to create why must such teaching set moslem against christian ishmael ameer o brother chancellor continued with same soft voice think islam be not only faith have departed from spirit of founder true if islam for handmaiden have divorce polygamy christianity have drunkenness prostitution doubt certainly coming out of east out of desert ishmael ameer see in christianity of west contradiction of principle for great master fought suffered gordon sat down again be religion of peace while christian church prays for unity concord among nation christian state be daily increasing instrument of destruction be religion of poverty while christian priest be saying 'blessed be meek christian community be struggling for wealth trampling upon poor in effort to gain ishmael ameer belief that if great master came back now must not recognise in civilisation known by name true posterity of little church founded on shore of lake of galilee be true too true said gordon yet under doe ishmael ameer see under that ishmael ameer see said chancellor that what be known to world a christian civilisation be little better than organised hypocrisy lust of empire in nation greed of gold in men destroying liberty morality truth therefore warns follower against civilisation come to east with religion in one hand violence avarice in other surely see said gordon what christian civilisation have done for world what science have done for progress what england for example have done for egypt ishmael ameer think replied chancellor in same slow soft voice that essential quality of national greatness be moral not material that man doe not live by bread alone that be of

be threescore ten year when egypt review past look back on threescore ten century there be silence for moment during muezzin voice be heard again calling first hour of night then gordon visibly agitated said think ishmael ameer regenerator reformer redeemer of islam if preaching prevailed must send grand cadi back to sultan be that so chancellor made reply must also send england out of egypt must said gordon still chancellor gave sign must go farther than perhaps must drive western civilisation out of east must that be end of said gordon then chancellor replied must drive corrupt ungodly civilisation out of world son see said gordon think mission of ishmael ameer transcends egypt transcends even europe say to humanity in general 'what call civilisation be killing religion because nation christian moslem alike have sold to lust of empire greed of gold ' be that what mean chancellor bowed grave head in scarcely audible voice said yes think too said gordon whose breathing be now quick loud that ishmael ameer be apostle of soul of islam perhaps of soul of religion without respect of creed one of great men who come once in hundred year to call world back from squalid sordid materialism be ready to live aye to die for faith savonarola luther gamal ed deens perhaps mohammed dropping voice in sense christ egyptian soul like mirage of egyptian desert recedes a be approached again chancellor made reply tell o sheikh said gordon rising to go if ishmael ameer came to cairo must permit to preach in el azhar be alim doctor of koran must not prevent must lodge in own house yes

course of day greeting to general love to daughter gordon in spite of brave tone of letter be not without certain uneasiness a rode across to father house must have acted otherwise thought then recalling helena hint of something else be intended must do told that father be being deceived did not know what be doing first of must tell truth at cost truth thought firm resolution be little moment entered garden home atmosphere began to creep upon when ibrahim father egyptian servant told that mother who have be le well since went away be keeping bed that morning shadow of domestic trouble seemed to banish stalwart purpose bounding upstairs three step at time called in cheery voice at mother door almost before faint half frightened answer came back to be in room pale faced old lady in nightdress be in arm knew be said then with thin moist hand clasped about neck head against breast began in plaintive hesitating voice a if be afraid of own son to warn reprove understand what be happening dear must never let anybody poison mind against father may be little hard sometimes be not denying that then be not to be judged like other men be really not know must cut off right hand if thought have done wrong be very tender to love love dear want to do so much for be pitiful to hear last night gordon ' feel a if enemy have stolen own son said own son own son kept saying until must have cried must sleep for thinking of wo let anybody poison mind against father promise wo dear gordon comforted kissed rallied laughed felt for moment a if have come back a traitor to destroy happiness of home fatimah followed out of room winking to keep back tear whispered disconnected story of what have happened on day on father received letter oh eye soul be sad must hear footstep in bedroom night long sometimes be speaking to 'the scoundrel 'they know what shame be 'have have enough now too son son ' gordon went downstairs with slow heavy step felt a if everything be conspiring to make abandon purpose why ca leave thing alone thought just a reached hall egyptian prime minister who be going out of house passed in front of without seeing certain sinister look in man sallow face wiped out in instant softening effect of scene upstairs take care thought tell truth happens when entered library expected father to fly out at old man be very quiet sit down will be ready in moment said continued to write without raising eye gordon saw that father face be more than usually furrowed severe voice seemed to say to be afraid so walked over to window tried to look at glistening water of nile red wedge of pyramid across river well received letter said old man after moment be nonsensical reason gave for not doing duty be brusque tone have always taken with secretary when be in wrong be blunder to adopt with gordon who flushed up to forehead wheeled round from window walked up to desk said beginning little hesitatingly gathering strength a went on reason father for not doing what be sent to do be merely that found must not do without being rascal fool old man flinched glass fell explain said came to conclusion sir that be mistaken in matter really possibly misinformed indeed by british official who know what be talking about by native scoundrel who for forty year have anybody in egypt spoken to consul general like only said stand there like parson in pulpit sit down tell about whereupon gordon took seat by desk only riot witnessed in alexandria sir be due simply to bad feeling always exists between lowest element of european egyptian inhabitant ishmael ameer have nothing to do with on contrary helped to put down heard what have said in mosque have one of sermon reported to sir be teaching such a must have have own sympathy being in line with what have always said about corruption of islam necessity of uplifting egyptian woman a mean of raising egyptian man so decided seems decided father that to arrest ishmael ameer a one who be promulgating sedition inciting people to rebellion must be act of injustice must not wish to perpetrate in name consul general put up glass looked for letter lay on desk glanced at said see say that before arrived in alexandria be known that be to come be so sir that after riot counselled governor to consent to man request that must preach in public did sir thought must be good experiment to try effect of little moral influence of course experiment be justified perfectly justified people dispersed quietly there have not be single arrest since have battalion of soldier on spot have be only right to be ready for emergency old man laughed bitterly be surprised at see how have be hoodwinked man be warned of coming warned from cairo from el azhar find be so foolish a to visit before left for alexandria everything be prepared for trick eastern trick be so simple a to be taken in be ashamed of ashamed of before servant secretary gordon coloured up to flickering steel blue eye said father must ask to begin by remembering that be no longer child not quite simpleton know egyptian know better than people put together better than father perhaps yes sir better than father because because love whereas have hated from first have never deceived yet sir with permission be not going to deceive passionate word be hotly almost aggressively spoken in unfathomable depth of father heart old man be proud of son at moment strong fearless right sermon in public be that also on corruption of islam sir be about spirit of world greed of wealth be making people forget in day that true welfare of nation be moral not material anything else yes hope of time when world will have so far progressed towards peace that arm will be laid down redeemer will come to proclaim universal brotherhood did strike a ridiculous to see one unlettered man trying to efface law of civilised society asking sensible people to turn back on fact of life in order to live in spiritual hothouse of dream father did not strike a ridiculous because because what what now because john baptist jesus christ did precisely same thing there be silence for moment then old man said in golden age be to come predicts be told peculiar place for egypt be that so yes sir hold that in commonwealth of world egypt by reason of geographical position will become interpreter peacemaker between east west that be what have lived so long for yet did occur to that be sedition in most seductive form that man who promulgated be probably most dangerous of demagogue worst of egyptian who prate about native governing english being usurping foreigner sir did occur to at because felt that moslem people have right to own ideal also because thought well well that man who imago that soul of nation can be governed by sword whoever be king kaiser czar be worst of tyrant old autocrat flinched visibly scene be becoming tragic to for forty year have be fighting enemy have beaten now suddenly own son be standing up a foe after moment of silence rose said with stony gravity very well having heard view on ishmael ameer incidentally on have hitherto attempted to do in egypt only remains to to tell intend to do now know that man be coming on to cairo gordon bowed be probably aware that be intended that will preach at el azhar did know that sir be not surprised to hear well el azhar have to be closed before arrives closed be what said closed shut up student professor turned into street there be sixteen thousand of from part of mohammedan world sir be why press a medium of disaffection be bad enough el azhar be worse be hotbed of rebellion word spoken there go a by wireless telegraphy over egypt be secret society a such must be stopped have reflected do do anything without reflection closed say university mosque of mosque be impossible be trifling with have taken leave of sens sir beg pardon father only wish to prevent from doing something will never cease to regret be dangerous work to touch religious belief of eastern people know that sir better than do if shut up university holy of holy shake foundation of society be like shutting up st peter in rome st paul in london event have happened said old man resuming seat father beg of to beware trust know people christian nation nowadays belief in christianity a moslem believe in islam care enough for faith to fight for dusky million will die for religion then there be ishmael ameer must see for what manner of man be careless alike of comfort fame fanatic if like have only to call to people will follow wealth well being have bestowed on will go to wind will follow to man consul general lip curled again said quietly ask to believe at word of man without penny with head full of worthless noise blue shirted fellah will leave comfortable home land aye wife child too everything have ever hope to have if promise nothing danger death more will go to then must deal with also ca ca do anything with man like man who want nothing be afraid of nothing except kill ca do consul general did not reply immediately coming closer gordon began to plead with father believe know what be saying be blind to storm be brewing so undo good have ever done for egypt sake england own let damnable scoundrel like grand cadi prime minister play on like pipe be gordon who have blundered now consequence be cruel ruthless saturnine old man rose again on square hewn face there be icy smile brings said speaking very slowly from what have done to what must do ulema of el azhar have received order to close university went to morning through president of council who be acting a regent in absence of khedive if refuse to go will be duty to turn out mine yours governor of city commandant of police will go with where sixteen thousand student disaffected population have to be dealt with military will be required if have brought ishmael ameer back from alexandria step might have be unnecessary now instead of one man may have to arrest hundred if resist will know will in case will be tried by special tribunal a person assaulting member of british army of occupation be dispatched without delay to soudan surely ulema be required to signify assent by to morrow morning be to meet at citadel at four in afternoon will probably be required to be there father left something to discretion before hoping to give opportunity of distinguishing in eye of england in case order will be definite only duty will be to obey will not permit to will do for present be busy good day gordon went out dazed dumbfounded saw nothing of ibrahim who handed linen covered cap in hall of page boy at porch who gave rein held down stirrup when came back to consciousness be riding by side of nile where bridge be open number of boat with white sail like flight of great sea gull be sweeping through at next moment be at entrance to own quarter found white motor car standing there be be car leaping from saddle went bounding up stair chapter xviii helena with anxious perplexed face be at door talking to soldier servant at next instant be in other arm trouble be gone smile seemed to light up room more than wealth of sunlight nothing else be of smallest consequence after moment drew out letter said told father be back dictated message to be going to send by adc asked to be allowed to bring consented here be dear gordon opened read general letter be formal request that must be in attendance at citadel at four following day to receive urgent important instruction know what refers to helena yes know answered look of

always told that sooner later that man must come between ishmael yes last night father said hate to mention tell dear tell said must marry man who have disobeyed be degraded ' meaning that if refused to obey order perhaps by arrangement between father mine maybe be what understood to mean dear therefore came to see flushed crimson for moment then began to laugh will never believe that of must be monstrous impossible questioning look in helena eye remained tried to reassure so many thing might happen to remove difficulty altogether ulema might take order of government a protest against visit of ishmael ameer send instruction not to come to cairo be here already dear said helena a drove down from citadel have passed through crowd of native coming from direction of railway station one have said be procession in honour of new prophet who have just arrived from alexandria then have seen helena saw man in white dress on white camel did look at have somebody else to think about be carried away by singleness of love with score of passionate expression kissed beautiful white hand did best to comfort never mind dear be afraid governor of el azhar may agree to close door temporarily at event anyhow will muddle through somehow made promise not to go near new mahdi then began to draw on long yellow driving glove suppose gossip of cairo must be shocked if knew have come to see said be not first time have be here though be here always see said with arm about waist took round room to look at portrait that hung on wall be helena here helena there helena everywhere since be first time real helena have visited quarter must drink health there must only drink in water when have done so have to slip off glove again dip finger into same glass that might drink own health a well in spite of shadow of trouble hung over be very happy world of warm impulse coursed through vein must hardly permit to part be sweet to stand by window again look down at dazzling nile for old river flowed for sang sleepy song looked into other eye smiled without speaking be just a if heart saw other be satisfied at length clasped arm about neck felt warm glow of body think that still gordon what dearest love be above everything everything in world whispered then kissed of herself nothing else mattered nothing on earth in heaven chapter xix when helena have gone air of room seemed to be more dumb empty than have ever be before bell of telephone rang immediately hafiz spoke to hafiz have just heard from uncle that ulema be to meet at eight o'clock to consider what course ought to adopt chancellor be in favour of submission to superior force of colleague of reactionary party old stick in mud made in mecca not being able to believe government must be in earnest be advocating revolt

can be sure can let call for at eight will go up together ca see why must wait ishmael ameer be in cairo will be there think know must think very likely well ca be helped eight o'clock then by bye said gordon with rang off wrote to helena telling what be going to do be going to break word to again be only in interest of peace with hope of preventing trouble suppose people can influence hair breadth dearest wrote above all be angry at eight o'clock hafiz came for dressed in mufti walked up to university with more than usual ceremony be taken to chancellor room in roof there in tense electrical atmosphere ulema be already assembled group of eight nine rugged unkempt creature in farageeyahs loose grey robe like of monk squatting on divan about wall member of board of el azhar be present only stranger there except be ishmael ameer who sat in spotless white dress with solemn face on chair beside door in silence with many sweeping salaam from floor to forehead gordon be received by company at request of chancellor explained object of visit be not official be scarcely proper be intended to do good there be moment when passion being excited there be serious risk of collision between governor governed be one of rightly wrongly consul general be convinced that university of cairo be likely to become centre of sedition must not agree to close for time at event at electrical atmosphere of room broke into rumbling of thunder order of government be outrage on mohammedan religion england have pledged to respect el azhar be one of three holy place of islamic world to close be to take bread of life from moslem government might a well cut throat at once have done with said one from denouncing order of government ulema went on to denounce government be eating people be like wolf trying to devour be to be body soul under heel of infidel asked after that denounced lord nuneham be slave of power be drunk with strong drink of authority university be voice have deprived of other now be trying to strike dumb when somebody remembering that be speaking before consul general son suggested that if be doing bad act might be with good conscience alim with injured eye malignant face cried by allah man who usurps place of god becomes devil be what nuneham be long have be listening to violence gordon have found taking father part at moment anger have risen so high that be struggling against impulse to take unkempt creature by throat fling out of room when soft voice of chancellor began to plead for peace mohammed to be prayer peace always yielded to superior force who be that must be too proud to follow example at that reactionary party became louder fiercer than before prophet cried one have commanded not to seek war not to begin have also told that if war be waged against islam be to resist under penalty of being a unbeliever to follow up who assail without pity without remorse therefore if english close holy el azhar will be waging war on religion by most high god win fight to last man woman child at instant hafiz who have be trembling in obscure seat by door rose to foot said in nervous voice addressing uncle eminence may say something speak son of sister said chancellor be about colonel lord said hafiz if refuse to close el azhar order to force to do so will be issued to military colonel lord will be required to carry into effect well be friend of muslemeen eminence if resist will be compelled to kill must be well to say 'with god permission ' said man with injured eye whereupon hafiz wheeled round on answered hotly have bayonet have courage if fight there wo be so much a rat among will be left alive there be moment of tense breathless silence then hafiz now a nervous a before said quietly on other hand if refuse to obey order

in tear in fervent prayer night long in mosque until light shine on door of hope have opened chapter xx a gordon returned to barrack air of native section of city seemed to tingle with excitement dirty unpaved street with overhanging tenement be thronged framed portrait of ishmael ameer with candle burning in front of be standing on counter of nearly cafe men squatting on bench about be chanting koran one man generally blind man with right hand before ear must be reciting text at close of surah others must cry allah allah in densest quarter where street be narrowest most full of rut house most wretched window most covered with cobweb company of dervish be walking in procession bearing ragged banner singing weird arab music to accompaniment of pipe drum while boy parading beside be carrying tin lamp open flare before certain of house stopped for minute swayed body to increasing chorus of allah allah allah gordon saw what have happened with coming of new teacher wave of religious feeling have swept over city dam up suddenly what scene of fanatical frenzy might not occur back in room with window down to shut out noise from river bridge tried to come to conclusion a to what ought to do following day if ulema decided to resist must resist have doubt about for where men be under influence of gust of religious passion might call on god god answer be always same if ulema be to decide not to close sacred place must intend to die in defence of seeing issue from moslem point of view that el azhar be centre of spiritual life gordon concluded that must be justified in resisting if be justified order to evict must be wicked act of eviction must be crime ca do told ca wo firm resolve relieved for moment then began to ask must happen if refused to obey bad work must be done same for somebody else must do what then will be result thought first result must be that must suffer must be tried for insubordination of course degraded punished a man might be in right a soldier must be in wrong thought of hard fought fight of honour have won head went round in whirl next result must be that must bring disgrace upon father a well refusal to obey order must become known if consequence expected must come to pas must seem to stand up a first of father accuser father only son must be mean of condemning in eye of england of europe of world in old age too after have done for egypt then above there be helena general must side with consul general helena must be required to cast in lot with father with if sided with must have to break with father if sided with

restless pain threw open window river bridge be quiet by time through breathless night air there came music of waltz be last dance of visiting season at hotel near by number of british officer be dancing on edge of volcano gordon shut window again threw on bed at length problem tormented seemed to resolve into one issue father did not realise that moslem must die rather than give up possession of holy place that in order to turn out of must have to destroy slaughter man must not outrage most sacred of human feeling without being morally blind to what be doing father be great man thousand time greater than must ever hope to be in case be blind somebody have to open eye will go bring to reason thought may insult if like matter last cab have rattled home street be silent when gordon reached entrance to agency then saw that be late for house be in darkness not even window of library showed light moon be full looked at watch good heaven be two o'clock house dog heard footstep on gravel path barked bounded towards then recognising began to snuffle to lick hand at same moment light appeared in upper window be window of mother room at sight of resolution began to ebb away be once more seized with uncertainty strife between father must extinguish last ray of mother flickering life must see looking at with pleading frightened eye be really going to kill mother that too

whisper ah well said old lady after listening for moment then fatimah put out light went back to bed god bless boy said tremulous voice in darkness after there be sigh then silence save for hollow thud of footstep in adjoining room chapter xxii before gordon be out of bed next morning hafiz rang up on telephone have just heard from uncle chancellor that a result of night long deliberation prayer ulema have decided to ask consul general to receive ishmael ameer listen to suggestion what will be asked gordon that government must leave el azhar alone on condition that ulema consent to open mosque connected with to public police inspection so a to dissipate suspicion that be centre of sedition splendid to make mosque a free a christian church be splendid thought inspiration if government will not agree what then then order to close el azhar will be resisted 'only over dead body say soldier enter ' gordon went about work that morning like man dazed dumb after lunch dressed carefully in full staff uniform with aiguilette hanging from left shoulder gold crimson sash sword white be spiked helmet put on medal decoration distinguished service order king south african war

faculty reason be clogged idea be obscure must not see hear properly passing sentry in lodge by gate did not notice man bewildered stare acknowledge abbreviated salute whole event of last hour have overwhelmed a with terrible darkness in darkness plodded on until came into street dense with people clamorous with noise of eastern city clapping of water carrier cry of lemonade seller braying of donkey ruckling of camel where be going asked at one moment when remembered that be going back to quarter for be what have be ordered to do that might be under arrest in due course tried by court martial told that have be tried condemned punished already at thought though clouded obscure bit lip until bled muttered can not go back to quarter will not at next moment certain helplessness came over up from deep place where strongest man be a child by pathetic instinct keep boy alive in to last dark day of life in hour of death came desire to go home to mother when thought of mother pleading voice a begged to keep peace with father then by juggling twist of torturing memory of first evening after return to egypt when wore medal fingered on breast with pride that queen ever have in jewel in crown said to can never go home again mind be oscillating among agonising thought when became aware that be walking in esbekiah district european quarter of cairo where ooze of gutter of city be flung up under public eye there under open piazza containing line of drinking place in atmosphere be thick with tobacco smoke reek of alcohol babel of many tongue striking of match popping of cork sat down at table called for glass of brandy brandy seemed to clear faculty for moment aimless wandering thought began to concentrate then scene in general office came back to drawing of sword from scabbard breaking of across knee throwing of wretched fragment at foot ripping away of medal trampling of under foot hideous memory of so illegal so un english made blood to boil when beaten brain swung back to scene in have won honour at risk of life omdurman ladysmith pretoria rank injustice have suffered almost stifled with rage swore struck table anger be against general not against father of whom have hardly thought at cruellest agony passed through came at moment when wrath rose against helena a thought of became dizzy brain reeled with dance of idea in picture lasted longer than instant emotion must stay at one moment be seeing a saw first with big eye black a sloe joyous smile be one of greatest charm arched brow silken lash gleam of celestial fire go yet came into look then quickening pulse thrill passed through mysterious voice whispered be without knowing groaned aloud a thought of ruin have come to at next moment be in midst of memory memory of future a have imagined must be be to be married soon then realising one of dream of life be to visit america for mother blood called to to go there to see great new world yes above to stand with helena quivering hand in on rock at plymouth where handful of fearless men woman have landed on bleak hungry coast afraid of fate for god be with in two short century have peopled vast continent created one of mightiest empire of earth remembering a vanished dream wretched soul be on edge of vortex of madness laughed outright with laugh shivered air around then be conscious that somebody be speaking to be young girl in gaudy silk dress with pasty face lip painted very red eyebrow darkened flower in full bosom be covered with transparent lace little satchel swinging on wrist overdoing bit have dear said in french smiled at poor sidelong smile out of crushed crumpled soul at same moment became aware that three men at table behind be winking at girl joking at expense one of little fat american jew with puffy cheek chewing end of cigar be saying guess man have use for hat in climate like sun so soft only ninety nine in shade whereupon englishman with ripped ragged mouth miscellaneous nose half pug half roman answered be hanging up on nail by breast of coat too bet putting hand to hair looking down at torn cloth of tunic gordon realised for first time that be bareheaded having left helmet at citadel to unclean consciousness of people about be drunk at moment started up suddenly coming into collision with american who be swinging on back leg of chair sent sprawling on ground where yelled here say blazing third man at table dragoman in fez whispered hush know that gentleman leave alone sir please let go with heart soul aflame gordon walked away intending to take first cab came along then forgetting to do so one wild thought now took possession of expelled other thought must go back to citadel accuse general of gross injustice must say what meant to say when stood by door a be going out general must hear must by must brandy be working in brain by time in blind leading of passion everything happened on way seemed to fortify resolve street of native city be now surging with people a submerged mine surge with water run through knew where be going be going to el azhar when came to great mosque have to fight way through crowd be coming from opposite direction with turbaned head of very tall man showing conspicuously in midst of multitude who be chanting verse from koran cry in chorus la ilaha illa llah at sight of procession knowing what meant that moslem be going to doomed place to defend to die thousand confused form danced before gordon eye impatience to reach citadel became feverish began to run again at foot of hill on fortress stand be kept back time be by troop of cavalry who be trotting hard towards el azhar saw deputy macdonald with blotchy face monocle be seen by one in crush be almost ridden down citadel when reached seemed to be deserted even sentry standing with back to in sentry box a hurried through there be nobody in square of mosque yet at gate to general garden be open door of house when came to be open too with hot blood in head teeth compressed nostril quivering burst into general office came face to face with old soldier a be rising from sofa thus in blind swirl of circumstance two men met at moment when heart of be full of hatred for other be brave men of never for one instant have of known what be to feel afraid be not afraid now have loved other once up from what deep place in soul god alone can say there came wave of feeling fought with hate general no longer wanted to punish gordon only that gordon must go away while gordon rage be to have thundered at general broke into agonising cry what be doing here did order to quarter do wish to put under close arrest get off not yet have to settle account first have behaved like tyrant tyrant be only word for if be guilty of insubordination be guilty of outrage have right to arrest to order must be court martialled what right have to condemn before be tried punish before be sentenced before after what right have to break sword tear off medal degradation be obsolete in british army what right have to degrade before father too before helena what right have leave house instantly leave leave said general voice coming thick hoarse not till hear what have come to tell said gordon then repeated threat who know on what inherited cell of brain imprinted father have made forty year before have come to tell that will go back to quarter will court martial to morrow if dare before england may know by what be done to night refused to obey order because be soldier not murderer if never know cried in breaking voice try condemn degrade even to rank will get up again do hear will get up again win back have lost more until be own master will have to obey general face became scarlet lifting hand a if to strike gordon cried in choking voice go before do something gordon in delirium of rage heard nothing except sound of own quivering voice more than that said will win back helena be mine have separated from broken heart a well a own be that act of father of robber tyrant will come back to when be dead in grave will be together because stop stop say general unable to command longer have snatched up broken sword from floor be making for gordon a if to smite stand away be old man be not coward drop by god general losing utterly flung on gordon with broken sword voice gone in husky growl breath coming in hoarse gust struggle be short terrible gordon in strength of young manhood first laid hold of general by upper part of breast to keep off then feeling that hand be wounded gripped at old man throat with finger clung like claw at next moment snatched sword from general at same instant with delirious laugh flung man away general fell heavily with deep groan gurgling cry gordon with contemptuous gesture threw broken sword on floor then with growl of wild creature turned to go fight must eh kill perhaps have settled account at last have hearing answer turned at door to look back saw general lying where have fallen outstretched still at sight breath seemed to go out of body at one gasp head turned giddy red gleam of sunset be deflected into room appeared to half blind eye to cover everything with blood chapter xxix gordon stood with mouth open brute sense struck out of by dead silence then said get up why get up hardly knowing what be saying got answer horrible idea began to take shape in mind though so hot moment ago shivered teeth began to chatter looked around for moment in dazed way of man awakening from nightmare then stepped up on tiptoe to where general lay raising head looked at found hard to believe that what vaguely feared have happened there be sign of injury anywhere eye be open looked fixedly at with so fierce stare that seemed to jump out of socket stunned that be stunned by fall thought seeing bottle of brandy on shelf of desk got up poured little into medicine glass then kneeling lifting general head again forced liquor through tightly compressed lip ran out a went in with gathering fear fumbling finger gordon unbuttoned general frock coat laid trembling hand over heart at one moment thought felt beat at next knew be only throb of own pulse at that world seemed for moment to be blotted out when came to again be holding general in arm calling to general general speak to for god sake speak to in torrent of remorse be kissing general forehead cry over face there be response then great trembling shook whole body dropping head gently back to floor rose to foot general be dead knew have seen death hundred time before only on battlefield amid boom of cannon wail of shell snap of rifle oath of men now filled with terror silence be awful minute ago general have be living man face to face with room have be ringing with clashing of voice now breathless hush paralysing stillness in very air seemed to be dead for something be gone a by stroke of almighty hand there be nothing left motionless figure at foot what have done asked when told that in headstrong wrath have killed man head spun round round who have refused to obey order because must not commit murder be guilty of murder what devil out of hell have ordered thing so that a very consequence of refusing to commit crime have become criminal god have pity upon tell be not true thought knew be true when told that man have killed be general pain increased tenfold general have loved favoured be proud of upheld never down to coming of trouble have friendship be darkened by cloud oh forgive god forgive thought in blind misery hardly saw yet for what be impulse came to to carry burden of sin too heavy for to helena that might help to bear have taken step towards door leading to room when struck a blow on brain that be daughter of dead man be going to for comfort after killing father at thought stopped laid hold of desk for support being so weak that must scarcely keep on leg remembered helena love for general how much of young life have given to how quarrel have divided from have come of determination not to leave father a long a lived now have killed bead of sweat started from forehead after moment told that if must not expect comfort from helena be duty to comfort to break news to saw doing so helena listen dear be brave what be father be be dead dead worse thousandfold worse be murdered murdered be in heat of blood man did know what be doing who be who be see helena be have turned again to door leading to helena room when blow from invisible hand seemed to fall upon saw helena eye fixed on face in intensity of hate heard voice driving away go let never see again be more than must bear staggering to sofa sat down minute passed red glow in room deepened to dull brown at one moment there be groan in gathering gloom heard looked up there be nobody there then realised that be who have groaned at moment mind occupied with lesser thing saw that one finger of left hand be badly wounded bound up in handkerchief then looked at in mirror hung on wall in front of sofa must not see face distinctly eye nose mouth being blurred did not attempt to escape never for instant did occur to to run away sun went down behind black pyramid across nile after while dead silence of evening of eastern day be broken by multitudinous cry of muezzin came up from city below like deep ground swell on rugged coast after gordon knelt again by general body trying to believe be not dead eye be still open light have gone out of seeing stony stare thought came to that general soul be with in room stupor of sens have suddenly given way to supernatural acuteness at one moment imagined felt touch of hand on shoulder at next instant be plainly conscious of door opening closing in inner part of house of light rapid footstep approaching knew what have occurred helena have be out on terrace in parade ground have just come back be now in next room breathing hard a if have be running must hear rustling of skirt soft step a walked towards door of general office at next moment there came knock gordon held breath made answer then father in tremulous voice full of fear a if helena knew what have happened still gordon made reply frightened voice came again be alone now may come in then gordon felt impulse to throw door open confess everything saying did helena did intend to do threw upon flung off fell be truth a god be witness must not do because be afraid who have never before known fear who have stood in firing line when horde of savage men have galloped down with fanatical cry be trembling now at thought of meeting woman face so treading softly stole out of room by outer door door leading to gate a closed behind felt that door of hope also be now for ever closed between helena going through garden have to pas arbour at sight of loved spot wave of tender

made lame excuse for leaving post for few minute while egyptian be in general office sentry at gate of citadel who said one have come in after colonel macdonald cavalry have passed out then question of calling herself be promptly quashed by consul general inquiry closed hardly have black boy delivered last of message when there be timid knock at helena door army surgeon came into room be small man with uneasy manner married with family of grown up girl who be understood to be cause of anxiety to regret deeply regret to tell miss graf that father death have be due to heart failure result of undue excitement will do justice be sure will do justice to remember that repeatedly warned general of danger of over exciting unfortunately temperament be such consul general deep voice in adjoining room seemed to interrupt surgeon making visible call on resolution came closer to helena said have not mentioned previous knowledge of organic trouble lord nuneham asked searching question promise made to father again consul general voice interrupted with flicker of fear on face said now that thing have turned out so unhappily might perhaps be awkward for if in short dear miss graf think may rely on not to oh thank thank said a helena understanding anxiety bowed head thought must relieve to receive assurance that death be due to natural cause only purely natural be true thought for moment that perhaps there have also be violence violence said helena let alarm be only passing impression must be sorry very sorry just at moment when new thought be passing through stormy night of helena mind like shaft of deadly lightning chaplain of force came into room surgeon left chaplain be well nurtured person who talked comfort out of full stomach with expansiveness sometimes come to clergy who live long amongst soldier have come to say dear young lady place entirely at service with permission will charge with sad necessary duty so sudden so unexpected how true in midst of life be in death there be more coin from same mint then shaft of deadly lightning a before be perhaps saddest fact of death in eastern climate burial follows so closely after a there seems to be sufficient reason to believe that general death have be due to natural cause will probably be to morrow say will probably sufficient said helena with new poison at heart hurried away to father room found general where have placed on own bed in uniform eye be now closed feature be composed everything about be suggestive of peaceful end while be standing in gloomy echoless chamber consul general came in stood beside though faintly simulated natural composure be deeply shaken for moment looked down at dead friend in silence while eyelid blinked lip trembled then took helena hand drawing aside said be blow to of child to be great terrible one did not reply stood with dry eye looking straight before have made strict inquiry be satisfied entirely satisfied that father died by visitation of god still did not speak after moment spoke again be true that man ishmael ameer be last to be with what happened at interview must be useless to ask dangerous perhaps in present state of public feeling listened with complete self possession strong hold of feeling though bosom heaved breathing be audible so let put away painful thought helena after father end be enviable one harder for than for know looked steadily for moment at averted face then said in husky voice be sorry lady nuneham be so much of invalid that can not come to see be moment when mother stopped without finishing what have intended to say then said be still more sorry that one who again stopped then in low smothered scarcely audible voice said hurriedly be over now good night child god help helena be standing where consul general

be to take care of lady while mosie be away then have run back fast very fast be too late be over will lady ever forgive mosie will lady like mosie more helena comforted little twisted tortured soul with word of cheer then sent to bed with sad longing in big eye look of dumb creature wanted to lick hand came back to say must not sleep in own room because death be in house might sit on floor where lady be keep company touched by tender bit of human nature be tearing big little soul of black boy who worshipped helena went back to own bedroom then grin of delight passed over mosie ugly face said never mind be thing lady will forget about to morrow now lady will lie down sleep helena put out light in room sitting by open window looked long into moonlight lay over city at one moment heard clatter of horse hoof macdonald cavalry be returning to citadel after effort in interest of peace order at interval heard ghafirs watchman who cried wahhed god be one in silent street below constantly looked across to barrack stood at edge of glistening nile at moment cruel core in heart grew yet more hard why have not gordon come to must know of father death by time why be not there why have not written to at event be true have parted in anger what of have never loved must be with now have done well to drive away from thank god must never see again moon died out cold breath passed through air

taken beloved father loved be always so proud of thought there be nobody like try to think how happened at end can not forgive for what said yesterday seems be right about everything everybody else be wrong doe matter now nothing matter want have nobody else be quite alone god help come to soon unconsciously be speaking word aloud a wrote sobbing a spoke suddenly became aware of voice in adjoining room thought might be gordon voice catching breath rose to listen then in muffled broken tear laden tone word came to through wall o allah most high most merciful make lady sleep make lady sleep o allah most high most merciful black boy have be lying night like dog on mat behind door chapter v before gordon opened eye that morning heard tinkling of cymbal sweet sound of voice of boy singing in choir felt for moment a if be carried back to school at eton where morning dawned on green field to joyous carolling of bird then looked saw that be lying in little yellow curtained room be full of gentle ray of early sun opened on to garden in quiet courtyard with one date tree in middle facade of christian church at opposite side in disarray of sens must not at first remember what have happened to said aloud where be then cheery voice by side said ah be awake elderly man with good simple homely face looked down at smiled what place be asked gordon said good man be house of coptic

hand finding be closely bandaged gave pain be easily pushed back to pillow lie still until surgeon come michael have gone for will be here immediately good man make sure about will be secret will say nothing then there came through open window sound of footstep on gravel path of garden old patriarch leaning over gordon said in same husky kindly whisper be coming must go into church be afraid did bravely nobly harm will come to while be here hardly knowing what to understand choking with confusion shame gordon heard old man shuffling step going out of room moment afterwards firm tread of surgeon coming into surgeon who be middle aged man copt with bright face hearty manner took gordon right arm to feel pulse said better much better last night condition be so serious that found necessary to inject morphia there be hand too know third finger have be badly hurt be compelled to take injured part away morning however gordon impatience must restrain no longer doctor said clutching at surgeon sleeve close door tell have happened surgeon repeated report appeared in english newspaper about clearing out of el azhar shooting of boy killing of hundred student by sword imprisonment of nearly four hundred others then thinking that drug have administered be still beclouding patient brain spoke of gordon own share in bad work of night before how have refused to obey instruction be ordered under open arrest to return to own quarter how have defied authority making way to university have perpetrated violent personal attack on officer commanding troop there know nothing about know what colonel macdonald have communicated to press contrary must think to army regulation sense of honour decency say have be guilty of threefold offence first mutiny next desertion finally gross assault on officer while in execution of duty gordon have hardly listened to part of surgeon story face betrayed feverish eagerness when surgeon said there be something else hardly know whether ought to tell what be asked gordon though knew full well what surgeon be about to say occurred last night too consul general have managed to keep out of morning newspaper feel ought to tell though if must be sure must take calmly tell general graf be dead be found dead on floor of office daughter found gordon covered face asked in voice tried in vain to render natural what do say died of god said surgeon be what mohammedan call know science can find better name suffocating with sickness of fear gordon said what about daughter bearing with strange stoicism say not tear on face tell if know anything of human nature be suffering more for poor girl gordon threw off counterpane rose in bed be better now said let get up must go out impossible said surgeon be far too weak to go into street besides must never reach destination macdonald must take care of have told have given out that penalty of military law for least of offence be well death gordon dropped back in bed surgeon continued if have message to send to one why not write will see that reach safe hand will send in be cooking food for will tell to bring paper pen with surgeon left moment later serving man cheery face came into room behind smoking basin of savoury broth here be be to drink at once said then taking writing pad from under armpit laid with pen ink on table by bed saying doctor have told be to deliver letter gordon replied that must ring when be ready whereupon michael said good will take first will put strength into smiled nodded simple face out of room in vain gordon tried to write to helena first impulse be to tell to make clean breast of everything dearest helena be in deepest sorrow shame can not live hour without letting know that dear father be impossible at moment when one great blow have fallen on be impossible to inflict if suffered now when thought father have died by hand of god how much more must suffer if heard that death have be due to violence to foul play to hand of man who said loved destroying first attempt gordon began again poor dear helena be inexpressibly shocked grieved by news of be impossible also hypocrisy of concealment seemed to blister very soul tried again yet again not word must come be not cruel false then great trembling came over a realised that being what be to helena being what be to father be struck dumb before a by hand of heaven hour passed though day be bright deep impenetrable darkness seemed to close around at certain moment be vaguely conscious of noise in street outside great scuttling scurrying of foot loud clamour of tongue chopping ripping air barking bleating of mob in full flight then clattering of horse hoof whistling shouting of soldier michael came back at last having waited in vain to be summoned be full of news business in cairo have be suspended notable have met in opera square to condemn action of british army vast multitude of egyptian have joined have gone up to house of grand cadi to ask to call on sultan to protest to england well well said gordon cadi be afraid hearing crowd be coming barricaded door window then wrecked house shouting 'down with turk 'long live egypt ' cadi be inside sir speaking on telephone to officer commanding on citadel soldier came galloping up took hundred fifty prisoner in spite of better feeling gordon felt certain joy in bad news michael brought have be right everybody must see that have be right what then be duty duty be to deliver up say here be court martial now if will if dare plain practical sense seemed to tell that ought to go to agency where father highest british authority in egypt even though civil one seeing turn event have taken chaos into affair have fallen ruin macdonald brutality threatened having witnessed utterly illegal circumstance have attended arrest must place in command pending instruction from war office trust to influence with populace to restore peace must do too why not general sickening pang of hope shot through a told that one knew have killed general that even if have done so have only be in self defence that veriest poltroon must have done what did that mind counted act a crime be morbid diseased helena thought father have died by visitation of god why must not leave at be suffering though be for to comfort must fly to side difference must be over now too must see that have be right that jealousy have be mistaken then death with mighty wing must sweep away everything else thus in blind labouring of hope threw off counterpane again got out of bed whereupon michael whose garrulous tongue have be going ever since came into room first asking for letter surgeon have told to deliver then protesting in plaintive tone that broth be untouched now be cold laid hold of said brother no can not get up to day doctor say must not if attempt to do so be to tell patriarch michael voice only whistled by gordon ear like wind in desert sand storm seeing that gordon be determined to dress good fellow fled off to fetch master hardly have michael gone when barrenness of hope be borne down on gordon mind be asking by what title must go out a champion of right being so deeply in wrong even if everything happened a expected if threefold offence against letter of military law must be overlooked in light of obedience to spirit if consul general be able to place in command pending instruction from war office if be capable of restoring order in cairo by virtue of influence with inhabitant what then what of conscience have clamoured so loudly in relation to own conduct must continue to plead extenuation of own offence on ground of general unjustifiable unsoldierly conduct to tell that what have done in general house have be in self defence have be in self defence that have returned to citadel after be ordered to own quarter that have hurled hot insulting word at general such a man must listen to without loss of pride even respect god thought then helena with what conscience must comfort in suffering being cause of with what sincerity must tongue speak if pen refused to write if juggled into deceiving must go on a affection must tempt to do now more than ever since father be gone be quite alone to carry out plan have made for before fearful event befell impossible utterly impossible told grim vision rose before of shameful life corrupted by hypocrisy damned by deceit in be married to helena having succeeded to father rank occupying house room office with one sight standing before eye always sight of general body lying on floor where have flung o god save from that thought gordon dropped back to bed sat on edge of doubled up with hand covering face how long sat there never knew for mind be deadened to sense of time only at interval of lucidity be partly conscious of what be going on outside little pulseless place in be hidden away while world went on without at one moment heard bell of coptic cathedral ringing for evensong then light pattering a of rain when people passed over pavement into church then suddenly there came sound seemed to beat on very soul be firing of gun at citadel a soldier knew what be be minute gun for general funeral boom boom must see what be taking place a plainly a if eye beheld square of mosque lined up with troop two battalion of infantry one regiment of cavalry two battery of artillery boom boom coffin on gun carriage covered with silken union jack with general sword plumed white helmet on top of boom boom general charger immediately behind body with spurred boot in stirrup reversed boom boom boom officer of army of occupation drawn up by door of general house one of must be spared from duty except who ought above others to be there then carriage of consul general of egyptian prime minister then boom boom boom boom a cortege moved away to slow squirling of funeral march through square of mosque under gate of old fortress firing ceased in dumb emptiness of air gordon saw sight tore at heart still more terribly be room in general house dark blind with curtain drawn helena sitting there alone for first time one to comfort seeing thinking of barrier be between of blood be dividing that must never again come together manhood went down at last burst into tear like boy forgive helena be alone too forgive forgive then over sound of own voice heard innocent voice of choir boy singing evening hymn remove sin from before thy sight o god at next moment be conscious of old wrinkled hand being laid on bare arm of somebody by side who be saying huskily peace son god be merciful then sharp rattle of three volley of musketry coming from far away body of general have be committed to grave chapter vi helena have be in act of sending out letter when general aide de camp came in with news of doings of night before riot at el azhar gordon assault on colonel macdonald then disappearance before troop must recover from surprise a suddenly unaccountably a if have be swallowed up by earth of course macdonald acted like brute said young lieutenant colonel did exactly what might have be expected of under circumstance must have done same if offender have be commander in chief now have to pay penalty can not be light one macdonald be scouring city to find nook corner of mohammedan quarter have two motif for doing so too ambition revenge a helena tore up letter dropped bit by bit into waste paper basket felt a if last of hope dropped with rose again with thought though gordon might be in danger must not be afraid that love for be so great so unconquerable that must bring back to now in time of trouble in teeth of death will come be sure will come thought in confidence sat in semi darkness of room during preparation for military funeral hearing be being done outside with supernatural acuteness come to bereaved marching of troop rolling of gun carriage arrival of friend a well a soul crushing booming of minute gun be waiting to be told that gordon be there be listening for name a black boy darted in out with whispered news of egyptian minister english adviser inspector judge finally consul general when last moment came band of guard have begun to play toll for brave be certain that gordon have not come heart sank low then told that if ran risk of arrest be reason enough why must not show at fortress will be at chapel instead thought though have not intended to be present at funeral determined now that must go be put into carriage with consul general sat by side without speaking merely looking through window at crowd stood in street quietly silently without much grief on face listening to slow squirling of dead march roll of muffled drum over dull rumbling of closed coach when reached cemetery in desolate quarter of old cairo band stopped drumming ceased stepped out of carriage breathing silence of open air be broken by tremendous word be resurrection life be sure a took arm of consul general walked with over crackling gravel to door of chapel that moment crossed threshold first person must see must be gordon heart sank lower than ever when realised that be not there after have taken seat chill chapel have filled up behind service began tried in vain save at moment of poignant memory to fix mind on awful errand have brought will be at graveside thought one must arrest at place like english soldier be english gentleman if arab nobleman in desert must allow enemy who have stumbled into tent at night to get clear away in morning gordon must be allowed to stand by grave of friend general one must know be there when short service be over consul general drew hand through arm again walked together over gravel through grass to open grave behind rose bush that grew near to wall thought knew have only to raise eye from ground must see gordon standing there shaken with sob knew too that moment saw must break down altogether so kept head low a long a must when troop have formed in rectangle chaplain have taken place last word have be spoken through deeper hush bugle have led voice of soldier with father in thy gracious keeping leave now thy servant sleeping looked up at last saw that gordon have not come at felt a if something have be soft tender within have broken something be hard bitter have taken place while volley be being fired over grave officer of army came up to one by one brave men of many of hardly able at moment to speak see still did not weep when consul general with twitching lip said let go gave hand again though be limp nerveless now under long black glove a cold a snow

clearly much affected firm mouth often looked a if have be cast in bronze seemed now to be blown in foam helena said time have come to speak plainly be sorry be quite unavoidable after first salutation continued to stand by chair to stare out of window gordon have gone can no longer have doubt about others with other motif have be trying to find have failed have be trying too with better purpose perhaps better result voice be hoarse be struggling to control be now satisfied that when left house after scene painful perhaps unsoldierly scene of degradation took advice father gave to fly from egypt hide shame in other country paused for moment then said be scarcely proper advice perhaps who can be hot cold wise angry in moment merit of father counsel think gordon made up mind to follow only a conduct of despairing man who knew that be over can explain last appearance at el azhar again paused for moment then after clearing throat said think will see again think wish to see military court must probably hold responsible for blood have be shed during past twenty four hour thinking encouragement gave populace have led to rebel therefore judgment upon offence a soldier must hardly be le than than most severe voice be scarcely audible a added that must be harder for to bear than to think of a dead therefore others may be doing mother be cherishing illusion son be gone career be at end let please let say more on subject helena did not reply bosom be stirred by rapid breathing continued to stare out of window after moment consul general said more calmly have plan for future helena shook head desire to remain in egypt relative friend in england same think will be best for to return home helena bowed without speaking sooner better perhaps be sunday there be steamship from alexandria on saturday will suit to sail by one of secretary will make arrangement see safely aboard meantime have anxiety england will take care of father daughter then rose taking ice cold hand said think be will come up on saturday morning to see off good bye for present then in same hoarse voice a before looking steadfastly into face for moment god bless girl for minute helena did not move from spot on lord nuneham left sense of double bereavement have fallen on for first time with crushing blow that day must lose father be idea to mind have long be accustomed never for one moment until then not even in bitter hour in have parted at door have allowed to believe that time must come when must have to live on without gordon be here now past future alike be closed to black curtain have fallen about life if gordon must not return without risk of arrest what right have to expect to come back to at be gone be lost to be alone city have be lying hot in quivering sun began to grow red hazy in gathering twilight helena became conscious of crier in street below black boy who be always bustling about interpreted cry be cry funeral of student who have fallen at el azhar be to take place night ishmael ameer called on people to gather in great market place of mohammed ali walk up by torchlight to arab cemetery outside town must lady like mosie go see then mosie come back tell lady everything said black boy in hope of being alone helena allowed to go hardly have boy gone when timid knock came to door army surgeon entered room man thin lip be twitching be clearly ill at ease excuse said hearing be soon to leave for home thought only fair to myself in fact have come to make explanation what be asked helena without trace of interest in tone surgeon gnawed end of moustache for instant then looking uneasily at helena said when come to turn thing over in mind may perhaps think be to blame in keeping dear father secret condition however be not so serious under ordinary circumstance say ordinary circumstance might have lived five year ten year even fifteen truth be though well want to prove sincerity of friendship miss graf be sure prefer must speak plainly truth be what asked helena who be now listening with strained attention that dear father death be now fully convinced of be due partly due at event to circumstance that be not ordinary helena pale face turned white made answer after moment surgeon said must have be cruel to tell last night immediately after shock of bereavement now that be going away besides spoke to lord nuneham mentioned surmise know what be great man undoubtedly great man incapable of taking counsel always have be always will be of find so helena seized with indefinable fear be speechless surgeon blundering tongue went on 'better not speak of ' said lord nuneham let weaken case against man rouse popular fury by accusation can not possibly bring home wait will get hold of to better purpose by by ' helena heart be beating violently only said with laboured breathing ca dispense with have come to tell that father did not die from natural cause be that yes be to say pardon be alone helena assented impatiently then to tell truth be satisfied violence a contributing cause at event looked at again morning when at last moment in fact mark be even plainer than before mark mark of man hand about throat man hand said helena with lip rather than with voice thought at first might have be general own hand there be one peculiarity forbade that inference tell be left hand while thumb first second fourth finger be plainly indicated there be impression made by third so so concluded that mark about throat must have be made by somebody who have lost third finger of left hand helena gazed long time blankly into surgeon face until at length frozen by fear having said tried to convey impression that have said nothing miss graf have given pain feel have mind say certainly that hand at father throat be cause of death may have be used merely to push off if person seen last in general company be apparently quarrelling with please understand make accusation have never met ishmael ameer even if must be found that have peculiarity of third finger mean in case consul general will not hear of indictment so be sure be sure can rely on discretion hearing be going home felt must not allow to think have permitted dear father surgeon went stammering on for time longer helena did not listen when at last man backed out of room hugging willow soul with flattering thought that in following selfish impulse have done well did not hear go be now sure of have hitherto only half suspected egyptian have killed father killed there be other word for not merely by excitement presence engendered by actual violence authority knew too knew perfectly be afraid afraid in absence of conclusive evidence to risk breakdown of charge against one whom people in blindness worshipped sky have grown blue luminous by time star have come out in distant depth of heaven from market place below rampart of citadel there came up into clear air thick murmuring of vast multitude have gathered there with ten thousand smoking torch to follow new prophet to arab cemetery beyond town when helena thought of egyptian again be with intensity of hatred have never felt before have not only killed father have be first cause of devilish entanglement have led to gordon disgrace yet be to escape punishment for offence be to go on until sin against state have brought into mesh of minister while father be in grave gordon be in banishment be sent home in womanish helplessness shame o god be there to be one to punish man thought in dark searching of soul while finger nail be digging trench in palm from hard clenching of teeth lip be bleeding then suddenly in delirium of hatred of egyptian tragic tangle of error while be standing alone in desolate room with allah allah of ishmael follower surging up from below new feeling feeling have never felt before stirred in depth of abased outraged soul will go back to england asked will chapter vii a soon a lord nuneham reached agency went up to wife room sweet old lady be sitting in dressing gown with face to window on west while egyptian woman be combing out thin white hair binding up for night sun be gone river sky be shining like molten gold faint

rustling whisper of prayer at pillow then for weary careworn old lady day slid into night chapter viii meantime gordon with heart filled with darkness sat huddled up on bed in little guest room of coptic cathedral on table at left small green shaded lamp be burning on chair at right sat saintly old patriarch gently patting bare arm trying in vain to comfort yes god be merciful son be just because be such guilty creature that lord came to deliver know father know said gordon know what son know what reason have to reproach said gordon then catching by sure instinct of pure heart vague sense of gordon position old man began to talk of confession wherein soul of man lay down sin before god begin to feel a if have wing on receiving penitent confession said be duty of coptic priest to take sin upon just a if be own if son ca be impossible god forbid said gordon then saintly old soul allowing that there be sacred place in heart of man only god be eye must see spoke of atonement whereby be guilty of sin may begin journey towards repentance be numbered at last if penitence be true among living who live in god peace why must of son matter how foul stain of sin have contracted live in dread of miscarrying for ever while have energy to atone said good old man in worn husky voice then tide of gordon troubled mind have ebbed flowed like sea on desolate shore under blank darkness of starless night seemed to be suddenly brightened by light from morning father said must send for somebody indeed must who be asked patriarch captain hafiz ahmed of egyptian army can be found at headquarters say that one know well wish to see at once will tell michael to take message immediately said patriarch shuffling old foot went off on errand new light have dawned on gordon mind be same a have seen before yet be now quite different must deliver up a have first intended to do in humility not in pride in submission to will of god not in defiance of power of man reclaiming voice seemed to say to atone for crime confess everything die on gallows if need be better suffer pain of death than fury of remorse give own life for life have taken matter by what impulse of self defence devilish accident of fate hafiz must carry message to headquarters perhaps help to go there good old patriarch must explain why have not gone before be only way now only hope thought within hour hafiz arrived hot breathless a if have be running one moment stood near door while lip lagged low cheerful face darkened at sight of gordon white cheek then gushed out into word tried best to be brave be tragic with tear knew said have said so day long lying ill somewhere must show up now whatever consequence be wounded be let see be nothing said gordon nothing at sit down old fellow then hafiz sat on right of bed holding gordon hand in hand told what have happened during day how macdonald bloodhound have be out in pursuit of expecting to arrest court martial how also have be searching for since yesterday with hope of helping to escape high low have looked everywhere everywhere except here who must have thought of place like said hafiz so much better though will stay here until be well can get safely away will too will see will be hard to listen to good fellow scheme for escape tell at once of intention to give up so gordon asked one by one question be uppermost in mind little thinking that hafiz answer must break up purpose stifle for ever cry of tortured heart general be buried be said turning face away a spoke when hafiz answered yes that have died by hand of god be buried that afternoon that everybody be saying that have be good man great soldier egypt must never again see equal gordon asked what after must be worth of atonement offered a equivalent for life like general life such a own be longer of use to to one again when asked in low voice be breathless with fear how father be hafiz answered that iron man whose name have be terror in egypt for so many year though calm on outside still be breaking up like frozen lake from below that have be calling over telephone day long entreating to find son that might tell to deliver up immediately in spite of everything lest must be charged with desertion be liable to death gordon sickened with sense of shame into be about to plunge father in last day by confession intended to make fate meant to meet again when with deepening emotion asked about mother be worse for disgrace have overtaken hafiz told that though sitting in sort of bewilderment waiting for god light in darkness have fallen on life be yet living in beautiful blind hope that must come back to justify meantime sending message to saying tell mother be sure only did what believed to be right because boy must not do what be wrong gordon heart knocked hard at breast with thought that brave atonement to have set face must surely kill mother before have time to kill when last of in sore pain of wounded tenderness asked about helena be well be asking after hafiz again answered that have seen at general funeral where must not trust to speak to for pity of dumb trouble in pale face that leaning on arm of consul general have lifted tearless eye a if looking for somebody must not see that be to go back to england soon very soon on saturday without one for company being alone in world now then gordon broke down altogether for saw following on lonely journey home with cruel needle blow must ruin little be left of peace on saturday say yes by english steamer from alexandria said hafiz then eagerly a if by sudden thought gordon well why must

come back tell what be going on meantime will say nothing about about knowing where be mean nothing to consul general nothing to mother nothing to anybody good bye old fellow leave to will see through when hafiz went off with rush of spirit gordon being left alone sank to still deeper depression than before felt a if be thrown back again on desolate shore where tide of mind ebbed flowed under blank darkness of starless sky proud atonement whereby have expected to wipe out crime have fallen utterly to ash looked like nothing better now than selfish impulse to escape from life have become burden to by killing father honour mother trust last hope of helena happiness no can not deliver up be impossible thought if death be denied to what be there left to in life career a soldier be clearly at end father house be for ever closed to day with helena be over then what can do where can go asked suddenly remembered what general have said in delirious moment when with bitter taunt have told to fly to foreign country where men must know nothing of disgrace cruel unjust a sentence have seemed to then appeared to be be left to now when work home love alike be gone from yes will go away thought

with be more than guilty man must bear live why ca go to america asked be mother home country to something in blood have always be calling refuge also be denied to for though might hide in new york boston philadelphia chicago san francisco better than in trackless desert yet in very pulse of life must still be alone with mind must always be rambling through way of past seeing nothing in happiness of other men cruel vision of what might have come to also for one blind moment of headstrong passion be life then to be utterly closed to thought be neither to die for crime live for repentance have god almighty set face against thought of helena a must be in england alone like cut off for rest of life from happiness except bitter one of memory of few short day together thinking ill of a need must for leaving in sore need while time heart be yearning for love of must have given soul to be by side for barrier of blood now seemed to separate forever then in bitterness of remorse depth of abased penitence thinking almighty must be against began to pray never having prayed since day when mother held to knee o god have pity upon cried a sat huddled up on bed only

tell where be going found ascending hill lead up to bab el gedid sight of gate of citadel suggested fresh consideration might have acted a warning paid heed to be nothing to in present mood that be like man who be putting head into noose walking deliberately into trap marching straight into camp of enemy whose first interest be to destroy image of helena sense of presence so near to left little

prayer from minaret of mosque inside fortress goin ' to sing bloomin ' song suppose thought sentry private of middlesex regiment when gordon a one having authority walked boldly through gateway being now within citadel gordon began to be besieged by thought of tracker who must surely keep watch upon general house also if a hafiz have said there be suspicion that helena intended to go away together again vision of helena rose before other consideration be swept away to leave cairo while helena remains in must be cowardly told emboldened by thought walked fearlessly across square of mosque round old arsenal to gate of general house without caring whom met there met one gate be standing wide open door of house when came to be open also there be nobody anywhere about with gathering sense of shame such a have never felt before stood there for moment wondering what course ought to take whether to ring for servant to walk through a have be wont to do before dread event befell suddenly wall of house within resounded to peal of raucous laughter followed by burst of noisy voice in coarse clamorous talk utterly bewildered stepped forward in direction of helena boudoir then realised that be room voice came from after moment of uncertainty knocked whereupon somebody shouted to in arabic to enter then opened door helena servant being paid off required to leave house in morning have invited certain of friend made feast for squatting on floor around huge brass tray contained lamb roasted whole various smaller dish be now regaling after manner of kind with last content of general larder

of meat between finger thumb half way to mouth mosie have gone to england with lady helena left here at six o'clock to catch night train to alexandria so a to be in good time for to morrow steamer gordon stood moment longer looking down at grinning yellow face about tray then with various apology after many answering salaam closed door behind whereupon heard buzz of renewed conversation within room followed by more subdued burst of laughter alone in corridor asked why since helena be gone have be brought back to place be for punishment for penance must have be so all that have to be expiated told then turned to go walking through outer hall have to pas door of general office thinking must be sort of penance to enter room persuaded to do so room seemed naked dead now being denuded of little personal thing have made live be dark too save for ray of light came from lamp outside first thing met gordon eye be spot on general fell forced to look at spot for moment compelled to stand by though hair rose from crown bead of perspiration broke from forehead have to be expiated told again again turned to go back in hall be on spot where have last parted from helena there new penance awaited remembered that in hideous moment when have tried in vain to reply to reproach have be telling that if loved a loved must be trying to see thing with eye that thought have helped to leave then brought comfort now why have not seen that girl love be fighting with pride why have not followed into house when in pleading sobbing voice have called after yes everything have to be expiated told once more turned to go passing through garden caught sight of arbour on edge of rampart seemed to that deepest penance of must be to stand for instant on loved spot giving quarter abating nothing of bitterness of expiation drinking to dreg cup fate have forced to lip entered arbour there image of girl have loved girl still loved rose most vividly of before must almost feel bodily presence by side gleam of eye odour of hair heaving of bosom must see caressing smile broke from face must hear echo of ringing laugh proud strength self reliance energy grace passionate daring chivalry gay raillery be greatest charm everything be helena appeared to be about now love be above everything will only think of have said moon be shining leaf be rustling silvery haze of night dew be in near air while light of city be blinking below river be flowing silently beyond how often on night have walked on rampart with helena leaning closely on arm springing rightly by side almost seemed a if have only to turn head must see there with light scarf over head crossed under chin thrown over shoulder must nothing separate have asked have answered nothing in world grief be crushing be of kind unequalled for bitterness sweetness combined come to strong man who have be robbed of woman love by fate more cruel than death helena be not dead when have thought of on way to england while be homeless wanderer in desert shut out from love friendship practice of profession progress of world pain of position be almost more than must bear after while be brought back to by burst of raucous laughter laughter of servant inside house at next moment saw light running along ground in dark market place below light of tracker who be going off on wrong scent with company of mounted police in direction taken by hafiz chapter xvi gordon left citadel unchallenged unobserved in le than hour be climbing yellow road white now in moonlight go up to mokattam hill by time be beginning to see meaning of night experience unconsciously have be putting providence to proof unwittingly have be asking fate to say if path have marked out for have be right one when have decided to follow ishmael ameer to khartoum to work by side to come back at last when sin have be forgiven redemption won providence have decided in favour if destiny have determined that must not leave cairo might have be taken hundred time because have not be taken be clear to that be intended that must go have tried to see mother if must have done so must have stayed with at hazard since be so ill perhaps so near to death have tried to see helena also if have not gone to england already must have clung to at cost in spite of consequence on other hand have seen father heard from very lip that nothing not even liberty yet life of own son must stand between duty to law what did mean that must be so cut off so stripped naked so deprived of place a son lover soldier man that have hitherto stood to a a gordon lord be gone meant that existence be before work mission destiny be carrying away from former life have only to go forward without fear thus once again on height of great resolve pushed on with quick step not daring to look back lest sense of seeing thing for last time must be more than must bear lest thought of leaving city loved people who loved men brother officer mother memory of happiness with father consciousness of having wrecked hope of lifetime must drag back at last moment in midst of emotion be startled by loud sharp voice be without not within enta meen who be then realised that have reached fort on top of hill that egyptian sentry at gate be challenging for moment stood speechless trying in vain to remember name by be henceforward to be known who be cried sentry again then gordon answered omar omar

peace to o brother whereupon gordon answered a well a must for thickening of throat seemed to stifle to more sure than ever now that god hand be leading walked on with quicker step than before presently saw in distance dark group recognised a osman camel allah be praised have come at last whispered osman be bright intelligent young egyptian for last hour have lived in fever of alarm thinking gordon must have fallen into hand of police got wind that be hiding at coptic patriarch house said be only waiting for permission of agency to raid at eleven o'clock left at ten said gordon

for provision hanging on side be restive when have to rise be a much a osman must do to keep from grunting being so fresh so full of corn held mouth closed until be on foot then mounted own camel by climbing on neck moment afterwards good creature be gliding swiftly away into obscurity of night with upturned steadfast face noiseless tread swinging motion men be accustomed to camel riding knew track before therefore lost time in getting under first village be soon left behind a came near to other hamlet howling of dog warned of danger skirted round quickened pace little beyond helwan came upon bedouin camp with long irregular dark tent open fire around company of men sat talking gordon pushed forward with flintlock swung across saddle bow while osman thinking to avoid suspicion hung back for moment to exchange news greeting then on on went up down yellow hill across sandy plain be still warm with heat of day over rocky gorge seemed to echo hundred time to softest footfall in le than three hour be out on open desert lonely grand without soul yet sound save faint thud of camel tread on sand dice like rattle of cowry hung from saddle allah khalasna god have delivered said osman at last a wiped cold sweat of fear from forehead never for moment have gordon felt afraid more now than before did know what fate be before if pillar of fire have appeared in dark blue sky must not

certainty that path have chosen be path be intended that must take somewhere knew not where somehow knew not how heaven have us for still a rode over sandy waste became fixed in mind that being rejected by world now stripped of everything that man hold dear be meant by god that must offer life in great cause thought did not terrify at delighted inspired stirred passion of soldier in soul to be perhaps link between east west to carry white man burden into black man country for higher end than greed of wealth lust of empire must die if need be thousand death how did come to think of a fate

almost devilish that day disappeared escaping from importunity of people into desert did not return at night at sunrise next morning black zogal went in search of nubian returned without telling wild supernatural tale of having come upon master in midst of angelic company face be shining with celestial radiance so that at first must not look upon when at length be able to lift eye master who be

ready for task enterprise ishmael who began to make plan for going back to cairo for be there according to view that expected one be to appear sent letter to corner of country telling messenger to return home helena wrote letter with trembling hand in spite of secret errand be surprised by certain sympathy great hope great dream touched pity gave at beginning moment of compunction after while began to see a wicked madness enabled to steel heart against ishmael again man who held out such crazy hope to credulous people might be harmless in england in egypt be peril once let ignorant superstitious populace believe that end of world be coming that messiah be about to appear human government be dead letter what then revolution bloodshed for first duty of government be to preserve law order helena asked if time have not come at last to write to consul general perhaps to steal away from khartoum return to cairo that might report what have seen learned after reflection concluded that only result of doing so must be that of punishing yet further poor misguided populace who have be punished enough already be ishmael alone who ought to suffer whether for offence against follower conspiracy against government crime against in order to punish apart must have to separate from people how be to do seemed impossible fate assisted few day after abdel kader have gone off in humiliation shadow of lanky body appeared across threshold of guest room where ishmael be sitting with other company than old mahmud helena who be writing usual letter while little mosie fanned to drive off fly peace of god be with master said in low humble voice then with shy look of triumph produced letter have be given to at letter be from chancellor of el azhar told ishmael after usual

charge of city egyptian soldier be moslem o brother brother son of poor afflicted child of allah need only right word from right man will throw down arm at city gate then army of god may enter ishmael read letter aloud in throbbing voice face began to shine with ecstasy in instant wild scheme took shape in mind must announce pilgrimage with ten thousand twenty thousand fifty thousand of follower must return to cairo to meet greet expected one native army must not resist co religionist once within city struggle must be at end in single hour fifty thousand must be five hundred thousand government must not turn out dared not make war upon whole world must cry out against general massacre god must not permit to occur somebody must go into cairo in advance to prepare way to make sure there must be bloodshed trusty messenger servant of most high who must kindle soul of egyptian soldier to such blazing flame of love that not peril of death must make take up arm against child of god when came to gate while ishmael propounded scheme with gathering excitement look of frenzy helena sat trembling from head to foot clutching with nervous finger reed pen held in hand for knew that hour have struck at last hour have waited watched for hour have come to khartoum to meet held breath gazed intently into ishmael quivering face a long a continued to speak then in voice must scarcely recognise a own said messenger who go in advance into cairo must be one whose wisdom a well a courage can trust true true most true said ishmael speaking eagerly rapidly one whose word will carry influence with egyptian army please god will be so said ishmael if soldier be native moslem officer be british christian therefore risk run be great great very great god will protect to disobey may be to suffer imprisonment perhaps discharge possibly death know know god will bring to happy end therefore said helena whose nervousness be gathering feverish strength messenger who go into cairo in advance must be one who can make forget danger of death ishmael reflected for moment then in burst of eagerness said counsel be good will go be flushed face looked triumphant man of men said what messenger from ishmael must be so sure a ishmael yes please god will go said ishmael in louder voice began to laugh be first laugh have broken from lip since helena came to khartoum then paused said people anybody can follow with said loyalty be certain need persuading will go said ishmael for above there must be bloodshed then old mahmud who alone of person present in guest room seemed to be untouched by excitement of moment turned to helena said be ishmael only one for enterprise daughter know one one know said helena who know everybody everybody know old man answered not soldier merely master also at helena nervousness gathered up into trill of unnatural laughter said nonsense can be disguised kufiah headdress of bedouin covering head nearly face what more be wanted so be not afraid for daughter afraid will make kufiah with own hand will put on brave heart of woman cried ishmael stronger than soul of man be duty will do with that turned to abdel kader who have looked on with staring eye said go back to cairo by first train say 'it be well god willing will come then in fever of new purpose went off to mosque there first called upon people to repeat shehadah moslem creed after that administered oath to never by grace of god prophet to reveal what be going to say except to true believer only to on taking like oath of secrecy fidelity people repeated in chorus word spoke in loud voice concluded man with right hand on koran left upraised to heaven with solemn amen then ishmael told everything how time have come for deliverance from bondage corruption to glorious liberty of child of god how a people of prophet have returned from medina to mecca so be to go up from khartoum to cairo how be to go before under leader be to follow god must give great reward at news poor unlettered people grew delirious in excitement man interpreting ishmael message according to own vision of millennium saw turning hated foreigner out of egypt others be already in imagination taking possession of cairo rich land of valley of nile while few like ishmael be happy enough in expectation of prostrating at foot of divinely appointed guide who be to redeem world from sorrow sin a soon a prayer be over black zogal ran back to old mahmud house with wild story of flash of light saw darting from ishmael head while spoke from pulpit helena heard be sitting alone in guest room tortured by contending thought be wicked woman asked remembering how easily have taken advantage of ishmael fanatical ecstasy again hardened heart against ishmael telling that simplicity be cunning that be impostor who have gone so far with imposture that must even impose upon how must one who have committed crime cruel cowardly crime be anything villain madman perhaps same villain then other thought thronged upon sweet bitter thought with memory of gordon of father of early day in grasmere of short morning of happiness in cairo of brief rift in cloud of life be now plunged in perpetual night thus stifled qualm of conscience by going back back to same plea same support after killed father chapter viii in village outside blind walled dead metimmeh with blank empty hovel

own spirit have also failed have asked why since knew of use that heaven must have for there continued to trudge along through bare barren wilderness doubt uncertainty be now gone be in fever of impatience to reach khartoum that might put end to ishmael scheme that scheme be madness must only end in disaster carried into execution must be arabi insurrection must lead to like failure a much

rising brightness began to flush with stony height of distant hill drew rein made camel kneel dismounted be then near well from group of laughing girl with bare bronze arm shoulder be drawing water in pitcher carrying away on head while osman loosened saddle of camel fed tired creature with durah gordon asked one of girl for drink held pitcher to lip saying with smile may give thee health prosperity after hour rest having filled water skin being refreshed with biscuit date readjusted saddle of camel mounted rose started again making salaam to young daughter of desert who stood grouped together in morning sunshine looked after with laughing eye clear vivifying elastic desert air breathed upon face camel strengthened by rest food swung away with better speed day long continued to ride without stopping gordon impatience increased hour a reflected upon probable consequence of scheme with unknown woman have inspired ishmael osman being told of danger forgot weakness in fervour of devotion shadow lengthened along sea flat sand while passed over waste without bush scrub sign of life just a sun be setting entered crater like valley of kerreri with clump of mimosa far view of innumerable island of nile be scene of gordon first battle battle of omdurman score of tender thrilling memory came crowding upon from past yonder be thicket in have taken khalifa flag spot where have left ali show bit of bridle to colonel tell died faithful give salaam to charlie knew charlie gordon lord must stay with to end how different old battlefield be to day instead of deafening roar of cannon wail of shell frenzied shout of dervish swathe of sheeted dead there be only grim solitude of stony hill yellow sand with here there white glistening bone over vulture circled in silent air night have fallen when entered omdurman change in town too struck chill into gordon heated spirit no longer dirty disgusting mahdist capital be deodorised swept sweet must be possible that be opposing force have brought civilising change when traveller reached ferry last boat for khartoum have gone nile being high have choice to remain in omdurman until morning ma'aleysh happens a god ordains said osman gordon impatience must scarcely contain so eager be to undo work of woman who have done so much ill lodged in khan of old slave market be now full of peaceful people sitting about coffee stall lit by lantern candle where formerly air be tense with frenzied gallopings of wild baggara melancholy boom of great ombeya fearful trumpet of death before going to bed gordon wrote letter to ishmael saying have got thus far expected to meet in morning then being unable a yet to sleep under roof after sleeping so long on desert dragged angerib into open stretched under star there gazing up into great vault of heaven memory came back to have never once failed to come when lay down to sleep memory of helena night on long desert journey discomfort of bed if be only hole between stone arab shepherd build to protect from wind last thought have be of be gone be lost to must be in england by time be exiled from home for ever in twilight moment of heart mind go between waking sense sleep be with still now lying on angerib in omdurman must see radiant eye hear deep melodious voice catch note of gay raillery be perhaps greatest charm though have done ever since left cairo felt to night a if sweet agony of must break heart looked up at star found pleasure in thinking that same sky be over helena in england then looked across at khartoum saw that window of palace be lit up a for dance mystic sense of impending event came over what must be wondered then remembered word of osman who be now breathing heavily at side ma'aleysh happens a god ordains thought then sending last greeting to helena in england turned over fell asleep chapter ix early that morning abdullah have entered ishmael room while master be still sleeping for messenger from metimmeh coming by train have brought urgent letter ishmael read letter rose immediately when helena met in guest room hour afterwards saw that be excited disturbed rani said have be thinking about plan have certain doubt about better let rest for few day at event helena asked why be told that stranger be coming whose counsel might be wise for knew cairo government egyptian army have asked ishmael to wait until arrived before committing to course who be asked one who love people have suffered sorely for love of what be name call sheikh omar benani at moment learned more than that stranger be bedouin chief of great fame influence that have rested at night before be now coming on to khartoum a fast a camel must carry may be here to night to morrow at latest said ishmael so let leave thing where be until brother arrives news threw helena into fever of excitement saw possibility of scheme coming to nought bedouin who be now on way might destroy be afraid of bedouin if knew cairo government egyptian army must also know that plan ishmael have proposed to be impossible that being so must advise ishmael against influence with ishmael must be greater than own a consequence plan must fail then have hoped for have come for have sacrificed so much for must be lost wasted what be to do there be only one thing possible to cause ishmael to commit to plan before bedouin arrived in khartoum again fate assisted same train brought bedouin letter brought messenger from cairo be immensely tall dinka who have be employed to avert suspicion a soon a be alone with ishmael household slipped off sandal tearing open undersole produced very small letter be from ulema of el azhar gave further particular of forthcoming festivity with one hint of amazing advice that certainly must not have come from men of world consul general have decided to give annual dinner in honour of king birthday not a usual at british agency in pavilion of ghezirah palace on island in front of city authority must be there night housed under one roof british army must still be in province egyptian army alone must be left in defence of town therefore to prevent possibility of bloodshed there be only one thing to do turn key on pavilion in order to imprison person in command then open bridge crossed nile that ishmael following with consent of native soldier might enter cairo unopposed be plot whereof counterpart must only have be found in history of abu moslem al mansour perhaps for reason alone took ishmael heart by storm required immediate confirmation for if secret scheme be to be carried out arrangement be matter of urgency reply must be received at once there be moment of tense silence after ishmael have read letter for already have begun to hesitate to talk again of waiting for bedouin who knew egypt better than one in soudan be wise brave learned in war helena seeing advantage began to speak with flushed face trembling tongue of train be to leave khartoum for cairo that morning of interval of four day before departure of one there can be time to lose said with stifling sense of duplicity especially if ulema be to arrange for own arrival a well at length ishmael no longer man used to be strong above in common sense enthusiast living in world of dream be swept away by ulema scheme seeing only one sure way to avoid bloodshed that of shutting up british official in midst of festivity while bridge crossed nile be opened follower took peaceful possession of city called on helena to write reply ran to serenity chancellor of el azhar from slave of god ishmael ameer good news in interest of peace agree though liking not for other reason plan of imprisoning pharaoh people in pavilion lest must be said of 'behold true believer resort to trick of infidel who trust not in good arm of god ' praise be to exalted one nevertheless send word of greeting giving consent saying behortly go down to cairo to call upon brother under arm to very great lord khedive to refuse when day of deliverance come to shed blood of child of most high ' having dictated letter added usual arabic salutation signed then full of fresh enthusiasm went off to mid day prayer in mosque where with greater fervour than before

paused for moment looked fixedly before although said nothing lip moved a if be interrogating empty air be asking again be cruel revengeful vindictive be replying to herself a have replied before if so can not help have lost father have lost gordon be alone heart be torn strengthened by thought took ishmael letter from bosom folded inside own while be in act of putting into envelope paused again for new more startling memory have flashed upon be memory of mark upon father throat of missing finger print have somehow formed so fatal evidence of ishmael guilt how have happened that have forgotten fact until now that during time have be in khartoum have never once remembered to verify that even at moment must not say whether third finger of ishmael left hand be intact not matter be not fact of greatest consequence in case have gone too far to think of now sealed envelope addressed then called for mosie black boy came running at sound of agitated voice mosie said in breathless whisper have always said that loved so much that must lay down life for black boy showed shining white teeth a if from ear to ear do think must find way back to cairo alone deliver letter to english

sandal said when have whipped off took scissors lifting inner sole hid letter underneath then hurried into room returning with small canvas bag contained nearly money have left in world gave to black boy sent off chapter x after sat down for heart be beating violently must scarcely breathe at same moment caught sight of face in hand glass stood on table at wrote feature looked so strange that scarcely seemed to be own if anybody with eye of spirit must have gazed at moment into deepest recess of soul harder to look into than obscurity of sea must have seen battlefield of contending passion be reflecting for first time on whole meaning of what have done have condemned ishmael ameer to death at least at very least to lifelong imprisonment in damietta torah when put so furnace of conscience seemed to consume in order to live with have to oppose thought with thought of gordon gordon gone knew not where exile outcast brilliant young life wasted never to be seen again relieved riot in brain to ease heart still further made believe that what have done have not be to revenge to avenge gordon whom ishmael evil influence have destroyed serve right thought let go to damietta what better doe deserve at moment ayesha ishmael little daughter came running with bare foot into house seeing helena leapt into arm kissed kiss of child seemed like blow made dizzy at next moment

bringing home from mosque be calling upon god prophet to bless touching white caftan a if be divine virtue be coming out of dismissed with word of rebuke gentler more indulgent than before perhaps entering house called for food few minute afterwards ishmael helena old mahmud be sitting in guest room together drinking new milk eating soft bread where be boy o rani asked ishmael who missed great fan of ostrich feather helena made halting excuse mosie have be troublesome have sent back to where came from cairo cairo asked arab woman with glance of suspicion helena looked confused ishmael saw nothing be more than usually excited enthusiastic full of great hope after while talked of bedouin who be coming brother be not in fact bedouin said not bedouin neither be moslem be christian indeed englishman englishman yes be one who love moslem have gone through shame degradation rather than do wrong helena be afraid to ask further question must only listen terrified by vague apprehension truly o lady who loveth child of god god loveth said ishmael brave man be soldier if have suffered rather than do evil act will god forget helena shuddered idea be taking shape in mind seemed incredible ishmael be speaking in softest tone yet voice seemed like subterranean sound that precede great shock of earthquake be coming be good to rani if must take heart out weigh must find gold helena be struck with sort of stupor be dreaming asked what be thinking about be one of mysterious moment on eve of great event of life when murmur come from know not where long hour of day passed in sort of dark confusion at last sun set moon rose over desert golden tropical moon in purple of eastern sky lit up wilderness of sand a with softer sun grew late helena rose to go to room a did so almost fell from dizziness ishmael helped to door of woman quarter have seen lustrous eye upon with expression have made tremble on night of betrothal again in same scarcely audible voice said god give good morning putting for first time lip to hand went away when be alone long hour passed in silence bedroom be in state of perfect calm yet frightful tumult be going on in brain must be possible that who be coming be wild irony of thought be too terrible that at very moment when thought be avenging gordon for injury have suffered at hand of ishmael at moment by sinister eccentricity of destiny in midst of hideous pain sweet joyous sound fell upon ear be voice of child who have awakened for moment from peaceful sleep will not come into bed rani yes yes dear presently answered at next moment child equal tranquil breathing so gentle so calm fell on ear again innocence be most formidable of spectacle can confront uneasy conscience when at length helena got into bed child in blind
