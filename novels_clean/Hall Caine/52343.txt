dazed condition of sens must almost persuade herself that have imagined everything impatience must not permit to remain in house too must go to mosque although have never be there before so putting on indian veil set out hurriedly when came to herself again be in gallery people be making way for be dropping into place then realised that be sitting between zenoba little ayesha mosque be large four square edifice full of column arch with kind of inner court be open to sky have minaret at corner gallery looked down on court helena saw below half in shadow half in sunshine head of great concourse

above then echoed by men on carpet below helena hardly heard of one thing only be conscious that by tragic play of destiny be there while be here after while became aware that ishmael have risen be beginning to speak tried to regain composure enough to listen to what said brother said be according to precept of prophet peace to name to receive christian in temple if come with goodwill of good moslem with heart be true to know o brother whether be moslem not pray to most merciful to bless such christian a one who be here to day more of same kind ishmael said helena found hard in tumult of

of a probable sequel to what have occurred in cairo have not be turned out by own in effect cashiered from army forbidden father house have not driven away from what sequel be more natural more plainly inevitable then grew hot cold at new still more terrifying thought gordon must come there how must meet how look into face momentary impulse to deny own identity be put aside immediately impossible useless then how must account to gordon for presence in house ishmael wife according to mohammedan law custom not only betrothed married to when put position to herself so thread of thought seemed to snap in brain must not disentangle knot of sense of infidelity to gordon to very spirit of love brought for moment self reproach despair of woman who have sinned in midst of pain heard light voice of people returning to house at next moment ayesha zenoba came into room child be skipping about full of high spirit arab woman be bitterly merry rani will be happy to hear that master be bringing stranger home said zenoba helena turned gazed at woman with stupefied expression what have foreseen a terrifying possibility be about to come to pas opened mouth a if to speak said nothing meantime arab woman in significant tone be meant to cut to core went on to say that be highest honour moslem must show unbeliever a well a greatest trust must repose in have never heard of in country o rani be true though quite true people supposed that moslem guarded house so jealously that strange man might look upon wife among arab of desert when traveller tired weary sought food rest sheikh

be conflict going on within that helena hardly heard woman word though jealous spirit behind be piercing heart like needle became conscious of great crowd returning be making same ululation a before mingled with same shout at next moment there came knock at bedroom door abdullah voice cry lady lady helena reeled little in rising to reply be with difficulty that reached door master have brought sheikh omar benani back be calling for lady what will say helena fumbled hem of handkerchief in finger a be wont to do in moment of great agitation be asking must happen if obeyed ishmael summons must gordon see through motive in being there if so must betray to ishmael already must hear confused murmur in guest room out of murmur memory seemed to grasp back a from vanishing dream sound of voice have be lost to felt a if be suffocating breathing be coming rapidly from depth of throat yet arab woman be watching while whirlwind be going on within have to preserve complete tranquillity without say be coming said supreme moment have arrived with great effort gathered up strength drew indian shawl over head in such way that partly concealed face then pallid trembling with downcast eye walked out of room chapter xii gordon have day experienced emotion only le poignant than of helena in early morning after parting with devoted comrade of desert journey have encountered british sub governor of omdurman young captain of cavalry who have once served under now spoke to in assumed character a bedouin with certain air of command brought twinge of wounded pride be complicated by qualm of conscience a rode through street past silversmith shop where grave looking arab sold bracelet necklet past weaving quarter where men boy be industriously driving shuttle through string of flimsy loom past potter bazaar grain market so sweet so free from former smell of sun dried filth warm humanity packed close together be coming here to oppose power that in so few year have turned chaos into order asked more personal emotion came later came in full flood when ferry steamer by crossed river approached bank on other side saw standing there near to spot on dervish landed on black night of fall of khartoum vast crowd of son son son who be waiting to receive again came qualm of conscience when out of crowd stepped ishmael ameer who kissed on cheek led forward to own camel amid people shout of welcome be a british soldier throwing in lot with enemy of country a englishman christian be siding with adversary of religion civilisation journey through town to mosque with lu lu ing throwing of palm branch before camel foot be le of triumphal progress than abject penance must hardly hold up head sight of bronze black face about shouting for for of race creed making that act glory have led to crime be almost more than must bear when reached mosque when found unbeliever though be kneeling in front of kibleh when ishmael laid hand on head called on god to bless people cried with one voice be of be brother sense of human sympathy swept down other emotion felt a if at moment might burst into tear then when prayer be over ishmael brought up uncle patriarchal old man with beard like flowing fleece said be to lodge at house finally when ishmael led home took to own chamber called to abdullah to set up angerib saying be to sleep in same room gordon twinge of pride qualm of conscience be swallowed up in one great wave of human brotherhood came back with sudden bound when ishmael began to talk of wife sent servant to fetch be sitting in guest room by time waiting for lady to come to gordon felt moved by inexplicable impulse of anxiety have felt before who be mohammedan woman who have prompted ishmael to scheme must so surely lead to disaster did know what be doing be betraying then door on woman side of house opened slowly saw woman enter room did not look into face distrust of whereof be now half ashamed made keep head down while bowed low during little formal ceremony of ishmael presentation instantly certain indefinite memory of height step general bearing made blood flow fast felt perspiration breaking out on forehead moment afterwards raised eye then seemed a if hair stood upright be like man who have be made colour blind by bright light must not at first believe evidence of sens that who appeared to be before be actually there did not speak utter sound embarrassment be not observed by ishmael who be clapping hand to call for food during next few minute there be little confusion in room black zogal abdullah be laying big brass tray on tressels covering with dish then came ablution sitting down to eat gordon at head of table with ishmael on right old mahmud on left helena next to ishmael meal began with beautiful eastern custom of host handing first mouthful of food to guest a pledge of peace brotherhood faith trust kept gordon occupied for moment helena have time for observation in midst of agitation must not help seeing that gordon have grown thinner that eye be bloodshot nostril pinched a if by physical moral suffering after while saw that be looking across at with increasing eagerness under glance became nervous almost hysterical gordon on part have now not shadow of doubt of helena identity still did not speak too noticed change helena profile have grown more severe there be dark rim under large eye must not help seeing sign of pain have gone through though mind be going like windmill under constantly changing wind why be there must be that great sorrow fell upon at death of father have made fly to consolation of religion dismissed that thought instant came to for behind close behind came recollection of helena hatred of ishmael ameer of jealousy have be first cause of separation between smash mahdi have said not altogether in play then why be there great god must be possible that after death of general have gordon felt at moment a if world be reeling round helena glancing furtively across table be sure must read gordon thought with certainty that knew what have brought to khartoum felt at first crushing sense of shame what fatality if anybody have told that must be overwhelmed with confusion by very person have be trying to avenge must have thought mad yet be precisely what providence have permitted to come to pas sense of blindness helplessness in hand of destiny be so painful a to reach point of tear when gordon spoke in reply to ishmael old mahmud question very sound of voice brought memory of happy day together looking back on past of life thinking where be now wanted to run away cry time ishmael saw nothing for be talking rapturously of great hope great expectation near approach of time when people suffering must end sort of radiance be about face shone with joy majesty of dreamer in full flood of dream when meal be over old man who have be too busy with food to see anything else went off to siesta then dish being removed servant gone ishmael talked in lower tone of detail of scheme how be to go into cairo in advance in habit of bedouin such a gordon wore in order to win confidence of egyptian army so that must throw down arm man ought to bear thus permit people of pilgrimage coming behind to take possession of city citadel arsenal engine of war in name of god expected one poured out in rapturous language of one who saw impediment danger peril from chance treachery then turning to where helena sat with face aflame eye cast down gave credit of everything have be thought of everything be to be done yes be rani who suggested said when triumph of peace be won god will write on forehead afternoon have passed by time sun have gone far round to west be glistening like hammered gold along river in line of fort of omdurman be near to hour for evening prayer helena be now trembling under new thought thought that ishmael must soon be called out to speak to people who gathered in evening in front of house then gordon must be left alone when thought of that felt desire have never felt before never expected to feel desire that ishmael might remain to protect from shock of first word must be spoken when be gone gordon on part too be feeling thrill of heart from fear of truth must fall on moment helena be left together black zogal came to open door of guest room ishmael who be still on height of fanatical rapture rose to go talk to rani tell everything about kufiah intend to make good plan proposed to prevent bloodshed two unhappy soul still sitting at empty table heard sandalled footstep pas out behind then raised eye for first time looked into other face chapter xiii when began to speak be in scarcely audible whisper helena gordon why be here helena what have come for disliked distrusted ishmael ameer when heard about first used to say hated what doe mean helena did not answer immediately tell helena let go on thinking cruel thought why be here with ishmael in khartoum still helena did not answer be now sitting with eye down hand

body of people have repeated solemn word there be silence in guest room again in same hushed whisper a before more eagerly more impetuously gordon said say put scheme into mind helena if so must know quite well what will lead to will lead to ruin inevitable ruin bloodshed perhaps great bloodshed helena found voice at last spirit of defiance took possession of for moment said firmly will never come

know that helena lip be compressed made silent motion of head how do know have written to father have written to father yes said still more firmly will know everything before ishmael arrives will act a think best helena hel be struck breathless by what said by relentless strength with said there be silence again for moment once more voice of ishmael came from without there be three holy book o brother took of moses hebrew prophet book of gospel of lord jesus plain book of koran in first of be written ' know that redeemer liveth that will stand at latter day upon earth gordon reached over to where helena sat at side of table with eye fixed steadfastly before touching arm said in whisper so low that seemed to be afraid very air must hear then then be sending to death shuddered for instant a if cut to quick then braced up be that so helena be with lip still firmly compressed made same silent motion of head be that what came here to do yes to posse of secret then there be other way answered biting under lip helena can be possible that have deliberately stopped a if afraid to utter word be trembling on tongue then said in softer voice why helena why spirit of defiance took possession of again said be enough that came between that love love helena helena can talk of love here now dropped head before flashing eye again reached over to said in same breathless whisper be love for to become wife of man helena what be saying did not speak only hard breathing told how much suffered then think of other man wife when woman becomes man wife be one to marry man in order to to oh be impossible can not believe of helena suddenly without warning burst into tear for something in tone of voice rather than strength of word have made feel shame of position occupied in eye after moment recovered in wild anger at own weakness flamed out at saying that if be ishmael wife be in name only that if have married ishmael be only a matter of form at best betrothal in order to meet own wish to make possible for to go on with purpose a for love love be not who have be false to never for one single moment although in spite of everything for even when be gone when have abandoned in hour of trouble too have lost hope of then why helena hated ishmael wished to put down while thought be coming between why when seemed to be over between lip be twitching eye be ablaze ask why wished to punish said very well will tell because paused hesitated breathed hard then said because killed father gordon gasped face became distorted lip grew pale tried to speak must only stammer out broken exclamation great god hele oh may not believe know said helena then with rush of emotion in torrent of hot word told how ishmael ameer have be last man seen in father company how have seen together be quarrelling how father have be found dead few minute after ishmael have left how have found how other evidence gave proof abundant proof violence a contributory mean at least have be cause of father death how authority knew perfectly be afraid in absence of conclusive evidence to risk charge against one whom people in blindness worshipped so be left alone quite alone for be gone too therefore vowed that if there be one else must punish be what yes o god o god gordon hid face in hand being made speechless by awful strength of blind force have governed life led into tragic tangle of error misunderstood feeling with flashing almost blazing eye though sob choked voice for moment turned on said why not think of what father have be to say if be not justified nobody ever loved a did nobody be old too weak for be ill though nobody knew then barbarian hypocritical oh when think of have such feeling of physical repulsion for man can scarcely sit by side saying rose to foot standing before gordon a sat with face covered by hand said with intense bitterness a if exulting in righteousness of vengeance let go to damietta to death if need be doe deserve doe uncover face tell tell if if tell if be approaching gordon a if to draw away hand when began to gasp stammer a though have experienced sudden electric shock eye have fallen on third finger of left hand fixed upon with fascination of fear saw that be shorter than rest that since have seen before have be injured amputated breath have be labouring heavily seemed to stop altogether there be silence once more in voice of ishmael came again when deliverer come will find peace on earth will find war will find corruption worship of false god will find hatred vengeance beware of vengeance o brother corrupts heart pull down pillar of soul vengeance belongs to god when men take out of hand writes black mark upon face two unhappy people sitting together in guest room seemed to hear very heart beat at length

kill father lip trembled convulsively grew paler paler moment know did not helena because covered face again because know who did then who who be did not intend to do helena who be be in heat of blood who be hesitated then stammered out see helena be have known in advance what be going to say not until have said did whole truth fall on then in moment world seemed to reel moral earthquake upheaving everything have brought all aim to ash mighty force have guided sustained soul sense of doing necessary righteous thing have collapsed without instant warning force powerful almost brutal force of

minaret of neighbouring mosque illustration music fragment god be most great god be most great seemed to be supernatural voice voice of accusing angel calling back to present position ishmael helena betrothal hand separated rose to foot one moment stood with bowed head at opposite side of table listening to voice outside then without word more went different way to room to hers into empty guest room moment afterwards came rumbling rolling sound of voice of people repeating fatihah after ishmael praise be to god lord of creature direct in right way o lord not way of who go astray chapter xiv

stranger have arrived that day in khartoum bedouin said cadi one whom ishmael ameer love who love yet bedouin say asked sirdar in incredulous tone with certain elevation of eyebrow bedouin o excellency repeated cadi whereupon others without word of further explanation bent turbaned head in assent then sirdar explained reason for have called together be given to understand said that idea be abroad that government have be trying to introduce change into immutable law of islam form integral part of moslem religion be therefore rightly regarded with high degree of veneration by follower of prophet if anybody be telling if one be saying that there be prejudice against because be mohammedan be wicked mischievous person beg of to tell who be saying sirdar looked sharply round table met nothing blank expressionless face then turning to cadi who a chief judge of mohammedan law court have be constituted spokesman asked pointedly what ishmael ameer be saying nothing o excellency said cadi nothing be contrary to sharia religious law of islam be telling people to resist government grave company about table silently shook head do know if have anything to do with conspiracy to resist

oiled beard person of doubtful repute who have once be slave dealer be now living patriarchally under protection of government with many wife concubine old black sinner cast little glittering eye around room then said if ask o master say ishmael ameer be putting down polygamy divorce ought to be put down at there be clamour among ulema sirdar thought saw rift through might discover truth pasha be soon silenced in moment there be same unanimity a before then what be asked sirdar whereupon venerable old sheikh after usual arabic compliment apology said that having seen new teacher with own eye talked with have now not slightest doubt that ishmael be man sent from god therefore that who resisted who tried to put down must perish miserably at word electrical atmosphere have be held in subjection seemed to burst into flame in moment six tongue be talking together one sheikh with wild eye told of ishmael intercourse with angel knew man who have seen riding with prophet in desert third have spoken to somebody who have seen angel in form of dove descending upon from sky fourth be ready to swear that one day while ishmael be preaching in mosque people heard voice from heaven cry

soon soon o excellency very soon after outburst there be moment of tense breathless silence during sirdar sat with serious eye fixed on table officer standing behind glanced at other smiled immediately afterwards sirdar put end to interview tell people said that government have wish to interfere with religious belief feeling whatever may be tell also that intends to have order obeyed that suspicion of conspiracy still more of rebellion will be instantly put down group of unkempt creature went off with sweeping salaam then sirdar dismissed officer also saying bear in mind that be recognised agent of just merciful government personal opinion may be of arab superstition please understand that be to give anti islamic colour to british feeling at same time remember that have worked for redemption of soudan from state of savagery can not allow to be turned back to barbarism in name of religion ulema other british official being gone sirdar be alone with inspector general well said well repeated inspector general biting end of close cropped moustache what more did expect sir naturally man own people be not going to give away nearly did so though heard what old zewar pasha said tut take account of said sirdar brother of christ must have put down too locked up in asylum dare say be exactly what must do with ishmael ameer anyway said inspector general of course performs miracle be attended by angel removal to torah inability to free from government jail must soon dispel belief in supernatural agency how can do under what pretext ca imprison man for preaching second coming of christ if did jail must be pretty full at home be thinking inspector general laughed old error dear sirdar ca apply same principle to east west old parliamentary cant dear friend be sick to death of there be moment of strained silence then inspector general said ah well know holy men with sham inspiration so called heavenly message develop by degree sir one have begun by proclaiming advent of lord jesus will end by hoisting flag claiming to be lord jesus when doe that colonel will consider position afresh meantime may do mischief to remember that if family of jesus must have dealt with founder of own religion a must deal with olive faced arab there must probably be christianity in world to day inspector general shrugged shoulder rose to go good night sir good night colonel said sirdar then sat down to draft dispatch to consul general nothing to report since marriage betrothal whatever be of 'rani to man in question undoubtedly be laying strong hold on imagination of native acquiring allegiance of large body of worker can not connect with conspiracy to persuade people not to pay tax with organised scheme be frankly hostile to continuance of british rule will continue to watch find at fearful odds owing to difference of faith be one of disadvantage of christian government among people of alien race religion that method of revolt be not always visible to naked eye god know what be going on in sealed chamber of mosque that only show danger of curtailing liberty of vernacular press violence of sporadic muddled anarchy leave press alone say instead of chloroforming into silence give tonic if need be drive trouble underground such be common sense practical wisdom of how to deal with sedition in mohammedan country let of logger headed dunce who write leading article in england say what will if man must develop supernatural pretension will know what to do without whether claim divine inspiration not if people must come to regard a divine very name idea of divinity may become danger suppose will have to put under arrest then remembering that be addressing not only consul general friend sirdar wrote 'art thou king ' strange that question of pontius pilate be precisely what may find in own mouth soon stranger still almost ludicrous even farcical hideously ironical that though for two thousand year christendom have be spitting on pusillanimity of old pagan representative of christian empire will have to do precisely what did short of pilate situation though see right to take man so be not taking sorry to tell so can not help love from to trust janet be feeling better news of poor boy suppose boy have for thirty year be name for gordon chapter xv grave a be gathering in sirdar palace at khartoum there be still graver gathering day at british agency in cairo gathering of wing of death lady nuneham be nearing end since gordon disgrace disappearance have be visibly fading away under burden too heavy for to bear consul general have be trying hard to shut eye to fact more than ever before have immersed in work being plainly impelled to fresh effort by hatred of man who have robbed of son through soudan intelligence department in cairo have watched ishmael movement in khartoum expecting to develop trait of mahdi thus throw into hand of sirdar be deep disappointment to consul general that did not occur same report came to again again man be doing nothing to justify arrest although surrounded by fanatical folk whose mind be easily inflamed be not trying to upset governor giving divine sanction for removal of official meantime mischief be manifestly at work over country from day to day inspector have be coming in to say that people be not paying tax convinced that be result of conspiracy consul general have shown mercy sell up have said inspector taking cue from own spirit exceeding order have done work without remorse week by week trouble have deepened when disturbance have be threatened have asked british army of occupation meaning violence to go out into country show people england power then grumbling have come down on from representative of foreign nation if people be so discontented with british rule that be refusing to pay tax there must be deficit in egyptian treasury how then be be creditor to be paid time enough to cross bridge when come to gentleman said consul general in stinging tone with curl of iron lip if worst came to worst england must pay england must not be asked to do so because egypt must meet cost of own government hence more distraining inevitable violence in suppressing riot resulted from eviction finally came hubbub in parliament with customary christian prattler prating again fool did not know what subtle secret conspiracy have to deal with while be cry out against mean of killing must kill form of passive resistance attack on treasury be deadliest blow have ever yet be aimed at england power in egypt must not let europe see must make believe that nothing be happening to occasion least alarm therefore to drown cry of people who be suffering not because be poor must not pay because be perverse must not must organise

know pretence at length feature became more composed breathing more regular then consul general who have be standing aside mute with anguish said in low tone to fatimah be sleeping quietly now then turned to go fatimah followed to head of stair said in husky whisper will be over to night though will see will for moment looked steadfastly into woman eye then without answering walked heavily down stair back in library stood for time with face to empty fireplace over mantelpiece there hung little picture in black gilt frame of bright faced boy in arab fez be more than must do to look at portrait now so took off nail laid face down on marble mantel shelf just at moment one of secretary brought in despatch be despatch from sirdar sent in cypher now written out at length consul general read without apparent emotion put aside without word hour passed slowly night be very long old man did not go to bed not for first time be asking searching question about mystery of life death great enigma be still baffling must be possible that while have occupied with mere show semblance of thing calling by great name civilisation progress simple soul upstairs have be grasping eternal reality there be question cut deeper even than now faced one by one be true that have married merely in hope of having one to carry on name thus fulfil aspiration of pride have for nearly forty year locked heart away from woman who have be starving for love be only by loss of son who be to have be crown of life that be brought together in end thus hoof of dark hour beat heavily on great proconsul brain

how good lord be be so easy to go now john must not think suffer longer because have pain now dear none then clasped wasted hand together in attitude of prayer said in rustling whisper to night lord jesus let be to night after rapturous voice died away ecstatic eye gently closed ineffable smile continued to play on faintly tinted face a if be looking on wing be waiting to bear away doctor came in at moment be told what have occurred delirium of course said change have come crisis be approaching if same thing happened at supreme moment patient be not to be contradicted delusion be to be indulged did not happen in early hour of morning consul general be called upstairs there be deep silence in bedroom a if air have suddenly become empty void day be breaking through window looked over to nile white sail of line of boat gliding by seemed like passing of angel wing sparrow be twittering in eaves through window to east first streamer of sunrise be rising in sky consul general approached bed looked down at pallid face on pillow wanted to stoop kiss felt a if must be profanation to do so now own face be full of suffering for sealed chamber of iron soul have be broken open at last with hand clasped behind back stood for minute quite motionless then laying one hand on brass head rail of bed leaned over dead wife spoke to a if must hear forgive janet forgive said in low voice be like sob did hear who can say did not be only ray from sunrise made egyptian woman think that over dead face of careworn weary one whose sweet soul be even then winging way to heaven there passed light of loving smile chapter xvii within three day softening effect on consul general of lady nuneham death be lost out of very bereavement sense of being left friendless alone became harder severer man than before secretary be more than ever afraid of servant trembled a entered room heightened anger against gordon to believe that by conduct have hastened mother end in absolute abasement there be moment when must have found easier to forgive gordon if have be prodigal wastrel prompted to do what have done by grossest selfishness deep down in obscure depth of father heart worst suffering came of certainty that son have be moved by tragic earnestness belongs only to greatest noblest soul still more hardening embittering to consul general than memory of gordon be thought of ishmael intensified anger against egyptian to feel that having first by visionary mummery by manoeuvring quackery robbed of son have now by direct consequence robbed of wife also consul general bull necked strength force of soul be roused to fury when thought of that be old tired needed rest before permitted to think of retirement must crush ishmael ameer not that allowed to recognise vindictiveness shutting eye to personal motive believed be thinking of england only ishmael be head centre of anarchical conspiracy be using secret stealthy weapon be more deadly than bomb therefore ishmael must be put down must be trampled into earth movement must be destroyed how within few hour after lady nuneham funeral grand cadi came by night with many vague accusation against arab innovator repeated former warning tell again o excellency if permit that man to go on will be death to rule of england in egypt then prove what say prove prove cried consul general raising impatient voice suave old moslem judge must not must not do so indeed being turkish official accustomed to quite different procedure be at loss to understand why consul general wanted proof arrest offender first will find evidence enough afterwards said english statesman must not act on line like so consul general turned back to despatch of sirdar last of one received during dark hour preceding wife death contained significant passage if man must develop supernatural pretension will know what to do have there be hope in charlatan element in ishmael ameer might carry far if only temptation of popular idolatry be strong enough once let man deceive with idea that be divine nay once let follower delude with notion of divinity civilised government must be bound to make short work of whatsoever might be that man must die sudden cloud passed over face of consul general a glanced again at sirdar despatch saw reference to christ how senseless everybody be becoming in world thought pontius pilate pshaw when must religious hypocrisy open eye see according to law of civilised state roman governor have done right jesus claimed to be divine people be ready to recognise a king whether kingdom be of world did matter if pretension have be permitted must have led to wild chaotic shapeless anarchy therefore pilate crucified jesus scorned though have be through age have done no more than so called christian governor must be compelled to do to day jesus of king of jew why must not people understand that word be written not in derision in self defence there must be only one authority in palestine then there must be only one authority in egypt now if visionary mummer with empty quackery must develop idea that be divine even messenger of divinity will hang like dog thought consul general chapter xviii five day after death of lady nuneham consul general be reading at breakfast last copy of time to arrive in cairo contained anticipatory announcement of forthcoming mansion house banquet in honour of king birthday foreign minister be expected to speak on unrest in east with special reference to affair of el azhar consul general face frowned darkly began to picture scene a must occur gilded hall crowd of distinguished person eating in public mixed odour of many dish pop of champagne cork smoke of cigar buzz of chatter like gobbling of goose on green then minister with hand on heart uttering timorous apology for proconsul policy pouring out pompous platitude a if have newly discovered decalogue consul general gorge rose at thought oh when must people who stayed comfortably at home lived by vote of factory hand of lancashire yorkshire hungered for shout of mob understand position of men like who in foreign land among alien race encompassed by secret conspiracy be spending strength in holding high banner of empire having chosen good man why ca leave alone thought consul general then personal feeling getting better of patriotism almost wished that charlatan element in ishmael ameer might develop speedily that might draw off allegiance of native soldier in soudan break out like mahdi into open rebellion must bring secretary of state to sens make realise real danger see in everlasting affair of el azhar if not light then lightning door of breakfast room opened ibrahim entered well what be demanded consul general with frown ibrahim answered in

lather eye be clear alert manner be eager well boy what do want asked consul general mosie looked fearlessly up into stern face with iron jaw tipped black thumb over shoulder to where ibrahim in gorgeous green caftan stood timidly behind at sign from consul general egyptian servant left room then quick a light mosie slipped off sandal ripped open inner sole plucked out letter stained with grease be letter helena have written in khartoum consul general read rapidly with eagerness even must not conceal so great indeed be excitement that did not see that second paper ishmael letter to chancellor of el azhar have fallen to floor until mosie picked up held out to good boy said consul general cloud have passed face bore expression of joy instantly apprehending dim purport of helena hasty letter consul general saw that what have predicted half hoped for be already coming to pas be to be open conspiracy now not passive conspiracy longer man ishmael be falling victim to most fatal of mental malady mahdist delusion be taking possession of be throwing into government hand hurriedly ringing bell consul general committed mosie to ibrahim care whereupon small black boy in soiled clothes with dirty face hand strutted out of room in front of egyptian servant looking a proud a peacock feeling like sixteen foot tall then consul general called for one of secretary sent for commandant of police commandant came in hot haste be big rather corpulent englishman wearing blue braided uniform fez naturally blusterous person with own people a soft voiced a woman a obsequious a slave before chief draw up chair commandant closer now listen said consul general then in low tone repeated what have already learned from helena letter added what have instantly divined from that ishmael ameer be to return to cairo that be to come back in disguise of bedouin sheikh that object be to draw off allegiance of egyptian army in order that vast horde of follower might take possession of city that be to be done during period of forthcoming festivity while british army be still in province that conspiracy be to reach treacherous climax on night of king birthday commandant listened

hurriedly make mistake see that men make none certainly lord investigate detail for above hold tongue guard information with inviolable secrecy surely lord can go now be busy good morning wonderful man thought commandant a went out at porch seems to have taken new lease of life wonderful consul general spent whole of day in thinking out scheme for special weapon when night came went upstairs

known for year fatimah be in bedroom for have constituted own nurse since wife death be nailing up on wall picture of little boy in arab fez having own theory about why have taken down in library said there will be company for lordship nobody will ask question about here when fatimah have gone consul general must not think of gordon always thought of at hour of night picture of son rose in mind eye

began to express halting doubt of success of enterprise have be thinking about said nervously now fear what do fear o rani asked ishmael fear said helena trembling visibly that moment government learn from sirdar a need must that great body of people have left khartoum be travelling north will recall british army to protect capital thus ishmael interrupted with laugh if day of redeemer have come

to time saw gordon a sat at meal moved about house did not speak to dropped head in shame a often a came close together at length caught look in face seemed to to say be really going to let innocent

detail of pilgrimage allah el hamdullillah cried people more than ever be like creature possessed hungry ragged a many of be new magnificence be to be given to life appeared to be already shining in eye helena saw heart be smitten with remorse at thought of cruel confession have decided to make must not make in sight of hope must destroy must look into gordon searching face remain silent a soon a crowd have gone made effort to speak ishmael said trembling over there be something wish to say if will not displease nothing rani can say will displease said ishmael be looking at with expression of enthusiastic admiration have seen in eye before be hard to go on intention be now known to everybody said have not hidden from of own people have be very trustful very noble still still what sister if somebody must betray scheme to government moment set foot in cairo again ishmael interrupted with laugh impossible said smiling upon with bright joyous eye islam have only one heart one soul one mind

be wanted soon sister then clapping hand for mid day meal went into room to prepare for leaving gordon helena for moment alone together gordon have be standing aside in torment of hundred mixed emotion now helena spoke in whisper be determined to go into cairo said quite determined oh be there way to prevent none now unless unless what asked eagerly let let wait see said gordon then abdullah came in to lay table chapter xx a soon a mid day meal be over gordon escaped to room room shared with ishmael throwing down on angerib with hand clasped across face tried to think out situation in found to gaze into depth of conscience to see where be what ought to do so violent be state of soul that sat there long time before must link together memory of what have happened since arrived in khartoum be dreaming asked again again a one by one thought rolled over like tempestuous wave first thing saw clearly be that ishmael be not now same man that have known at alexandria that anxiety responsibility suffering have gone through a religious leader have dissipated strong common sense that a consequence caution whereby men guard conduct have gone also saw that ishmael spiritual ecstasy have reached point not far removed from madness that faith in divine guidance divine guardianship divine intervention have become absolute obsession therefore be hopeless to try to move from purpose by appeal on score of danger to to people be determined to go into cairo thought gordon into cairo will go next thing gordon saw a examined situation before be that helena be powerless to undo work by cruel error of fate have be led to do that act be irrevocable that there be calling back that must go from consequence to consequence of consequence helena face appeared to heart bled for a thought of how passed before who have always be so bold gay with once proud head bent low remembered former strength self reliance natural force grace fearless daring that dash of devilry have be for one of greatest charm then thought of false position in house brought there by own will held there by own act tragic figure of woman in mesh of own net can not continue to live like be impossible yet what can end be asked hour passed like head under hot hand burned temple throbbed yet ray of light emerged from darkness surrounding at length man in soldier lover swept down obstacle told that must save helena from consequence of own conduct whatever result might be must must kept on repeating a helena face rose before after while blind resolution brought at one stride to new idea ishmael be determined to go into cairo there be one way to prevent doing so that gordon must go instead when first thought of that temple beat so violently that seemed a if must burst felt a if have be brought to very brink of despair seeing nothing before instant arrest moment entered city seemed to be pitiful end to long journey across desert poor sequel to fierce struggle with to mystic hope with have buoyed up heart that immediately after have reached khartoum must turn back to death work mission redemption have so recently have meaning for have disappeared heart rose when remembered that if did what have determined to do must break cruel error of fate whereby ishmael have be doomed to die for offence did not commit what be first fact of cruel situation that helena have believed ishmael to be guilty of death of father ishmael be innocent whereas gordon be guilty must allow innocent man to die for crime brought to crisis of conscience settled everything destiny acting under blind force of poor girl love for father be sending ishmael to death destiny must be defeated must pay own penalty ishmael must be snatched from doom threatened helena must be saved from lifelong remorse yes yes must go into cairo instead told have grown late by time bedroom have become dark when abdullah knocked at door said that sheikh be in guest room ishmael be asking for omar under roof thatched with stalk of durah lit by lamp suspended from rafter ulema notable of khartoum same visited sirdar have gathered soon after sunset squatting on divan covered by carpet cushion have drunk coffee talked in winding circuitous eastern way of business before particularly of white lady part in while waited for ishmael who be still at mosque yes vivacious old pasha have said matter how great man may be when undertakes enterprise like must always consult ten of friend great one be not great in friend said younger sheikh what if have not got ten then let consult one friend ten time over nay if stand so high that have not got even one friend then said old man with sly look over shoulder towards woman side of house let consult wife advises let do contrary when gordon in bedouin dress entered guest room ishmael be sitting in midst of people called to to take seat by right side where be rani asked looking round whereupon abdullah answered that be still in room old pasha hinted that in emancipation of eastern woman perhaps woman must be chief impediment know know said ishmael same must turn back on madness of bygone age that woman be inferior to man counsel be not to be trusted bring abdullah few minute afterwards helena wearing indian veil with face uncovered entered guest room with downcast eye followed by arab woman child cut gordon to heart to see look of shame of confusion ishmael saw nothing in helena manner except maidenly modesty under eye of so many men making place for on left began without further delay on business have brought together be about to win dear victory for god be to be white war bloodless revolution heartless festivity be to be held in honour of birthday of king who lived across sea while people perished in egypt be to reach climax something more than month hence therefore great caravan of god child who be to cross desert by camel horse as in order that might meet expected one when appeared in cairo must start within week messenger of god who have to prepare path before must go by train ought to leave khartoum in four day other preliminary of pilgrimage there be to arrange after manner of kind sheikh talked long leisurely agreeing finally that ishmael must go first into cairo in disguise of bedouin sheikh to make sure of success of mission that omar gordon must follow in command of body of people at length there be silence for moment then ishmael said be there anything else brother at gordon who have not spoken before turned to answered in style a well a language of arab listen beg of to word forgive if what say be not pleasing to yours speak omar benani speak said ishmael laying right hand with affectionate gesture on gordon left there be moment of silence in gordon must distinctly hear sound of helena breathing then lie said reverse order o brother let go first into cairo tingling electrical current seemed to pas through air of room again gordon heard sound of helena laboured breathing one spoke except ishmael who said in soft voice why omar why gordon braced up answered first because best becomes messenger of god to enter cairo in company of people not alone in disguise next next because know cairo better than ishmael that can do can do more there be moment of tense silence then ishmael said listen to sincere proposal o brother before answer ask for counsel of friend then raising voice cried companion have heard what omar benani have said of be to be at tense atmosphere in room broke into eager impetuous speech first came a need must in eastern conclave gust of question then certain breeze of protest finally strong unbroken current of assent master said one of sheikh have eaten bread salt with therefore will not deceive let go first can do that ishmael can do run risk messenger of merciful said neither will deceive omar know cairo best therefore let go first after others have answered in same way ishmael turned to mahmud uncle whereupon old man wiped rheumy eye said life be in god hand o son of brother man can not escape destiny if be god will that must be first to go into cairo will go god will protect speaking for must think shame humiliation that father of people must not enter city with child if omar say can do a much a believe white man doe not lie sooner have old man concluded than whole company with one voice shouted that be of same opinion whereupon ishmael cried so be then omar will be think for one moment grudge choice el hamdullillah shouted company a from sense of otherwise inexpressible relief meantime gordon be conscious only of helena violent agitation though dared not look at seemed to see feverish face expression of terror in lustrous eye at length when shout of sheikh have subsided heard tremulous voice saying hurriedly to ishmael listen to why rani ishmael asked in whisper tried to answer must not because because because what asked ishmael again oh know ca think beg entreat not to let omar go into cairo agitated voice caused moment of silence then ishmael said in soft indulgent tone understand o rani may be task of greatest danger be place of highest honour too must fain see man except husband assigned to be of be of there can be pride jealousy between then taking gordon by right hand while with left be holding helena said omar friend brother el hamdullillah cried sheikh again then one by

than husband be to go into place of danger helena must bear more go out of room moment can not endure hate go woman go cried zenoba fled before fury in lady face at next moment helena have dropped to floor burst into flood of tear when regained possession of child ayesha be embracing without knowing why be weeping over wet cheek chapter xxi now that gordon be to take ishmael place helena found deeper than ever in toil of own plot must see nothing death before a result of return to cairo if identity be discovered must die for own offence a soldier if be not discovered must be executed for ishmael conspiracy a have made known oh can not be must not be will not be continued to say to herself without seeing way to prevent never for moment in anxiety to save gordon from stepping into pit have dug for ishmael did allow to think that being real cause of father death deserved penalty have prepared for guilty man mind have altered towards event since man concerned in have changed more thought of more sure became that be totally different thing in strict sense hardly crime at in first place reminded that father have suffered from affection of heart must have contributed to death even if have not be principal cause of how must have forgotten that fact until now remembering father excitement exhaustion when saw last must see for first time by light of gordon story what have

must come back oh will kill be sure will saw that gordon strong manly face be now utterly discomposed must not help follow up advantage then think little of too gordon be fault if anything be done to in cairo will be just same to a if have done do wish to die of remorse saw that be struggling to restrain turning beautiful wet eye upon laying hand on arm said go back to cairo gordon for sake for own sake for love sake gordon must bear more cried in low hoarse whisper helena for heaven sake speak so knew must be easy to do what intended to do be easy make harder for than be beg pray tried to speak again must not listen when sent message into cairo doomed ishmael to death thought have killed father if have really done so must have deserved did to have whereas have do think can let innocent man die for crime gordon began again stopped speak about helena for heaven sake have fought battle with before ca fight over again with eye upon too voice in ear presence by side be trying to move away be still clinging to arm speak about love be over now must know be there be barrier between can never voice be breaking be struggling to tear away from leapt to foot cried gordon will hear must then stopped short looked at think be cause of father death be not said mouth opened lip trembled grew deadly pale think too that there be barrier of blood between there be such thing take care of what be saying helena what be saying be truth gordon be god truth looked blankly at for moment in silence then laid hold of violently by arm gazed closely into face said in low trembling voice helena if knew what be to live for month under shadow of sin awful sin unpardonable sin surely must why speak speak girl speak then helena looked fearlessly back into excited face said gordon do remember that came to room in citadel before went in to that fatal interview yes yes how can forget do also remember what told then that happened day must never leave father yes certainly yes do remember that asked why said must tell because be secret somebody else secret well pulse be beating violently must feel throbbing on arm gordon said do know what that secret be can tell now do know what be what that father be suffering from heart disease have already received death warrant waited for gordon to speak be almost afraid to breathe did know condition until arrived in egypt then perhaps ought to have resigned commission have be out of service for two year temptation to remain be too much for so asked to promise to say nothing about gordon released arm sat down again stood over breathing fast painfully thought ought to have be told at time when became engaged father said why put in false position burden with responsibility ought not to bear ' helena own voice be breaking now a gordon listened to be looking down at flushed face be thinner than before more beautiful than ever in eye hundredfold more touching than when first won heart tried to tell day too before went into general office so that might see for dear that if separated from father must possibly follow there be promise then then pride something said that pained wounded know know know said now continued rising to foot again now repeated in same trembling voice with look of joy triumph now that have told what happened after return to citadel see quite clearly be sure perfectly sure that dear father died not by hand at by hand will of god helena helena cried gordon in tempest of love overwhelming sense of boundless relief flung arm about covered face with kiss one long moment of immeasurable joy be permitted to know then hand of fate snatched at again from intoxicating happiness be awakened by voice be only voice of muezzin calling to mid day prayer seemed to be reproaching separating tearing asunder reminding of where be now what be that god be over illustration music fragment lip parted arm fell away from other irresistibly simultaneously a if by impulse of same heart dropped to knee to pray for pardon voice of muezzin ceased in silence of following moment heard soft footstep coming behind be ishmael did not speak to of seeing on knee at hour of mid day prayer stepped up knelt between chapter xxii when gordon have time to examine new situation in found saw that be now in worse case than before have be inexpressible relief to realise that be not first cause of general death therefore that conscience did not require to go into cairo in order to protect ishmael from consequence of crime did not commit sooner have passed great crisis than be brought up against great test what be to that must save life if have to lose helena helena be now ishmael wife betrothed to by most sacred pledge of mohammedan law if barrier of blood have kept from helena have be removed barrier of marriage kept helena from remained what can do asked for long time saw answer in fierce struggle followed honour duty seemed to say that inasmuch a helena have entered into union of own free will however passively acquiescing in strange condition must abide by must leave where be crush down consuming passion be unholy passion now honour duty be halting timorous guide in presence of love when gordon came to think of helena a actual wife of ishmael be conscious of nothing flame be burning at heart core remembering what helena have told what have seen since came to house reminded that after marriage be only marriage pro forma promise made under mysterious compulsion of fate contract of convenience perhaps generosity on one side on other side of dark calculating design must not bear to be thought of longer being result of blind leading of awful passion under circumstance of most irresistible provocation when came to think of love be dead to everything else ishmael did not love helena whereas gordon loved with heart soul strength be everything in life to though might have gone to death without be impossible to live leave behind thinking so began to conjure up picture of time when ishmael under influence of helena beauty charm might perhaps forget bargain between claim right a husband then thought of beautiful head with dark curling lock a lay in arm day lying in arm of arab with ishmael swarthy face above so tortured that swept away other consideration must not will not can not be told that brought to final thought since loved helena since helena loved not husband position in ishmael house be utterly false wrong must not possibly continue be not fair even to ishmael thought when struggling with conscience asked how be to put end to odious miserable situation concluded at once that must go boldly to ishmael tell whole story of helena error temptation thereby securing sympathy extricating of from position in be placed anything will be better than present state of thing thought a reflected upon difficult delicate task intended to undertake after moment saw that while must be hard to explain helena impulse of vengeance to man who have be object of to tell of message have sent into cairo must be utterly impossible can not say anything to ishmael about thought only logical sequence of idea be that must not say anything to ishmael at left with only one conclusion inasmuch a be impossible that helena must remain longer in house equally impossible that must leave with ishmael knowledge consent there be nothing for to do to fly away found hard to reconcile to idea of secret flight very thought of seemed to put into position of adulterer deceiving unsuspecting husband when remembered scene in guest room day moment of over powering love irresistible kiss then crushing sense of duplicity a ishmael entered without thought of treachery knelt between told that at cost whatsoever must put end to false position in lived must do soon sooner better thought though have lived so long with thought of losing helena that kiss have in moment put soul body into flame knew that love be blinding to certain serious consideration of must rise up later perhaps accuse of selfishness disloyalty worse must only think of helena now longing to posse made dead to everything else in fever of excitement began to think out plan for escape reflecting that two day have still to pas before train left khartoum by have be intended that must travel in character a ishmael messenger decided that be impossible for to wait for must get away at once by camel if not by rail remembering osman former guide companion concluded to go over to gordon college secure aid having reached point asked if ought not to obtain helena consent before going further must not wait even for then remembering how utterly crushed be victim of storm tempest bird with broken wing assumed attitude of strength towards telling be woman after be duty a man to think to act for so set out in haste to see osman when on way through town passed without being recognised former comrade in khaki colonel of lancer whose life have be darkened by loss of wife through treachery of brother officer felt qualm at at thought of taking helena from ishmael ours be different case altogether said then told that life must be brighter in future because have have terrible event in be late dark when returned from gordon college then old mahmud house be a busy a fair with people coming going on errand relating to impending pilgrimage watched opportunity to speak to helena a soon a ishmael who be more than commonly animated excited that night have dismissed follower gone to door to drive home approached whispered in ear helena yes can be ready to leave khartoum at four o'clock in morning for moment made reply seemed to incredible happiness that be really to go away together quickly collecting wandering thought answered yes can be ready then go down to post landing will be there with launch yes yes heart be beating furiously osman guide who brought here will be waiting with camel on other side of river yes yes yes be to ride a far a atbara take train from there to red sea what then god know what then must wait for direction of fate america perhaps a always hoped intended looked quickly round then took face between hand kissed to morrow morning at four o'clock whispered at four repeated thousand thought be flashing through mind asked further question at next moment went off to own quarter door of room be ajar face of arab woman who be within doing something with clothes of child seemed to wear same mocking smile a before helena be angry alarmed when asked if woman have seen heard have taken place between gordon danger loomed before in relation to flight confidence in gordon strength courage power to protect be absolute if intended to take away must do so not ishmael arab on earth must stop chapter xxiii gordon must not allow to sleep night lest must not be awake when hour came to go room shared with ishmael be large have one window looking to river to khartoum through window be open heard noise of desert town by night sometimes there be dead measured thud of camel tread on unpaved street sometimes light beat of donkey hoof at interval there be faint distant cry of night watchman from various part of town intersecting air like cross current of wireless telegraphy once hour there be guttural voice of black zogal at door of own house calling confession of faith there be god god god god have be late when ishmael came to bed even then being excited in high spirit finding gordon still awake have talked for long time in darkness of preparation for forthcoming pilgrimage hope of progress across desert three half mile hour fourteen hour day making month for journey altogether finding that gordon did not reply thinking must be sleepy wished good night blessed morning then with few more word be trustful affectionate warm hearted brotherly fell asleep be after twelve by time though gordon intended to rise at three seemed to that few hour between must never end listened to measured breathing of sleeping man counted cry outside time passed a if with foot of lead be never quite dark through luminous dark blue of southern night fretted with star nearly everything outside must be dimly seen of light be one most conducive to thought in spite of gordon must not help thinking obstinate question have be able to crush down during day be now rising to torment what will happen when household be now asleep awakes in morning asked knew quite well what must happen must soon be missed helena must be missed too must be concluded that have gone together after have banished picture rose to mind eye of confusion must ensue on discovery of flight set to defend be true that be breaking pledge have made to people when undertook to go into cairo have made promise under mistake a to own position therefore be not incumbent upon to keep now that knew truth be true that helena be breaking betrothal have entered into with ishmael too have acted under error therefore marriage be not binding upon conscience do what must to justify must not shake off sense of deceit even of treachery thought of ishmael how have heaped kindness honour upon since came to khartoum thought of helena of shame with flight must overwhelm man who considered husband go on something seemed to say in taunting whisper fly away seek own happiness think of nothing else be what came to khartoum for be what great hope aim amount to leave good man in midst of confusion have brought upon let go into cairo innocent though be die by cruel error of fate be good that be brave be worthy of man soldier against thought like tried to set memory of old mahmud word at meeting of sheikh man can not resist destiny if god will that must go into cairo will go god will protect there be really only one way to reconcile to what intended to do be to think of helena to keep beautiful face constantly before be on other side of wall must be awake now only other person in house who be not asleep thinking of waiting for hour when be to escape luminous dark blue of air died into soft red of early dawn wahhed of night watchman became le frequent call of black zogal stopped altogether be now three o'clock gordon who have not undressed rose to sitting position on bed brought face to face with ishmael whose angerib be on opposite side of room arab be sleeping peacefully too have lain down in clothes having to rise early have unrolled turban leaving nothing on head mecca skullcap made look like picture of saintly pope dim light be filtering through window rested on a lay in white garment under white sheepskin there be look of serenity of radiance almost of divinity in tranquil face gordon felt a if be thief murderer stealing from stabbing man who loved trusted have almost irresistible impulse to waken ishmael there then tell plainly what be about to do thought of helena came back again remembered that be quite impossible at length rose to go be still wearing hafiz slipper found stepping on toe to deaden sound of tread when got to door opened carefully so a to make noise just at moment sleeping man stirred began to speak in toneless voice of sleep nevertheless with accent of affection gordon have never heard from before ishmael said rani rani gordon stood listened not daring to move after moment be quiet again there be sound in room ishmael measured breathing a before how gordon got out at last never quite knew when recovered self possession be in guest room drawing aside curtain covered open doorway feeling cool fresh odourless desert air on hot face in nostril saw black zogal stretched out at bottom of wooden step fast asleep with staff beside insurgent dawn be sweeping up be silent within without save for nubian heavy snoring there be not sound about house feeling throat to be parched turned back to water niche for drink while be lifting can to lip eye fell on letter have be left for there having come by train arrived late night before then be specially delivered after have gone to bed letter be in black bordered envelope be addressed sheikh omar benani in care of ishmael ameer at first sight handwriting struck like familiar face before have time to recognise be conscious of crushing sense of fatality vague almost heart breaking impression that while have be spending long black hour of night in building up hope of flying away with helena little packet of sealed paper have time be waiting outside door to tell must not go took opened with trembling finger read at glance a one read picture be from hafiz told that mother be dead then pent up pain shame of night rolled over like breaking wave dropped down on nearest seat wept like child chapter xxiv contrary to gordon surmise helena have slept soundly with beautiful calm confidence of one who relied absolutely upon thought trouble be over awoke at half past three a promptly a if alarum clock have wakened arm of ayesha be then closely encircling neck be with difficulty that liberated without awakening child a soon a have done so must not resist impulse to kiss little one so boundless be happiness so entirely at moment have conquered sense that ishmael innocent daughter have be constant torture to then dressing rapidly in usual mixed eastern western costume throwing travelling cloak over shoulder instead of indian veil giving thought to other belonging must leave behind stepped lightly out of sleeping room moment entered guest room heard moan before realising where came from said who be there then gordon lifted tear stained face to face without speaking held out letter hung from helpless hand took read with sense of overwhelming disaster while gordon with access of grief at first moment of great sorrow presence of loved one brings heaped reproach upon a if that have done at hard bidding of conscience have be sin crime poor mother poor dear mother be who made last day unhappy hour went by in way time for going passed helena dared not tell that opportunity for flight be slipping away seemed like outrage to think of now so stood by side feeling powerless to comfort dazed by blow have shattered hope then black zogal being awakened by sound of gordon weeping came in with wild eye after came abdullah then zenoba who gathering idea of trouble went off to awaken ishmael old mahmud so that in little while whole of arab household be standing round gordon a sat doubled up on edge of divan when ishmael heard what have happened be deeply moved sitting down by gordon side took one of hand smoothed while in throbbing voice went to heart of everybody with look of suffering in swarthy face luminous black eye spoke sympathetic word life end in death brother world be place of going not of staying mystery of pain who can fathom life must be unbearable for one thought that god be over rule everything for best yes believe everything have have hour of sorrow too have always found so after while gordon be able to control grief then ishmael asked if must not read letter aloud with reluctance gordon did so required self control to repeat mother message leaving out usual arabic salutation began where hafiz said with heavy heart have to tell most dear brother that sweet saintly mother died morning have be sinking ever since went away end came so quickly that took by surprise gordon voice thickened ishmael said take time brother have consolation of religion think passed in peace there be only one thing clouded closing hour on deathbed be constantly expressing earnest hope that might all be re united father helena who be now so far apart take time o brother said ishmael seeing that helena also be moved took hand too a if to strengthen thus sat between comforting while gordon in husky voice struggled on not long before died wished to send message power of life be low in must not write except to sign name a see below then did not know where be to be found mother promised must take care that said must come to hand be word sent boy that last thought be about though be sorry took side of false false prophet ' go on brother go on said ishmael in soft voice be certain did what thought be right be sure tell died happy because because know will see again if be never to see in world will do so in world to come say say will be waiting for there tell will not seem long be with difficulty that gordon came to end for eye be full of tear throat be parched tight must have broken down altogether for sense of helena presence by side ishmael be now more deeply moved than before how must have loved said then began to speak of own mother what have done for be only poor ignorant woman perhaps died to save loved with heart at that two black servant abdullah zogal who have be standing before gordon in silence tried to utter homely word of comfort old mahmud wiping wet eye said may god be merciful to mother son forgive sin be saint never have replied gordon whereupon arab nurse who alone of household have looked on at scene with dry evil eye said bitterly nevertheless died a christian unbeliever therefore can not look for mercy then helena eye flashed like fire into woman face gordon felt blood rush to head ishmael be before zenoba ask pardon of god said before thunder of voice majesty of glance arab woman fell back heed not brother said ishmael turning back to gordon then added serve under same general though of wear uniform of red of brown of blue who serf best be best soldier in day of victory will general ask colour of garment at generous word gordon burst into tear once more ishmael said weep for one who have entered into joy of paradise when gordon have regained composure ishmael asked if must read part of letter again knowing what part must be part about prophet tried to excuse saying be not fit to read more then rani will read said ishmael far a helena must have fled from tragic ordeal must not escape from so in soft mellow voice read on without faltering until came to own name then stopped tear began to trickle down cheek go on said ishmael be afraid of what follows when helena came to false prophet turned to gordon said dear mother did know how much love know now added for dead know there be further interruption until helena have finished then ishmael said did know what work merciful have waiting for in khartoum perhaps did not know something called to come here something drew on of have not felt like god guide heart merciful make mistake nobody spoke gordon eye began to shine with light helena who be looking at have never seen in before same continued ishmael hear what mother say be not for to keep against will if wish to go back now none will reproach speak omar do wish to leave there be moment of tense silence in gordon hesitated helena waited breathlessly for reply then with great effort gordon answered el hamdullillah cried two black servant then ishmael sent zogal into town camp to say that faithful must bid farewell to omar in mosque following night that evening after sunset instead of delivering usual lecture to people squatting on sand in front of house ishmael read prayer for dead while gordon helena number of sheikh sat on divan in guest room when service be over company be breaking up old men pressed gordon hand a be passing out said may god give compensation a soon a be gone gordon approached helena whispered hurriedly must speak to soon where can be ought to go to water woman well by good landing to morrow morning said

to many wild ardent mind so that vast following of half civilised people whom have gathered up in soudan be to start soon may have started already for city believe to be mecca of new world well ishmael ameer pretend to have come to cairo in advance of follower to prepare for millennium what have really come for to establish political state down to moment consul general have be leaning back

general went to bed grand cadi story being so exactly what wanted to believe have thrown entirely off guard appeared to illuminate everything have looked dark mysterious sudden advent of ishmael growth of influence sending out of emissary projected pilgrimage gathering up of camel horse in such enormous quantity a even government must not have commanded in time of war accounted for ishmael presence in cairo mission a described by helena of drawing off allegiance of egyptian army accounted too for treachery of minister pasha notable who be too shrewd too selfish whatever riff raff of soudan might be to risk comfortable income for religious chimera yes khedive money substantial prospect of establishing vast arab empire not vague hope of spiritual millennium have be power that worked wonder vexed to think that old enemy whom have banished have be more powerful in exile than at home tortured to reflect that ishmael have developed with religious malady of mahdi political mania a well matter must be more than match for force when great historical drama came to be played before eye of astonished humanity must be seen that have saved not england only europe perhaps civilisation thus for three triumphant hour consul general saw a patriot trampling on enemy of country hardly have left library begun to climb stair of great empty echoing house switching off light a

of have pledged good old man to secrecy on subject for present at event giving confident assurance that in common with best of ulema be being wickedly deceived made innocent instrument for destruction of own cause dear helena be right vague suspicion of damnable intriguer grand cadi be justified already realise that after fruitless effort to inveigle ishmael into scheme of anarchical rebellion be who conceived conspiracy have taken friend by storm in form of passive mutiny of egyptian army accursed scoundrel know well can not be passive that somewhere somehow will break into active resistance be precisely what desire a told be old trick of caiaphas over again be lowest meanest dirtiest thing in history query be playing same game with consul general be sure be when think that england father

right again grand cadi continues to pay secret visit to consul general that much hafiz must say from intercourse with mother be sufficient to tell that by keeping running sore open with father

surprise to be told that ishmael ameer be already in cairo already did say that have be here for three week that came by same train a wearing costume of bedouin sheikh that dear nuneham be incredible said sirdar with buoyant laugh be certainly true that bedouin sheikh travelled in same train with from soudan that be ishmael ameer in disguise be of course utterly unbelievable why so because week after left khartoum heard that ishmael be still living there because other day since then have brought advice from governor saying man be coming across desert with people dear friend said consul general in judging of east one must use eastern weight measure race must for fourteen century accept preposterous tradition that be not jesus christ who be crucified one else who took on likeness died

outside cairo said consul general then in slow deep firm voice grown old husky unburdened for first time telling of helena departure for khartoum on errand of vengeance of letter from there announcing ishmael intention of coming into cairo in advance of people in order to draw off allegiance of egyptian army of ishmael arrival residence at house of chancellor of el azhar of visit of princess

oriental revolution be present that while dear friend have be holding hand in soudan for fear of repeating error of two thousand year ago troubling about pontius pilate moral force versus physical one giving benefit of catchword of christian socialism western democracy conspiracy of gigantic proportion have be gathering about sirdar usually ruddy face whitened listened with dumb vague wonder while consul general went on with burst of bitter humour to describe one by one mean have taken to defeat enemy by whom be surrounded so see too said at last lifting unconsciously tired voice that by time to morrow will have defeated worst conspiracy have ever be made even in egypt meted out sternly retributive justice to author of put end to form of resistance whether passive active silenced chatter

why must think so go to bed said consul general with obvious relief woman turned to go wait cried how long have be in room only little moment oh lord replied fatimah after that two men went to library time passed before conversation be resumed sirdar lit cigar puffed in silence while consul general who did not smoke sat in arm chair with wrinkled hand clasped before breast at sirdar said came of helena letter from khartoum be suggested by said consul general told be there must not imagine what be doing what errand be good heaven what revenge make one shiver carry one back to age better age

forgiving anaemic god of day god who doe nothing god of day be at least god of mercy of pity of love said sirdar be lay figure friend who permit wrong without avenging in short god at illogical inconsequential useless creature sirdar made further resistance consul general went on to defend helena impulse of vengeance by assailing christian spirit of forgiveness there be at least something natural logical a well a majestic magnificent in old ideal of jehovah new ideal of jesus be contrary to nature opposed to law of life 'love enemy 'do good to that hate ' 'if man smite thee on right cheek turn to other also besist not evil ' 'if man take away thy coat let have thy cloak also impossible fatal if be christianity be christian when be hit hit back when be injured demand justice only way other must lead to triumph of worst element in humanity what do everybody else doe everybody though hypocrisy of modern world will not permit people to admit consul general have risen be tramping

resumed concerned danger of arab empire according to grand cadi khedive with help of ishmael expected to found what must mean said consul general utter annihilation of unbeliever doe not word ' signify hero who slays infidel doe not mollah when recites khuttab in mosque invoke divine wrath on non moslem what then establishment of arab empire must mean revolt of whole eastern world against western world return to brutality intolerance of farrago of moribund nonsense known a sacred law sirdar made reply after moment consul general said then think of spectacle of conquering mohammedan army in cairo if citadel arsenal of capital must be occupied by horde outside must not be merely england power in egypt must be ended english empire a world force must be injured must be western civilisation must in end be destroyed mohammedan in india must think that what brother in cairo have done might do result must be incalculable chaos unlimited anarchy turning back of clock ten century consul general returned to seat saying friend catastrophe so appalling a can not be left to chance if be necessary to blow fifty thousand fanatic out of mouth of gun rather than lay fate of world open to irretrievable ruin will do depends on truthfulness of grand cadi story be so asked sirdar consul general bent head first test of truthfulness be whether not thousand of ishmael follower be armed force again consul general bent head well said sirdar rising throwing away cigar be bound to tell that see reason to think be more than will not believe that when boy took serious step must have sided with white prophet if have suspected that man aim included attack upon england power in egypt can not imagine for moment that must be fool enough not to know again consul general frowned sirdar went on firmly believe thought knew that ishmael ameer propaganda be purely spiritual establishment of era of universal peace brotherhood be world question having nothing to do with england egypt arab empire except so far a consul general who be cut to quick by sirdar praise of gordon must bear more only old woman of sex look for era of universal peace said testily in case replied sirdar old woman

came from people at tent mouth torment must make tongue wag said one beat innocent until guilty confess be good maxim o master said zewar in rasping tone black zogal with wild eye stepped out a if to lay hold of lad ishmael waved back wait said be looking at helena again face have undergone fearful change boy said still keeping eye on helena if tell must give back to people at that boy broke into paroxysm of hysterical sob master will not do see said tearing wider torn caftan so a to expose breast master will kill at next moment helena hand be on ishmael arm let boy go said can tell rest gloomy chill traversed ishmael heart have sense of spiritual paralysis a if everything in world be crumbling crashing down to impotent wreck ruin people at tent mouth be muttering among dismissed sending everybody away including boy arab woman most of went off grudgingly ungraciously for first time reluctant to obey will then closed up mouth of tent be once more alone with helena chapter iv in spite of dread with for more than month helena have looked forward to hour in ishmael must hear of betrayal felt none of terror from cause have feared expected must think of nothing gordon where be now what be doing to seemed to be only possible explanation of arrest that scheme for salvation of people have failed must be handed over to military authority must be tried by court martial what must be punishment of offence a soldier sinking down on angerib pressed hand over brow over eye that might think of shut out everything else meantime mind of ishmael be going through conflict a strange le cruel although plain evidence of sens have already told that have be betrayed by woman loved yet dread of discovering traitor in own tent in own wife filled with terror tried to escape from having fastened up tent walked to fro for moment without speaking then sitting down by helena side taking hand smoothing said in throbbing quivering voice rani have eaten bread salt together be faithful with what woman sent that letter helena hardly heard what be saying be still thinking of gordon will condemn to death told rani said ishmael again have lived under same roof have shared with closest secret of soul tell what woman sent that letter helena looked at tried to listen gordon doom be ringing in ear drowned other sound of life rani said ishmael once more though denied right of husband yet be wife life have be united not by man by god in presence of whose name be exalted of who read heart ask what woman sent that letter helena heard yet terrible a question be perilous a knew answer must be felt fear if tell thought why not doe not matter now rani said ishmael yet again god give right to command do command what woman sent that letter did said helena though word be spoken in faltering whisper seemed to ishmael like deafening roar allah allah cried leaping to foot for though have expected that reply reeled under a under blow helena realised what answer meant to again from bottom of heart pitied at next moment thought swung back to own trouble remembered that father have admitted that british army in egypt be always on active service asked what must happen to gordon if military authority lost head in fear of insurrection must try by field general court martial in case must court be called instantly must inquiry last only few minute must sentence be carried into immediate effect o god can be possible that be over already asked meantime ishmael after moment of suffering seemed hour of eternity be again struggling to resist only conclusion fact have left to be true that rani have confessed to sending letter have led to arrest of messenger heart rebelled against inference that have intended to betray cause people have not cast in own lot with have not come from distant country richer home to live in poor house in khartoum have not endured hardship of desert journey in company like man who have be shipwrecked in whirlwind of darkness be groping blindly through tempestuous wave for mean of rescue at length sort of raft of hope came to helpless impotent thing clung to sitting down by helena side again said in same piteous voice a before see how have be o rani did not intend to betray people poor people whose suffering have seen whose faith hope dream have shared witnessed be omar be thinking of heart have never forgiven for taking place meant for husband be jealous of for sake jealousy got better of judgment ' will punish ' thought ' will make mission of effect so sent that letter did not reflect that in destroying omar must be destroying people also be wrong be cruel be woman fault have seen suffered for ever since jealousy of omar perhaps hatred of omar be be not o rani voice be breaking a spoke for pitiful explanation have lighted upon be failing to bring conviction to own mind yet fixed sad eye eagerly on helena face repeated jealousy of omar perhaps hatred of omar be what caused to send letter helena must not speak pathos of error be choking replied to with look required word to interpret said not of omar of whom then helena must not lie must know day thought of whom then repeated in helpless confusion replied allah allah said in breathless whisper rising to foot again striding across tent at first moment after helena confession seemed to ishmael that sun moon have suffered eclipse world be in total darkness why have rani betrayed from what motive for what object tried to follow thought found impossible to do so there be short period of frightful silence then feeling a if wanted to cry drew up before helena again said in husky voice swarthy face trembling twitching why o rani have done wrong from day came to did must for must to make night peaceful morning happy why have heart be so far away from helena felt that time have come to tell everything yet in order to do so must begin with death of father must not speak of without involving gordon be impossible thought absolutely impossible speak said ishmael when sent letter to english lord must have known that be dooming to death what have done to deserve can not tell can not can not answered be unnecessary said ishmael in moment of helena silence terrible explanation of conduct have come to thought saw a by flash of lightning into dark abyss be at foot manner have be gentle down to moment suddenly became harsh voice have be soft became hard when did send letter demanded saw stern closing of lip for instant felt afraid be before meeting of sheikh at omar be chosen yes replied if gordon be to be condemned to death be of consequence what became of told english lord that ishmael be coming to cairo yes deep impenetrable eye seemed to be looking through through with what object in in what disguise yes knew be dashing to destruction matter when sent letter said to 'ishmael will go into cairo letter will go before ' yes yes in lowest depth of soul felt that if killed now did not care when omar stepped into place have meant for thought 'the letter wrote to destroy ishmael will destroy omar instead ' yes be that why tried to prevent omar from going yes tear be choking utterance why be unwilling to make kufiah yes why fainted in mosque bowed head being unable to utter word then said ishmael voice rose to husky cry then be love of omar not hatred of inspired letter made reply filled a be with shame for what have done to ishmael image of gordon be still in mind even at moment when terrible consequence threatened must not help thinking of if be tried by field general court martial to night might be executed in morning thought carried back to citadel be on drilling ground in dead grey light of dawn regiment of soldier be drawn up in line six of stood out from rest with rifle to shoulder before standing alone with back to rampart be one condemned dauntless man last thought be about be saying to living in cruel dream burst into tear again ishmael misunderstood weeping again wave of compassion passed over be possible be wrong said may be judging unjustly in case tell so will kiss foot will ask pardon sho must not speak will end in way thought in name of heaven speak tell love man tell be wrong cried be not wrong said do love be in despair have said be true can not help be wicked woman life by side have be deception from first with burst into flood of tear falling face downward on angerib buried head in pillow allah allah said ishmael blood in body seemed to flush heart be passing through supreme phase of agony perhaps cruellest that man can suffer agony of knowing that woman loved woman worshipped loved worshipped man in cloud of maddening thought sprang to brain imagined read mystery of helena conduct from first remembering that have called black man wild deep heart in rose to fever of jealous wrath see how have be said white man came to tent welcomed loved trusted be brother slept by side made free of harem put honour in hand how did repay by robbing of love be love heart be heart tried to speak to protest in torrent of wrath bore down white man have over reached though ' will outdo ishmael in eye thought have only fallen into pit be dug for let perish there curse of god be upon again tried to protest again in blind hurricane of anger silenced be nothing to that in betraying be betraying people also poor people who have suffered so much followed so faithfully face be terrible have sullen glow of western sky before storm have wrecked hope in hour of fulfilment have made dust ash of expectation of people have uncovered nakedness made thing to point finger at to scorn have turned heart to stone then wild anguish of jealous man became united to fierce wrath of fanatic going nearer to helena leaning over said worse than that hundredfold worse have made plan promise of god of avail have allowed evil one to enter into heart to use guilty passion to defeat scheme of most high therefore said raising quivering voice until rang through tent like tortured cry therefore a instrument of satan have right to live say have right even to live who have loved whose heart have be wrapped about like rope about wheel of well whom have betrayed destroyed people with be yes be who must who must helena heard stammering sobbing over at same time felt that trembling ferocious hand be laying hold of felt that long eastern veil have hung down back be being wrapped around throat felt that fold be growing tighter yet tighter that be being strangled be losing consciousness then suddenly became aware that ishmael formidable grasp have slackened that have stepped back from angerib on lay be saying to in tremulous whisper allah allah what be be doing allah allah allah at next moment realised that in horror of own impulse have turned fled out of tent chapter v being left alone helena emotion be so strange so bewildering so overpowering that must not immediately make out clearly what felt most contradictory thought feeling crowded upon first came sense of suffocating shame due to ishmael hideous misconception of relation to gordon put into position of unfaithful wife must truth have be better that be not indian rani not muslemah that gordon have known loved other before ishmael came into life that desire to punish for coming between have be impulse have taken to khartoum next came sense of utter degradation during recent scene in lip have be sealed have be compelled to submit to ishmael just natural wrath then came sense of abject humiliation with thought that ishmael have be right from beginning have be wrong therefore have merited have come to if have killed must have forgiven told finally perhaps from deep place in jewish blood came feeling that after be not so much ishmael who have be shaming for treachery a almighty who have be punishing for attempting to take vengeance out of hand vengeance be mine lord impious act have deserved penalty have overtaken against opposing fighting conquering triumphing over be memory of love for gordon loved must not have acted otherwise thought more plainly than ever now saw that love for gordon have be first cause origin of have done single hearted devotion left nothing else to think about wiped out ishmael troublesand trouble of people may be selfish cruel can not help told again again a continued to lie where ishmael have left face down on angerib shaken with sob after while heard step approaching arab woman have entered tent so be there oh beauty said zenoba with bitter ring in voice without raising head to look helena knew that usual obsequious smile have gone from woman face that eye be full of undisguised contempt in moment impulse of hatred have scoured through jealous soul for month fell on helena in bitter reproach knew must come to always told so must not listen 'ask pardon of god zenoba ' said now will have to ask pardon of helena must hardly control with effort submitted in silence let woman have way anybody might have seen be going on from moment white christian came to khartoum be use talking when man look at woman see eye not heart be blind to that love serve own heart be beating violently paintully compelled to lie still be more than deserve thought then arab woman lashed to bone with report of what people in camp be saying have happened might have be foreseen who have tried to emancipate woman have be first to suffer for good woman did not wish to be emancipated bad woman who let veil fall meddled with affair of men only wanted to imitate evil way of woman of west mother did not do neither will wife said while others declared that be better to have thousand enemy outside house than one within camp be utterly disorganised utterly demoralised instead of singing rejoicing of hour ago there be now wailing lamentation instead of prayer praise there be cursing swearing of people in state of panic be saying that soldier of christian government must soon be upon that must be shot dead with bullet that must be carried into cairo a prisoner crucified in public street that christian must eat flesh suck blood that who be not slain must be walking skeleton talking image made to worship wooden cross instead of own god allah a consequence many be packing baggage hurriedly turning head of camel to south boat be being unmoored at bedrasheen boat load be preparing to push off desolation be over whole camp hope of people be in dust of woman be kneeling on ground throwing sand over head face of men be heaping insult on ishmael name former love reverence being already gone where be promise made be asking be for brought from home others be calling searching for master tent be empty be nowhere to be seen have deserted in hour of trouble where be be cry what have become of one knew even black zogal must not say then be cry ela'an abu abu abu cursed be father father father father father father worse far worse because more fierce terrible than people anger against ishmael be wrath against white woman be who have betrayed for evil influence secret scheme might have inherited egypt rich land treasure of valley of nile listen be gathering about tent murmuring shouting excitedly hark be zogal voice be persuading to go away will come back oh beauty said zenoba better get away before return tear to piece a hungry jackal tear dog with merciless word bitter hearted woman took off leaving helena still lying face down on angerib in agony of mingled anger shame being once more left alone in tent helena continued to know what be going on in camp wailing of woman who be throwing sand over head seemed a if must never cease at length of began to sing sang song of sorrow contrasted strangely with song of victory men have sung before weird monotonous moving note be peculiar to arab music sounded like dirge in depth of night people be in despair consoling inspiring idea of divine guidance be gone hope have sustained soul through toil of desert march be dead myth of ishmael divinity have already disappeared master be no longer redeemer mahdi christ have be hideous illusion mirage of soul without reason reality be terrible be horrible be almost a if whole people have died hour ago in sure certain hope then suddenly awakened in other world to find that there be god heaven reward for pain of life have looked for expected have be shadow of dream listening to a lay on angerib thinking be partly to blame for helena asked if there be anything must do to save ishmael people o god be there nothing can do thought at first there came answer to question do what must to fix mind on people suffering ishmael downfall mind swung back to old subject once again thought of gordon arrest thing in regard be plainer to now idea of field general court martial have made chill with fear have be figment of over excited brain have happened to gordon effort in interest of peace whether have failed succeeded own trial must take ordinary course military court of usual kind must have to be summoned sentence must have to be confirmed only king must confirm must take time therefore there be need for panic meantime what be gordon position have be arrested in mistake for ishmael consequently must one way be liable to punishment for ishmael offence be to say for offence have attributed to ishmael yet gordon have done no wrong have intended no evil be there nothing can hing at ail asked again suddenly light dawned on if consul general must be made to see what gordon motif have really be to save england to save egypt to save good name of own father if must be made to realise ishmael aim be not rebellion follower not armed force merely vast concourse of religious visionary what then then a just man if stern hard one must be compelled to see that own son be not punished perhaps who must say might even permit ishmael people to enter cairo vague undefined unconsidered a idea be helena leapt at a solution of difficulty when asked how be to bring conviction to consul general mind remembered gordon letter nothing must be better being written before event intended for eye only must be convincing to anybody absolutely irresistible to father private matter intimate affectionate full of closest secret of soul never mind sho must share with one who be flesh of gordon flesh for heart must be with issue be life death yes must go into cairo see consul general show gordon letter prove explain everything thus who have be first cause of people suffering of ishmael downfall of gordon arrest must be gordon ishmael people deliverer yes wait have not promised gordon that must remain in camp happened have that promise be annulled by time while great errand must be precisely what have be sent there for by flying away now must be fulfilling destiny in wider deeper sense than even gordon must have conceived will go at once thought sprang up from angerib to carry out purpose a did so saw little ugly black face blubbered over with tear on ground beside be mosie be kissing hem of skirt saying mosie very sorry not know will lady ever forgive mosie helena heart leapt up at sight of boy wanted help immediately unexpected appearance at moment be like assurance from heaven that what intended to do ought to be done comforting lad drying eye asked in breathless whisper number of question where be donkey on have ridden into camp be near by tethered did know way to railway station at bedrasheen did must lead there through darkness must be now half past nine must there be train to cairo soon yes for alim have just gone to catch one be to go to boukq daorour at ten o'clock very thing said helena bring donkey to back of tent wait there until come yes yes said boy now ablaze with eagerness kissing hand alternately shot out on errand then helena picked up little locked handbag contained gordon precious letter added own letter to after extinguishing lamp hung from pole stepped out of tent few minute later mounted on donkey be led by boy woman looking like egyptian with black skirt drawn over back of head closely clipped under nose be picking way through darkness be quiet by time weeping wailing have at last come to end from vast encampment there rose nothing deep somnambulent moan ascends from great city when be falling asleep fire be smouldering out people such of a remained be lying in tent others outstretched on sand weary heart broken in misery of dead hope dead dream dead faith kind of soulless silence hung in air even call of night watchman god be one be more to be heard only braying of donkey at interval ruckling of camel barking of dog there be moon star be thick one of be falling chapter vi taking steam launch have be moored to boat landing of ghezirah palace consul general returned home immediately after gordon arrest did not wait to say what be to be done with prisoner to tell official what further step if be to be taken to prevent expected insurrection one overwhelming event have wiped everything else out of mind plan have be frustrated have be degraded made laughing stock by gordon own son a launch skimmed across river in darkness must hear in back wash of propeller guffaw of diplomatic corp in throbbing of engine choking laughter of whole world mind be going like weaver shuttle be asking by what sinister development of fate devilish surprise have be brought about must find answer in baffling mystery of event only one thing seemed clear that gordon when disappeared from cairo after affair of el azhar have not gone to america india australia a everybody have supposed straight to man ishmael camp that have allowed to be used by charlatan mummer to further intrigue against own father too father who have be thinking of day night nearly night be now by instrumentality made object of derision contempt fool fool fool thought consul general anger against gordon burnt in heart like fierce consuming fire on reaching agency went to room rang violently for fatimah somebody within own household have become aware of plan revealed to enemy have little doubt of identity of traitor for remembered fatimah unexpected appearance in dining room night before confusion lame excuse when sirdar observed

word what be have be doing woman demanded in stern voice whereupon fatimah made attempt at disguise must help o master said breaking into tear must have given eye be same a own son have suckled at breast can woman deny anything to own consul general looked down at for moment in silence drooping lower lip trembled then with gesture of impatience said get away to room at once opening door for closed locked when be gone momentary spasm of tenderness towards gordon have come to consul general at sight of foster mother love disappeared at next instant only excuse must find for son conduct in duping ignorant egyptian nurse be that perhaps have be duped after first plan have be formed in khartoum helena letter have be dispatched fanatic hypocrite have probably discovered that intrigue have become known in cairo then have put gordon into gap gordon have be so simple so innocent so stupid a to be deceived there be small comfort in reading of riddle consul general fury shame increased tenfold fool fool fool thought taking from mantelpiece portrait of boy in arab fez looked at for moment then flung back impatiently fell to floor minute passed in infuriated man be unconscious of

by throat wring neck a must wring neck of bird of prey quarter of hour passed hour still two men did not speak consul general did not return chapter viii meantime helena in room still wearing mixed eastern western dress be sitting by table in attitude of supplication with arm outstretched hand clasped across corner of speaking earnestly rapidly to consul general who be standing with head down in front of pale in spite of heat of south sun of desert very nervous flurried little ashamed yet with sense of urgent necessity be telling have happened since left cairo how have gone to khartoum under impulse of revenge be inspired by mistaken idea of cause of father death how being there have be compelled to accept position of ishmael nominal wife go back with errand unfulfilled how have come to know of base proposal of certain of ulema how at length when ishmael have succumbed to last of have written dispatched letter saying be coming into cairo in disguise then in soft voice with deep note told of gordon arrival in khartoum of own tragic mistake awful suffering of confession to of confession to of how realised error found powerless to overtake undo finally told consul general of gordon determination to take ishmael place being impelled to do so by firmest conviction that father be being deceived by one in cairo by certainty that ishmael must not otherwise be moved from fanatical purpose that while consequence of own arrest must be merely personal to result of ishmael death at hand of authority might be holy war must put egypt in right england in wrong cover father honoured name with old man listened eagerly standing a long a must on same spot then walking to fro with nervous irregular step stopping at interval a if breathless from overpowering sense of hand of fate having finished story helena produced gordon letter from little handbag hung from one of arm having kissed a if consul general have not be present began with panting affection to read passage from in proof of what have said being woman knew by instinct what to read first one by one came passionate word told of gordon affection for father whom felt bound to resist bey father ' read great man who

what right have to say so listen said helena read gordon account of visit to grand cadi when oily scoundrel have called father slave of power evil doer adventurer great assassin then why did come like man tell asked consul general listen again sir said helena read what gordon have said of impulse to go to father in order to disclose grand cadi duplicity then of reason restraining being sure that father be aiming at coup that acting from high sense of duty consul general must hand over to military authority before work have come to do have be done did see what be doing aiding abetting conspiracy listen once more please said helena read what gordon have said of ishmael pilgrimage that while father thought prophet be bringing up armed force be merely leading vast multitude of religious visionary who be expecting to establish in cairo millennium of universal faith empire even so be necessary to do what did demanded consul general listen for last time sir said helena then in soft earnest pleading voice read 'it be necessary to prevent massacre know father doe not must inevitably ensue necessary to save father from execration of civilised world necessary to save ishmael from tragic consequence of determined fanaticism necessary to save england ' give to said consul general taking almost snatching letter out of helena hand in fierce nervous tension left time to think of courtesy then drawing chair up to table fixing eyeglass over spectacle turned page one by one read passage here there helena watched while did so in changing expression of hitherto hard immobile implacable face saw effect be being produced can not say how hard be to to be engaged in secret mean to frustrate father plan be like fighting one own flesh blood be not fair warfare can say what struggle have be to a english soldier to make up mind to intercept order of british army be like playing traitor can scarcely bear to think of same know be necessary also know god know be necessary

terrible upheaval of soul most bitter sorrowful reflection first thought be about helena that sweetness loveliness have be joy by day dream by night belonged not to to be nothing to told greater grief than felt at thought seemed to surpass bound of possibility there be worse behind at next moment of anguish remembered that not only did helena not love be repulsive to see be hateful odious to that be black man be white woman be more than heartrending be physically excruciating like poison creeping under skin have spiritual torture also who have built life on belief that son daughter of men be child of one father have found out in moment in twinkling of eye within own camp in own tent that nature gave lie to faith that be only a black man to white woman whom called wife thought that where love be there must be race colour be wrong quite wrong told again seemed a if everything have built up soul be crumbling away even worse than be thought helena have betrayed who have seemed to sacrifice so much pitiful delusion cruel snare be maddening to think of merely human side of betrayal between guilty wife lover be only husband who have to be got rid of spiritual aspect be still more terrible who have allowed to believe that be specially guided by god that merciful have made messenger have be deceived duped be more than poor weak helpless man who have be led away by love for woman

then content to be man recalling one by one touching memory of life with adila in prison brightened by ray of love in poor desert home illuminated more than palace by expectation of child be to come heart failed wanted to curse destiny have led to greatness wherein be vain wild insurrection in soul have left time to think course be taking wandering across sakkara desert have by time come to foot of sphinx calm immovable tremendous great scarred face be gazing in passionless meditation into luminous starlight asking a have asked through long yesterday of past a will continue to ask through long to morrow of future everlasting question question of humanity question of suffering soul why why must man aim higher than can reach why must give up joy of humanity for divine dream can never be realised why must be victim to devilish power within without be always waiting to betray destroy why must god forsake just when be striving to serve best allah allah why why cried higher nature speedily regained supremacy came to a flash of light in darkness that true explanation of downfall be that god be punishing for presumption in allowing idolatry of people to carry away from first humility to forget proper place a man to think of a if be god led to thought of atonement in moment image of death came to own death a sacrifice began to see what have now to do have to take have

of death before must now be borne remembered unbridled wrath with rani ferocious violence felt ashamed be almost impossible to believe that have really laid hand upon tried to strangle remembered how have left face down on angerib in misery remorse picture in mind eye of weeping woman in tent made heart bleed with pity must go back to people might suspect that be author of trouble in fury might threaten must conceal fault must take sin upon must cover with cloak thought thus thirsting with desire to drink cup of degradation to dreg ishmael got back to camp be full of touching sight instead of flare of light tumult of excited crowd have left behind there be now only ash of dying fire melancholy moanings of people who be sitting about made way first to helena tent standing by mouth of

must like to cut tongue out helena be unhurt held up head for first time day to princess surprise when re entered room officer made way for pushed through to front took seat back to wall immediately before sirdar almost face to face with gordon there be that tense atmosphere in court always precedes sentence there be also sort of humid air a if angel of pity have passed through place softened to tear gordon be told to rise then president obviously affected proceeded to address might say at once that judge regretted to find unable to take account of moral aspect of case nothing military aspect came within cognisance that being so court notwithstanding able ingenious defence must find excuse for insubordination first duty of soldier be to obey in like manner must find excuse for savage personal attack by officer in uniform upon officer in exercise of office be conduct to prejudice of good order military discipline finally court must find excuse for desertion be act of great offence to flag soldier be sworn to serve under circumstance continued president court have alternative to find guilty of crime with have be charged though be within court discretion to mitigate penalty of offence have decided after anxious deliberation remembering grave fact that force in egypt be on active service not to exercise right out of regard to high record a soldier great provocation certainly suffered to content with recommending to mercy thus leaving issue to higher authority therefore whatever result of recommendation be now duty very painful duty to pronounce upon charles george gordon lord full sentence prescribed by military law death there be solemn silence until president last word be spoken when eye be turned towards gordon bore with absolute self possession there be slight quivering of eyelid quick glint of steel grey eye in direction of opposite side of court nothing more then thrilling incident occurred helena whose head have be down be seen to rise in seat to raise thick dark veil one moment stood there back to wall with magnificent pale face strength courage looking steadily across at prisoner a if nobody else be present in room then a quietly a have risen sank back to place oh sublime power of love oh pitiful impotence of word everybody felt thousand inexpressible thing simple act be meant to convey gordon be first to feel when guard touched on arm turned went out with step rang on marble floor firm a rock a court broke up one of officer be heard to whisper hoarsely be worthy of what more be there to say at last moment sirdar turned to whispered must

greatest triumph however be with colonel macdonald must have help too said to princess whereupon highness put finger to nose answered if must heart must remember when want dog service address a beir ' did with blush told colonel be dear divine falsehood that gordon have said have have personal animosity against be sorry if at moment of undue excitement have behaved badly curmudgeon took apology according to kind saying that in opinion officer who struck brother officer publicly before men deserved to be shot drummed out of army still if colonel lord be ashamed of what have done helena eye flashed with anger compelled to smile to say be assure be before big highlander knew what be doing have written to headquarters at helena dictation to say that inasmuch a own quarrel with colonel gordon lord have be composed that count in offence might so far a be concerned be wiped out sweet double face told how good noble even christ like be of then marching off with letter said to herself brute meantime hafiz acting through uncle chancellor got ulema of el azhar to send message to foreign minister saying with many eastern flourish that what general graf have ordered gordon to do what subordinate have done be deep injury to religious susceptibility of mohammedan people besides sirdar sent secretary with gordon letter ream of written explanation of conduct to permanent head of war office friend firm disciplinarian man of strong humanity why have prisoner refused to plead because did not wish to accuse dead general why have made explanation of desertion of conduct at time of arrest because did not wish to impeach father why have intercepted order of army because have be inspired solely by desire to prevent tumultuous effusion of blood have prevented finally a technical point of highest importance must be deemed that troop in egypt be on active service when there be such declaration to effect a section of army act required within two day everything be done then there be nothing left to await result helena wanted to go up to see gordon be afraid to do so when sorrow be shared be lessened suspense be divided be increased after five day sirdar began to hear from london to send news to helena over telephone matter be to be submitted to majesty personally have objection to king seeing gordon letter so very intimate well what of king be good fellow there be nothing in world touched so nearly a beautiful woman except woman in love in trouble then came two day of grim unbroken silence then burst of great news in consideration of colonel lord distinguished record a soldier unblemished character a man out of regard to obvious purity of intention undoubted fact that order disobeyed have led to irreparable result remembering great provocation have received not forgetting valuable service rendered by father to england to egypt king have be graciously pleased to grant free pardon under great seal coming first a private message from head of war office threw sirdar into ecstasy of joy called up consul general immediately repeated glad word over telephone answer came back to except old man audible breathing a quivered over wire then thought of helena with soldier terror of tear in eye of woman even tear of joy decided to let hafiz carry news to tell to go up to citadel break good tidings to gordon said speaking to egyptian headquarters nothing loath hafiz went bounding along to house of princess blurted out big message expecting that must be received with cry of delight to bewilderment helena heard with fear trembling becoming weak womanish at once seemed to be about to faint hafiz with proper masculine simplicity became alarmed at princess began to laugh what cried have be a brave a lion with cub while man life have be in danger to go mooing now now like cow with sick calf helena recovered after moment then hafiz delivered sirdar mandate that be to go up to citadel break good news to gordon dare dare said still trembling what cried

watery smile declared must go if hafiz must go with hafiz be ready in le than hour be driving up to citadel in princess carriage with footman saises eunuch highness for emancipation thought necessary to female propriety in public everything went well until reached fortress then going up stone staircase to gordon quarter helena began to tremble more than ever oh oh dare must go home whispered lord not now said hafiz remember up there be one who think be going to die while here be who know be life will be doubly sweet if be that take back to come sister come give arm then said helena panting with emotion perilously near to point of tear went up on shaking limb to door at two soldier armed to teeth be standing on guard at moment gordon in officer bright room have be given to a cell be leaning on sill of open window looking steadfastly down at object in white city below during past six day have known what be being done on behalf desire for life have thought dead in have quickened to suspense pain to ease feeling have smoked innumerable cigarette made pretence of reading illustrated paper brother officer have poured in upon out of otherwise dumb helpless sympathy few minute of day have leaned out of window to look first with certain pang at heavy lidded house contained father next with certain sense of tear at green spot covered with cypress tree contained be left of mother finally with certain yearning at trellised eastern palace of princess nazimah contained helena be what be doing at moment when helena hafiz be ascending stair just a be asking for hundredth time why helena did not come to see heard guard gruff tone mingled with woman mellow voice deep note among soft one sent blood in body galloping to heart turning round saw door of room open helena herself on threshold one moment stood there with sweet care worn face growing red in passion of joy then rushed at fell on breast throwing arm about neck cry such news gordon oh gordon bring such good good news such news dear such news oh such good news thus trying to tell tidings at breath told nothing continued to laugh sob kiss say what good news brought yet word be needle before hafiz whose fat wet face be shining like round window on april day must whisper king pardon gordon like true lover be have said have meant bring nothing so good a dearest nothing chapter xv helena be with following morning when one of guard came in hurriedly announced amid gust of breath that consul general be coming upstairs not without certain nervousness gordon rose to receive father met at door with hand outstretched old man took one of quietly with air of person who be struggling hard to hold in check took helena hand also when must have left room prevented no said sit down child resume seat seemed to gordon that father looked whiter feebler yet even firmer of will than ever like lion have be shot be dying hard lip be compressed a took chair gordon offered when spoke voice be hard little bitter first let give good news said be pardon asked gordon something else perhaps in sense something better said old man have received unofficial message from war office to say that king taking half measure intended to promote gordon to rank of major general appoint to command of british force in egypt helena must hardly contain joy at fresh proof of good fortune gordon made demonstration watched pained expression in old man face felt sure that something else be coming be remarkable perhaps unparalleled instance of clemency continued consul general under circumstance may be said to open up a momentous mission a be ever confided to military commander father asked gordon not without effort old man laughed flush overspread pale face for moment then said oh be dismissed dismissed gordon have gasped helena lip have parted that be what come to stated in plain word without diplomatic flourish true have sent in resignation long short of be that after debate on address carrying of amendment downing street have agreed that time have come to associate people of egypt with government of country well sir well a be policy against have always set face policy have considered premature perhaps suicidal secretary of state have cabled that being unable to ask to carry into effect change be repugnant to principle be reluctantly compelled to accept resignation gordon must not speak again old man tried to laugh of course pill be gilded continued clasping blue veined hand in front of breast foreign secretary told parliament that resignation on ground of age ill health naturally be heaviest blow have fallen on english public life within living memory also said that while other method might be necessary for future none must have be so good a mine in past then king yes father hard half ironical smile passed over old man face king have be graciously pleased to grant earldom even to make knight of garter there be moment painful silence then consul general said so go home immediately immediately by to night train to take p o to morrow ' said old man bowing over clasped hand to morrow why not secretary can do without why must linger on stage on be no longer leading actor only supernumerary better make exit with what grace can under semi cynical tone gordon must see father emotion found impossible to utter word thought must come up before going away bring good news though be almost like father who be deposed congratulating son who be to take place say that sir said gordon why must why must gird at fortune be strange nevertheless how history repeat came to egypt to wipe

grant gordon must not speak confess have faith in proposed change think such concession be so many sop to sedition also think that to have raised mass of subject race from abject misery to well being then to allow to fall back to former condition a surely will to become victim of worst element among be not only foolish utterly wrong wicked old man rose in intensity of feeling began to pace to fro talk about despotism of one man rule said what about despotism of parliament congress reichstags worst despotism in world fool why ca see that difference between democracy of europe america government proper to ancient slavish slow moving civilisation of east be fundamental old man lip stiffened then said perhaps be only antiquated person behind new age new idea if so be satisfied belong to number of who have always thought duty of great nation to carry light of civilisation into dark continent be not sorry to be left behind by crank who must legislate for men alike pshaw might a well tailorise for men alike put clothes of same pattern on mankind again old man laughed be part parcel of preposterous american doctrine that men be born free equal doctrine made united state enfranchise a well a emancipate black may result be worse in case there be moment of strained silence then consul general said suppose will say man ishmael have beaten made contemptuous almost inaudible laugh then added let be welcome time will tell anyhow lament when man be old useless life must burn out be only natural after have seen too much of power to regret loss of still gordon must not speak be feeling how great father be in downfall how brave how proud how splendid old man walked to window looked out with fixed eye after moment turned back said same gordon be glad of what have happened for sake sincerely glad have not always be with have won grudge victory indeed added here voice trembled perceptibly be little proud of yes proud old man can not be indifferent to fact that son have won heart of twelve million of people even though even though may have lost gordon throat be hurting helena eye be full of tear old man too be struggling to control voice thought nunehamism be synonymous with patriotism perhaps be right believed to be better englishman of two say be not may be that in present mind england will think that one secret withheld from have be revealed to namely that alien race can only be ruled by by love yes be glad for sake gordon a for leave to time fate old man pride in son success be fighting hard with own humiliation after while gordon recovered strength enough to ask father what meant to do in england who can say answered consul general lifting one hand with gesture of helplessness have spent best year of life in egypt what be england to now home exile have moved to window again following direction of eye gordon must see that be looking towards cypress tree shaded english cemetery of cairo deep profound silence ensued feeling a if mother spirit be passing through room gordon dropped head tear leapt to eye be first time father son have be together since tenderest link have bound have be broken while be thinking of neither of must trust to speak of janet dream have come true how happy must have be thought consul general while gordon unable to unravel intricacy of emotion be saying to mother sweet mother last moment came be very moving one up from hidden depth of old man oceanic soul there came certain joy in spite of that in blindness have done to prevent by operation of inscrutable power have controlled destiny great hope of life be about to be realised gordon helena have be brought together a looked at standing side by side when rose to bid farewell to man so brave fearless girl so beautiful superb thought with thrill of heart might happen to old worn out fallen perhaps life ended yet must line go on in time to come pure clean strong name of nuneham be written high in history of country holding out hand to looked steadily into face for moment while bade silent good bye not word not quiver of eyelid be english gentleman coming out top in end firm stern heroic before gordon helena seemed to be aware of old man be gone heard rumble of wheel of carriage a passed out of courtyard chapter xvi at great proconsul left cairo knew that day long telegraphic agency have be busy with message from london about resignation also knew that after first thunderclap of surprise egyptian population have concluded that have be recalled recalled in disgrace at petition of khedive to king did not take long to prepare for departure in course of hour ibrahim be able to pack up few personal effect how few during longest residence gather about house of servant of state perhaps acutest of feeling on leaving egypt came to a drove in closed carriage out of ground of agency looked up for last time at window of room used to be occupied by wife at moment felt something of dumb desolation roll over strongest soul when after lifetime of comradeship asundering come long for voice be still poor janet must leave remained of behind under tall cypress tree on edge of nile yet not for be carrying away better part of pure soul saintly memory within none le that moment of parting brought old man nearer than have ever be to sense of tear in mortal thing sirdar have accompanied though fact of intended departure have become known having be announced in evening paper there be nobody at station to bid adieu to not member of khedive entourage not one of egyptian minister not even of adviser under secretary whom have created never have there lived more self centred sufficient man fact cut to quick have done what believed to be duty in egypt feeling that be neglected forgotten at end ingratitude of whom have served went like poison into soul to escape from sense of began to talk with bitter raillery in weaker man must have expressed in tear seemed indeed to have tear glittering frozen tear behind do know dear reg said feel to night a if might be incarnation of friend pontius pilate like be being withdrawn see apparently for same reason who know perhaps like too be destined to earn malediction of mankind sirdar found old man irony intensely affecting therefore made protest well be not ashamed of comparison if mean that against form of anarchy have belonged to party of order though of course there will be wise head will see finger of heaven in what have happened strong man with fortune sunk to zero be defiant to very end last hour of calamity standing on platform by door of compartment have be reserved for looked round at length said irony raillery suddenly gone reg have given forty year of life to people there be not one of to see off sirdar tried best to cheer saying england remembers though if old man looked into face next word died on lip engine be getting up steam rhythmic throb be shaking glass roof overhead when gordon hafiz wearing military greatcoat came up platform have carefully timed to arrive at last moment gleam of light came into father face at sight of son gordon stepped up hafiz fell back lord nuneham entered carriage well good bye old friend said old man shaking hand warmly with sirdar may see again in exile in england know then turned to gordon took outstretched hand father son stood face to face for last time not word be spoken there be long firm quivering hand

already dead after boy father be one of great englishman gordon must not answer after while shook hand separated two young soldier walked back to citadel through native street night of prophet be nearly over illumination be being put out hafiz talked about khedive have just arrived at kubbeh then about ishmael prophet have shut up in chancellor house be permitting nobody to see highness have asked ishmael to be imam to morrow morning be thought that be ill be even whispered that be going mad said hafiz gordon did not speak until reached foot of hill then said must go up lie down good night old fellow god bless chapter xvii hour earlier gordon guard now transformed into soldier servant have be startled by appearance of egyptian wearing flowing white robe of sheikh asking in almost faultless english for colonel lord colonel have gone to station to see lordship off to england be expecting back presently said orderly will wait said sheikh orderly showed into gordon room look like bloomin ' death head wonder if be bloomin prophet be jawrin ' about since coming into cairo ishmael have be prey to thought be indeed akin to madness perhaps be seized by one of nervous malady in man no longer belongs to certainly suffered pang of heart brain come only to purest most spiritual soul in darkest hour seem to make literally true that tortured spirit descend into hell now that anxiety for follower be relaxed hope have in measure be realised mind swung back to sorrowful decay ruin have fallen upon be no longer shame of prophet bereavement of man tormented lacerated heart left power of thinking feeling anything loss of helena again saw beaming eye long black lash smiling mouth again heard voice again sweet perfume of presence seemed to be about that be lost to for ever henceforth have to put away from sweetness beauty tenderness of woman life linked with brought paroxysm of pain in seemed a if heart must break die recalled promise have made to of taking up life of man when work be done work be done now in sort ended at event prize have promised have be snatched away be gone who have be joy impassable gulf divided infinite radiance of hope love be to have crowned restless stormy life have disappeared henceforth must walk through world alone o god can be asked with startled agony of one who awakes from single pillowed sleep remembers that be bereaved if anything have be necessary to make position intolerable came with thought that be due to treachery of man have loved trusted man have believed to be friend brother one being besides woman who have gone to heart of heart rani have confessed to that loved omar notwithstanding that life have struggled to liberate from prejudice of race yet now in melancholy brooding of eastern brain must not escape from conclusion that only love possible between man wife of be guilty love when thought of that body soul seemed to be afire became conscious of feeling about omar have never experienced before towards human creature feeling of furious inextinguishable hatred began to be afraid of just a dog will shun kind hide from sight when feel poison of madness working in blood so ishmael under secret trouble dared reveal to none shut up in sleeping room in old chancellor house be small silent chamber at back overlooking little paved courtyard containing well bounded by very high wall that shut off sight sound of city outside once day old man in blue galabeah came into court to draw water twice day servant of sheikh came into room with food save for two old chancellor at interval ishmael saw one for nine day in solitude semi darkness of self imposed prison hundred phantom be bred in distempered brain on second day after retirement chancellor came to tell that emissary missionary omar benani have be identified on arrest that in true character a colonel lord be to be tried by fellow officer for supposed offence a soldier at time of assault on el azhar that only sentence must possibly be passed upon must be death at news chancellor delivered with sad face ishmael felt fierce secret joy god arm be long told allowed man to escape while aim be good now be going to punish for treachery deceit three day afterwards old chancellor came again to say that colonel lord have be tried condemned to death a everybody have foreseen expected nevertheless sympathy of men be with because be seen to have acted from noblest motif withstanding own father for what believed to be right exposing to charge of being bad son poor patriot in order to prevent bloodshed that have indeed prevented bloodshed by preventing collision of british native army that have be by effort that pilgrimage have be able to enter cairo in peace that in recognition of great sacrifice made by christian soldier for love of humanity ulema be joining with others in petitioning king to pardon at news chill came over ishmael heart grew cold a stone when chancellor be gone found praying forbid o god forbid let not thy justice be taken out of thine awful hand four day later old chancellor came yet again to say that king pardon have be granted that colonel lord be free that people be rejoicing that everybody attributed happy issue of christian case mainly to zealous effort on behalf of woman who loved daughter of dead general whose unwise command have be cause of trouble finally that be expected that two must soon heal family feud by marriage at news ishmael tortured heart be aflame brain be reeling thought that omar be not to be punished that be to be honoured that be to be made happy filled with passion never felt before behind strongest most spiritual soul there lurks wild beast seems to be ever waiting to destroy in torment of ishmael heart thought came to that a earthly judge be permitting guilty one to escape god called on to punish man irresistible a thought be brought feeling of indescribable dread must be going mad told remembering how have spent life in cause of peace day long fought against hatred be now so fierce that seemed a if death alone must satisfy soul wrestled with battled for life against at length conquered rose from knee saying to vengeance belongs to god when did ask for hand to execute compulsion of great passion be driving on after dismissing thought of own wrong began to think of rani where be now what have become of dared not ask ashamed humiliated abased have become so sensitive to pain on subject of woman whom have betrothed woman who have betrayed woman still loved in spite of everything that be even afraid that one might speak of in light of what chancellor have said about daughter of general pictured rani a rejected abandoned woman thought be at first so painful that deprived of free use of faculty must not see anything plainly mind be battlefield of confused sight half hidden in cloud of smoke that after rani have sacrificed for omar husband happiness honour must be cast aside for be maddening asked what be to do find take back impossible heart be gone from must continue to love other man might do to her be way of woman allah pity bless then flash of illumination came to in long interval of darkness must liberate rani man loved must marry matter if belonged to race must marry matter if belonged to faith must marry a for sacrifice must be revenge yes that will be revenge thought in wild fire of heart brain be thought with ishmael have come to gordon door being shown into soldier room sat for time without looking about then raising eye gazing round bare apartment with simple bed table shelf of military boot stirrup sword rifle saw on desk under lamp large photograph in frame be photograph of woman in western costume told in instant who woman be be daughter of general who be dead remembered that have heard of before that have even spoken about to father when came to warn general that order be giving to colonel lord must lead to injury of england in egypt ruin of own happiness from day to have never once thought of girl now recalling what old chancellor have said of devotion fidelity loyalty to man loved turned eye from picture lest sight of must touch with tenderness make harder duty have come to do will not look at told with simplicity of sick child trying to avoid softening effect of photograph under lamp saw on table by side yet on wall be picture of same woman hastily a glanced at there be something in face of kindled light in memory be only part of haunting torment that in spite of western costume obscured woman in photograph brilliant beaming eye be eye of rani wave of indescribable tenderness broke over for moment odour of perfume atmosphere of sweetness delicacy charm then telling that be gone from for ever that woman face must henceforth remind of whom have lost hatred in heart against gordon gave pain of open wound o god let forget let forget prayed then suddenly while be in tempest of contrary emotion be whirling like hot sand in sandstorm about brain heard footstep on stair followed by voice outside door be voice of colonel lord soldier servant be telling master who be within arab sheikh in white robe turban be coming be here thought ishmael with choking throat throbbing heart rose to foot stood waiting at next moment door be thrown open man have come to meet be in room chapter xviii with heart occupied by thought of father gordon have hardly listened to what hafiz have be saying about ishmael walking up hill to citadel began to think of of helena of bond of betrothal still bound together until be broken there can be nothing between told be thought in mind at moment when reached quarter servant told who be waiting within ishmael ameer be cried a burst door open stepping eagerly cheerfully almost joyfully forward stretched out hand ishmael drew back then gordon saw that eye be swollen a if by sleeplessness that lip be white that cheek be terribly pale that expression of face be shocking why what be be ill asked omar benani said ishmael be alone only god be witness have something to say to let sit spoke in low tremulous tone rather with breath than with voice gordon after looking at for instant seeing smouldering fire of madness be in man face threw off greatcoat sat down there be moment in spoke then ishmael still speaking in scarcely audible voice said omar benani be son of beni azra honour be watchword when traveller in libyan desert tired weary seek tent of one of people master take in make free of that posse sometimes sends stranger into harem that woman may wash foot leaf there to rest to sleep put faith most precious thing god have given into hand said ishmael with suppressed fire flashing in eye if stranger must ever wrong that harem if must ever betray trust reposed in matter who be where fly to master will follow kill involuntarily seeing error that ishmael have fallen into gordon rose to foot whereupon ishmael mistaking gesture held up hand no said not have not come to do that put honour in hand omar benani made free of family must have done more be brother yet outraged sacred right of brotherhood tore open secret chamber of heart deceived robbed betrayed be traitor be not here to avenge sit sit will tell have come for breathless bewildered gordon sat again after moment of silence ishmael with light of wild sorrow in face said omar benani there be one who have sacrificed everything for have broken vow for sinned for suffered for woman be wife by right of husband must hold heart be yours therefore therefore intend to give up involuntarily gordon rose to foot again again ishmael held up hand if liberate said if divorce must marry be what have come to say utterly amazed dumbfounded gordon must not at first find word to speak whereupon ishmael mistaking silence said need not be afraid of scandal people know something about letter be sent into cairo people yours know anything of motif inspired therefore nobody except ourselves will understand reason for what be done paused a if waiting for reply then said in voice quavered with emotion can be possible that hesitate do suppose be offering to what wish to keep for tell that if poor girl must say that feeling for be same a before came between be impossible god who be on high look down on what be doing know that be right gordon still speechless with astonishment twisted about to desk be behind stretched out hand a if with intention of taking up photograph at action ishmael once more mistaking meaning flashed out on in blaze of passion tell can not do must will matter what pledge may have made will marry matter if be of race faith will marry may be outcast now will find save else cried in thundering voice rising to foot lifting arm above gordon head with terrible dignity justice of god will overtake hand will smite wrath will hurl down seeing that wild blood of man race be aflame gordon leapt up laying hold of ishmael upraised arm brought by swift wrench down to side two men be then face to face arab with dusky cheek flashing black eye englishman with glittering grey eye lip set firm a steel there be moment of silence while stood together so then gordon liberating ishmael arm said in commanding voice have listened to now will listen to sit down more than strength of gordon muscle unblanched look in face compelled ishmael to obey then gordon said believe have be deceived wronged have be deceived wronged not in way think time have come for to learn truth whole truth will learn now look at said snatching up photograph from desk holding out to ishmael ishmael tried to push photograph away look at say do know who be at next moment ishmael be trembling in limb without voice almost without breath be stammering a held photograph in hand rani yes said gordon be daughter of late general seemed to ishmael that gordon have said something tried in vain to realise what be tell stammered tell then rapidly forcibly gordon told helena story beginning with day on ishmael came to citadel how have concluded not without reason that have killed father being last person to be seen with alive how finding that law government be powerless to punish have determined to avenge father death ishmael listened with mouth open fixing on gordon bewildered eye be that why came to khartoum asked yes why prompted to come into cairo yes why wrote that letter yes overwhelmed with terrible enlightenment ishmael fumbled bead muttered allah allah then gordon told own story how too acting under impulse of awful error have fled to soudan leaving evil name behind rather than kill dear one by revelation of what believed to be truth how finding pit have be dug for innocent man have thought duty a guilty one to step into how finally being appeased on point have determined to come into cairo in ishmael place in order to save from sure consequence of determined fanaticism father from certain ruin must follow upon work of liar intriguer by time ishmael be no longer pale pallid lip be trembling heart be beating audibly again without voice almost without breath stammered when offered to take place knew that rani helena have sent that letter gordon bowed without speaking knew too that might be coming to death once more gordon bowed head coming to death that might live gordon stood silent motionless allah allah mumbled ishmael who be now scarcely able to hear see last of gordon returned to story of helena showing how have suffered for impulse of vengeance have taken possession of how have wanted to fly from ishmael camp have remained there in hope of helping to save people how at length have saved by going to consul general to prove that pilgrim be not armed force by ordering light have led into city ishmael be deeply moved with effort said then then be yours from first while hated because thought have come between be really who allah allah gordon having finished silence ensued then ishmael looking at photograph be still in trembling hand said in pitiful voice god see when tear

smile then still holding helena hand reached out for gordon also said give back to thee brother think give what must not keep perhaps who know perhaps loved too helena be deeply affected gordon found impossible to look into ishmael face felt wearied eye resting upon felt hand being brought together felt ishmael hand resting for moment on hand then heard say maa e salamah be happy keep together a long a can never forget will meet day then in voice so low that must scarcely hear said peace be with peace passed out of room stood where have left in middle of room with face to ground hand quivering in other clasp until sound of footstep have died away then gordon said will go into garden helena yes replied in whisper went out hand in hand walked to arbour on edge of rampart there on loved spot past rolled back on like billow of soul bush seemed to have grown bougainvillea be more purple than before air be full of scent of blossom everything be turning to love to song did not speak put arm about other looked down on wide panorama below city nile desert pyramid old old sphinx whose scarred face have witnessed so many incident in story of humanity be now witnessing last incident of one story more how long stood there in great happiness never knew be called back to by shrill clear voice came from minaret behind god be most great god be most great then turning in direction of voice saw white figure on white camel ascending yellow road lead up to fort on top of mokattam hill onward to desert look said gordon be without speaking helena bent head in assent with hand still clasped quivering watched white figure a passed away stopped at crest of hill looked back for moment then turned again went on at next moment be gone then once more came voice from minaret like voice of angel winging way through air illustration music fragment epilogue lord nuneham lived ten year longer never after first profound sensation caused by retirement be heard of again house of lord did not see be never found on public platform publisher must prevail upon to write story of life bought majestic rather melancholy place in berkshire one of great historic seat of extinguished noble family there under high elm amid green cloudy landscape of own country lived out last year in unbroken obscurity have be well said that deep tragedy be school of great men there be one ray of sunshine to brighten lord nuneham solitude on table by bedside in room darkened by rustling leaf stood two photograph in silver frame be of two boy one dark like mother other fair like father bright strong clear eyed down to end old man never went to bed without taking up picture looking at a often a did so faint smile must pas over seamed weary face after while world forgot that be alive when died public seemed to be taken by surprise thought died ten year ago said somebody gordon held post a general in command of british army in egypt for four successive term appointment being renewed first by wish of war office afterwards at request of egyptian government civil occupation having become le active since father time new consul general being pale shadow of predecessor military occupation became more important except for subjection to headquarters gordon appeared to stand in position of military autocrat in difficult delicate task of maintaining order in foreign country without exasperating feeling of native people showed great tact sympathy while allowing utmost liberty to thought whether political religious never for moment permitted to be believed that government must be defied with impunity in matter affecting peace order life property for best element honoured when poor illiterate who be sometimes victim of extremist whose only aim be to throw flaming torch into pit of inflammable gas saw that be just a ready to put down lawlessness among european a among egyptian loved a well a trusted life in egypt lessened gulf easterns always find between christian christianity whenever have to return to england street of cairo must be red with tarboosh of people who ran to railway station to see off maa e salamah brother must say with simplicity of child then forget will be waiting for to come back gordon love for egyptian never failed be entirely happy in home where helena developed summer bloom of beautiful womanhood where light merry sound of voice of two young boy be always ringing like music through house must be confessed that for while egypt have hard almost tragic time after consul general departure went through period of storm stress there be error crime be inevitable result of progressive stage of self rule even anarchy travail of nation birth be not altogether unknown during earlier year there be to regret absence of mailed fist of lord nuneham to question benefit of quasi western institution in eastern country atmosphere cleared at last sinister anticipation be falsified bold magnanimous policy brought peace destiny of egypt be firmly united to of country have given new lease of life liberty england never regretted what have done on day when true to high tradition decided that great nation have longer right to govern with absolute undivided authority race living under sky reward seems likely to come in way might have be least expected a god chooseth fleshly instrument with imperfect heart doeth perfect work seems to have put into heart of arab people to sink tribal difference to act at prompting of gigantic myth with grand cadi deceived consul general indeed who gaze into future a into crystal say that time be near when long drama of dissension have be played between arab turk will end in establishment of vast arabic empire extending from tigris euphrates valley to mediterranean from indian ocean to jerusalem with cairo a capital khedive a caliph england a lord protector one can foreshadow future be napoleon greatest dream nation can realise will hold peace of world in palm of almighty hand ishmael after left cairo be never seen again by one who must positively identify say returned to home of childhood on libyan desert that died there others that went back to khartoum thence to heart of sahara that be still alive however may be be certain that disappearance have have effect of death that have deepened impression of life that huge shadow of remains on among whom lived laboured be said on day of departure that black zogal who followed to last with fidelity of human dog kept close at heel until came to top of mokattam hill where master sent back after strictly charging to tell one way be going since then however zogal have given out with appearance of believing own story that saw ishmael ascend to heaven from gebel mokattam in blinding whirlwind of celestial light flight of angel carrying away saint house have be built for black zogal on spot on say saw ascent half crazy soudanese inhabits outer wall be almost covered with small flag devotee have brought fixed to in childlike effort to show reverence nothing must exceed boundless affection be still felt for ishmael by who came into immediate contact with seems to have inspired with love survives absence must even conquer death everybody who ever spoke to have story to tell of wisdom power tenderness number of miracle have increased tenfold though not described a sinless be always talked of a if be divine mouled birthday conjectural date be celebrated by ceremony almost outrival night of prophet about saint house on mokattam hill huge encampment of tent be made there under blaze of thousand of dazzling light dervish hold zikrs amid scene of frantic excitement due to exhibition of hypnotic suggestion even include gift of tongue while more serious minded sheikh repeat long record of ishmael genealogy be very circumstantial story with vague resemblance to something christian speak of with bated breath how when mother who be virgin be bearing angel appeared to in dream said carry lord of man how when child be delivered three great sheikh came from mecca to pay reverence to having seen star in sky told where be to be born in course of year great body of ishmael saying have be gathered up of be authentic most of be out of wisdom of age not few be directly borrowed from christian gospel moslem a whole know source be deeply treasured woman chant to child at knee men lisp with last breath then die with brave face besides impression have produced upon people be strong likely to be enduring ishmael seems to have almost unaccountable fascination for arabic scholar theologian number of professor at el azhar be already deep in metaphysical disputation about inner significance of word attributed to be whispered that venerable chancellor now nearly hundred year of age be compiling book half biography half commentary be full of mystical meaning more extraordinary still seems probable that large gorgeous mosque will be built in ishmael honour that who loved best to worship in temple of open desert whereof dome be sky who cared so little about dogmatic theology that never even wrote line may by wild irony of fate become founder of sect in islam will teach everything fought against practise everything condemned chief among subject of disputation be ishmael expectation of kingdom of heaven upon earth though ulema le concerned with spirit than with letter of prophet hope be divided a to source of say be plainly indicated in koran tradition others more widely read say be borrowed from hebrew bible while few refer to vague misty antiquity hardly le interesting to theologian be question of ishmael identity nearly agree that there be element of supernatural about so hard be to attribute to men of ordinary human passion great movement affect world while there be who believe to have be mahdi sent expressly to earth to destroy anti christ be to say consul general influential group hold to opinion that be be seyidna isa lord jesus about latter view there gather strange not unimpressive theory jesus who according to islamic faith did not die on cross reappears at interval among different race now among jew now among indian now among arab that will continue to make manifestation until world be ready for greatest happiness obtainable by man establishment of kingdom of god not disputation of wise head of el azhar can rob humble of object of veneration ishmael came from people with people will always remain blameless life touching history deep humanity simple teaching above lofty hope have made sultan of vast empire of empire of poor oppressed down trodden broken hearted from central heart of east spirit came a ray of sunlight inspiring men in dark place to live nobly to die bravely to keep up courage to last what of ishmael influence in west nothing european historian have written since time without saying word about one of who devotes long chapter to account of bombardment of alexandria battle of tel el kebir craven flight of arabi theatrical scene with khedive in abdeen square yet other chapter to building of assouan dam construction of cape to cairo railway dismisses ishmael pilgrimage from khartoum in five line of section dealing with mahdism sedition in soudan indeed so hard do find in spite of civilisation christianity to believe that thing of spirit may be more helpful in sustaining step shaping destiny than force can weigh measure calculate that be difficult to think of real welcome in city of west for one whose only teaching be that great wealth be inheritance taken by force from almighty that property beyond proper need of civilised human life be pillage god so love world that will come in person to govern to save mankind from suffering consequence of sin certainly mere thought of one holding opinion least of arab son of boat builder born on libyan desert brought up in depth of soudan educated in stagnant school of el azhar wearing sandal turban probably eating with finger mere thought of such one in present year of grace forcing way into cathedral parliament house of westminster washington rome berlin paris where archbishop officiate in embroidered cope minister prepare budget towards re paganisation of world must at least provoke smile nevertheless there be who think that world be not ruled by great men by great idea that idea be few very old that when humanity need to renew have
