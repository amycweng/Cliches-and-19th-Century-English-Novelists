bolder spirit seemed to say what be childish fuming about fortune come to with hand full be bold may have wish of soul desire of heart deemster ship kate be impossible to believe that if married kate governor must not recommend a deemster have not admitted that stood in fear of public opinion of island be not conceivable that besides unselfish interest governor have shown in there be even personal
