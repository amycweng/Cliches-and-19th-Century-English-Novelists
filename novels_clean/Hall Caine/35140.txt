that man be merely watching out of country that be aware that knew secret be only too certain that have betrayed knowledge to authority at capital after have parted from be more than probable be not impossible that very men who have taken bribe of have in turn bribed that might follow see did not inform minister consul of foreign country of murder of american in street of fez theory partly reconciled to man presence let watch constant company be in tormenting way best security must go to minister consul must see have too much reason to think of own living affair to busy with of dead american such poor unction a reflection brought be dissipated by second thought what security for man for authority who might have bribed perhaps menaced to watch must lie in fact have passed out of country without revealing fact of crime have witnessed safely back in england might tell with safety once let leave morocco with secret in breast penalty people dreaded might be upon merely to watch be wasted labor meant to do more must have done nothing thinking so idea took possession of with shock of terror man be following to kill a sole christian witness of crime have be committed by light

god make way easy remember larby remember good fellow be not only pocket of people of fez be in danger if christian must escape let leave gharb alive own neck be in peril be spy be informer be hotheaded madman who led attack ended in spilling of christian blood if sultan must have to pay twenty thousand dollar to minister for america at tangier for life of dead dog whom have grubbed into earth in garden if basha of fez must have to pay forty thousand dollar to sultan if people must have to pay eighty thousand dollar to basha then larby in turn will have to pay with life to people be
