everybody knew everybody be man who be submerged if story of last night became known to anyone must become known to everyone from governor to meanest beggar on road position of honour authority must ever be possible to after that black fact must be clanking chain must have to drag after a long a lived when thought of that event of one night might alter whole course of life bring scandal upon deemster that be due to miserable accident in first instance accident of meeting bessie on street after midnight be filled with fierce consuming rage for one bad moment have almost uncontrollable

spirited girl who for might have married decent man of own class held head proud declining after few vain month of fine clothes idleness to condition of slattern going down to dirt degeneration of

to through so many year have never really be reconciled to loss of down in dark secret chamber of consciousness there have always be phantom hope that notwithstanding devotion to work for woman dedication to celibacy a stern a consecration of veil believed to be demanded by fenella must return to island great love must be rewarded have be real cause of idleness have be waiting waiting waiting for fenella to come back make worth while now by own act consequence of oh god oh god for first time save once since be child felt tear in eye brushed away impatiently be too late to think of

clatter of horse hoof on high road gell in high spirit be galloping home iv later in day stowell be alone in library reading deposition in secret heart knew that wicked temptation have come to temptation to get bessie off to stop flood of evil must surely follow if deemster taubman tried be condemned same be struggling to drown qualm in contempt of case against how little there be to direct evidence be almost childish medical testimony be only thing of consequence how sloppy how inconclusive be there anything against bessie if have be advocate for defence must not have riddled with a

upstairs to look at new decoration have be made in room be to be boudoir stowell remained in library sound of fenella step on floor above beat on stunned brain with drumming noise of train in tunnel have sense of cowardice have never felt before at one moment wanted to tell fenella everything thinking must be end of torture at next reflected that must be beginning of hers inflicting incurable wound upon affection then if bessie be going to be acquitted a seemed possible evidence being so unconvincing why must enlarge area of shameful secret when fenella returned saying a came downstairs how beautiful room be how proud must be of took out to carriage do remember whispered have recovered gay spirit coachman be on box do remember first time saw off from here nodded tried to smile be too bashful to shake hand be too shy to look at being seated in carriage door closed on said by way must like to drive over with to mr quayle if brought home again mean laughed merrily oh very well have refused again will remember sir after carriage have disappeared at turn of drive stowell went up to room shut door behind covered face in hand fenella hunting down blindly unconsciously innocently while urging entreating almost compelling to sit on case woman loved who loved be trying to destroy be to be punishment mr quayle must say nothing if thought must injure mother son power on earth must prevail upon to speak sooner later by one mean other fenella must find out then god be merciful to sinner moaned smothering sound of word behind hand must sit in judgment on bessie collister case with

south of island somewhere will be home for luncheon take cigar not smoking yet must anyway have come to see on serious matter sir said stowell felt lip trembling so governor glanced up quickly charged pipe then settled to listen will remember story told about man who have promised to marry girl then fallen in love with somebody else perfectly stowell paused moment lip became pale hand contracted well that be own story sir there be moment of silence stowell have expected exclamation of surprise clang of astonishment governor face be still to fire only sound made be swivelling of pipe between teeth advised to break off engagement did so what be result girl be relieved relieved yes because too have in meantime fallen in love with somebody else friend gell how fortunate seemed so at first thought providence have stepped in to help out fate have kept terrible reckoning sir what have happened girl have committed crime be in castle rushen awaiting trial for murder of new born child woman collister yes now be judge in ordinary course be duty to try there be period of silence broken only by rapid puffing of governor pipe be not sir being in frightful position everything be tempting to corrupt justice first natural desire to influence trial in favour of girl perhaps to get off altogether next pity for poor mother who have be pleading for mercy then friendship for gell who have be begging to try case because old statute be severe colleague cruel last of step father of girl who have be trying to intimidate well think will see be impossible for to sit on case in private interest public duty conflict utterly impossible must be against usage justice governor removed pipe face have become cold hard speak of colleague have done anything with yes have asked to sit instead of what if can not then will ask sir to send for judge from across water stowell have struggled through to end although perspiration have be breaking out on forehead when have finished governor sat for time without speaking obscure motif be operating within in depth of mind scarcely known to be asking how will all if allow to go farther affect fenella will stop marriage disturb happiness destroy life on surface of mind be only aware of consideration of public welfare be irritated by what have occurred be impediment in path wished to kick out of way rose laid pipe on mantelpiece standing with back to fire hand behind chin firm mouth set hard said with sudden energy now listen to always knew that be own story yes what did not know be that harm have be done did indeed did girl be incredible do know

injustice too even if girl committed crime say if be not responsible for stowell began to stammer again did wrong in first instance sir nothing wrong governor said sharply of course did wrong in first instance have nothing to do with wrong if be guilty have done since ca be supposed that have sympathy with act can god forbid did desert did leave to mercy of world have ever be in want be in danger of being unable to provide for offspring when came can not say then what folly to think be responsible for what did in taking life of child if did take other fact motif operated with girl fact motif be so far a can see have nothing to do with nothing stowell pulse be beating high tried to say something about moral responsibility again governor cut short moral responsibility said with ring of sarcasm be sick of sentimental talk about moral responsibility man responsibility for conduct of woman rest of person who commits crime be criminal be only foundation of law order then think sir said stowell that since think said governor that whole thing be unfortunate damnably unfortunate since be not responsible for girl crime if committed crime at knew nothing about have sympathy with ought to go on doing duty why must interested of course be interested in little community like judge be nearly always interested be that what deemster oath be intended to provide for stowell muttered something about being afraid again governor caught up afraid what be afraid of public doe occur to that only risk run in direction be not risk of sitting on case of not sitting on there must be people who have seen coming here morning if be not in court on appointed day be likely to ask why there be gell certainly there be gell when marriage be broken off did tell anything did stowell shook head how must

hurrying out to meet have have tiring day can see that said a poured out cup of tea for ah high position 'there be nothing to be got without being paid for a father used to say to escape from janet solicitude to tire out so that might have chance of sleeping night walked down to shore storm be rising gull be flying inland white wing be mingling with black one of rook fierce sky to south cold grey of sea to north bleak church tower on stark headland looking like blinded lighthouse suited better with mood fenella must know everything by time how be to meet eye in morning gell too must know everything now how innocent thing have done to help friend must look like cunning bribery cruel treachery be lie to say that sin must be concealed evil act once done must never be undone must never be

robbie creer have to shout to other above fury of wind farmer have be over to nappin field above point found hidden fissure in soil three foot deep must lose land before morning at dinner janet did best to make thing cheerful there be sweet home atmosphere wood fire with odour of resin gorse snow white table cloth silver candlestick old fashioned daintiness stowell be preoccupied hardly listened to janet chattering so went early to room saying be sure wished to be alone father always did during adjournment of serious case father again how devotion to father drove iron into soul be late rain have begun to slash window pane when heard front door bell ringing after few moment heard ringing again more loudly insistently nobody answered household must be asleep then came hurried knocking at window of dining room voice be like wind become articulate cry out of darkness let in be gell for first time in life stowell felt spasm of physical fear remembered something gell have said at door of railway carriage in douglas on day of trial of peel fisherman must have killed other man strengthened anything be better than torture of hidden sin anything go back to door will open called through closed window then walked to porch heart be beating hard thought knew what be coming when gell entered house be not man stowell have expected with flaming eye passionate voice poor broken irresolute creature hair be disordered step be weak shuffling be stretching out nervous hand on coming into light a if still walking in darkness have to come tell be guilty have confessed said then collapsed into chair broke into pitiful moaning be too cruel must have taken girl word against world yet have deceived did say who did ask miserable farm hand suppose brute animal damn whoever be damn damn to devil hell stowell felt boundless relief yet sense of sickening duplicity what matter about man said gell be girl who have deceived daresay be not first perhaps step father did turn out for nothing there may have be something to say for old scoundrel choking with hypocrisy stowell found pleading for girl perhaps who must say perhaps have be more sinned against than sinning then why did tell said gell voice be like wail who can say stowell felt throb in throat be speaking with difficulty who can say be trying to save pain knowing how believed in cared for if have only told said gell if have only be straight with stowell felt on edge of terrible revelation controlled if bessie have concealed part of truth what right have to reveal after moment of silent terror asked gell what meant to do in morning advise to amend plea cast on mercy of court yes be only proper course now said stowell then gell rose to go be wild night wind be higher than ever by time rain on window be rattling like hail stowell asked gell to sleep night at ballamoar secretly hoping must refuse did have bespoken bed at railway inn near to station must go up by first train in morning stowell saw to door held open with shoulder against wind swirled through hall making flame of lamp on landing to flame up in funnel outside there be slashing of leaf crackling of bough among elm around lawn well good night said gell turning up collar of coat went off in darkness rain stowell turned back into house with sense of degradation have never felt before what miserable coward hidden sin made of man sooner later must be revealed then what then suddenly be startled by new thought bessie confession must give trial entirely different turn if pleaded guilty in morning there must be nothing for jury to do must have to be dismissed instructed to bring in formal verdict verdict against prisoner must depend upon judge be to say bessie fate must depend upon upon alone first shock of thought be terrible after while told that came to same thing in end real responsibility be with law judge be only law spokesman for given crime given punishment judge did not make sentence on prisoner have only to pronounce strengthening so went to bed for long time lay awake listening to many sound of storm in middle of night be startled out of troubled sleep by loud crash in distance morning broke fair with clear sky sea lying under sunshine like sleeping child a drove off after scanty breakfast found carriage drive strewn with young leaf torn bough of old elm stretching across path number of dead rook lying about lawn outside big gate met robbie creer who be riding barebacked on farm horse farmer have be over to nappin seen what have expected headland be down there be gob mouth where point have be sea be flowing between two cliff have be torn asunder driving hard stowell arrived early at castletown found crowd at castle gate waiting for trial a for show be passing through deemster private entrance when have vision of scene spectator must not be counting upon what if prisoner while making confession accused judge joshua scarff in coloured spectacle be waiting at door to deemster room be afraid honour be not well morning said little headache be said stowell have stumbled on threshold bad omen be wondering what must happen before came out again chapter thirty verdict when court resumed gell rose with haggard face to make announcement in accordance with suggestion of excellency accused have be seen during adjournment though not by with result that have confessed to having given birth to child being cause of death in circumstance said speaking in husky voice have taken only course open to that of advising to revise plea with permission of court will now do so there be moment of agitation in court be understood to assent then bessie be called upon to plead again hardly have risen at call of deemster when broke down utterly sob followed sob at question be put to at length bowed head be accepted a plea of guilty then gell rose again said although prisoner pleads guilty to causing death of child say did not so wilfully therefore propose to put back in box to prove extenuating circumstance once more court agreed when bessie be removed from dock to witness box broke down again not word must be got out of be only natural said gell that must feel shame at having to take back what said yesterday deemster bowed speaking with obvious effort appealed to girl to answer question of advocate still bessie sobbed made answer court have nothing left to to go on to judgment said attorney general at moment when trial seemed to be brought to standstill fenella sitting near to witness box be seen to lean over whisper to gell who rose asked to be allowed to make suggestion inasmuch a accused be unable to answer for somebody else who knew what wished to say must be empowered to answer for deemster seeing what be coming seemed to catch breath after moment agreed course proposed although unusual be not contrary to interest of justice altogether without precedent deaf dumb witness always giving evidence by speaking proxy therefore if attorney general did not object not at said attorney in case said gell will ask lady who received prisoner confession to speak on behalf miss stanley be said afterwards when event of day have fierce light cast back upon that when fenella stepped up to witness box stood side by side with prisoner ready to take oath deemster seemed scarcely able to recite familiar word to please tell court a nearly a possible in own word what prisoner told said gell there be deep concentrated silence never before have anybody witnessed so strange scene speaking calmly firmly fenella told bessie story a bessie have told journey from south of island birth death of child burying of under clagh ny dooiney when have finished bessie who be stifling sob have bowed head in reply to question from gell that assented to what have be said on attorney general rose to cross examine doe prisoner deny said that when returned home told mother of condition yes mother knew nothing about doe deny that by keeping condition secret from person most proper to know of deliberately intended to put child away by violence doe not deny that say that when baby came instinct of motherhood came too from moment onward idea of taking life be far from heart doe prisoner wish court to believe that in spite of subsequent conduct in concealing birth death of child in secretly burying yes doe if court of men can not believe court of woman must because attorney general with look of triumph sat down quickly fenella flushing up to flaming eye stopped suddenly there be moment of deep silence in court then gell who have to struggle with emotion rose to re examine doe prisoner say that when killed child did so unconsciously under influence of fear yes under influence of fear fear of step father who have behaved like brute to doe think that however lamentable act be moved to by pardonable motif not pardonable motif merely said fenella flaming up again nobly unselfish one nobly unselfish motif said attorney general rising again will witness please tell court what mean by nobly unselfish motif in case like mean said fenella hesitating for moment looking up at deemster then before must be stopped speaking with passion rapidly mean that girl be betrayed at time of sorest need by one who must have protected not taken advantage of mean that falling in love afterwards with man good man who be willing to make wife committed crime solely only in effort to cover up fault to save honour in eye of man who loved mean too that real guilt lie not so much with poor creature who sits here in shame a with man who used caring nothing for then left to bear consequence of sin alone shame on shame on may no good man own for friend may no good woman take for husband may live to irregular outburst be interrupted by cry from advocate bench gell have risen with wild eye seemed to be trying to speak mouth opened said nothing after looking first at fenella then at deemster sank back to seat then fenella a if realising what have done sat also there be moment of uneasy silence then attorney general rose for last time be impossible said not to be moved by what have just heard however improper on legal ground may have be court will not allow to be carried away by feeling be natural consequence of great crime that must bring great suffering prisoner have confessed to great crime have failed to establish proof of extenuating circumstance therefore for protection of human life a well a good name of island ask for utmost penalty of law after there be long pause broken only by whispering on bench be observed that deemster took part in except to bend head when governor clerk of roll leaned across spoke to at length with manifest effort in low voice so low that people in court have to lean forward to hear began to address jury ii when prisoner pleads guilty said be usual for court to proceed at once to sentence in present unhappy case have be thought right that judge in directing jury to find formal verdict must indicate ground on court have based judgment prisoner have pleaded guilty to taking life of new born child have confessed that down to hour of birth have deliberate intention of making away with court be unhappily compelled to find in conduct only too many evidence of design have also said that after child birth under divine love compassion of awakened motherhood repented of intention of killing that came to death by accident accident of semi consciousness consequence of fear court must gladly accept explanation if must be corroborated by evidence unfortunately can not on contrary prisoner subsequent behaviour point to entirely different conclusion therefore court have nothing before prisoner confession that intended to take life of child fact that did indeed take deemster paused gell have risen be seen crushing way out of court then continued how child came by death be between god conscience be not for perhaps for man to read secret of woman heart in dark hour of birth of misbegotten child into cloud of mystery only eye of heaven can follow must fail in duty a judge if did not try to show that court be fully conscious of physical weakness spiritual temptation lie in way of woman who be in position of accused then followed during breathless moment such speaking a nobody present have ever heard before except from stowell only from on day when snatched from gallows rag of woman who have killed husband be contrast of condition attending birth of child born in wedlock of child born illegitimate knew first beloved young wife watching with thrilling heart for sign of coming event be to complete joy happy month in be shielded from harm tender solicitude of husband own sweet secret preparation for little stranger who be to come guess a to sex discussion a to name until at length in fulness of appointed time child born in wedlock come like angel floating out of sunrise into world be waiting for to take into arm child born out of wedlock what of poor mother betrayed perhaps abandoned perhaps bereft of love counted upon living for month in fear of accusing eye in dread of being under heart who be coming to shame to drive from home to make outcast byword among woman until at last creep away to hide in secret place where alone in darkness of night distraught amid groan a of thunderstorm face death to bring fatherless babe into world want not what wonder if sometimes said deemster in pain of body disorder of soul woman more if have hitherto borne good character must be tempted to escape from threatening disgrace by killing child who be innocent cause of rightly wrongly law must take account of such temptation in great eye of justice issue of life death be in god hand only life be sacred not more sacred be life came in palace with statesman waiting in antechamber life of heir to throne than life came in hovel under thatch life of bastard who be to run barefoot on road may be thought to be hard law take account of temptation to woman be exposed when nature demand that penalty from never demand from men who sit here have nothing to do with judge be sworn to administer law a find own feeling may be therefore court have now choice to direct jury to find verdict of guilty against prisoner there be deep drawing of breath in court everybody thought deemster have finished after short pause in tremulous voice vibrated through heart continued jury have right judge can not exercise can go beyond law if having heard evidence in case having god good conscience before jury in finding formal verdict can come to conclusion favourable to prisoner story may recommend to mercy of crown thereby lead perhaps to lessening of punishment even to wiping of out altogether if not law must take course at discretion of governor a representative of king when deemster tremulous voice have ceased juryman put head together for moment then one of rose to ask if might retire to own room to consider point left to by honour court agrees said governor juryman trooped out judge advocate went out also prisoner who have be clinging to fenella hand be removed only die spectator remained in place be afraid to lose for concluding scene iii in small unventilated room overlooking keep jury

local preacher who not always to financial advantage have made rule of life whether in reaping of corn sowing of turnip to wait for divine guidance in moment be on knee one by one fellow juryman including long landowner have slithered down after when rose be apparently of one opinion inasmuch a nobody except god knew why bessie have killed child being alone under cloud of night only thing to do be to leave to lord meantime gell with restless irregular footstep be striding about in court yard fenella outburst have fallen on like flash of lightning in darkness everything have suddenly become clear vague fear have haunted so long suspicion have thrust behind back fact have be unable to understand what blind fool have be stowell life long friend on whose word must have staked soul

committed crime poor girl because a fenella have said have come to love stowell have carried on deception to last moment be carrying on now when be sitting in judgment on own victim meant to sentence to death too yes under fine phrase be easy to see that meant to sentence if did so gell must murder yes by god will murder thought in darkness of cell with light on tortured face except of candle behind grill bessie breaking into fit of hysteria be reproaching fenella with deceiving told that if confessed deemster must let off be going to condemn why must let be what for did come here at did ask did be calm said fenella will explain everything after awhile bessie regained composure then asked for forgiveness beg pardon sometimes know what be saying have be like through time of trouble be very wrong to forget how spoke up for in court will forgive wo then fenella though sorely in need of comfort comforted girl reassured court might be compelled to sentence a have sentenced other girl for similar crime sentence must not be carried out never be in day besides said jury will recommend to mercy then judge will exercise discretionary power to reduce punishment bessie eye began to shine must really forgive alick do think alick will forgive too yes when see that what did be done out of love for how good be will be able to leave isle of man go away somewhere perhaps day oh how good be

back to court said must be brave happens will let hold hand said bessie fenella scarcely able to speak answered yes in deemster room there be painful silence clerk of roll be under deeply recessed window turning over crinkling folio of deposition in case to be taken next governor stretched out in leathern bound armchair before empty fireplace be smoking hard trying to justify to own conscience stowell be sitting at end of long table with head in hand gazing down at red blotting pad in front of spoke occasionally there came from without mournful cry of gull flying over harbour at one moment ululation of crew of irish sailor who be weighing anchor on schooner in bay profound silence around only made thunder in stowell soul knew be at crisis of life on what did now future of life depended address to jury have be fearful ordeal sentence must be terrible to sentence bessie collister having be first cause of crime must do might only be formal sentence crown being certain to commute punishment awful word prescribed by statute must not choke in very throat then fenella voice be ringing in ear still shame on let good man own for friend let good woman take for husband what will be end asked heard door open behind low hum of voice came down staircase from court house there be footstep on carpeted floor somebody by side be speaking be joshua jury be ready to return to court honour iv when stowell resumed seat on bench buzz of conversation have subsided be conscious of presence of only three person besides bessie in dock with fenella by side alick gell with distorted face wig little awry in bench in front of juryman filed back clerk of roll read out name then asked for formal verdict find prisoner guilty according to instruction of court aw yes guilty enough poor soul said foreman be northside farmer lave to lord say there be titter at quaint finding be quickly suppressed then clerk of roll said assume that mean that recommend to mercy aw yes mercy enough too said foreman for when sacrets of heart be revealed be mercy will be wanting after stowell be conscious of still deeper hush in court saw bessie in full glare of shame standing in dock holding rail with one hand clinging to fenella with other heard asking if have anything to say why judgment must not be pronounced upon made answer there be strange expression of frightened hope in face understood be expecting that must save even at last moment at sight there came to one of frightful impulse tempt people on dizzy height from sheer fear of danger to fling into abyss below prisoner at bar said have be said on behalf that be first led to do what did by act of one who remains unpunished while have to bear full weight of fall if think will lessen burden of crime to plead a extenuating circumstance speak be not too late to do so bessie made reply stowell who felt fenella eye fixed on continued be afraid if think will lighten guilt in eye of court to mention man name mention bessie swayed little a if dizzy looked round at fenella then turned back to bench shook head hush in court be broken by rustle of astonishment have deemster lost stowell be conscious of movement by side of governor saying in angry whisper go on for god sake at length in voice so low a to be only just heard even in breathless silence said elizabeth corteen have pleaded guilty to charge of taking life of innocent child little helpless babe who have other natural protector than mother who bore on bosom by act have brought under condemnation of law be for law to punish out of regard to suffering uncertainty a to motif jury have recommended to mercy will be duty to see that prayer be sent through excellency governor to high proper authority in hope that measure of pardon in exceptional case be granted to person in position may be extended to also tear be rolling down bessie cheek stowell saw that be still looking up at with same expression meantime continued however may be court have choice to condemn to punishment prescribed by law who sit here must act according to oath duty justice be pointing with trembling hand to motto under father picture be most sacred thing on earth even even if fellow sinner sat on bench first duty must be to justice for justice be above then lowering head speaking rapidly in muffled indistinguishable whisper stowell pronounced sentence of death none of seemed to be clearly heard until reached last word may god have mercy on soul then there came loud scream from dock bessie who have be leaning forward listening intently look of hope expectation on face darkening to dismay terror have dropped back must have fallen for fenella who have leapt up caught remove prisoner said governor sharply at next moment constable be carrying girl out of court screaming sobbing before have gone there be movement in bench of advocate alick gell have risen again with wild eye be shouting after never mind bessie must rather be than judge there be consternation in court

prisoner until last cry have died away in corridor then have turned about a if intending to leave bench taken step forward stumbled dropped to one knee governor rose reached forward to help recovered immediately face be very pale smiled pitiful smile a if saying little dizziness nothing more waved off assistance bracing up stood aside for governor to go before then walked out of court with firm step ring of tread be plainly heard a passed through green baize door led to deemster room spectator looked into other face a if bewildered by what have seen heard although business of day be not yet

bounded along granted have done wrong in first instance terribly cruelly wrong have have many excuse if bessie collister have told everything surely fenella must see too seeing must understand great fact of be that except for first catastrophe love of fenella have be root cause of have happened if have not loved fenella with deep unconquerable unquenchable love have swept everything else away

first time a man really be not man have imagined to be then what must happen then ii a soon a trial be over bessie weeping bitterly be taken back to cell fenella have left castle rushen be ashamed remembering wild outburst under attorney general examination be reproaching bitterly victor stowell have done what right have to denounce of others in open court too then gell although nobody else

finding solid legal ground on prisoner must be liberated when have convinced law officer of crown that be proper case for exercise of mercy must come up to say bessie collister be free barrier between be broken down for full day after heart be at ease nay more be almost happy for hidden away in secret place of semi consciousness be thought that measure of stowell effort for bessie collister be meter of love for herself at length impatience got better of tranquillity became eager to know what be going on there be only one person who must tell that father coming down to breakfast on sunny morning after storm saw among letter by governor plate large envelope superscribed home secretary when father have opened said a if casually news yet about poor thing in castle rushen there be something here of course be pardoned on contrary death sentence have be confirmed confirmed yes be to die only remains for to fix date of execution sun went out a before thunderstorm rising from unfinished breakfast fenella fled from room great wave of pity seemed to sweep down other feeling determined to go to castle rushen again break news tenderly to unhappy woman on way to railway station mind swung back to stowell after must have done nothing to save girl life be inconceivable that authority in london must have be indifferent to opinion of judge who have tried case can have done nothing nothing then came shock to also a carriage dipped into hill going down to station saw stowell coming up from bridge with rapid stride something told that having news be going to government house to protest be good of going now useless worse than useless one glance got of face before dropped own be whiter thinner than before a if from sleepless night suffering wanted to stop wanted to go on did not know what wanted at next moment coachman who have seen nothing of stowell being occupied with difficulty of hill have swept into station yard when got out of carriage heart be burning with pang of mingled love rage if girl dy in prison there will never be anything between never thought deep in heart almost unknown to herself there be still more poignant cry doe not care for can not chapter thirty four man law when stowell reached government house found governor in garden bareheaded smoking cigar of be obviously trying to preserve ash while watched gardener at work of repairing ravage of last night storm among flower bed ah have come at last have just missed fenella have gone to castletown girl again suppose know saw be matter have come to speak about so oblige then by walking here so that may keep eye on gardener stowell winced stepped to fro on path by governor side while in low tone broached business deemster taubman told at tynwald that have reported against jury recommendation well thought perhaps must permit to explain exact legal position yes be fifty year at least since prisoner have be executed on island for crime fifty be governor blew light blue smoke into lighter blue air watched rising deemster taubman seems to think that prisoner who have wilfully taken life be necessarily murderer be wrong sir wrong quite wrong be established by law of civilised country that be reason of man make accountable for action absence of reason acquits of crime be there ground for thinking that girl be not responsible said governor ground sir woman in position ever be can be responsible gardener think tulip be why law of england continued stowell have ceased to look upon infanticide a crime punishable by death in foreign country be not looked upon a crime at woman who kill child within five day after birth be thought to be suffering from temporary mania therefore not guilty of murder besides besides what stowell breathed heavily then said there be exceptional circumstance in case call for merciful treatment mean mean said stowell speaking rapidly in vibrating voice that girl have bad motif such a usually inspire murder greed lust desire for revenge in fact meant harm to anybody on contrary be conceivable that meant good good even to child to save from life of suffering in world in must have father family nobody to care for shamed outcast mother governor looked at stowell for moment thought be ill be trying to unload conscience then said aloud so have come to ask to have come to ask sir to withdraw objection to recommendation to mercy so that death sentence may be commuted to imprisonment again governor looked at stowell heated face thought yes will ill doe see that be fighting own battle do sir said stowell do for god sake before be too late there be such outcry throughout kingdom a will shake very foundation of justice in island governor be still smoking leisurely keeping eye on flower bed gardener think that bed of geranium began stowell must bear no more good god sir be matter of sufficient importance to merit attention governor turned sharply upon threw away half smoked cigar said come way not word be spoken until returning to house with certain pomp of stride with stowell behind governor reached room closed door behind then unlocking desk took out large envelope same that fenella have seen at breakfast handed content of to stowell saying look at stowell saw at glance what be uttered cry of astonishment then be done yes be done now sit down listen to stowell continued to stand with paper crinkling in trembling finger say taubman told reported against jury recommendation quite true a president of court head of manx judiciary told home secretary saw justification for justification whatever stowell be silent say be fifty year since crime have be punished by death perhaps be fact that statute remains be proof enough that law contemplates case in may properly be exercised in view be case have right to say so still stowell remained silent say prisoner may have acted from good motive see good motive in mother who take life of child speak of shame shame be excuse for crime why must such woman suffer shame shame be just consequence of evil conduct to try to escape from by making away with misbegotten child be crime stowell be trembling still silent pity for woman of sort be sentimental weakness worse be danger to public safety sooner such people be put out of world better for public good there be palpable silence on side for moment governor glanced at stowell twitching face began to be sorry for good lord thought why ca man see that be best for that girl must die a long a life wretched scandal may break out again own share in may come to light then fenella how must allow to marry with danger hanging over head stowell finger be contracting over paper crinkled in hand at length threw on desk said excellency if carry out that sentence will be committing crime monstrous judicial crime governor returned paper to desk then rose said with ring of sarcasm in voice so be criminal be well be responsible for public security in island a long a be here be going to see that be preserved offence of kind have be too frequent of late can only be put down by law prisoner in present case have be justly tried rightly condemned will be business to see that pay penalty of crime stowell pale face have become scarlet lower lip be trembling outside sea be sparkling in sunlight band be playing far off on promenade excellency said stowell quivering over will be life long grief to to resist authority must tell at once that if order that girl execution will never be carried out what do say say will never be carried out why not because will prevent governor rose face be red throat have swelled lip be compressed do mean that will go over head do governor brushed stowell aside in making for bell there be heed for be going sir said stowell at next moment governor be alone in room speechless with astonishment wrath going down corridor stowell passed open door of library room in have parted from fenella in quarrelling with father have burnt last bridge by fenella must come together god forgive must hing else nothing whatever ii fenella found that tragic news have reached castle rushen before bessie have received at first with incredulity expectation of pardon have reached point of conviction morning a rose from plank bed have said to herself will came to day when tommy vondy went into condemned cell blowing nose repeatedly talking about death how came to everybody sooner later bessie looked at with terror screamed oh god help god help for while raved like madwoman everybody have lied to deceived deemster have done nothing to save because wanted out of way after while idea occurred to became calm alick gell if alick must go up to london see king tell that have never intended to kill baby must forgive then alick must come galloping back at last moment perhaps waving paper over head cry stop have seen such thing in illustrated weekly budget story paper used to read on sunday morning at home while dinner be cooking in oven pot mother be singing hymn in primitive chapel father be poring over mistake of moses must do have deceived twice then sister have always be trying to drag away from at once like echo of bell through thick mist over sea came memory of cry a be being carried out of court never mind bessie must rather be than judge yes loved still out of cunning air of prison breed scheme flashed upon must write letter to alick gell not telling what wanted to do plainly pointing to fenella be amazed to find bessie apparently reconciled to end have expected torrent of tear even coarse language of farmyard suspense be worst will be glad when be over said bessie only thing troubled be to die while alick be thinking so hard of if hand did not shake so much must write to ask for forgiveness will write for said fenella will give letter into own hand miss so that sister may not see will try dear sitting by door of cell under light from grill fenella wrote with prison paper on lap while bessie without vestige of colour in forlorn face dictated from bed dear alick will have heard what be going to do to be dreadful be thought perhaps must have written few line though know be too much to expect after sorrow shame have brought on oh if must only have lived to make up to must have gone away a always said to america somewhere must have be so good must have be so happy nobody to cast up to what did be very wrong see what good will do to king to take life poor girl never saw in world still think if there be anybody to speak for must forgive even yet everything must be all right be more than anybody must do for now suppose even though have always loved so dear bessie paused be that asked fenella in husky whisper not quite said bessie began again mother be here last week brought photo got wet in bag on way from derby haven be cracked smudged kiss constant be such company good bye alick last thought will be of last prayer that god will bless if must only see for minute think must be satisfied if ca come write say forgive have be through love for that be here so think best of bessie signed letter filling up remaining space with cross then wrote with own hand p be weak to day so if anything be to be done there be time to lose fenella saw through girl pitiful subterfuge knew well that gell must hing there be only one man in island who must have saved bessie be judge who have tried why have all way home in train fenella asked question only answer must find be that stowell be afraid of offending governor owing so much to oh if have only resisted father in case standing up against fearing one how must have loved found government house shuddering with awe a if tornado have swept through gone at length miss green explained what have happened mr stowell have called to see governor be turned out of house hardly have reached room when father followed into suppose know stowell have be here said yes what did come for to threaten be what came for to threaten that if attempted to carry out sentence of law on girl in castle rushen must prevent fenella tried to conceal joy be rising within what do think intends to do asked appeal to home secretary against suppose must wonder if leaf island in morning if doe brings back pardon will be vote of censure upon nothing short of governor strode across room in wrath then suddenly drew up on seeing that fenella be smiling see who be cause of man insane conduct said who have broken with have because have misfortune to encounter woman long ago hold responsible for everything have done since so to satisfy ridiculous qualm fall back upon fool damned fool be better know what be taking possession of woman in day be sick to death of feminist imbecility braying of male ass father talk to said governor with blazing eye swept out of room then victor have done something did care for now be going to take great risk to save life of girl in prison momentary qualm about duty to father be swept down by tide of love for stowell after be man have thought to be god bless speed chapter thirty five god made man of dust of ground stowell have travelled far by time when left government house in heat flame of anger be at war with god man there be kind of self defence in thinking that however deep own wrong doing whole world be full of infamy found that news of forthcoming execution have reached fort anne before returned to to avoid whispering group in public room packed bag took afternoon train to ballamoar alone in railway carriage have time to review situation visit to governor have be wretched failure even if have be success what must have be result to bessie collister substitution of jail for gallows instead of death three year five year perhaps ten year imprisonment thank god have not succeeded what be to do now asked appeal to london useless home official must support resident authority having made hideous error must be reluctant to correct then what can do thought suddenly saw that argument have used with

know in world if be be singer be singing in triumphant tone god move in mysterious way wonder to perform fenella who have begun to tremble turned back to hotel market place be full of people who be pouring into from thoroughfare on reaching room locked door pulled down window blind sat on bed covered eye tried to think out what have happened noise outside be like surge of sea like surge of sea be tumult in heart brain must be possible that victor stowell have helped bessie collister to escape remembered what have said to father that if attempt be made to carry out sentence must prevent remembered what have said to that never must there be anything between while girl lay in prison have be in castletown night before be only man in island who must have access to castle without order from governor chief constable judge to break prison what must be end of why have done incredible thing risking everything be solely because must not allow unhappy girl who have suffered so much for already to go to gallows be perhaps because have said suddenly great quickening of love for stowell came over if have stumbled upon secret must protect what can do asked at one moment occurred to to run back to quay lane warn good people there to say nothing more about deemster might awaken suspicion thought bessie escape be due to supernatural agency that have come a answer to prayer let continue to think so at seven o'clock be in train for douglas telegraph pole be flying by must know what governor be doing father might do own course be clear must stand by victor now happened ii in cool sunshine of early may morning government house lay asleep gardener be mowing distant part of lawn when saw carriage drive rapidly up to porch two gentleman got out of in le time than took to empty grass pan into wheelbarrow rang three time at door inside house nobody be yet stirring except old john watchman who be drawing curtain opening window heard bell thought postman have brought registered letter in cloth shoe be shuffling to vestibule when bell rang again yet again traa de looiar time enough growled voice fell to more deferential tone when opened door saw who be there apology to excellency say attorney general chief constable wish to see immediately on urgent business two men stepped into smoking room be still dark with blind down rank with last night tobacco smoke few minute later governor entered in dressing gown over pyjama with bare foot in heelless slipper then attorney told young woman who be to have be executed that morning have escaped good god only too true sir colonel farrell have have urgent telegram from inspector at castletown when did happen during night jailer say locked up at eleven when opened cell at five prisoner be gone where be jailer at castle still said chief constable have told police to send up immediately governor rose from seat into have dropped walked to fro such blow to authority of law escape of prisoner on eve of execution said attorney such handle to disorderly element too said chief constable good lord know let think let think governor drew up one of window blind eye fell on steamer lying by pier with smoke rising lazily from black red funnel if woman escaped only few hour ago said can not have left island yet have given order that passenger by morning steamer will be watched not yet sir do so at once if fails telegraph to police in town parish good gracious in pocket handkerchief of island ought to be possible to re capture escaped prisoner in day even if lie like toad under stone will leave stone unturned

presume find out for certain come back at four afternoon bring blockhead of jailer with listen men be leaving room try to keep ridiculous thing quiet if get into paper across water england will be laughing at governor be again at window watching attorney general carriage going rapidly down drive when saw hackney car containing fenella coming up to house sight started new order of idea remembered stowell threat if order that girl execution will never be carried out because will prevent for three day have understood to mean that deemster must appeal over head to imperial authority stowell have not done so be such fool have remembered bedevilment of own position so governor have dismissed thought anger at son of old friend have subsided now threat came back on with new interpretation must be possible such unheard of thing a soon a fenella entered house called into room shut door behind have just come from castletown yes father then know what have happened yes can throw light on light on mean have seen anything of stowell since spoke of last nothing heard from do think likely that be impossible responsible person in sense must do thing must be other one what other father young gell of course be only man in island who must wish girl to escape only one who must be fool enough to help to do so fenella went to room with heart at ease be sorry for gell very sorry in consuming selfishness of love for stowell found secret joy in thought that suspicion be being diverted from real culprit victor be safe thus far what must do be now doing iii be near to noon

behind what be alick to think of then that what have done have not be at call of friendship of mere self protection to divert suspicion from to remove only witness against thus to build future life on unprotected name of innocent man must let that lie run on without saying word against then fenella have seen going to saying now that girl be longer in prison barrier between be broken down have seen

repeated what have said in smoking room of key have only to give rascal rope must hang friend be yet more deadly nearly have deserted good thing have said have be forgotten bad thing must remember be revived a far back a reckless day at mount murray a young man expulsion from king william a boy be man of straw be surprising what people have seen in astonishing that governor have recommended for position of deemster press have be silent from fear of penalty of contempt pulpit sunday having intervened have be loud with platitude inspired by text be sure sin will find out when time came for judge to enter court house atmosphere be rank with evil passion acid odour of perspiring people taubman be deemster although tortured by rheumatism have dragged out of bed having scented opportunity of gaining favour with governor governor presided a be duty to do be remarked that except for one moment on taking seat when looked round at open mouthed spectator with expression seemed to say what race never raised eye be short trial rarely have there be more irregular one taubman be notorious for legal deficiency in earlier day stowell in one of limerick have christened old necessity because necessity knew law have long be jealous of stowell popularity particularly of rapid rise to position have have to wait forty year for now have upstart in hand at last when case be called stowell be brought up by two policeman placed in dock cheek be very pale eye heavy a with unshed tear be almost a if youth have stepped with one stride into age suffering give certain sublimity be said afterwards never before have looked so strong noble spectator saw nothing of now calm seemed to to be callousness did not appear to see scorching glance cast at last time have seen in court be on bench now be in dock must have be better pleased if in dread certainty of fate have betrayed fellness of terror except for one moment when turned slowly round to look at murmur ceased suddenly at full sight of face seemed to to have forgotten shame of place stood in taubman in rasping voice read out charge to prisoner called on to plead how say be guilty not guilty guilty said stowell in clear voice then after moment of merciless silence there be deep drawing of breath have accomplice none humph what be motive in committing crime again there be moment of merciless silence then stowell speaking very slowly said have seduced prisoner be therefore first cause of crime ah there be long indrawing of breath among spectator be wonder man did fall dead with shame what if please be reason for making confession must not allow innocent person to suffer for crime be that only reason silence became breathless after pause stowell said in low voice be question will answer to higher tribunal indeed said taubman with sneer then silence be broken by cowardly titter passed through court house attorney general rose to summarise fact face be white decomposed thin hair be disordered linen slip under chin be awry only once before since leaving government house have be out of door to visit stowell at police station receive letter have be found on too have dragged from bed to come to court being afraid to leave prosecution of son of old friend boy brought up in own office to deputy whom governor be sure to appoint in place hudgeon who sat by side speech did not please court spectator gave impression of being plea for prisoner indeed there be moment when attorney seemed to forget that be there to prosecute speaking in tremulous voice never once looking towards dock said must seem incredible that anyone in position of accused must be guilty of crime with be charged lucidity of confession correspondence to fact a knew made inconceivable that have told lie there must be doubt be guilty being so came under condemnation of law have said old man flashing moist eye on glistening eye behind crown stand for justice not revenge court must remember that prisoner have made voluntary confession that nothing must have be known of crime if have not of disclosed before sublime spectacle of man who be making only reparation in power to justice have sullied must be touched by fire of great renunciation murmur of dissent passed through court house again court must remember that prisoner have confessed to secret sin have tempted to crime if have be scoundrel must have concealed have put conscience before liberty before reputation perhaps before life oh once more court must remember that prisoner have surrendered to justice because be in danger of arrest must not be human if be not moved by sight of man giving up to law so that innocent man might not suffer in stead finally court must remember youth of prisoner undoubted talent brilliant promise high position revered memory of father if moved by consideration decided to impose nominal penalty crown must be satisfied ah punishment court think fit to impose on prisoner said attorney can be a nothing to have inflicted upon never in island have there be so great downfall rarely can suffering for sin have be more terrible since veil of temple be rent in twain darkness covered land be impossible for spectator not to be hushed to awe by daring word quivering tone with old attorney closed speech taubman in ferocity of malice be unmoved humph said mean suppose that man may be innocent guilty at same time then cowardly titter ran through court house time have come for judgment taubman leaned over bench clasped bony finger in front of said victor stowell stand up stowell rose stood with hand interlaced heavy eye fixed steadfastly on judge have anything to say why judgment must not be pronounced upon nothing need skill to wound defenceless for next few minute taubman seemed to glory in exercise of power prisoner at bar said have confessed to crime of breaking prison to effect escape from custody of young woman have first debauched then abandoned have have be said on behalf strangely enough by public servant whose duty be to arraign that confession be voluntary nothing of kind be made when hand of law be upon when warrant for arrest of innocent man be about to be issued be face to face with certainty of exposure punishment have have be also be said that confession of private sin show operation of conscience conscience must have be better employed when sat in judgment on own victim deliberate offence be probably without precedent in history of criminal jurisprudence finally have be argued that high position family connection ought to mitigate punishment on contrary ought to increase a showing disregard of responsibility especially ingratitude to head of judiciary excellency here taubman bowed to governor whose favour have so ill requited ah crime be clear be without particle of justification have disgraced name profession island therefore court can only mark sense of enormity of offence by inflicting maximum penalty prescribed by law two year imprisonment in castle rushen hardly have last word be spoken when spectator broke into frenzied shout of approval police judge made attempt to repress governor rose hastily hurried off bench taubman gathering up paper spectacle two walking stick hobbled after shouting went on surged about stowell a stepped out of dock passed with slow stride through door led down to prison deadened sound of followed while descended stair when reached cell mingled with yet wilder shouting from street where tumultuous crowd have be waiting for verdict delight of mob seemed delirious woman from meaner street by quay be dancing on pavement meantime in robing room with governor taubman be congratulating on travesty of justice taking wig off stubbly grey hair said think gave gentleman desert for bad treatment of
