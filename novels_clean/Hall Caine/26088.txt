follow in ignorance of manifest design tripped back on tiptoe fled away like lapwing over noiseless grass when greta met hugh ritson be saying to herself of paul in particular of sex in general what dear simple unsuspecting trustful creature be then drew up sharply ah hugh how happy look greta said fixing eye upon new light brightened sunny face not happier than feel answered swung arm over

hesitation be sure be le painful to because be there to see oh be so sorry said greta impetuously mean with father hugh bent head slightly be inevitable know that full well for share in ask pardon be nothing said took father too seriously took at word be dear old man meant nothing meant very much only wanted to abuse little perhaps frighten shake stick at then love better for may be right greta among whim of nature there be that of making such human contradiction a say take thing seriously everything life paused there be slight trembling of lip besides went on in tone have be always so since childhood brother mine there have not be much paternal tenderness wasted on can hardly expect now surely that must be morbid fancy greta said in distressed tone light be dying out of eye made one quick glance downward to where hugh ritson infirm foot trailed on road then in instant of recovered consciousness glanced up now confused embarrassed into face be too late have read thought faint

tone just lawful impediment a say greta eye opened wide in undisguised amazement impossible can not mean said with customary impetuosity glanced into hugh face misread what saw there then began to laugh at first lightly afterward rather boisterously said with head averted almost a if talking to herself be nothing to man love do then love greta started do ask said amazement in wide eye have deepened to look of rapture love said better than world beside girl be lifted out of herself be to be brother hugh need not fear to speak so swung bonnet on arm just to preserve composure by distracting exercise hugh ritson stopped face softened be perplexing smile sat on feature while have talked with greta there have run through mind a painful undertone thought of mercy fisher have now dismissed last of qualm respecting to be tied down for life to mindless piece of physical prettiness what man of brain must bear have yielded to natural impulse true that moment of temptation threatened painful consequence still true what then nothing be dead fruit to hang about neck forever tut natural law be against have not said that be above prejudice so be above maudlin sentiment of great lover of noble history sophistry grew apace with greta beautiful countenance before catching at last word said brother yes did never guess must have wished name look of amazement returned to eye

be busy with many thought be thinking of paul a parson christian great book have pictured paul a child little darling babe not yet able to walk must be possible that paul paul have once be that of

monday paul have promised to come home on wednesday only two day more yet how long must be after greta have reached lonnin went up to ghyll must soon be there how thick tree be in lane shut out last glimmer of light from sky lantern burned yellow amidst snow lay on like crust then greta thought of mr ritson be strange that paul mother have sent for be friend there have never be much intimacy between mr ritson be grave earnest woman saintly soul greta lightsome spirit have always felt rebuked in presence paul loved mother must need love a well a reverence mother of paul be paul first paul last paul be center of world be woman love be whole existence here in lonnin be in pitch darkness stumbled once into dike then laughed went on again at one moment thought heard noise not far away stood listened be nothing only hundred yard more bravely then by swift rebound knew not why mind went back to event of morning thought of hugh ritson mysterious threat what did mean what harm must do oh that have be calmer asked heart fluttered flashed upon that perhaps be not mother who have sent for to night pulse quickened at instant curlew shot over head with deep mournful cry at same moment heard step approaching came on quickly stopped who be asked there be answer sound of footstep ceased who be called again then with heavy thud in darkness on snow one approached trembled from head to foot advanced step stopped again footstep be passing brought light of lantern full on retreating figure be figure of man going by hastily turned head over shoulder saw face be face of paul colorless agitated with flashing eye drop of greta blood stood still paul cried thrilled immovable there be instant of unconsciousness earth reeled beneath when came to herself be standing alone in lane lantern half buried in snow at foot have be dream be twenty yard from house door of porch stood open chilled with fear to heart core rushed in one be in hall not sound faint mutter of voice in kitchen ran through passage threw open kitchen door farm laborer be at supper chatting laughing eating smoking did hear somebody in house cried men got up turned about there be dead silence in moment when now what body flew off without waiting to explain kitchen be too far away hugh ritson room opened from first landing of stair stair went up almost from porch darting up threw open door of hugh room hugh be sitting at table examining paper by lamp have seen paul cried in agonized whisper with panic stricken look hugh dropped paper rose stiffly to foot great god where here moment eye met did not answer be very pale have dreamed looked down at snow crusted lantern in hand must have be dream stepped back on to landing stood in silence serving people have come out of kitchen huddled together looked at in amazement then low moan reached ear ran to mr ritson room door to stood wide open fire burned in grate candle on table outstretched on floor lay mother of paul cold still insensible when mr ritson regained consciousness looked about with empty gaze of one who be bending bewildered eye on vacancy greta be kneeling beside helped to lift into bed mr ritson did not speak grasped greta hand with nervous twitch when girl whispered something in ear from time to time trembled visibly glanced with startled look toward door not word did utter thus hour after hour wore on night be growing apace painful silence brooded over house only in kitchen be voice raised above whisper there servant quaked clucked tongue among let loose in conjecture accent of surprise hugh ritson passed again again from own room to mother looked down from time to time at weary pale quiet face said little put question greta sat beside bed only le weary only le pale quiet only le disturbed by horrible imaginings than sufferer who lay upon toward midnight hugh came to say that peter have be sent for from vicarage greta rose put on cloak hat kissed silent lip followed out of room a passed down stair greta stopped at door of hugh ritson room beckoned to enter with went in together closed door now tell said what mean hugh face be very pale eye have wandering look when spoke voice be muffled by effort of unquenchable energy shook off show of concern mean said that have be victim of delusion greta pale face flushed mother have also be victim of delusion hugh shrugged shoulder showed teeth slightly made reply answer tell truth be frank for once tell can explain mystery if must explain how must be mystery greta felt blood tingle to finger tip do believe have told truth asked be sure have do believe saw paul in lane be sure think saw do know for certain that went away hugh nodded head be sure have not got back quite sure in short think what saw be merely result of woman hysteria hugh smiled through white lip staring eye assumed momentary look of amused composure stepped to table fumbled paper reminded greta of paper parson have asked to deliver ought to have given before said mr christian sent took without much apparent interest put on table unread went to door with trap be standing in court yard with natt in driver seat brother peter in seat behind snow have ceased to fall lay several inch deep on ground there be snow dumb silence on earth in air hugh helped greta to place then lifted lamp from trap looked on ground few yard ahead of horse there be footprint in snow said with poor pretence at smile none at least go from house greta have begun to doubt lacked presence of mind to ask if there be footprint at except peter thing be done gone happened three hour ago be easy to suspect evidence of sens hugh returned lamp to loop did scream asked when saw when saw greta be beginning to feel ashamed might have done can not positively say ah explains everything doubt mother heard be frightened see now natt drive on cold journey good night greta felt face burn in darkness before have time impulse to reply be rolling away toward home at interval ear caught sound of suppressed titter from driver seat natt be chuckling to with great apparent satisfaction since fire at mill have be putting two two together be now perfectly confident a to accuracy of computation when folk said that paul have be at fire laughed derisively because knew that hour before have left at station idea work in brain like natt pretty much a hop ferment when go to bottom leaf froth bubble at top natt knew that there be grave quarrel between brother also knew that there be two way to station two way back to newlands one through town other under latrigg mr paul might have own reason for pretending to go to london also own reason for not going natt have left stepping into station at town entrance what be to prevent from going out again at entrance from latrigg of course be what have done have never be out of county deary how blind folk be to be sure thus natt wise head chuckled clucked at one moment natt twisted sapient facetious noddle over shoulder to where brother peter sat huddled into hump in gloomy silence mercy peter cried in affrighted whisper with mighty tragical start be thee dusta know thowt be thy ghost know a be not dragging body frae bed cold neet like mumbled peter numbed up to tongue still warm enough there chapter ix hugh ritson be content that greta must think have be victim of delusion be not unwilling that must be tortured by suggestion of supernatural if concluded that paul have deceived her a to departure from newlands must not be unlikely to foster delusion one thing of others hugh ritson be anxious to prevent be that greta must be led to draw purely matter of fact inference that when thought saw paul have really seen man be own conviction be now sure beyond hope of doubt that there be man alive who resembled paul ritson so closely that have thrice before now once again be mistaken for by unsuspecting person that other man be to be living power in own life in brother life in mother life in greta life who be left alone in court yard when trap drove away hugh ritson shuddered looked round have laughed with easy grace of man no longer puzzled a bid greta good night suspense be gnawing at heart returned hastily to room sat down at table picked up paper parson christian have sent read with eager eye read reread seemed to devour line by line word by word when must have set down finger so trembled that let fall rose from chair with rigid limb what have dreaded now knew for certainty have stumbled into empty grave opened drawer took out three copy of certificate that mr bonnithorne have brought selecting earliest of in order of date set side by side with copy of extract from parson christian diary by one paul son of grace ormerod by husband robert lowther be born august by other paul reputed son of grace ormerod by husband allan ritson be infant still in arm on november paul ritson must not be paul lowther paul ritson must not be half brother of greta hugh ritson fell back a one who have be dealt blow for month have be idly hatching addled villainy revenge that have promised for spurned outraged love revenge that have named retribution be impotent mockery for hour strode up down room with flushed face limb that shook beneath natt came home from vicarage put in horse turned into kitchen now long deserted for night heard restless footstep backward forward began to wonder if anything further have gone wrong at last ventured upstairs opened noiselessly door found master with face aflame look of frenzy curious young rascal with sleepy eye have not time to proffer disinterested service before be hunted out with oath returned to kitchen with settled conviction somewhere in mysterious chamber master kept capacious cupboard for strong drink like master like man natt brewed ample pint of hot ale pulled off great boot drew up to warm before remains of huge fire hugh ritson bedroom opened off sitting room went to bed tried to sleep sleep came near tossed about for hour rose walked room again then went to bed once more be feeling first pang of honest remorse worse man must have accommodated more speedily to altered condition when found that have pursued phantasm to do erring man justice writhed under better man must have fled from if at outset if when first step in descent have be taken have seen clearly villainy lay way must not have gone further now have gone too far to go on be a easy a to go back go on must while honestly believed that greta be half sister to man known to world a paul ritson brother must have stood aside witnessed without flinching ceremony be to hold forever together apart then without remorse must have come down separated seen that woman die of heart hunger who have starved to death great love bore there must have be stern retribution in voice of nature must have whispered that did well when be no longer possible to believe that greta paul be anything to other power of sophistry collapsed retribution sunk to revenge might go on there must be self deception blind earthworm of malice might delude if liked must see must face truth if ever did what have proposed to do then be scoundrel conscious scoundrel hugh ritson leaped out of bed perspiration rolled in big bead from forehead tongue grew thick stiff in mouth great vein in neck swelled without knowing whither went walked out of own into mother room candle still burned on table fire have smoldered out servant maid sat by bedside with head aslant sleeping innocent sleep approached bed mother be breathing softly have fallen into doze pale face be very quiet weary look of worn cheek be smoothed out absent eye be lightly closed closed too on rough world be poor soul be vexed by hugh ritson be touched somewhere deep down in frozen nature angel of love troubled still water bending head must have touched cold forehead with feverish lip drew back tenderness be not for good god gave to a manna from heaven here there man stretched on rack of life have not drop of water must cool tongue with stealthy step a of one who have violated chamber of chastity hugh ritson crept back to own room took brandy from cupboard drank glass of then lay down composed afresh to sleep thought of greta came back to even love for be without tenderness be fiery passion made weep nevertheless galling tear hot bitter smarting tear rolled from eye down in deep hidden well of feeling where too be man like other men hugh ritson strong heart bled must have thought that love like must have subdued whole world to will that when woman must reject very stone must cry out pshaw must sleep never come leaped up laughed mockingly drank glass of brandy laughed again door be open hollow voice echoed through house put on dressing gown took lamp in hand walked down stair into hall wind have risen moaned around house then licked with hissing tongue hugh ritson walked to ingle where fire burned there stood scarcely knowing why lamp in hand cast reflection into mirror on wall behind be flushed face haggard with hollow eye parted lip sight recalled scene stepped into little room at back be in room father died now be empty bare mattress chair table no more hugh ritson lifted lamp above head looked down be enacting whole terrible tragedy afresh crept noiselessly to door opened slightly looked cautiously out then leaving ajar stood behind with bent head inclining ear face wore ghastly smile wind soughed wept without hugh ritson threw door open stepped back into hall there stood minute with eye riveted on one spot then hurried away to room a went up stair laughed again back at bedside poured glass of brandy once more lay down to sleep certainly slept time sleep be deep natt dreamy ear voice in hall have drunk hot ale from same potent cause a master also have slept with somewhat le struggle awakened in chair by unaccustomed sound stole on tiptoe to kitchen door be in time to see from behind figure of man ascending stair carrying lamp before natt eye be shade hazy at moment be cock sure of what saw of course be mister paul sneaking off to bed after more straitforrad folk have got into nightcap second sleep be where natt soon put when be still in troubled house moon white face peered through rack of flying cloud looked in at dark window chapter x next morning tuesday morning hugh ritson found letter on table dearest know what be happening to eye get worse worse to day yesterday have not opened oh dear think be losing sight have have fearful fright day after wrote to mr be son came home saw oh thought be brother paul name be paul too think now must be eye be very bad perhaps did not see plain asked question went away next morning be long writing be oh so very lonely when be coming to write soon loving mercy hugh ritson have risen in calmer mood be prepared for disclosure like last night have be overwhelmed by discovery that paul ritson be not son of robert lowther with coming of daylight sterner spirit of inquiry came upon question now agitated be identity of man who have be mistaken for paul after mercy letter mystery be in measure dispelled there must hardly be shadow of doubt that man who have slept at pack horse man who have be seen by many person at fire man who greta have encountered in lane be one same with man whom mercy knew for paul drayton innkeeper at hendon so much light on one small spot only made surrounding gloom more dark far more important than question of who man be by repute be other question of why be there wherefore have come why did not come openly what hidden reason have for moving like shadow where knew one be known of none hugh thought again of circumstance of mother strange seizure last night have formulated theory respecting be simple enough second man whoever be have for reason come to house failing to attract attention in hall have wandered aimlessly upstairs to first room in heard noise room happened to be mother when stranger with fatal resemblance to absent son presented before in strange way at strange hour in strange place fear have leaped to heart that be wraith warning of death have fainted fallen theory have serious loop hole for incredulity hugh ritson minded not at graver issue tortured morning by light of mercy letter view be clearer if man who resembled paul have come secretly to newlands must have have reason for not declaring if have wandered when none be near into mr ritson room must have be because have purpose there mother seizure might not have be due to purely superstitious fear silence to shattered nerve there be one thing to do be to get at heart of mystery whoever be second man be to be living influence in life thus far one thing only be plain that paul ritson be not half brother of greta hugh determined to travel south forthwith if other man be still beating about newlands so much better hugh must be able to see old woman mother talk with undisturbed by suspicion of cunning man hugh spent most of day in office at pit head settling up such business a must not await return on wednesday morning early dispatched natt on foot with letter to mr bonnithorne explaining succinctly with shrewd reservation recent turn of event then stepped for moment into mother room mr ritson have risen be sitting by fire writing hugh observed a rose that there be tear in eye that paper beneath pen be stained with great drop have fallen a wrote woman be busy on knee on floor sorting linen into trunk garrulous body old dinah wilson be talking a hugh entered cap niver heard sec feckless wark be saying reuben threept down too there be in peat loft when went for peat have all a fine a clerk after passon 'it be master paul at fire certain sure say ower ower again 'what man get away wi ' thy botheration mister paul be off to london ' say 'go see if tha can leet on straight waistcoat spot say threept threept 'it be master paul own birth brother ' say hush dinah said mr ritson hugh told mother in quiet voice that business be taking away then turned about said good day without emotion held out hand to looked tenderly in eye be parting said then leaned forward touched cheek with lip seemed surprised turned pale went out calmly without speaking in hour be walking rapidly over snow crusted road to station chapter xi when paul parted from natt at station on saturday night have told stableman to meet with trap at same spot at same hour on wednesday since receiving instruction however natt have a have seen arrived at conclusion of own respecting certain event futility of doing a have be bidden began to present to mind with peculiar force be good of going to station for man who be not coming by train be use of pretending to bring home person who have never be away other equivocal problem defied solution when natt essayed revolved situation fully on way home from mr bonnithorne decided that to go to station night at eight o'clock must be only fine way of making fool of body when reached stable sat down to smoke saw hour approaching instinct began to act automatically in sheer defiance of thing called reason in short natt pulled off coat proceeded to harness mare then be that relieved of weight of abstract question made two grave discovery first be that horse bore mark of having be driven in absence next that harness be not hanging precisely on hook where have last placed when drew out trap saw that tire of wheel be still crusted with unmelted snow concrete issue finally banished discussion of general principle natt have not entirely accounted for strange circumstance when jumped into seat drove away old idea of paul dubious conduct be still fermenting froth bubble be still rising natt have not gone half way to station when almost leaped out of trap at sudden advent of original thought trap have be driven out before have not covered mile more before thought have annexed along road too after sequence of idea be swift in le than league natt have realized that paul ritson have driven mare to station in order that might be there to come home at eight o'clock thus complete deception have practiced on gullible slow witted person in satisfaction at explanation natt overlooked trifling difficulty of how trap have be got home again driving up into station be greeted by flyman waiting for hire bad on laal mare ma man two sec journey in ya half day reckon tha know be be here afore natt face broadened into superior smile seemed to desire gratuitous informant to tell something did know unspoken request be about to be gratified dusta ken who came down last natt waved hand in silent censure of so much unnecessary zeal passed on promptly a clock struck eight london train drew up at station minute afterward paul ritson came out here be of course thought natt paul be in great spirit face wore

father death thought of mother confession confession more terrible to make more fearful to listen to than mother ever made before son ever heard now again be disaster of very night link in chain of destiny let man compare withering effect of father curse with blasting influence of father sin if wrath of providence must fail in stern awful retribution world in mercy must not forget that sin of father must be visited upon child paul entered lych gate entered church yard night dew on cheek be not colder than tear a knelt by father grave at one instant cursed world world cruel law then there stole into heart poison corroded dearest memory thought of father with bitterness at moment strange awe crept over knew though still only by eye of mind that vision have returned knew be standing against night sky a ghastly headstone to grave when raised eye what saw be more terrible face be before be dead face now saw own corpse stretched out on father grave head fell on cold sod lay like dead on grave of dead then knew that be ordered above that cloud of father sin must darken day that through range change of life be to be lonely slave of sin not own fate be sin inherited wage of sin be death be strange that at moment when earth seemed gloomed by shadow of curse lay blackest over when reverence for father memory love learned at mother knee be deadened by sense of irremediable

more substantial severity of lawyer cynicism relaxed paul handed mr bonnithorne without comment deed drawn up in london mr bonnithorne glanced at pocketed smiled sense of paul importance a dangerous man sunk to nothing at moment parted without more word parson christian got home toward evening dead beaten with fatigue found lawyer waiting for marriage have be big in eye day other affair very

mr christian if think of be be be father old friend there let look on a settled mr bonnithorne looked on a awkward well to say truth mr christian 'd 'd rather not old parson lifted two astonished eye gazed at mr bonnithorne over rim of spectacle lawyer uneasiness increased then parson christian remembered that only little while ago mr bonnithorne have offered reason why paul must not marry greta be rather too secular same reason doubt have appealed honestly to mind a friend of greta family paul greta be going away said parson so judged go to victoria to farm there continued parson on greta money added lawyer parson christian looked again over rim of spectacle then for once frank mellow face annexed reflection of curl on lawyer lip do know said never once came into simple old pate to ask must find dross honest labor mr bonnithorne winced simple old pate must on occasion be more than match for own wise head seeing that will marry think will be expected that must give to husband if have objection objection mr bonnithorne interrupted know that feeling be so serious a then let leave there will decide in morning said parson christian so left there mr bonnithorne dear friend of family made haste to telegraph office sent telegram to hugh ritson in london be to be married to morrow if have anything imperative to say write to night come paul greta saw other only for five minute day amid general hubbub few word be pregnant with serious issue beneath chorus of heart joy there be undersong of discord knew of other perplexity greta be thinking of hugh ritson mysterious threat whether not hugh have power of preventing marriage be question of le consequence to greta at moment than other question of whether not must tell paul what hugh have said a day wore on uncertainty became feverish if spoke must reveal what hitherto have partly hidden importunity unbrotherly disloyalty of hugh love must also awaken fresh distress in paul mind already overburdened with grief for loss of mother probably paul must be powerless to interpret brother strange language if must be puzzled more must be pained perhaps hugh ritson threat be nothing outburst of distempered spirit noise of bladder be emptying still greta nervousness increased reason sophistry must allay felt like blind man who know by current of air on face that have reached two street crossing can not decide turn to take paul on part have grave question to revolve be thinking whether be act of honorable man to let greta marry in ignorance of fact that be not father legitimate son yet must never tell oath have taken over father body must seal lip forever mother honor be wrapped up in oath break one other be longer inviolate true must be to greta greta alone be one true too mother be now dead to world oath be rigid never to reveal to human soul by word deed act shame have sworn must keep conflict of emotion be terrible love be dragging one way love other honor said yes honor said heart first thought be to tell greta everything to keep nothing back from whose heart last thought be secret of birth must lie a dead speechless thing within if be not act of honorable man to let greta marry in ignorance of birth there be only one escape from dishonor not to let marry at if married oath must be kept if oath be kept marriage might be dishonored must not be unreserved complete union of soul with soul heart with heart mind with mind true marriage meant must be laying treasure at altar keeping back part of price paul be not man of subtle intellect perhaps such reflection must have troubled too deeply love be above everything to give up greta be impossible if circumstance be evil genius of man life must be made god of also at hazard paul meant to marry greta after what did question of honor amount to be mere phantasm what did matter to greta whether be high basely born must love le more must be le more worthy of love how be birth base not in god eye for god have heard voice of hagar son only in eye of world what did mean meant that whether birth be high base depended one part on virtue nine hundred ninety nine part on money where have world titled great one sprung from not like from father father father from monarch favorite thus paul reasoned with at juncture whether be wholly right wholly wrong partly right partly wrong concern not at be natural that man in such place at hour must decide once for to say not word to greta be just a natural that reticence must produce long series of incident still to be recorded thus be not word be said between of what lay nearest to heart of
