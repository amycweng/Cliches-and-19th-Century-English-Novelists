one of wooden stool in front of pope baron continued to stand by side between pope king be wooden table on two large candle be burning young king be pale expression of twitching face be one of pain be good of holiness to see said perhaps gravity of errand may excuse informality of visit pope who be leaning forward on arm of chair only bent head excellency said king indicating baron tell have gained proof of organised conspiracy against life say that holiness hold secret of conspirator pope without responding looked steadily into face of young king who became nervous embarrassed not that be afraid said personally afraid naturally must think of others family people even of italy if holinessif youryour holiness baron who have be standing with one arm across breast other supporting chin intervened at moment majesty said with majesty permission that of holiness bowed to sovereign may be convenient if state shortly object of visit young king drew breath of relief pope who be still silent bent head again day ago holiness be good enough to warn majesty government that from private source of information have reason to fear that assault against public peace be to be attempted pope once more assented since then government have received corroboration of gracious message of holiness coupled with very definite prediction of nature of revolt intended in short have be told by correspondent abroad that conspiracy of european proportion involving subversive element of england france germany be to be directed against rome a centre of revolution that attempt be to be made to assail constituted society by striking at king well sir holiness may have heard that be intention of government nation to honour anniversary of majesty accession by festival anniversary fall on monday next have reason to fear monday be day intended for outbreak of vile conspiracy well holiness may have difference with majesty can not desire that cry of suffering must mingle with strain of royal march if government know have remedy let alter king plan advice with holiness honour be scarcely practicable for government to alter king plan must be to alarm populace demoralise service to add to unhappy excitement be object of festival allay why do come to because holiness information although conclusive be too indefinite for effective action believe holiness can supply mean by may preserve public order with apologetic gesture save life of king pope be moving uneasily in chair will ask to be good enough to speak more plainly said baron heavy moustache rose at one corner to fleeting smile holiness said be already aware that accident disclosed to source of information be lady knowledge enabled to judge who be subject of communication be lady lover official channel give proof that be engaged abroad in plot against public order thus if know sir what do want with holiness may not be aware that person in question be deputy that deputy can not be arrested without fulfilment of various condition prescribed by law one of condition be that one must be in position to denounce pope half rose from chair ask to denounce baron bowed very low government doe not presume so far said only hope that holiness will require informant to do so then want to outrage confidence be not confession holiness even if have be a holiness know better than do must not be without precedent to reveal fact be necessary to be known in order to prevent crime capuchin sandal be scraping on floor pope raised left hand friar fell back be aware said pope that lady speak of a informant be married to deputy be aware that think be think said indignant voice of capuchin pope left hand be raised again in short sir ask to require wife to sacrifice husband if holiness call so to perform act will preserve public peace do call so baron bowed young king be restless there be moment silence then pope said putting aside extreme unlikelihood that lady know more than have said have already communicated what possible inducement do expect to offer that must sacrifice husband husband life said baron life holiness may not know that government of europe having ascertained existence of widespread plot against civil society have joined in measure of repression one of be extension to country of what be called belgian clause in treaty whereby person guilty of regicide of plot directed against life of sovereign be made liable to extradition well deputy rossi be now in berlin if be denounced with condition required by law a conspiring against life of king might have arrested to night brought back a common murderer well holiness may not have heard that since late unhappy riot parliament in spite of protest of majesty have re established capital punishment for form of high treason therefore said pope if wife be to denounce husband for participation in conspiracy must be sentenced to death for conspiracy yes said baron present be not only conspiracy man rossi have engaged in eighteen year ago be condemned in contumacy for conspiracy against life of late king have not yet suffered for crime because of difficulty of bringing home in case a in there be only one person known to authority who can fulfil condition required by law that person be informant of holiness well if holiness can prevail upon lady to identify lover a man condemned for former conspiracy will be helping to save husband life from penalty due for present one how so majesty be willing to promise holiness that whatever result of new trial in assize to follow old one in contumacy will grant complete pardon then then deputy rossi will be banished threatened conspiracy will be crushed public peace will be preserved king life will be saved pope leaned forward on arm of chair did not speak there be silence for moment thus holiness must see said baron suavely that in asking to obtain denunciation of man rossi government be only looking to holiness to fulfil mission of mercy to venerated position have destined if refused to exercise mission of mercy baron bowed gravely holiness will not refuse said if do what then then holiness be about to say something be listening man speak of be bitterest enemy of church hypocrisy be at once atheist freemason sworn to allow private interest feeling bond of patriotism blood to turn aside from purpose be to overthrow society church well be also bitter personal enemy of holy father know object so dear a of tearing from place shaking throne of st peter well sir police army of government be only force by holy father can be protected without bad element lurk in community must break out holy father must be driven from rome priest assaulted in street what will happen if refuse to outrage sanctity of immortal soul in spite of danger holiness asks what will happen if refuse to obtain denunciation of man whom holiness know to be conspiring against public order do what will happen will be holiness be speaking go on if crime be committed king be killed minister of majesty will be in position to say to call upon friar to witness that pope knew of beforehand under most noble sentiment about sanctity of immortal soul gave supreme encouragement of regicide then sir world draw nice distinction holiness vatican be now at war with nearly power people of europe in presence of monstrous crime against most innocent most highly placed world must say that what pope did not prevent pope desired what pope desired pope designed that vicar of prince of peace attempted to rebuild temporal power by mean of plot of conspirator dagger of assassin sandal of capuchin be scraping floor again once more pope put up hand come to sir when have exhausted other mean of obtaining end naturally government wish if possible to spare holiness unusual painful ordeal lady have resisted other influence have resisted influence can be brought to bear upon by proper authority have heard of sir have heard what 'authorities have done to humble helpless woman have be victim of heartless man by knowledge of fact 'authorities have tempted tried tried with poverty with humiliation with jealousy shadow of shame blessed god upheld in love have awakened soul withstood to last baron for first time looked confused have also heard that in order to achieve same end one of gaol have be scene of scandal have outraged divine human law holiness must not accept for truth be printed in halfpenny paper be true that in cell where helpless unfortunate be paying penalty of crime 'authorities introduced police agent in disguise to draw into denunciation of accomplice be matter of state holiness assert deny in name of humanity ask be such 'authorities punished do sit in cabinet of minister of interior doubt official went too far holiness will for sake of miserable malefactor who told one story to day to morrow drag public service through court of law pity for such person be morbid sentimentality holiness unworthy of strong enlightened government then god destroy such government sir bad unchristian system support allow that man be miserable malefactor be not alone be offended in poor degraded person spirit of justice what did 'authorities do tortured man by love for wife by memory of murdered child by be true noble divine in crucified christ in helpless man stand here in presence of vicar of christ to excuse defend pope have risen in chair lifted one hand over head with majestic gesture involuntarily young king who have be ashen pale for moment dropped to knee baron only folded arm stiffened leg have ever thought sir of end of unjust minister think of dying hour tortured with memory of young life dissolved mother dead widow desolate orphan in tear think of day after death when who have passed through world like scourge of god lie at foot one so mean may spurn dishonoured carcass be aiming high excellency beware beware pope sat king rose to foot majesty said pope day will come when must present before god to render to account of deed being far more advanced in year will assuredly be first must not dare to meet eye of judge if did not day warn of danger in stand only god know by what inscrutable decree of providence one man be made pope king while man equal superior be made beggar slave god who made pope king meant to be father not seducer of subject sovereign may be man of good intention if be weak allows to fall into hand of despotic minister be worse affliction than cruellest tyrant think well majesty throne may be quagmire man may be buried in buried alive young king began to falter incoherent word without listening pope rose to end audience promise said pope that if say if in order to avoid bloodshed to prevent crime obtain from lady identification of husband a person condemned for former conspiracy will spare pardon happens holy father give solemn word for then leave let think wait if consent where must go to to procura by ponte ripetta a time press at ten o'clock on saturday morning

habit pope lay on lounge with hand in vertical pocket of white woollen cassock holiness be not well morning not very well father pifferi holiness be disturbed by interview in sacristy must think more about in case what minister proposed be impossible therefore must dismiss from mind to ask wife to reveal secret of husband must be tyranny worse than rack besides must be uncanonical holiness must never consider how so did holiness promise whatever nature of poor lady confidence must hold a sacred a confessional well what be confessional holiness be tribunal in priest be judge penitent prisoner

expressly forbidden to demand name of others upon plea of preventing evil how can hold lady confidence a sacred yet ask to denounce husband pope rose with face full of pain walked to bookcase took down book listen said began to read if penitent be obliged under pain of mortal sin to reveal accomplice to repair common injury have maintained against other theologian even then confessor can not oblige to do so there cried capuchin what did say gaume be wise other theologian who be only continued pope turning page holding up one finger can must oblige to make known accomplice to other person who can arrest scandal capuchin took long breath be that what holy father intends to do in instance can must capuchin dropped head there be long pause in pope walked nervously about room poor child
