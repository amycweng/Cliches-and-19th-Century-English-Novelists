three hour since matthew branthwaite have left moss mr ray still sat before turf fire gazed into in silence rotha be by side willy lay on settle drawn up to hearth listened for sound of footstep did not come old clock ticked out louder more loud cricket measured chirp seemed to grow more painfully audible wind whistled through leafless bough without in lull of abating storm low rumble of ghyll must be heard within what kept ralph away be unusual thing for to be abroad from dawn to dusk finger of clock be approaching eleven still did not come on night of others must have wished to be at home earlier in evening rotha have found occasion to go on errand to neighboring farm there have heard that towards noon ralph have be seen on horseback crossing stye head towards wastdale upon reporting at moss old dame have seemed to be relieved think of everything have said day have cherished hope that must be possible to bury angus over hill at gosforth be in old churchyard there that father lay father mother kindred be twenty mile to plain upland lay beyond bleak shore of wastdale be full five hour journey there back when twice five hour have be counted still ralph have not returned anxiety of inmate of old house must no longer be concealed in eagerness of expectation clock ticked louder than ever cricket chirped with more jubilant activity wind whistled ghylls rumbled longer welcomer sound broke stillness at length willy got up put on hat must go down lonnin to where joined road meet ralph on way must have done so before horror of walking under shadow of tree where last night father fell have restrained conquering fear sallied out late moon have risen be shining at full with beating heart passed dreaded spot reached highway beyond must hear nothing of horse canter there be step approaching went on towards whence came two men passed close beside of be ralph did not respond to greeting when in accordance with custom of country bade good night be stranger looked closely thought suspiciously at a went by willy walked little farther then returned a got back to lane led to house two men passed again once more looked closely into face fear prompted to speak again went on in silence a willy turned up towards home truth flashed upon that men be cause of ralph absence knew enough of what be going on in world to realize bare possibility that brother early parliamentarian campaign might bring into difficulty even yet seemed certain that lord of wythburn manor must be executed only ralph obscurity must save when willy got back into kitchen impression that ralph be being pursued dogged be written on face mother understood more of trouble than brother have not returned looked from face back to fire now died slowly on hearth rotha be quicker to catch significance of willy nervous expression fitful word to situation now appeared hardly le than tragic with old father lying dead in loft above what must come to household if one strong hand in be removed then thought of own father what must become of where be night sense of impending disaster gave strength to however rose put hand on willy arm a walked to fro across earthen floor be more drawn to from scarce explicable sense of weakness one coming now said in eager tone ear be awake with feverish sensitiveness one at back be ralph at last have come down side of ghyll have entered house from behind breathed freely god bless thee said mr ray have be anxious be bad to keep so said with obvious effort to assume ordinary manner reckon thou couldst not have helped lad said mr ray relieved cheerful be bustling about to get ralph supper on table well no answered know have be over to gosforth be long ride borrowed jackson pony from what wild country be to be sure blew gale on stye head be bleak enough up there on day like mother must scarce hold horse wonder ralph see here thy poddish thou must be fair clemm 'd called at broom hill how did come in at back lad do not come up lonnin thought 'd go round by low meadow see safe then nearest way home be on hill side know willy rotha glanced simultaneously at ralph a said found nothing in face voice manner to indicate that word be intended to conceal truth look how late be said a clock struck twelve have better go off to bed of think must surely go off said mr ray with rotha left kitchen willy soon followed leaving ralph to eat supper alone laddie who have entered with master be lying by smouldering fire after one have finished eating other came in for liberal share of plain meal then ralph rose lifting up hat staff walked quietly to brother room willy be already in bed candle be still burning sitting on old oak chest that stood near door of little room ralph said will perhaps be off again before be awake in morning will be done in good time funeral will be on day after to morrow robbie anderson will see to everything robbie anderson said willy in accent of surprise know be custom in dale for friend of family to attend to office yes robbie anderson of men may depend upon said ralph be first time have heard that can depend upon said willy true true be satisfied about robbie need fear nothing robbie changed man think changed must be ralph if must commit to care what must not be too well discharged by most trustworthy friend of family yes robbie will do a well a better know willy have old weakness for sheep stray when get back fancy somehow be best of flock may straggler justify odd fancy time brother rotha will see to what have to be done at home said ralph rising turning to go ralph said willy do know faltered began again obviously changing subject have be in there to night with motion of head towards room wherein lay remained of father have dare not go must not if must wish to remember a lived one glance at dead face must blot out memory forever ralph must not understand there be chord in nature responded to such feeling said nothing in reply ralph continued willy do know think rotha almost thin do not think that rotha rather care for perceptible tremor passed over ralph face then said with something like smile do think doe lad do almost do think so ralph have resumed seat on oak chest simple faltering word just spoken have shaken to core hidden there hidden even from have lain inert for month mighty passion such a only great heart can know in one moment have seen known for what be yes have indeed loved girl loved still when spoke again voice seemed to have died inwards appeared to be speaking out of breast what of willy asked think care for too think so how sure be other of more absolute affection than most positive word must express ralph sat silent for moment a be wont when under influence of strong feeling head inclined downwards eye be fixed on floor great struggle be going on within must forthwith make declaration of own passion love said yes love must be above tie of kindred claim of blood many tongue of unselfish nature said if thing be wrong must of come to nought if right must be useless to oppose struggle be soon over impulse of self sacrifice have conquered at what cost at what cost yet there be father know willy added one dread thought of such match there may be something in blood at least one fear need have fear of rotha that come of relation to simeon stagg sim be innocent man so say so say let hope so be terrible thought that of marriage with flesh blood of of murderer rotha be a free from taint of crime a be be noble girl worthy of worthy of man father may be said ralph yes yes know thought 'd say so be glad ralph ca tell how glad be to hear say so if be right if rotha really love know will be a glad a be ralph face trembled slightly at nodded head smiled not must think of for long time willy continued dreadful occurrence must banish

mountain moreover zeal be not so ardent a to make eager to risk danger of arrest be likely to be full of peril be willing enough to accept story of ralph flight must not reasonably neglect opportunity to assure of credibility so have beaten about house during morning under pioneering of villager whom have injudiciously chosen a guide now scanned face of mourner who set out on long mountain journey

escaped observation of person for whom be intended have not reuben thwaite who walked beside matthew gently emphasized with jerk of elbow motion of thumb will glower at moon till fall in midden said matthew with grunt of amused interest two stranger have now gone by willy ray breathed freely a thought that with encounter threatened danger have probably be averted then procession wound way slowly along breast of bracken water when robbie anderson in front have reached point at path went up from pack horse road to top of armboth fell paused for moment a though uncertain whether to pursue keep to auld corpse road cried matthew then in explanation of advice explained ancient cumbrian land law by path becomes public property if dead body be carried over before long procession have reached mountain path across cockrigg bank path be intended to follow a far a watendlath here reverend nicholas stevens left mourner in accordance with old custom might have required that must pas through

through borrowdale towards foot of stye head pas must necessarily be hard tiresome one there being scarcely traceable path through huge bowlder here be agreed that mourner on foot must turn back leaving more arduous part of journey to only who be mounted on sure footed pony matthew branthwaite monsey laman reuben thwaite be among dozen more dalesman who left procession at point when on return journey have regained summit of armboth fell be about to descend past blea tarn towards wythburn stood for moment at highest point took last glimpse of mournful little company with one riderless horse in front wended way slowly beyond rosthwaite along bank of winding derwent looked to now like thin streak of blue in deep valley below soon after procession left house on moss arrangement be put in progress for meal have to be prepared for mourner upon return in evening preliminary investigation into quantity of food must have to be cooked in hour intervening disclosed fact that wheaten flour have run short that one must need to go across to mill at legberthwaite at once if hot currant cake be to be among luxury provided for evening table so liza took down cloak tied ribbon of bonnet about plump cheek set out over dale almost immediately funeral party turned end of lonnin little creature tripped along jauntily enough with large sense of personal consequence to enterprise afoot without absorbing sentiment of gravity of occurrence gave rise to have scarcely crossed old bridge led into legberthwaite highway when saw blacksmith coming hastily from opposite direction now liza be not insensible of attraction in eye of son of vulcan at proper moment be not indisposed to accept tribute of admiration usually however felt affected measure of annoyance at importunity with prosecuted suit when saw coming towards on occasion first feeling be little touched with irritation here be great tiresome fellow again thought can never let girl go by without speaking to have great mind to leap fence cross field to mill liza did not carry into effect scarcely feminine athletic exercise have proposed to herself change of intention on part open up more curious problem in psychology than little creature have notion of fact be just a liza have resolved that must let nothing in world interfere with fixed determination not to let young blacksmith speak to observed to amazement that gentleman in question have clearly no desire to do so be walking past hurriedly with so preoccupied air a actually seemed to suggest that be not so much a conscious of presence be true that liza did not want to speak to mr joseph be also true that have intended to ignore that must not want to speak to that must seem to ignore be much more than must be borne by stubborn little bit of coquettish pride distended at moment too by splendor of best attire in short liza be piqued into desire to investigate portentous business have obviously shut out of consciousness of blacksmith mr garth said stopping a drew up to liza be that replied be in hurry lass good morning mr garth repeated liza maybe will tell what be hurry about have one horse dropped shoe be hooping day what that know body now when meet one in road lass good morning liza must be off very well mr garth if must must be not one to keep one 'at doe want to stop not indeed said liza tossing up head with air a of supreme indifference turning half on heel next time speak to will speak to mind with expression denoting triumph of arm achieved by little outburst of irony sarcasm combined liza tossed ribbon aside that be pattering face in wind seemed about to continue journey parting shot have proved too much for mr garth that young man have stopped few pace down road between two purpose seemed for moment uncertain to adopt impulse of what thought love triumphed over impulse of what proved to be hate retracing few step lay between girl said take cross liza lass if thought really wanted to speak to 'd stop anywhere for nowt must 'd stop anywhere for nowt always seemed to over throng with yon robbie that did if for certain really did want be to say want to speak to 'd stop anywhere for nowt liberal nature of blacksmith offer did not so much impress acute intelligence of girl a fact that mr garth be probably at moment abroad upon errand have not undertaken from equally disinterested motif concerning nature of errand felt particular curiosity that be unknown to be being withheld from be of sufficient provocation to investigation liza be simple country wench must be error to suppose that because have be bred up in city more diminutive than anything ever before gave name because have lived among hand loom milking pail have never seen ball opera worn mask domino be destitute of instinct for intrigue in gayer busier world seems to be heritage of half sex putting head aside demurely a with eye cast down ran finger through one of loose ribbon said softly who say be so very partial to robbie never said so did not that say be partial to anybody else not that ay so joseph sly emphasis be put upon word expressed liza unwillingness to commit to declaration of affection for mysterious entity unknown seemed to mr garth to be proof beyond contempt of question that girl before implied affection for entity no more mysterious than blacksmith face brightened manner changed what have before be almost supplicating tone gave place to tone of secure triumph liza said be going to bring robbie down peg two be be perching up alongside of ralph ray last back end be going to feckle turn joseph be going to do though said liza with brightening face seemed to mr garth to say do by mean mayhap be said blacksmith significantly shaking head be snared a neatly by simple face a ever be swallow by linnet hidden in cage among grass that ralph too great lounderan fellow treat like dirt that doe will pay out now wo joseph said liza a though glorying in blacksmith forthcoming glory liza lass will tell something under fire of pair of coquettish little eye head a well a heart seemed to melt became eagerly communicative dropping voice said that ralph be not gone away at all will be at father berrying that will nay cried liza without prolonged accent of surprise indeed fact have come upon with so much unexpectedness that curiosity be now actually a well a ostensibly aroused yes said mr garth there be a know where to lay hand on very day that there be must be surprised now if yon robbie anderson have be up to something with said liza with curl of lip intended to convey idea of overpowering disgust at conduct of absent robbie maybe have said mr garth with ponderous shake of head denoting extent of reverse evidently must ' must will go to wo joseph be a want leastways one of a want will go take wo that will said joseph emphatically must be off lass for have horse to get ready forby shortness of time so be going on horseback eh joey will take long matter of two hour for must go by black sail come back to wastdale head be round about thou know so will take on wastdale head then eh said liza turning head aside a though in abundance of maidenly modesty really glancing slyly under corner of bonnet in direction taken by mourner wondering if must be overtaken joseph be little disturbed to find that have unintentionally disclosed so much of design potency of bright blue eye looked up so admiringly into face at revelation of subtlety with have seen through mystery impenetrable to le powerful vision have betrayed into unexpected depth of confidence having gone so far however mr garth evidently concluded that best course be to make clean breast of expedient conceived to be insusceptible of danger for must see that funeral party be already on brow of hill so with one foot stretched forward a if in preliminary stage of hurried leave taking blacksmith told liza that have met schoolmaster that morning have gathered enough from word little man have dropped without thought to put upon trace of old garrulous body with whom schoolmaster lodged that mother mistress garth have undertaken office of sounding person have learned that ralph have hinted that must relieve robbie

coming breath blurted out main part of revelation then paused a much from physical exhaustion a from overwhelming sense of threatened calamity rotha be quick to catch significance of message communicated in liza disjointed word pale face became paler sidelong look haunted eye came back to at moment tremulous lip trembled visibly for few minute stood apparently powerless irresolute then light of determination returned to young girl face leaving liza in porch went into house for cloak hood when rejoined companion mind be made up to daring enterprise men of wythburn such of a can trust

robbie urged on mare with burden remembered that ralph have said chain young horse to mare at bottom of pas did so before going far however found new arrangement impeded rather than accelerated

horse come up have crossed pas can not go before funeral train be now in sight in few minute more must be at side yes there be robbie anderson leading mare have not chained young horse must be done at point must have be done at bottom however how have robbie forgotten be grave face became yet more grave a looked down at solemn company approaching willy have recognized see head drooped a sat in saddle at instant ralph thought no longer of terrible incident more terrible revelation of past few day thought not at of untoward fortune have placed where stood saw only white burden be strapped to mare thought only of with whom earliest memory be entwined raising head dashing gathering tear from eye saw one of woman on hill opposite running towards cry loudly a if in fear wind carried away voice must not catch word from gesture however gathered that something have occurred behind harm to funeral train must come of following on few pace ralph turned about walked rapidly upwards then woman voice seemed louder shriller than ever appeared to cry in agony of distress ralph turned again stood have mistaken gesture have something happened to mourner mare walked calmly up pas what must mean still shrill cry came to still word of be borne away by wind something be wrong something serious must go farther see then in instant became conscious that simeon stagg be running towards with look of terror close behind be two men mounted third man rode behind sim be being pursued frantic manner denoted ralph did not ask why ran towards sim quicker than speech before sim have recovered breath ralph have swung about caught bridle of horse by violent lurch have thrown rider from seat seemed hurt leaping to foot together bounded down upon ralph laying firm hold upon tried to manacle then with first moment of reflection truth flashed upon be who have be pursued have thrown into arm of pursuer be standing by gap in furze bush mourner be at top of pas saw what have happened robbie

furiously tearing at leg be succeeding be overpowering have on ground now be in gap of furze bush struggling in willow stream robbie dropped rein of mare ran to ralph aid at moment mighty gust of wind came down from fell swept through channel caught mare startled by loud cry of men barking of dog affrighted by tempest started away at terrific gallop over mountain with coffin on back mare mare cried ralph who have seen accident a robbie dropped rein for god sake after strength of ten men came into limb at rose from where men held down threw from a if have be green withe that snapped asunder fell

dark pike in distance already mist be obscuring ralph followed on on until company stood a though paralyzed on pas must see mere chapter xiii 'batable point when constable david tried to rise after fall discovered too many reason to believe that leg have be broken constable jonathan have fared better a to wind limb upon regaining foot found voice of duty silent within a to necessity of further action such a might expose to more serious disability with spirit of professional combatant rather admired prowess of adversary certainly bore ill will because have vanquished man six foot high if be inch have strength of ox said a bent over coadjutor inquired into nature of bruise constable david seemed disposed to exhibit le of resignation of brave humility can find solace even food for self flattery in defeat than of vexation of cowardly pride can not reconcile to stumble fall come of waistrel mister burn wind said meaning to indicate blacksmith by contemptuous allusion to gentleman profession constable jonathan must not forbear laugh at name at idea suggested ay if 'd burned wind time instead of blowing said might have raised between come let raise into saddle instead hegh hegh though continued a horse lurched from with gust need to raise wind up here easy there be right now think will need to ride on one stirrup be perhaps natural that constabulary view of disaster must be limited to purely legal aspect of loss of prisoner subject of constable reproach be not so far dominated by official ardor a to be insensible to terrible accident of flight of horse with corpse mr garth have brought own horse to stand at twenty pace from spot where ralph ray have thrown companion from saddle in combat ensuing have not experienced unconquerable impulse to participate on side of what stood to for united revenge profit if not for justice also when in result mare fled over fell sat a one petrified until robbie anderson who have earlier recovered from own feeling of stupefaction in first moment of returning consciousness have recognized blacksmith guessed sequel of rencontre brought up to very lively sense of situation by bringing down to full length on ground with timely administration of well planted blow mr garth be probably too much taken by surprise to repay obligation in kind rapped out volley of vigorous oath fell about adversary a fast a hen must peck then remounted horse with such show of valorous reluctance a must still be assumed after so unequivocal overthrow made best of haste away be not yet however entirely rewarded for share in day proceeding have almost reached wythburn on return home when have singular ill fortune to encounter liza that young damsel be huddled rather than seated on back of horse property of one of mourner whom rotha have succeeded in hailing to rescue with rhoda walking by side be now plodding along towards city in temper primed by accident of day to condition of highest irascibility a matter of fact liza in secret heart be chiefly angry with for reckless leap over big stone have given sprained ankle under pain of now groaned be due to illogical instinct of sex that must not consciously take so spartan view of position a to blame for what have happened be at scarcely promising juncture of accident temper that came upon blacksmith at first sight of bitterness of feeling have be brewing fermenting within in default of proper object have be discharged on horse on saddle on road even on rotha found full magnificent outlet on person of mr joseph garth while gentleman have be jogging along homewards have be fostering uncomfortable sentiment of spite respecting laal hussy who have betrayed have be mentally rehearsing withering reproach yet more withering glance meant to launch forth upon when next must be misfortune to cross path such disloyalty underhand way of playing double seemed to mr garth deserving of punishment short of physical one must be most enjoyable to inflict might not with robbie in way be quite so pleasant to stand responsible for perhaps be due to illogical instinct of blacksmith sex that conscience did not trouble when be concocting pain penalty for duplicity certainly when two person in question came face to face at turning of pack horse road towards city logic played infinitesimal part in animated intercourse mr garth meant to direct scorching sneer a silent preamble to discourse owing to fact that robbie blow have fallen about blacksmith eye that organ have since become sensibly eclipsed by prodigious discolored swelling what be meant for withering glance looked more like meaningless grin at apparent levity under many distress liza wrath rose to boiling point burst out upon mr joseph with more of home spun of country side than ever fell from lip in calmer moment thoo dummel head thoo said thoo'rt a daft a besom thoo he made botch o thoo blatherskite stick that in thy gizzern thoo go bumman aboot like bee in bottle thoo juda thoo mr garth be undoubtedly taken by surprise time to be attacked in such way by very person meant to attack to be accounted injurer by very person who thought have injured sufficed to stagger blacksmith dull brain nay nay said when have recovered breath who be juda be 'batable point reckon gi cried liza without waiting to comprehend significance of insinuation like true woman not dreaming that charge of disloyalty must be advanced against gi gi call to swine thoo'rt thy mother awn son witch utterly deprived of speech by maidenly outburst of vituperation mr garth lost that self control quieter judgment have recognized a probably necessary to safety of own person white with anger raised hand to strike liza who thereupon drew up giving vigorous slap on cheek said keep thy neb oot of thoo bummeller go fratch with robbie anderson hear dinged thee ower thoo sow faced mention of name served a timely reminder to mr garth who dropped arm rode away muttering savagely under breath come hankerin ' after again cried liza rather unnecessarily after vanishing figure outburst be at least serviceable in discharging ill nature from girl breast when have watched blacksmith until have disappeared replied to rotha

shadow flee away be not at first that ralph be prey to sentiment of horror physical energy dominated emotion left room for terrible imaginings room for full realization of what have occurred that appeared to paralyze others by ghastly reality appeared to fix to earth with rigidity of stone endowed with power seemed superhuman inspired with impulse leapt to fulfilment mounted on young horse galloped after mare along long range of pike in out of deep cavernous alcove up down hillock hollow over bowlder over stream across ghylls through sinking slough with drizzling rain overhead at one moment caught sight of mare burden a passed swiftly over protruding headland be capped from point of view by nothing mist sky then followed on harder faster than horse must gallop over pathless mountain galloped horse of be in pursuit must see mare more yet rode on on when reached extremity of dark range stood at point where great howe fringe downward to plain turned about rode back on opposite side of pike once more rode in out of cavernous alcove up down hillock hollow over bowlder over stream across river through sinking slough still with drizzling rain overhead mare be nowhere to be seen then rode on to where three range of mountain meet at angle tarn taking first range nearest pike rode under bow fell past crinkle crag to three shire stone at foot of greyfriars where mountain slope downward to duddon valley still mare be nowhere to be seen returning then to angle tarn followed only remaining range past pike of stickle until looked into black depth of dungeon ghyll still mare be nowhere to be seen fear be behind only by fear must be overtaken be at about two o'clock in afternoon that disaster have occurred be now fully three hour later horse ralph rode fatigued wellnigh spent be slipping foot in gathering darkness turned head towards wythburn rode down to city by harrop tarn at first house be luke cockrigg stood on bank above burn left horse borrowed lantern family must have dissuaded from attempt to return to fell be resolved there be reasoning against resolution pictured on rigid cadaverous countenance drizzling rain still fell night have closed in when ralph set face afresh towards mountain now sickening horror of sentiment overtook for now have time to reflect upon what have occurred figure of riderless horse flying with dead burden before wind have fixed on imagination while darkness be concealing physical surroundings be revealing phantasm in glimmering outline of rock tree look where must peering long deep into blackness of night without moon star without cloud sky with only blank density around about ralph seemed to see in fitful flash came went now on right now on left of now in front now behind now on earth at foot now in dumb vapor floating above spectre of riderless horse sometimes must stop listen thinking heard horse canter close past be noise of hidden river a water leapt over stone sometimes thought heard neigh of horse in distance be only whinny of wind dog have followed close behind when fled from pas be still at heel sometimes laddie must dart away be lost for few minute in darkness then dog muffled bark must be heard ralph blood must seem to stand still with dread apprehension dared not to take name of hope no be only sheep have strayed from fold have taken shelter from wind rain beneath stone in narrow cleft be now sending up into night pitiful cry of lost desolate creature nowhere must hill give up object of search ralph walked on on with heart sank still sank knew trackless upland a few knew not even abstraction of mind came with solitary hour caused uncertain step on on through long dark night to stye head once more again along range of rugged pike calling mare by half articulate cry knew so well listening for answering neigh hearing only surging of wind rumble of falling ghyll then on on still on when earliest gleam of light flecked east ralph be standing at head of scree slowly gray bar stretched across sky wider more wide brighter more bright now changed to yellow now to pink chasing black wall of darkness died away on side in basin below at foot of steep scree whose side rumbled with rolling stone lay black mere half veiled by morning mist still veiled too be dale of ireton far away across undulating plain through river rambled flowed wide western sea touched at utmost bar by silvery light of now risen sun ralph turned about walked back with flush of sky reflected on pale stony face lantern not yet extinguished burned small feeble in hand night be breaking to day must yet break desolation of heart ruin of many heart what be before nature unswerving unalterable course phantasm of night have answered to hallucination be a nothing to reality of morning whose cruel light showed only more plainly blackness of despair sentiment of horror now possessed be more terrible because more spiritual than before to know sepulture idea be horrible in horrible in association with old hebrew curse more remorseless than curse of cain most horrible of because to ralph heightened imagination seemed to be symbol symbol of retribution past to come yes be a have thought a have half thought god hand be on on of others on others only through having once conceived idea in grim totality having once fully received impress of from violence suddenness of ghastly occurrence ralph seemed to watch with complete self consciousness action of morbid fancy on mind traced back to moment when truth what seemed to truth touching murder of wilson have be flashed upon by look from simeon stagg traced yet farther back to night at dunbar when at prompting of what mistook for mercy have saved life of enemy be to wreck own life life of be near dear to to tortured soul guilt seemed everywhere about whether own guilt guilt of others be still same now god have given dread disaster for sign vengeance be that retribution have come must come be dream of overpowered imagination nightmare of distempered fancy yet must not be shaken off have bathed whole world in light lurid light ralph walked fast over fell snatching at sprig of heather plucking slim bough from bush pausing sometimes to look long at stone river path last night appeared to be a familiar to a palm of hand have suddenly become strange mystery shadow of supernatural presence hung over throughout day walked about fell looking for riderless horse calling to expecting to see to hear saw once again people of wythburn abroad on errand kept abroad never came within hail stifling sense of shame kept apart none le that knew not wherefore such shame must fall on same that knew not that have fallen day must come when men must see that god hand be on yes ralph when day doe indeed come then men will also see that whom god hand rest on have god at right hand when darkness be closing in upon second night ralph be descending high seat towards shoulthwaite moss behind lagged jaded dog walking few pace with drooping head tail then lying for minute rising to walk languidly again chapter xv ralph sacrifice when reached old house ralph be prepared for result of further disaster for disaster have few further result for be needful to prepare light burned in kitchen in room above where lately father have lain when ralph entered willy ray be seated before fire hand in hand of rotha who sat by side on feature of pallid face be trace of suffering what of mother said ralph huskily eye traversing kitchen willy rose put hand on ralph shoulder will go together said walked towards stair led to floor above there lay mother of stricken son unconscious of suffering unconscious of own yet lived since terrible intelligence have reached her of what have happened on pas have remained in state of insensibility being stricken into such torpidity by shock of occurrence willy tear fell fast a stood by bed anguish be subdued thereby to quieter mood ralph suffering be not so easily fathomable stooped kissed unconscious face without relaxing muscle in settled fixity of own face leaving brother in room returned to kitchen how strange old place looked to now have everything grown strange there be tall clock in corner big black worm eaten oak cabinet half cupboard half drawer there be long table like rock of granite there be spinning wheel in neuk window there be whip horn on rafter overhead yet how unfamiliar seemed to be rotha be hastily preparing supper for sat on settle be drawn up before fire threw off heavy sodden shoe clothes have be saturated by rain of preceding night have dried upon back be hungry have hot eaten since yesterday at midday when food be put upon table ate with voracious appetite so often follows upon long period of mental distress a sat at supper eye followed constantly movement of girl who be busied about in duty of household be not easy to say with what passion sentiment heart be struggling with respect to saw a hope gone from joy not to be grasped possible fulfilment of part of nature be never to be fulfilled be conscious of sentiment peculiar to herself respecting brave rude man whose heart be tender enough to be drawn towards yet strong enough to be held apart at awful bidding of iron fate perhaps not in turn felt drawn towards knew force of feeling made centre of thought point round deeper emotion insensibly radiated be associated in mind with idea of love if affection touched at perhaps at moment went out where pity rather pride first found play perhaps ralph seemed too high above to inspire love brother weaker more womanly nature came closer within range there be now long silence between rotha said ralph at length will be last night at moss last for long time at least did expect to be here to night can promise one thing girl wo be hard for now not very hard now paused what be ralph said rotha in voice of apprehension only that wo leave old house while mother life rotha dropped head thought of lonely cottage at fornside of who must live there ralph divined thought be written in face get to come here if can said must help willy with farm must not come said be afraid must not then neither will return to fornside promise that while life ca be long rotha may be too short promise that will make house home first duty be to said rotha with hand to eye true be true said ralph sense two home be made desolate silenced with something stole upon like stifling shame there be only one way out of difficulty be to make two home one if loved brother a knew that brother loved then rotha said ralph with perceptible tremulousness of voice will ask question perhaps who know rightly perhaps be harder for to ask than for to answer will answer will not for ask solemnly with light of heaven on word on most earnest word think that ever came out of heart paused again rotha sat on end of settle with finger intertwined with eyelid quivering lip trembling gazed in silence into fire be time for idle vanity said be time to indulge unreal modesty have none of if be god have laid hand on rotha yes heart be open without disguise before before other too think yes said rotha scarcely knew what to say whither ralph word tended only knew that be speaking a have never heard speak before yes ralph repeated perhaps a say be harder for to ask than for to answer rotha continued strong man looked into girl eye with world of tenderness do think have feeling for willy be more than common saw how sat together a came in to have marked before when have be by have marked too have be strength solace to in trouble do think if loved rotha do think then must love wait added a raised eye with parted lip seemed prepared to speak be not for ask god know be a much for a for perhaps perhaps say most of for with frank voice face with luminous eye in there be fear shame rotha answered yes must love think do so now spoke to ralph a might have spoken to father whom reverenced from whom secret of soul must be hid heard in silence not until now not until have heard last word have realized what must cost to hear agony of lifetime seemed crushed into short moment have made for now at length be over to yield up perhaps be link in chain of retribution to say nothing of own love perhaps must be accepted a dumb atonement to see win love be won by love of brother perhaps must soften exile with thought of recompense for wrong that have be fate to do to her hers though knew not there be something like white heat of subdued passion in voice when spoke again doe love rotha said quietly will ask to be wife can not do so yet meantime while mother life while be gone god know where while be away from old home ask now once more to stay great clock in corner ticked out loud in silence of next minute only slow breathing of dog sleeping on hearth fell on ear yes will stay said girl while spoke willy ray walked into kitchen then talked together long earnestly three under shadow of terrible mystery that hung above of life death ralph spoke a one overawed by sense of fatality world vicissitude have left behind engraven on heart message lesson be not altogether hopeful one saw that fate hung by thread that life be turned on pivot of mere chance that traced back to source joy sorrow appear to come of accident no more momentous than word look in solemn tone seemed to say that there be plague spot of evil at core of world life that infects everything may do best must do best be not therefore to expect reward perhaps reward will come to while live more likely will be crown laid on grave happy be if love find fulfilment if curse rest upon must hope on hardly knew destiny work own way thus talked in solitary house among mountain sat far into night rude son daughter of hill groping in own uncertain unlearned way after solution of life problem that wiser head than theirs age on age before since have never compassed shouting for echo into voiceless cavern of world great awful mystery chapter xvi at sunrise on raise friend thou hast adoption tried grapple to thy soul with hook of steel at following morning two men walked through wythburn towards hillock known a raise down long road led to south younger man have attained to maturity of full manhood brawny stalwart with limb strode firmly over ground with air of quiet reposeful power with steadily poised head with full bass voice soft yet deep with face have for utmost beauty beauty of virile strength resolution softened perhaps into tenderness of expression by washing in water of sorrow such now be ralph ray over jerkin wore long sack coat

along pack horse road on breast of fell walked long in silence be busy with thought one too weak other too strong to give utterance there said ralph a reached top of raise must part now old friend

cottage at fornside one went in pursuit of in day two must come back take up occupation a if have never be away walking leisurely into court yard must lift besom sweep step into stable set to work at stitching up rent in old harness willy ray can hardly be said to have avoided sim ignored there be more potent relation between two than of willy have idea satisfied a have professed to be that sim be innocent man be nevertheless unable to shake off uneasy sentiment of repulsion experienced in presence struggled to hold in check for rotha sake there be only one way in to avoid palpable manifestation of distrust be to conduct in manner a to appear unconscious of sim presence in house girl be not to blame said to again again rotha be innocent whoever may be guilty put case to so frequently in way tried so hard to explain to own mind that rotha at least be free of taint that very effort made conscious of latent suspicion respecting sim a to sim bearing towards willy be same a have adopted towards almost whole of little world in lived took up position of guilty man man to be shunned man from whose contaminating touch other men might fairly shrink never occurred to sim that there lay buried at own heart secret must change relation in stood towards younger more self righteous son of angus ray perhaps if have once be borne in upon that than be involved in suspicion have settled upon name if have even come to realize rotha might suffer stigma of fatal reproach for worse offence than be father daughter perhaps if have once felt a possible contingency must have shaken off black cloud seemed to justify odium in be held by about lifted up head for sake if not for own sim lacked virile strength disease of melancholy have long kept seat at heart that shadow of doubt must rest on rotha a result of misdeed supposed misdeed of have never yet occurred to sim mind truly rotha be above blight of withering doubt rude daughter of rude age in rude country without refinement of education still how pure sweet be how strong yet how tender how unconscious in instinct of self sacrifice how devoted in loyalty how absolute in trust deep rich a be rotha simple nature be yet incomplete be made aware that great change be even now coming to pas understood transformation little if at seemed a though somehow new sense be taking hold of indeed new light have floated into little orbit be too bright a yet for to see for what be flooded everything about bathed world in other hue than old time disaster have followed on disaster in day have just gone by nevertheless knew not how be not gloom in heart in waking hour of night there be more than memory of late event in mind dream be not nightmare in morning when swift recoil of sad thought rushed in at first awakening sentiment of indefinite solace came close behind be be coming to pas be love be now dawning upon though still vague indeterminate hardly knew object willy ray took note of change in girl thought understood accepted a one remaining gleam of hope happiness for of amid prevailing gloom rotha avoided searching light of glance when work of household be in hand shook off glamour of new found emotion in morning when men came down for breakfast again in evening when came in for supper girl busied in duty with ardor of one having thought behind feeling in did not share when quieter hour of day left free for other thought must stand look long into face of poor invalid to whom have become nurse foster child in one walk without knowing why to window neuk put hand on old wheel now rested quiet unused beneath while looked towards south through eye saw nothing be there be standing so one morning fortnight more after ralph departure from wythburn when willy came into kitchen before be conscious of presence sat in seat of little alcove within stood took hand lay disengaged by side told in word two of love have loved long in silence have loved before became blessing now be to to to day loved more than ever before be simple story came with accent of sincerity in word thought perhaps loved in return have sometimes thought so be wrong there be pause between regaining momentary composure girl turned eye once more aside looked through neuk window towards south felt color mounting to cheek knew that young man have risen to foot beside on part saw only fair face before felt only little hand lay passively in own be sad sort of home to bring to must be idle to ask if have be happy here must be mockery have be happy be happy to do a ralph wished a wished a wished too willy have be blessing to rotha sometimes think though that be hardly fair to bring into middle of trouble did for best said rotha who there be little start of recovering consciousness ralph answered dropped head true did for best repeated willy relapsed into silence besides have home then know how steadfastly girl eye be fixed oh distant south have father home rotha ah when ceased to be poor father home how must be mine longer be homeless there be pause then let ask to make house home forever can not do so think so can scarcely tell said might be best willy let loose hand have dreamed be wild hallucination bright gleam of happiness have penetrated darkness lay about at step how yearningly girl eye still inclined to yonder distant south let say more about now rotha said huskily if wish will talk again on matter be say if wish if not matter young man be turning away without moving fixed determination of gaze rotha said quietly willy think perhaps do love perhaps know remember said that heart lay open before other who said so rotha there be start of recovering consciousness then wide eye looked full into tongue must have spoken refused instant to speak name trembled in half articulate whisper on parted lip came upwards from heart girl be ignorant of own secret even yet will say no more about now rotha repeated willy in broken voice if wish will talk again give sign perhaps will talk on matter again in moment young man be gone chapter xix betrothal be not till be alone that girl realized situation put hand over eye hand still tingled with light pressure of touch what have happened have willy asked to become wife have seemed to say no sound of voice be still lingering on ear be low broken murmur such a might have fallen to sob have then refused must not be be poor homeless girl with nothing to recommend to such man a be yet knew have heard that loved must one day ask to be wife have thought that day be far distant have never realized that must be now why have not given time to think if ralph knew what have done for hour two rotha went about house with look of bewilderment in eye willy came back soon afterwards helped to wheel mother in chair to place by hearth have regained wonted composure spoke to a if nothing unusual have occurred perhaps have be something like dream haunted willy be speaking cheerfully enough just then father came into kitchen slunk away silently to seat in remotest corner of wide ingle willy went out almost immediately everything be in maze must be that have seemed to say rotha be rudely awakened from trance by entrance at moment of parson of chapel on raise present be first visit reverend nicholas stevens have paid since day of funeral have heard of latest disaster have befallen family at moss have also learned something of paralytic seizure disaster have occasioned must not longer put away solemn duty of visitation to take comfort of presence to give light of countenance to smitten be

tying ribbon of mr ray white cap under chin a vicar entered took up chair for placed near invalid did not sit immediately eye traversed kitchen at glance saw mr ray propped up with pillow looking vacantly about attention seemed to be riveted on sim who sat uneasily on bench apparently trying to escape concentrated gaze what have here said in cold strident voice man simeon stagg be here too moment before rotha have gone into dairy adjoining coming back be handing bowl of milk to father sim clutched at dish with nervous finger reverend nicholas walked with measured pace towards where sat then paused stood yard two behind sim whose eye be still averted be told have made habitation on hillside fitting home doubt for one unfit to house with fellow sim hand trembled violently set bowl of milk on floor beside rotha be standing yard two apart breast heaving have left for good pray there be suspicion of sneer in tone with question be asked yes have left for good said rotha catching breath sim have dropped head on hand elbow resting on knee more be shame perhaps who know may have be best place for shame to hide in sim got up turning about with eye still fixed on ground hurried out of house have driven away again do know said rotha regaining voice looking fall into vicar face eye aflame if so have done well young woman then surveying with look of lofty condescension added what be business here to nurse mr ray be part of even so be asked to come surely by whom ralph son small respect must have have for young woman tell what mean sir said girl with glance of mingled

perhaps after have business in house perhaps vicar be right yet must not be thought of mr ray smitten down dependent upon about for help in simple office of life thought of promise have made to ralph promise have said that will stay in old home a long a mother life have promised pledged word be registered in heaven then again perhaps ralph have not foreseen that mother might live for year in present state doubt thought near to death must not have intended that must live long in brother house yet have so intended will ask to be wife rotha ralph have said ca do so yet brought memory back to earlier event of morning willy ray have already asked to become wife what have done on part have not seemed to say willy be far above be true enough that be poor homeless girl without land without anything hand worked with willy be now statesman be something of scholar too yes be in way far above be there not others who might love yet ralph have seemed to wish to become brother wife what ralph have said must be best must of course be so must not bring to leave shoulthwaite be clear enough to bewildered sense must remain on present term of relation that also be too clear if ralph be at home how different everything must be must lead with word out of distressing maze when willy ray parted from rotha after have told her of love felt that sunshine have gone out of life forever have be living for week month in paradise be not own why have loved girl must hardly say be one knew daughter of poor tailor be poorest meanest creature in country round about young man must not help telling that might have looked to marry daughter of largest statesman in radius of mile then girl herself be noble creature none must question rude perhaps in way without other learning than hard usage of life have given yet be fine soul a deep a tarn on mountain top a pure clear have fancied loved disaster have quite overshadowed bright hope of surmise yet have not loved ralph instead perhaps girl did not realize that in reality love of brother have taken hold of did ralph love girl must not be must have guessed truth night spoke together still might be that ralph loved after by following morning rotha have decided that duty at crisis lay one way only way must take ralph have said must be well for to become willy wife have promised never to leave moss while mother lived must do a have said willy have asked for sign must give hint one sign that be willing to say yes if spoke again to day a have spoken yesterday having once settled point spirit experienced complete elevation what must

that have worshipped seemed to be shattered be if saw that rotha loved ralph must give up forever one dream of happiness there end be in mood that opened kitchen door just a rotha have put foot on treadle taken flax in hand there girl sat side by side with mother spinning at wheel within recollection hand one have touched how fresh fair young face looked tinged a be at moment too with conscious
