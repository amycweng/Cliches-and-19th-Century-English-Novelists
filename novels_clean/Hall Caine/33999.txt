heart hope of sunlocks oh thought if letter have come day earlier one little day nay one hour one little little hour then in tortured mind reproached jason for keeping back from by forgetfulness at next instant reproached sunlocks for tardy despatch last of reproached for not waiting for oh thought be ever girl born to bring such misery to who love long night thereafter tossed in restless doubt never once closing eye in sleep at daydawn rose dressed threw open window cool wave of morning air floated down upon from mountain where bald crown of barrule be tipped with rosy light from sun be rising over sea then in stillness of morning before cattle in meadow have begun to low sheep on hill to bleat there be yet noise of work in rickyard shippon moorland below lay asleep under thin coverlet of mist there came to from across field sound of happy cheery voice be singing listened knew that be jason chanting song of iceland after night spent on mountain looked saw that be coming on towards house with long swinging stride leap over gorse cushag hedge ditch be more than must bear after such night long torment to look upon happiness seemed about to wreck so turned head away covered ear with hand recking nothing of jason came on singing in snatch whistling by turn until firm tread echoed in paved courtyard in silence be broken by nothing beside except wakening of rook in elm must be awake for lie there window be open thought to whisht cried tossing up hand then without moving from where stood with back resting against window shutter turned head about eye aslant saw beneath casement looked buoyant joyous full of laughter gun be over shoulder fishing rod be in other hand at belt hung brace of bird with blood dripping on to legging across back swung little creel greeba whisht called again in loud whisper third time called then though heart smote sore must not step forward perhaps very shame made more beautiful at moment for cheek be rosy red round neck drooped eye be shy of morning light very sweet looked to lad who loved there ah said almost inaudibly drew long breath then made pretence to kiss though so far out of reach laughed in throat after that laid gun against porch untied bird threw down at foot of closed door thought must bring said have just shot then have not be to bed said greeba nervously oh that be nothing said laughing nothing for besides how must sleep sleep why must have be ready to kill morning if must have slept last night greeba well must never think what glorious night have be for so have have good sport said feeling ashamed sport cried laughed again oh yes have have sport enough said what night be happiest night of life star that shone seemed to shine for wind blew seemed to bring message bird sang a day be dawning seemed to sing song of happiness oh have be triumphant night greeba turned head away from did not stop morning coming down from barrule everything seemed to speak to of one thing be dearest thing in world little river ' said happily sing way to sea then remembered that before got there must turn wheel for at port y vullin day so said 'dear little mill how merrily will go when listen to plash plunge with love beside did not speak after moment laughed that be very foolish be said oh said why foolish well sound so ah last night star around on mountain top seemed like sanctuary morning bird

last of rafter on to day when building be raised be time to make merry laughed again with joyous lightness turned to go waved hand to a passed out of gate then one two three four strong rhythmic step went off behind elm then be gone early sun be gone with for brightness seemed to have died out of air being alone greeba knew why have tried to keep jason by side for while be with temptation be not strong to break in upon happiness when be no longer there do what must must not remember michael sunlocks oh what have done that two brave men must love thought none le for heart clamored for sunlocks sunlocks sunlocks always sunlocks sunlocks of childhood girlhood first womanhood sunlocks of bright eye smile like sunshine thinking again of jason brave way simple manly bearing plain speech so strangely lifted out of day into word with wing only told that be about to break heart to see do must go far to break own so decided that must write to then slip away a best must seeing more at resolve sat wrote four page of pleading prayer explanation having finished letter smote suddenly a folded sealed that must be selfish thing to steal away without warning leave poor paper behind to crush jason for though written in pity for in truth be fraught with pity only for a mean of soul a must not be straightway threw letter aside resolved to tell story face to face then remembered night of stephen orry death white lip of jason a stood above dying man father whom have crossed sea to slay again by quick recoil recalled laughter of morning said within if tell will kill that thought decided concluded that tell must let happen what must so partly in strength of resolve partly out of womanly weakness fear that might return to first plan at last took up own letter to jason locked in chest then taking from fold at breast letter of sunlocks to herself read again yet again for be only love letter have ever received there be dear delight in very touch of thought of sensuous joy smote conscience when remembered what have still to do thinking that must never speak to jason eye to eye with letter of sunlocks lying warm in bosom took out locked also in chest jason came back at sundown to fetch away that might make innocent sport together because mill be roofed then with eye on foot spoke listened in dull impassive silence while laughter died off face look of blank pallor came over when have finished waited for blow of anger did not come then be over between said with effort looking up saw that be forlorn man in moment fell to knee before with many pitiful prayer for forgiveness only raised said gently mistress greeba maybe have loved enough cried be only rough ignorant fellow sort of wild beast dare say not fit to touch hand of lady maybe lady must never stoop to there be not lady in world must stoop if be to marry then maybe vexed by finding own advantage in hour of need have behaved bravely with in trouble then greeba tell have happened since yesterday nothing everything jason have wronged be fault of yours now know love turned face away from when spoke again voice broke in throat must never think how fast close love will grow let wait said must be useless answered stay said stiffly do love anyone else before have time to speak said quickly wait have right to ask question will not hear answer be very noble jason said be thinking of said jason cried meant to ask to release have put to shame now ask to choose for have promised to if wish will keep promise at that stood sorrowful man beside for moment space before answered only tone of voice must tell how much answer cost ah no said greeba to keep promise to must be too cruel to think of now cried there be need to do that said for way be broken man will not also be broken hearted will man who part saying ghastly white hand seemed to sweep across face at next moment smiled feebly said god bless then turned to go greeba caught by hand jason murmured be true can not love if there be name for love be not twisted back to a spoke face be unutterably mournful to see look at like that said drew away felt face flush deep for be ashamed love be pole star what be jason only blankness of despair oh heart will break cried jason cried again again grasped hand again eye met then brave girl put quivering lip to ah said in husky voice broke from embrace chapter vi esau bitter cry shrinking from human face jason turned in dumb despair towards sea for moan of long dead wave seemed to speak to in voice of comfort if not of cheer year have deepened to autumn chill wind that scattered salt spray white curve of breaker mist dapple gray cloud scream of sea fowl suited with mood for at fountain of own being great deep be broken up be tuesday day thereafter until saturday haunted shore wild headland to seaward lonesome rock on south there bit by bit strange solemn idea of unrequited love be borne in upon be very hard to understand for one short day image of happy love have stood up before mind already day be dead that must never again clasp hand whom loved that be over between be painful be crushing oh be very cruel life seemed a much ended a if have taken death warrant for life without hope be nothing worth future have fondly built up for of lay broken at own foot oh irony of there be moment when evil passion arose in mind startled standing at foot of lone crag of sea must break into wild peal of laughter shriek out in rebellion against sentence be ashamed of impulse must sink away from scene of though human eye have there be on like dog be disgraced yet felt that like man among men must fight anything relentless doom anything anything must not shrink life love life love only must be well ah no not for be either creeping up in dead of night towards lague just that eye might see though sorrow dimmed house where lay asleep strong man must sob like woman cry out greeba greeba greeba with coming of day strength must return watching big ship outside pas on to north south listening to merry song of seaman who weighed anchor in bay told sadly without pain that life in island be ended that must not live where lived surrounded by trace of presence that something called away that must go having thus concluded spirit rose decided to stay until after sunday thinking to see then in church there take last tender look of bid farewell in silence for must not trust

with wall roof seat of wood floor of hard earth four short bench be raised step above step against farthest side on highest of bishop sat with three of colleague on of three row beneath prisoner stood on broad stool to right witness on like stool to left wooden bar crossed room about midway in open space between door spectator be crowded together place be lighted by candle be fixed to wall others be held by usher on end of long stick few be hung to roof rafter by hemp rope tied about middle floor ran like stream atmosphere be full of vapor of snow be melting on people clothes nothing must be ruder than courthouse court sat there observed rule of procedure be almost idolatry of form prisoner be called by name of jason son of stephen orry having answered in voice so hollow that seemed to come out of earth beneath rose to place attitude be dull impassive seemed hardly to see restless crowd murmured at sight of tall figure stooped there be cloud on strong brow slow fire in bloodshot eye red hair long a woman hung in disordered mass down worn cheek to shoulder bishop venerable prelate of great age looked at thought that man heart be dead within spokesman of court be middle aged man who be short have little piercing eye square brush of iron gray hair stood erect across top of corded forehead crisp clear utterance like crackle of horse hoof on frost jason be charged with attempt to take life of michael sunlocks first president of second republic did not plead have defence witness against spoke only in answer to leading question of judge first of witness be greeba evidence given in english be required to be interpreted brave strength be now gone trembled visibly eye be down head be bent face be half hidden by hood of cloak wore tone be barely audible have little to say prisoner have forced way into government house there to own face have threatened to take life of husband in plain word have done so then made show of going in pursuit of husband that might carry out design wait said bishop husband be not present said greeba there be therefore direct violence none whole sum of prisoner offence so far a know of lie in use of word that have repeated yes then turning to spokesman of court old bishop said there have be overt act be not attempt threat to take life be not crime by law of other christian country pardon lord said little man in crisp tone will show that prisoner be guilty of essential part of murder murder lord added be not merely to compass destruction of life for there be homicide by misadventure there be justifiable homicide there be right long recognized by icelandic law of avenger of blood murder be to kill in secrecy after long harbored malice now lord will show that prisoner have lain in wait to slay president of republic at greeba stood down other witness followed nearly everyone have be summoned with whom jason have exchanged word since landed eight day before there be lean student who have told of drill at latin school little tailor who have explained work at jail stuttering doorkeeper at senate house one of mason at fort much be made of fainting in cathedral yard on sunday morning out of deaf landlady cathedral caretaker startling disclosure seemed to be drawn still said old bishop see overt act good gracious lord said little spokesman be to wait until knife have be reddened god forbid said old bishop then came two

turned bloodshot eye in direction then limb gave way under sank back with moan court misread emotion be removed jason red eye followed constantly be case for warning not for punishment said bishop be plainly written in old law book that if man threaten to slay man will be warned of gravity of crime contemplates of penalty attaching to gracious heaven lord cried little spokesman what reason have to assume that prisoner be ignorant of with life to guard be prized by friend precious to state will let man go free who have sworn before witness to destroy god forefend said bishop be lawful to question prisoner so be questioned be true that have be lying in wait to kill president asked spokesman jason made answer be true that have done so from desire for personal vengeance answer from political motif answer still answer then spokesman turned back to court stubborn persistence of prisoner be easy to understand said smiled wait said old bishop turned towards jason have valid plea jason gave sign listen said bishop though man who compass destruction of single life be a though have destroyed world for posterity of who be dead might have filled world yet have law of men since pentateuch recognized certain condition limit gravity of crime if man who be slain have slain near kindred of slayer though law of iceland must no longer hold guiltless a in ancient time when evil for evil be rule sentence neither must punish a murderer who must eat bread drink water of misery day now what be true of murder must be true of intent to murder though be to believe possible in instance honoring loving a do good man whom be charged with lying in wait to kill yet in duty must ask question have michael sunlocks spilled blood of blood be a redeemer of blood that go about to slay there be dead hush in little crowded courthouse a jason lifted heavy bloodshot eye to bishop face answered in weary voice have nothing to say then aged lutheran priest who have sat within rail with snuffbox

who married again while be still alive have son by other wife on deathbed have heard of told prisoner who then there witness being present made awful vow of vengeance upon father father son old priest be heard in silence word sent quiver through courthouse even jason who have shown no interest save when greeba be removed lifted up bloodshot eye again listened bishop visibly moved turned to court said let put prisoner back to be tried by high court lagmann what lord cried little spokesman with lofty look set at liberty in meantime to carry out crime threatens heaven forbid said bishop remember

power of life be low in seeing jason said when warder stepped up to lash together be ill not fit to go out let work alone to day will do enough for of heed be paid to jason warning michael sunlocks be driven out by side day third of life together worked with difficulty for wound in hand of sunlocks be not only trouble to impediment to jason also yet jason gave hint of kept good spade going constantly with smile on face through sweat stood on little stolen word of comfort cheer when heat be strongest sunlocks must have stumbled fallen jason contrived mean to use spade together only requiring that sunlocks must stoop when stooped that warder might think be still working artifice be discovered came of be that be watched closer driven harder during hour remained of day next day fourth of direful punishment sunlocks rose weak trembling scarce able to stand erect with what spirit must summon up called upon warder to look upon see how feeble be say if be fair to yoke fellow that must compel to do work of two men drag human body after warder only laughed at protest once again be driven out by jason side long heavy be hour followed sunlocks being once started on way bore up under very bravely murmuring a little a might out of thought for jason jason helped along stumbling footstep a well a must for arm be bound to seeing how well worked by double power of human kindness warder laughed again made mock at sunlocks for former cry of weakness so amid tender word between jeer cast in upon by warder made shift to cheat time of weary day fifth day went by like fourth with heavy toil pain to make hard cruel taunt to make bitter many time a delved yellow sulphur bank dark chill crossed heart of thought in misery how cheerfully must dig for death if only lay in hot clay beneath night when have returned to hut wherein slept tried to sleep found that well meaning stranger have be there in absence nailed up on grimy wall above bed card bearing text come unto ye that labor be heavy laden will give rest so ghastly seemed irony of word in place that jason muttered oath between teeth a read sunlocks threw down being unbound for night with peal of noisy laughter soul full of strange bitterness next day after that sixth of life together rose darker than day have gone before for wounded hand of michael sunlocks be then purple black swollen to size of two hand bodily strength be so low try a bravely a might to stand erect whenever struggled to foot fell to ground again thinking nothing of warder be for strapping up to jason a before while be in act of doing so fainted in hand then jason swept from vowed that first man touched sunlocks again must lie dead at foot send for captain cried if man have bowel of compassion let come see what have done warder took jason at word sent message to office saying that one of prisoner be mutinous other pretending to be ill after time captain despatched two other warder to help of first two word along with for answer if one rebel punish nothing loth for such exercise four warder set to decide what punishment must be while laid head together jason be bending over sunlocks who be now recovered to consciousness asking pardon in advance for cruel penalty that rash act be to bring on of forgive said must help did know what be doing there be nothing to forgive brother whispered michael sunlocks thus with stammering tongue comforted one with hand clasped together waited for punishment have to come at length warder concluded that for refusing to work for obstinate disobedience for threatening nothing must serve that prisoner must straightway do most perilous work to be found day at sulphur mine now be beginning of end for red jason michael sunlocks if evil chance have not befallen god alone can say how long might have lived together at krisuvik how soon how late must have become known to one by true name character heaven have purpose even in barbarity of base hearted men a mean towards great end be near at hand be way of coming strange change that one must rightly understand have lately come upon natural condition of sulphur mine steam rose from solfataras have grown le le week by week day by day until in place have altogether subsided be grave sign for in steam lay essence of sulphur if ceased to rise from pit sulphur must cease to grow other change came with such a deep subterranean noise arose from part of plain where fissure have yet be seen footstep on earth around place produced hollow sound from sign taken together captain have concluded that life of mine great infernal fire raged beneath surface be changing ground leaving valley where have lived for age for mountain height where low grumbling be now heard to come from beneath earth crust of lava basaltic rock so taking counsel of people decided to bore ground in new place in hope of lighting on living solfataras must stand to against loss of dead one chanced that be in midst of many busy preparation for work when report of warder reached boring be still uppermost in mind when sent back answer a came upon flogging stopped thus happened that first thought came to warder be to send prisoner to one of spot have be marked on hillside for test of bore spade so in le than hour more jason sunlocks lashed together arm to arm leg to leg be being driven up mountain to place assigned to found hideous awesome spot within circle of two yard across ground be white yellow scaly like scab on evil flesh be hot so that hand must not rest upon hollow so that foot made shake from unseen depth beneath dull thud came up at interval like nothing else knocking of man buried alive at sealed door of tomb beneath spot heart of solfatara be expected to lie jason sunlocks be commanded to open obeying gloomily took bore first pierced scaly surface instantly sizzling bubbling sound came up from below then followed with spade scarcely have lifted top crust when twenty great fissure seemed to open under foot must see lurid flame rushing in wild confusion like river of fire in bowel of earth be sight at stoutest heart might have quailed jason leapt back to bank dragged sunlocks after be not safe said in with shouted warder from own safe footing of four yard away with growl from between clenched teeth jason stepped back into hole sunlocks followed hardly have got down to fearsome spot again when layer of clay fell in from leaving deep wide gully then scarcely yard of secure footing remained let stop while be safe jason cried dig away shouted warder if do will be digging own graf said jason begin shouted warder listen to said jason if be to open pit of fire brimstone at least let be free of rope be fair that man may have chance of life go on shouted warder if go on like will be burnt boiled alive said jason get along shouted warder with one voice then awful light flashed in jason eye for saw that out of revenge for paltry fine have resolved to drive two living men to death now listen again said jason mark word will do a command work in pit of hell will not die in know man beside be weak ill heaven curse inhumanity if anything happens to be alive to see a sure a there be strength left in arm blood in body will tear limb from limb so saying plunged spade into ground beneath with oath to drive at next instant there be flash of blue flame avalanche of smoke hurricane of unearthly noise cry like of dying man then awful silence when air have cleared jason stood uninjured michael sunlocks hung by side inert quiet blinded by jet of steam what happened to jason thereafter tongue of man must tell fire of spirit strength of day seemed to flow back upon in great moment parted rope bound a if have be green withe that snapped asunder took sunlocks in arm lifted up to shoulder hung across a if have be child that placed there stepped out of deadly pit strode along over lava mountain a if be sole creature of everlasting hill glance be terrific voice be voice of wounded beast warder dropped musket fled before like affrighted sheep chapter iv through chasm of men be still early morning soft gray mist lay over moorland sun have never set in northern land be rising through cloud of pink white over bald crown of mountain to northeast towards rising sun jason made way striding on with red glow on own tanned blackened face ghastly mockery of hue of life on pallid cheek whitened lip of sunlocks from right ankle right wrist hung ring of broken fetter from left ankle left wrist of sunlocks trailed rope have bound never moment did pause to breathe think question on on went over lava block lava dust basaltic rock heavy clay hot blue earth scorched withered moss still sunlocks lay over right side shoulder motionless unconscious hardly breathing alive with waist encircled by jason great right arm waist belt grasped tight a with grip of talon by jason hard right hand before long sunlocks recovered partial consciousness cried in faint voice for water jason glanced around on arid plain a if eye must pierce ground for spring water must see on side of so without word of answer strode along water water cried sunlocks again just then jason caught side long glint of river ran like pearl chain down black breast of mountain water cried sunlocks again yet again in voice of pain deep pleading not rightly knowing yet where be what bad chance have befallen yes yes one moment more only moment there there there whispered jason muttering such word of comfort cheer quickened pace towards river when got near to stopped short with cry of dismay river bubbled smoked hot be hot cried jason land be accursed at word sunlocks uttered low groan head have be partly lifted fell heavily backwards hair hung over jason shoulder be again unconscious then more than ever like wild beast ranging hill with prey jason strode along presently saw lake of blue water far away knew for cold water blessed ice cold water water to bathe hot forehead with water to drink with cry of joy there be human ear to hear turned made towards just a did so softening a went muttering from own parched throat word of hope comfort to unconscious man carried gunshot echoed through mountain above head knew what shot be be signal of escape looking down to valley saw that guard of settlement be gathering on pony in very line of plain that must traverse to reach water for sunlocks thirsted then water water came again in same faint voice a before whether with actual ear heard that cry in torment of distraught sense only rang out in empty heart man will say same answered from choking throat patience patience then with look downward look of human stag at cool water might not reach live turned back to mountain what happened to then for many weary hour thereafter must weary spirit to tell what plain crossed what hill climbed in what desolate wilderness walked alone with one for company save unconscious man across shoulder eye to look upon save eye of god first crossed wide sea of lava dust black a raven flew in air above bounded by hill a dark a earth be vast sand drift blown up into strange terrible shape by mighty tempest then came upon plain strewn over with cinder having grim crag frowning upon like bank of smelting house with scree of refuse rolling down by time sun have risen high grown hot black ground under foot began to send up reflection of sun ray into face to scorch still cry of water water rang in ear eye ranged desolate land to find never sign of must see strong heart sank once when have mounted with great toil to top of hill where behind have be black burnt blistered saw wide valley stretching in front of be a green a grass of spring thought that where there be grass there must surely be water stream of water river of water pool of water sunny stretch of sweet water lying clear quiet over amber pebble between soft brown bank of turf so at sight heart be lifted up bounding down hillside over lava block a fast a must go for burden began to sing from cracked throat in hoarse quavery voice when reached valley song stopped heart sank afresh for be not grass moss that grew there lay only on big block of lava with never drop of moisture handful of earth between be crushed be strong of heart must not despair so pushed on over green plain through hundred thousand mossy mound that looked like graf of world of dead men when came out of case seemed yet more forlorn for leaving soft valley behind have come upon lava stream sea of stone not dust cinder bleached cake of lava rock with never soft place for foot never green spot for eye not leaf to rustle in breeze not blade of grass to whisper to not bird sweet voice song of running water nothing lived there dead silence on earth in air nothing in other hour roar of wind rattle of rain crash of thunder time jason have walked on under sweltering sun never resting never pausing buoyed up with hope of water water for fainting man that might not die in desolation of moment dropped sunlocks from shoulder threw down beside sitting there with head of unconscious comrade upon knee put to say what have be good of that have done if must not have be better for of if have submitted to base tyranny remained at mine have not brought man out to death what else be before in waste wilderness where there be drop of water to cool hot forehead moisten parched tongue thinking that yoke fellow might die die at hand that must then be alone with only man face gone from have ever brightened life for heart began to waver to say rise up jason rise up go back just then be conscious of click clack of horse hoof on echoing face of stony sea about shaded eye looked around saw in distance line of men on pony coming on in direction though thought of guard have be signalled to pursue made effort to escape did not stir try to hide sat a before with head of comrade on knee men on pony came up passed closely by without seeing saw clearly heard talk be not guard from settlement thing men bound for thingvellir meeting of althing there while be going on before in laughter high spirit jason must scarce resist impulse to cry out on to stop take along with a prisoner for that be outlaw who have broken outlawry carried away with fainting man at knee before word must form while blistering lip be shaping to speak great thought came to struck back to silence why have torn away from sulphur mine only from gloomy love of life life for comrade life for what life be there in trackless waste mouldering dumb wilderness none none nothing death lay here death in gaunt solitude death in dry desert death amid ghastly haggard wreck of inhuman thing what chance must there be of escape from iceland none none none there be one hope yet who be men have passed be thing men be lawmaker where be going be going to mount of law why be going there to hold meeting of althing what be althing highest power of state supreme court of legislature law what did mean meant jason a icelander knew law of country that one great law above other law remembered at instant concerned outlaw be outlaw of ordered that condemned must appeal at althing against injustice of sentence if rank of judge opened for escape then be saved jason leaped to foot at thought of be what must do for comrade for must push on to thingvellir be five thirty heavy mile away matter for that angel of hope must walk with must reach mount of law carrying comrade way when got there must plead cause of of then judge must rise part make way for must be free men thereafter life life life there be life left for of very sweet seemed after shadow of death have so nearly encompassed only to live only to live be young yet loved one a brother while thinking so in whirl of sens a strode to fro over lava block jason heard what ear have hitherto be too heavy to catch thin music of falling water near at hand looking up saw tiny rivulet like lock of silken hair dropping over round face of rock thanking god for ran to filled hand with brought to sunlocks bathed forehead with poor blinded eye moistened withered lip whispering meantime word of hope simple tender nothing such a woman might croon over sick boy come boy come then come boy come whispered clapped moist hand together over placid face to call back to while did so sure enough sunlocks moved lip parted cheek quivered sighed seeing sign of consciousness jason began to cry for great rude fellow who have not flinched before death be touched at sight of life in deep place where strongest man be a child just then heard once more sound of horse hoof on lava ground looking up saw that there must be error time that guard be surely coming ten twelve of there seemed to be mounted on a many pony be driving on at furious gallop over stone there be dog racing in front of dog be running at heel with barking of dog loud whoop of men to urge pony along to clatter of pony hoof plain rang echoed jason saw that guard be coming on in direction in three minute more must be upon be taking line followed by thing men must pas by unseen a thing men have passed be not to be expected for be there to look for be to be done jason looked behind nothing be there implacable wall of stone rising sheer up into sky with never bough tussock of grass to cling to that man might climb looked around ground be covered with cracked dome like arch of buried city cavern lay beneath be guarded by spiked jaw only man foot must slip through not gap not hole to creep into not stone to crouch under not bush to hide behind nothing in sight on side bare hard face of wide sea of stone there be not moment to lose jason lifted sunlocks to shoulder crept along bent nearly double a silently swiftly a must go still behind be whoop of men barking of dog clatter of hoof on on went minute after precious minute ground became heavier at stride with huge stone tore stockinged leg mangled foot in thin skin shoe recked nothing of rejoiced in for way be a rough for guard behind must hear that horse have be drawn up from gallop to slow paced walk at step scoured bleak plain for shelter at length saw among pile of vitreous snag hummock of great slab clashed together with one side rent open be like nothing else on earth tomb in old burial ground where vault have fallen in wrecked monument above through cankered lip of hummock into gaping throat jason pushed unconscious body of sunlocks crept in after lying there in gloom waited for guard to come on a came strained ear to catch sound of word passed between be on right course said one voice how hollow far away sounded saw footmark on moss that have just crossed over will see again on clay be coming to be wrong said voice saw one man footstep only be following two tell red man be carrying other mile impossible anyhow be course not why so because be bound for hafnafiord why hafnafiord to take ship clear away tut man have got bigger game than that be going to reykjavik what to run into lion mouth yes to draw teeth too what have captain always said why that red man have along be spy for fair one know who be let once set foot in reykjavik will do over again what did before crouching over sunlocks in darkness of grim vault jason heard word a guard rode past in glare of hot sun not until be gone did draw breath just a lay back with sigh of relief thinking danger over suddenly heard sound startled be sniffing of dog outside hiding place at next instant two glittering eye looked in upon from gap whereby have entered dog growled jason tried to pacify barked then jason laid hold of gripped about throat to silence fumed fought jason held like vice until there came whistle call then struggled afresh erik shouted voice without erik erik then whistle followed whistle thinking creature must now follow master jason be for releasing before have yet fully done so dog growled barked again erik erik shouted voice outside from click clack of hoof jason judged that one of men be returning then jason saw that there be nothing left to to quiet dog must betray to death so while brute writhed in great hand struggling to tear flesh from laid hold of gaping jaw rived apart broke in moment more dog be dead in silence followed faint voice came from distance cry sigurd sigurd why be waiting then voice shouted back from near at hand very near so near a to seem to be on top of

with proper manly indifference to such endearment wriggled back to ground then greeba remembered with flash fell on brain like sword that husband be blind now beauty of world be nothing to smitten by thought stood moment while sunshine died out of eye rosy red out of cheek presently came to to ask if sunlocks be blind forever if nothing must be done for brought back with pang of remorse for such long forgetfulness memory of man apothecary in husavik who have credit of curing many of blindness after accident in northern mine where free men worked for wage so thinking of apothecary throughout day next found at last crooked way to send money to out of store still remained to to ask to come to grimsey waiting for coming of apothecary new dread be also new hope stole over since first day on
