decide upon course then while wait house be open to if be willing to share work be assistant will also have fair share of profit camaralzaman gladly accepted proposition for better by far be work however hard humble may be than idleness of unavailing regret so for whole year lived with old gardener a if have be son wearing blue smock down to knee working with hoe tending plant tilling soil carrying produce for sale to market day looked out over sea for merchant vessel be to arrive bear back to own country to arm of beloved now turn to princess badoura whom left lying asleep in tent when

with bashfulness for strange indeed to woman be offer of kingdom bride yet at father court have long since become learned in affair of state to rule kingdom have ever be desire moreover since by loss of talisman husband seemed destined to eternal separation there be cause that must see why life must not thus be dedicated there be also peril in refusal king must be certain to take a affront to daughter so after pondering matter for while lifted head spoke to king a follows o king if delayed for one moment acceptance of so splendid offer be only knowledge of unworthiness held back yet to delay longer might seem to throw doubt on discretion of royal mind beset by two danger place entirely in majesty hand if may have promise of guidance counsel will constantly need then will
