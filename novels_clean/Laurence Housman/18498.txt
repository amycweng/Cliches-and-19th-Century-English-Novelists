popular will really be man in kingdom be so much cut off from living contact with popular will a be king be in study room in most of routine work of daily life be accomplished large square chamber with three window to one side looking out across well timbered park toward distant group of tower for tower so civic in character might well have be taken for country view scarcely roof be visible upon large desk in center of chamber lay pile of official letter document awaiting perusal knew that in adjoining room one of private secretary be even now attending call from none of secretary must learn anything about popular will walked to window stood looking out into soft sunlit air slightly misty in quality lay over distance of capital away behind tree beneath tower sending toward ceaseless reverberation of bell wheel street cry countless noise of city life went vast teeming population of men woman already far advanced on round of daily toil be in midst not one of must see not one of did really know a man to man everything that learned about life came to at second at third hand did actual contact bring closer for wherever moved among knew who be behaved accordingly for twenty five year have not walked in single one of street nearest of lay within stone throw of palace a youth before father came to throne have sometimes gone about with without companion just like ordinary person taking chance of being recognized have not mattered then now must not be done people did not expect of minister must have regarded a dangerous expensive habit requiring at least trebling of detective service even then there must always have be apprehension uncertainty be king though might happen to place must be automatically filled government go on just a before yet a national symbol life be too valuable to be risked so on ascending throne have be forced a father before to resign personal liberty cease to go out in happy unpremeditated fashion of earlier day have long since got over curious home sickness separation have at first caused a opening to personal enjoyment impulse for freedom have long since died within heart still vaguely hungered for people who called king looking out into pale sunshine be now thinly buttering surface of prosperous capital listening to perpetual tick hum of busy life knew that for be must remain except in official sense unknown territory yet out there in territory be unable to explore thing be called popular will lived moved have being dimly dreamed of what might be thing of substance form there be none to interpret to dream except upon official line before eye salient object in heaven surpassing stony eminence surrounded rose tall spire of twin house of parliament upon top swung gilded weathercock while about portion of base stood maze of scaffolding facade of building having during last few month be under repair there seemed however for moment to be workman upon presently a gazed vacantly without intent something moved upon upper masonry engaged attention slowly along profile out of hidden million below one of subject single minute representative of popular will emerged cautiously into view king be gifted with good sight though figure appeared a tiny speck be unmistakably that of man bearing burden upon back ascending steadily toward highest point of in word be steeplejack a name passed through king mind evoked recollection said to again wonder whether call jack wonder with curious increase of interest fellow feeling watched distant figure mounting to airy perch a did so yet further similitude parable flashed through mind for man presence at dizzy height knew that board of public work be responsible a single item in general expenditure weathercock of palace of legislature have have voted to new coat of gilt steeplejack be now engaged in putting on be there in word of certain morning journal to add fresh luster to supreme symbol of popular will crowned constitutional edifice a word with caressing rhythm flowed across king brain discerned full significance of scene be being enacted before weathercock highest point of constitutional edifice requiring to be touched up afresh for public eye be truly symbolical of crown in relation to popular will twisting way responsive to interpretative of outside force have will of own at yet to do work must blaze resplendently be lifted high to be put in working trim kept with luster untarnished required at certain interval attention of steeplejack one accustomed to being in high place accustomed to isolation loneliness accustomed to bearing burden upon back before eye of one whose function be rather like own saw that steeplejack have now reached point where work be waiting for work required nerve courage wondered whether be highly paid wondered also by what mean man slung into position by what process new gold have to be applied so that must stick perhaps only polished up what be already there coated covered from view by grime of modern industry if so how did scrape off dirt without also scraping off gold perhaps on other hand old gold have to come off before new gold must be put on wondered whether man ever forgot perilous position whether habit did not make sometimes careless whether ever felt giddy how far exploit be really attended by danger to one possessed of skill cool head a thought putting in man place hand grew sympathetically moist well be wasting time must really get to own work now that secretary must be wondering what have become of glanced away over distant roof here there emerged above tree then for last look back again a did so all at once started uttered acute exclamation of distress dark speck have suddenly detached from ball upon vane stood must now be seen glissading with horrible swiftness down slope of spire fell into scaffolding zigzagged from point to point disappeared there must be mistake about be man who have fallen that single minute expression of popular will have passed for ever from view smooth equable hum of unseen million below went steadily on ii fleeing from sight still registered upon brain king rang for secretary figure of correctitude entered there have be accident said majesty over there pointed steeplejack have fallen secretary slid respectfully to window looked out to polite official gaze of inquiry scene of tragedy returned blank uncommunicative stare poor wretch murmured king actually saw go ring up inquire at police center though of course poor fellow must be dead secretary sped away on errand king moving back to window gazed fixedly at spire a though must still in way inform of tragedy consummated below then returned to desk looked distractedly at paper be use back went to window again presently secretary returned stood drooping for permission to speak permission came man be dead majesty be killed instantly king gave sigh of relief of course murmured from such height a that stood for while still cogitating on sad event then said with considerate thoughtfulness habit have made second nature be good enough to find out whether poor fellow be married if so let donation be sent to widow whatever case seems to warrant more if there must happen to be child over tablet secretary bowed beauty of person like recording angel then paused that heavenly measure might be taken with accuracy will be five pound sir inquired better make said king believe that pay for funeral in sending might explain have misfortune to be eye witness secretary cooed like brooding dove of course everybody must understand appreciate made memorandum of ten pound closed up tablet meanwhile king went on thinking aloud wonder said whether take proper precaution in trade like must like to look up find bet volume of encyclopedia appendica when volume be brought to king sat down read about steeplejack climbing iron crank pulley other various appliance requisite for driving of dreadful trade read also how men be inclined to prime for task in ever increasing measure so one day having over primed to be found at bottom instead of at top knowing nothing of how got there be very interesting very apposite rather pathetic when have done turned over page backward till came from steeplejack to statesman statecraft statute affair of state in general be from encyclopedia appendica presentation copy that got most of information upon practical thing in article became so absorbed that quite forgot how time flew until chief secretary came formally to announce to that hour for appearing in council have arrived announcement be observed be made by ordinary working secretary by chief of comptroller of majesty household retired general who have passed from military to civil service with record brilliantly made for by other men adjutant attache indefatigable right hand assistant of whom true diplomatist form stepping stone to power general poast prime minister shared between ordering disposal of king public service to nation while over other department impenetrable to premier hand of comptroller be still extended though personally king rather disliked have become absolutely indispensable adjunct to daily life so smooth in working yet so easily dislocated of royal household also a go between for minister whose intercourse with crown be purely formal have proved very efficient implement when on occasion became necessary to circumvent reduce to reason king characteristic obstinacy in small matter of detail might in fact be regarded a keeper not so much of king conscience a of savoir faire of tact for royalty in country be conspicuous everything related to remembering of name face of date anniversary historical association small considerate action of royal charity robbed of due privacy have now become perquisite of press thing stood ranged under minutely tabulated head within comptroller general department be literally king remembrancer so on occasion also have come a intermediary to remind majesty that hour for council be at hand council be one of function in be held necessary that part played by king albeit more than silent presidency at board where others spoke must wear appearance of importance so announcement made by comptroller be merely preliminary to more flourishing announcement by usher of court two lackey threw open door other than through general have just entered bowing official beautifully dressed waving fairy like wand announced from threshold majesty council now in attendance humbly begs audience of majesty iii then followed pause comptroller general with head deferentially bent waited to catch royal eye king graciously allowed royal eye to be caught comptroller general interpreting silent consent of glance uttered with due solemnity traditional form of word indicative of royal pleasure majesty hears lowed in correct palace accent usher bowed retired helped of course to make act of presiding in council seem highly important consequential to monarch susceptible to ceremonial flattery whether have originally be so devised may be questioned for monarch of old have needed no such ceremonial backing to very practical incursion into ministerial debate what have to notice be that ceremony have survived while other thing practice of substantial interference have become obsolete king passed from private apartment to broad corridor portal where resplendent footman stood in waiting where everything worked with silent automatic precision to prepare way for foot signaling on from point to point a though be sort of special train for line have be expressly cleared other traffic shunted yet when came to small anteroom opened directly into council chamber felt for world like timid bather about to unbutton door of bathing machine step forth into strange hostile element moment of trepidation be one never must get over to face council of minister be always plunge for here truly felt out of depth aware that politically be swimmer now for couple of hour must have to endure while thoroughly at home in own element twenty stout aquatic athlete tumbled around door be thrown open with air of calm self possession walked to head of table about minister stood waiting be seated gentleman said embracing in single bow obeisance of like slow wave closed in on subsiding in large curve soft fawning ripple of hand rubbing around empurpled board at nominally be to preside when be seated in order signed for prime minister to open proceeding thereafter have scarcely to speak for at king council only general report be presented discussion took place fresh proposal be mooted so sat heard how department be extending beneficent operation how statistic be completing to last decimal place prognostication of expert how along with thing import export be balancing trade declining education advancing strike growing day more formidable more popular be only last point really interested for here seemed to get dim rumor of something be part at least of popular will be duty to symbolize to safeguard official adviser of be for putting strike down yet while putting down seemed to wish to curry favor with striker for on one hand there be trade declining if strike be not put down to support fresh taxation on other labor party eighty strong declining if strike be put down to support government with finance act coming on question be whether to accept increasing deficit in revenue declining majority in legislature must be read vaguely between line of report presented by minister of interior time not one word be said about coming constitutional crisis be in everybody mind have be thoroughly discussed by minister sitting in real council elsewhere council at head of constitution have not be present about must hear no more than prime minister chose to tell so smoothly equably uneventfully council reached conclusion minister one after closed up portfolio sitting mute in place respectfully waited royal word of dismissal then king rose around board fawning ripple of hand rubbing ceased slow curving wave of ministerial body receded to respectful distance while majesty passed forth to adjoining chamber there to give a be customary separate audience to minister who have special memoranda to submit requiring royal endorsement on occasion found comptroller already awaiting apologetic for what might seem intrusion on territory belonging more properly to prime minister under correctness of deportment be clear that urgency impelled have come sir said to submit to majesty before matter go further certain difficulty have arisen in connection with majesty gracious donation to widow of unfortunate workman who paused mean steeplejack queried king comptroller general bowed assent majesty ordered inquiry to be made did have be found whether have family large family sir wife seven child ah said king then must suggest that ten pound be not quite well make twenty that sir be not difficulty fact be have discovered that man be what in industrial world be known a 'blackleg a majesty may be aware there be at moment strike in building trade man be working against order of union under circumstance donation from

for government oh sir correctitude protested against so dangerous implication surely be there at order of board of work at order of contractor majesty who be under contract with board to complete by certain date that sir can not be denied well really then said king from what department doe objection to donation emanate from department majesty objection be on general ground of policy king pride modesty be becoming little hurt be annoyed that so small matter of private charity must be thus canvassed brought within range of politics subconsciously have also more symbolic reason helped to show fight really dear general said think be discussing matter very unnecessarily widow be still widow child who tell number seven be orphan surely at death man cease to be either blackleg trade unionist be not working against order now at rate make twenty make twenty utterance grew hurried way have when crossed anxious not to have to give way ca hear anything more about now have brasshay waiting to see a at moment prime minister be announced comptroller general for present at rate made twenty retired did so with wry determined face a for king be thoroughly put out steeplejack be by association

prevented from attending here be crowd of important document term of king have never heard began to wonder at least ten dozen be strange to ordered to be set aside now very dimly very gradually began to suspect position to perceive without watchfulness might very easily become le conscious instrument of government than mere mechanism what if have become that already ii then grew dusk king dismissed secretary without turning on light sat thought alone effervescence have gone from brain melancholy ruled a sat ruminating upon past own present position mind became obsessed by historical character who have preceded in exercise of royal function now grown so exiguous in hand who have sat labored at statecraft in very room of perhaps in very chair in be now seated became almost present to consciousness how must have behaved in present situation how must have set to work to add luster to supreme symbol still crowned constitutional edifice must imagine own father opposing over considerable period weight of personal prestige to importunacy of minister saying with stately ease will speak of gentleman other day so calmly turning from subject in dispute not solving at least imposing delay a penalty minister must pay for difference of opinion that policy of quiet procrastination minister of time must have dared to withstand without first making for certain time allowance so much at least must have be secured not of right through weight of stronger personality what about others before slowly there dawned upon king vision clear a though have seen yesterday regal

six eight chosen prelate one of in defenseless position how must argue affair of state so what must do assent to incontrovertible statement that nonsense must certainly must be put down though knowing time that particular nonsense in question being thing inbred in mind of men must not be put down by act of parliament must persist even to breaking up of church unity so perfectly ineffective church government act have passed into law causing honest opponent to secede while far more numerous dishonest opponent have remained queen regent having for time being asserted authority in church have passed on actual solution of problem to later time later time king brain ceased to visualize came back to to accumulated problem now pressing for solution yes for monarchy not only a have made a have now become that great little lady be almost equally responsible genius have only arrested decay by bottling up in clear preservative of own virtue now stood out more conspicuously than ever survival

matter have ever be accustomed to follow find correct before weight of moral law bowed head gave up ghost of dead steeplejack widow seven orphan passed out of existence ceased longer to be mouth heart of flesh became instead abstraction to be set in class apart one not eligible for reward to such a public declaration of royal bounty must be made very well said king despondently strike off

voice ca move be unable to move moaned what be dear inquired sciatica answer came from source must not fathom one murmured in tone of deep discouragement one will ever call ' iii three hour later after dinner king son prince max be sitting together in same room king feeling considerably better for good meal have given max one of best cigar having gone so far to establish confidential relation be now trying to summon up courage to speak to young man a father must here a elsewhere be met by old difficulty son be not intimate have drifted apart not for lack of filial paternal affection simply because in round of official life so seldom met privately since prince have acquired establishment of own king knew little of what did with daily life beyond record of court circular max be now twenty five be taller darker than father more handsome more self possessed in appearance combined polish of military training with quiet air of amateur scholar forehead be prematurely quite becomingly bald mustache well groomed figure slight athletic have inherited father full lip glance of eye be of keener shrewder quality might be suspected that eye glass occasionally put on be assumed more for effect than for necessity above possessed what king conspicuously lacked self assurance with sort of moral ease a though error might fall into must be taken rather a experience to profit by than a occasion for self reproach face showed a talked that quality of humor enables man to laugh at own enthusiasm one must not always be sure whether be serious merely indulging in dialectic to one out of touch with intellectual origin be man difficult to know king being in matter altogether at sea knew really very little about be in consequence little afraid of that fact made frontal attack difficult nevertheless having screwed up to speak began abruptly max said father have ever thought about marrying max smiled little bitterly started thinking about said when be seventeen on have thought about ever since then added rather coldly a though to warn off mere curiosity why do ask have proposal be made well said father might certainly arrange something feel indeed that ought to at age only wanted first to know how felt upon matter see added hesitating people be beginning to talk wo do oblique cautious reference to son private life marked new stage in relation be actually first occasion in intercourse a father son upon sex question have ever be broached between be wonder therefore so far have be rather stranger to other now however having decided to speak king also decided that must go on interfere required moral courage for have never failed to recognize son a stronger character especially in intellectual matter superior have be told that have be keeping mistress said avoiding young man eye answered max must suppose be generally received phrase for who be queried king pushing hazardously on now that danger point have be reached do wish to meet parental dignity be offended be suggestion ought not to make then dear father why inquire after suit other to be nothing how long have be going on have lived together for five year king recalled phrase that have recently heard authoritatively spoken relationship of long standing morally of course that only make matter worse h be said aloud started early must say sir at age be already father said max correctively king made interjectory movement prince went on be twenty be still virginal to speak frankly be amazed at perhaps even amused yes even now be inclined to think that among prince record must have be exceptional

interested also to hear that be roman catholic have attack of devoutness occasionally prescribe separation have twice threatened not in anger with most sincere reluctance to break up peaceful

now inherited father property can give mother position have right to expect if must be so will find very attentive to offer of marriage that court of western civilization now includes japan may have to make have said sir that wish to know about feeling in matter what understand said king be idea about morality of really replied prince hardly know have have gone on so long anything be regular of long standing tends to produce moral feeling arrested king attention think so interrogated max waived decisive pronouncement perhaps said quite know what morality mean fancy sometimes that full meaning may be sprung upon when find in love if be not destined to undergo experience on day when learn be to become father without having intended morality arises out of proper improper performance of social obligation have sometimes wondered whether society most insane treatment of illegitimacy must not have compelled into misalliance with beistress a call have ever max cried king be outrageous

to have be written by heir to crown do mean to publish then cried king in awestruck tone certainly answered prince have not nation right to know opinion of possible future king never will be said that jingalo accepted blindly under dark cover of heredity at news king looked really aghast propose while be spending in trying to add luster began then checked propose to publish work may destroy confidence at present subsisting between sovereign people must not false confidence be worse alternative sir inquired max be doing in time said king plaintively be reign be disturbing not own think

monarchy even at present day be of greatest social political value unsettle in public mind unsettle basis of government sacredness of property everything else go with hereditary principle have in keeping make for stability continuity tradition nothing can adequately take place forget sir said son that if follow heredity back far enough ours be elected monarchy if once admit election must admit also right of to be elected one to offer refuse candidature nation can not play fast loose a have done with principle of male primogeniture at same time impose upon candidate for election unavoidable obligation to accept burden of heredity let have matter quite clear if people a have done by others in past claim right to reject must prove outrageous impossible character equally claim right to reject must see capable of making reasonable use of service before will consent to be made use of well said king breathing in resignation suppose ought not to mind too much 'after deluge ' be wise enough saying when one have power to prevent 'after deluge said max have come down to with muddled application if monarchy must only adopt a motto monarchy must be good for thousand year louis xv said louis xvi failed to give effect have placed at head of deluge in very forefront of rush roar waved hat to cried 'after ' like captain to company started off at gallop must have obeyed followed 'after deluge must be rallying cry of monarchy for renewal of youth not quavering note of dotage be motto be going to put on title page of book good gracious cried king max be pleased to see what impression have made did not usually get so good listener to think said that talk came of having asked question on matter be already five year old be sorry to have taken up so much time explaining on contrary said king be glad five year yes be very glad to know that got up moving to table made call on private telephone must mind waiting few minute went on perhaps will need countenance secretary answered call presently comptroller general appeared to learn royal pleasure be sorry dear general said king to trouble at so late hour about matter of widow who be not widow wish fifty pound to be sent to anonymously yes fifty pound will see that be done to night turning to max said a though referring to conversation already passed have effectually interested in case max saw that be being used a pawn in game did not understand held tongue comptroller general finding dismissed retired to do for once a be told so by inglorious device of anonymity lavishness combined king maintained point sent gift to relief of one who be a matter of fact just a legally widow a other may like to name john of jingalo have not yet broken official leading string on occasion have circumvented flushed with triumph bade son affectionate good night come talk to again said agree with anything say help to think be sign of progress hitherto have relied with far greater sense of security comfort on who have enabled not to think consultation with max insidious a drug habit a secretively employed be henceforth to count for much in development of constitutional crisis hereditary monarchy have conceived idea of turning hereditary material to account doubt cabinet must have objected preferring to keep victim in complete mental isolation at present cabinet did not know chapter iv popular monarchy that talk with max formed preliminary to month of most strenuous verbal intellectual conflict that king have ever known outside be calm constitutional crisis be in suspension by agreement on side hostility have be deferred till trade must have reaped full profit out of silver jubilee celebration paper spoke admiringly of truce to party warfare a instinctive loyalty on part of people expressive of desire to do honor to beloved sovereign in spirit undisturbed by contending voice of faction there be instinctive loyalty however within cabinet while street be decorating illumination preparing minister be giving majesty thoroughly bad time in way of course brought upon for at very next council meeting after conversation with max did thing so far a own reign be concerned be absolutely without precedent opened mouth spoke objected contended argued at sound of voice uttering something more than mere formality minister sat up amazed most of very angry scandalized at so unexpected reversion to constitutional usage of previous generation not word of leaked out whole thing be admirable example of keeping up of appearance on bureaucratic government so largely depends be if come to think of very deftly arranged affair there be whole country bobbing with loyalty enthusiasm commercial opportunism cabinet unencumbered for while by parliamentary situation must cause anxiety correspondingly free to direct energy elsewhere there within council without soul to advise be king scuffling confusedly against predatory device of minister poor man knowledge of constitution be scanty power of argument be feeble for from day of accession word precedent have governed yet have idea feeling that be now being forced into wrong position constitutional breath be being beaten out of body must pas from levee from reception of foreign embassy address of loyalty congratulation to conflict in council reminded of nothing so much a scrum upon football field through one goal be to be kicked exercise of crown prerogative to nominate free church bishop refusal to exercise whichever expedient be driven to in end knew that on one side grandiloquent word must be written about fine instinct for constitutional limitation power of monarchy on other pained deeply respectful word of regret that have be so ill advised by minister by others side loses be football win game that however be merely spectator point of view football only know that have be kicked yet king be well aware that in parliament at rate appearance must be kept up that corner of field got kicked to blame for must be laid ostensibly on others though a result monarchy to be bounden duty to add luster must be either strengthened weakened what course to take really did not know mind in consequence be greatly troubled being of conservative instinct believed that in main bishop be right prime minister wrong prime minister have be harassing country with general election country have have about a many a must stand yet without fresh election other ministry be possible now at moment when country be bent on profiting by revival in trade approaching celebration have stimulated nothing must be so unpopular a fresh ministerial crisis must have doubt that whatever paper might pretend to say odium of crisis if due to own action must fall eventually upon prime minister knew yes just at juncture resignation threat of have become absolutely compelling card be playing for be worth free church bishop be to be promised for ensuing year ministry must be bound to feel here now that majesty confidence in have be withdrawn resignation aimed not against opposing majority in parliament against demur opposition of crown fact in political significance with possible development of danger for state of humiliation for monarchy be daily pressing relentless weight against king scruple more unanswerable seemed more angry became more keenly did feel that be being unfairly used then one day a sat thinking at desk at once new thought occurred to throwing queer radiance into face of joy mixed with cunning then gradually faded out left blank old expression of anxiety distrustfulness returned shook head at scared that thought must ever have come into must do muttered impossible same got up from desk in deep cogitation began walking about room carpet with rich variegated pattern like max conversation helped to think until certain delivery of royal courier from abroad came to divert attention to more particular family affair nevertheless mind have again reverted to vetoed notion when hour later on way to queen apartment met princess charlotte tripping gaily along corridor stopped to give return home embrace how well be looking papa cried admiring flushed countenance king though smiled remained preoccupied with embryo of statecraft dear said abruptly do think that be popular why yes papa of course said opening sweet eye at doe everybody cheer when go anywhere think said father dubiously lending ear in fancy to sound think that crowd get into habit of cheering not because care for just because there be lot of like to hear sound of own voice sometimes have quite small crowd said

knew of day must have to know of must cause great deal of worry young woman with growing secret be at time twenty three ii princess charlotte have way of drawing in breath a if to speak then bottling little performance be at time very telling in effect spoke volume told of long training in self repression still did not come quite naturally told of inward combustion of tightly cornered still independent mind lady in waiting have seen princess run out of mother presence to tabber foot on inlaid floor of corridor thence to return smooth sweet tempered amiable for between charlotte queen there be temperamental difference have to declare find safety through emergency exit princess have such difficulty with father for imperturbability be not one of characteristic imperturbability be one quality in parent princess simply must not stand made feel powerless to feel powerless toward one intellectual inferior be to certain temperament maddening charlotte have long since be brought to recognize that mother in own dear way be quite hopeless be able with astonishing ease to get upon father nerve to trouble conscience for while queen remained impervious to influence outside convention of training habit king be a open to new scruple of conscience a sieve be to wind fresh idea rattled in head like green pea in cullender when shook head seemed to shake about larger one came uppermost princess charlotte have in recent year acquired habit of entangling father with most engaging simplicity in moral problem for constitutional monarchy must find answer be evidently interested in politics when of late king wishing to check so dangerous tendency have sought to know reason why have answered with perfect frankness max say for to also max man born to inaction have be talking max say be not sure if mean to come to throne if doe be just a well must know something of business young lady have most disrespectful way of talking about monarchy a business did not say a if in joke be

grace coldly custodian of theological teaching be to admit to endowment two extreme of heresy of schism if be admitted suggested prime minister will not tend to correct other study history by allowing side to be stated admit to chair school scientist rhetorician why then must not theology be studied on same broad line will chair of theology become more stable institution inquired archbishop by being turned into see saw prime minister smiled on illustration answer be edged with bitterness be way of securing movement at event remarked caustically church retorted grace denies need of such movement firm foundation have scriptural warrant for saying be upon rock be traveling menagerie swingboat merry go round yet have heard said prime minister that take ship to be symbol one in particular very specially designed to be traveling menagerie containing kind clean unclean unclean said archbishop be by divine dispensation placed in decisive minority yet shared suppose provision of establishment did not imagine sit down at table with patriarch family perhaps dog ate of crumb be not 'crumbs ' that be seeking said archbishop with asperity from chair of theology dispense to church bread of wisdom from draw sustenance ask to let source of intellectual life become infected with microbe at time when latitudinarian doctrine be sapping unity of church weakening discipline to allow establishment a principle in center of learning in seat of divinity what claim to denounce heresy schism will be left to church if in very government heretic schismatic teacher receive post of influence emolument authority to what extreme may not mind of student be led to what destruction of ecclesiastical discipline if will admit free teaching in university explained prime minister will not seek to touch theological seminary to invade order by infusion of fresh blood invade order cried primate that can not do bishop hand must bestow drew back own with declamatory gesture be not churchman perhaps know what to church mean hold in sacred trust power of key if surrender surrender everything be in good many hand already remarked prime minister blandly episcopal power be not limited to church of jingalo then for first time a pawn in political game archimandrite be mentioned archbishop must not believe ear must not dare said be sorry replied other that must be under such misapprehension let remind that only year ago recommended for honorary benefice church have not parish yes honorary not with administrative power yet fancy be devised in order at later date might employ merely by accident a be for confirming validity of order while device said archbishop be to use a mean for placing schismatics in position of control authority sir say to that must not dare nation will not allow time will show replied other smoothly ah cried archbishop passionately trust to time to power of eternal if such attempt be made to violate body of mother church then pronounce sentence of excommunication upon who take part in must have legal effect said prime minister miss point in dispute have not to discus matter of faith doctrine only of government if prefer if will give co operation consent be ready at time to offer alternative of disestablishment be solution for moment press undoubtedly must leave spirituality of church more free real fear have gathered be that must prepare way for extreme of doctrine can not countenance church triumphant be told must run risk of larger recognition than be allowed to under present form limitation imposed by state connection be most hopeful mean of retarding doctrinal development be not that so have not to discus matter of doctrine countered archbishop stiffly only of government concern be not with church teaching with power for enforcing upon own member including commented prime minister what have called 'the power of key power seek to extend over temporality to claim access to retain have in past used political mean be using to deprive of power recognize that have grace occupied to day position of advantage be now mine must have used with justification for strengthening of order from popular verdict must have have authority to deliver sentence against upon same ground now take only sure mean be open to to strengthen own order to safeguard future liberty what be order smoothly inquired grace order be representative system voice popular will mine said archbishop in richly reverberating tone be divine revelation voice will of god claim closer acquaintance with authority than remarked prime minister yet too have faith in efficacy of working base faith differently retorted grace have principle a have just boasted have opportunity think that opportunity be of same eternal character a principle to

impediment be pushing definition of impediment rather far when plan new thoroughfare giving stranger entree to church premise be really definition of 'premises said prime minister over be chiefly at issue what right have church to regard a stranger who be baptized christian archbishop seized advantage exultingly will only remind said of church government act measure of ancient date by parliament forced church to expel from benefice who must not accept discipline in matter of outward observance voted for measure prime minister have to acknowledge stroke made light of think that measure have already become obsolete be not put very thoroughly into practice even at beginning let parliament then admit error said archbishop abolish act principle enshrines before proceeding with other act diametrically opposed to while law claim hold over church church claim to hold by existing law may possibly then satisfy grace insinuated premier if presently propose restoration of certain free church minister by episcopal consecration to fold from be expelled archbishop rose to foot raising presentation bible high over head brought down upon table with bang then instantaneously conceiving mistake laid hand over in act of blessing never said firmly solemnly with ever deepening inflection of tone never never be measure might be avoided conceded prime minister alternative be before have made offer have offered said archbishop alternative be not able to discus roman catholicism unitarianism in alternate dos be price ask to pay church of jingalo will accept triple crown untriune divinity a guide drew to full height that sir be answer so really think inquired prime minister yours church voice be one blood of martyr said archbishop have stained very step of throne from under divine providence be commissioned to speak with authority call on to witness never in hour of need will church surrender divine mission to preach only pure doctrine to defend faith committed to saint thought said prime minister officially at least did not invoke dead sir have need record be inheritance be who invoke from imperishable past discussion then seems to be at end have gone back into middle age prime minister having got very much answer expected here rose began buttoning coat well archbishop said a thus trimmed to give neat finish to discussion before part will put question quite frankly be to be peace war be servant of church militant answered grace then compared note settled date a to when war be to be declared jingalo be about to exhibit to world continuity of institution with mind thus carried back to ancient time modern controversy be anachronism be on historic ground that arranged armistice recording angel be more truthful than archbishop prime minister recording angel having listened to conversation be led to set down upon table notable memorandum on account be popular pageantry trade interest to be disturbed during so golden opportunity a silver jubilee while be going on defense of church state must be relegated to obscurity iii have taken place before truce actually began see in fact chapter ii how much rather how little king have heard of already know how little truce brought benefit to will learn more fully in later chapter still for moment be not without comfort for have got max to talk to evening that spent together much talk went on king sat infected edified while maxian oratory flowed how be inquired father that have be able to think of thing see when tell how did ever come to enter head for year answered max have advantage of being youngest son until be twenty two life stood between succession while stephen rupert be drilling managed to get educated poor rupert murmured father must have made much better king than of think so said max must merely have kept monarchy to old line mean sticking in rut if monarchy be to mean anything will have to move not merely with time ahead of how can move ahead of how otherwise can lead be what head of privileged class never seem to understand look at bishop see what spectacle have made of through not leading ah yes sighed king thought 'd be against bishop against cried max of course be against bishop be set of prehistoric remains even if be up to date combined house of bishop judge with full legislative power be antediluvian be speaking of deluge now in sense in louis xv spoke of be eighteenth century arrangement yes be against bishop be much more against cabinet cabinet be seeking to control not only upper lower chamber a well be fighting bishop merely to delude people there be laity so stupid so lazy so corrupt that wo see one know that government sell honor for party purpose then cover up by pretending that contribution to party fund be 'public service everything now be to be have for price chancellery at so much knighthood at so much more order of other in exact proportion to prestige rarity last year have debate on in house debate where between corruptors corrupted be in majority solemnly took vote on declared that there be corruption though everybody knew to be fact opposition lay low because mean to do exactly same when time come oh be not only house of laity daresay bishopric have got price if only knew king must have rejected suggestion a fantastic only month ago now with archimandrite in mind began to be suspicious what price monetary political might not free churchman be paying for bishopric what secret bargain of be one duty to inform lashed at own impotence for ignominy of position increased with growing consciousness here be prime minister respectful compulsive able to threaten to browbeat to dictate term have counter mean to extract from minister on what term be consenting to do thing what price be paying to get done how constitutionally be to obtain knowledge of anything still piling up accusation voice of max went on presume said that quite lately list of jubilee honor have be submitted to for approval what doe approval mean be single one of own selection do know what majority of be for king shook head mostly be political said government have right have call to interfere be perhaps better must not interfere may be arguable sir that uncomfortably high position to be born cut off from more strenuously fermenting issue of political game from malignity hypocrisy of party system of a nation pretend to be so proud be secretly so much ashamed may be well that single authority must stand removed from above party if in hand of authority there be also left power of sentence dismissal power also to withhold unmerited reward power be no longer expected to exercise lie like china nest egg never to be hatched only to promote laying of other egg yet while prerogative have be thus diminished claim that will act with judicial impartiality have increased have become fetter to oppose course of ministerial action to day be by implication to ally with other side be in position of judge whose direction jury have authority to ignore from whose hand power of imposing penalty have practically be withdrawn change have be thrust upon monarchy by will not of people of class section in evolution of political system happened at time to be ruling one at one period be church at army at landlord capitalist be never that latent force lying in future peace loving industrial democracy to day be still striving to hold back from aim ruling power of past have now concentrated on cabinet a last line of defense so at present day be cabinet have largest control not only of patronage much of corruptly applied of certain penalizing device by monetary pressure can be brought upon who thwart will by practical usurpation of crown right to decree general election by control of party fund from parliamentary candidate be subsidized assisted to poll be able to hold over head of supporter financial threat to very few can remain indifferent be how so called popular chamber be manipulated run power of purse speak now of money voted for public service lie almost entirely in hand of who have largest monetary interest for keeping away from constituency maintaining leader in power a consequence ministry evasion of regulation safeguard increasing seizure of parliamentary time postponement of finance to date in session when legislature energy be exhausted have become more more corrupt in character why very minister whose duty be to see that member be constant in voting attendance be one with whom lie if not distribution of patronage at least recommendation be go between know how likely then be rank file to throw government out of office when immediate result will be not only to transfer bribe to hand of political opponent to inflict upon cost of contested election privately can not afford to face be accordingly obliged to go cap in hand to very men have voted from power who still have absolute control of party organization fund here max stopped to take breath iv can suggest other way questioned king surely must have party have reason to suggest answered son stand written in history under more ancient constitution house of laity came pledged from electorate to criticise to control by giving withholding of supply act of separate administratively independent body now government be carried on by administrative body though nominally dependent have at back majority of elected pledged not to criticise difference between two system be a difference between darkness light that body be now forcing monarchy also into same non critical attitude at least be securing that criticism will be impotent of result have right sir to ask what be doing to day to preserve for power inherited to tell truth son answered king be only lately that have begun trying to find out what power be seems strange confession to make after twenty five year be true when came to throne at moment of great political change be entirely uninstructed quite naturally made mistake letting thing go when be told to from false position successive ministry have never allowed to escape have kept have only just found out a uninstructed a possibly must burden with routine work busy hand while starving brain one of little way done on score of relieving of unnecessary trouble have be to submit in large batch at interval important document requiring assent smuggling in under cover of others when find out plead unavoidable delay urgency a though be quite exception tell have be going on oh dear yes for long time now general have known of a well a of other day made one of secretary go through entry find in last year signed sixty act of parliament about fifteen hundred other state document besides mere commission title diploma sort of thing tell have ghost of notion of what more than dozen be about give time to digest anything be quite right be system well said son at least treat much worse than do people representative have become regular plan now to bring in six bill rolled into one in form far too big complicated ever to be properly discussed insert lot of unnecessary contentiousness at beginning really administrative part machinery provides with political handle throughout country call non contentious part at end then on score of being non contentious because by time get to mind of legislature be exhausted then shut down with closure one result be that have law on statute book even make grammar only last session minister of education got bill sent up to spiritual chamber with three split infinitive in what be split infinitive inquired majesty merely grammatical error for in day school boy used to be whipped be not be important because when lawyer get on to interpretation of law loose syntax give opportunity make fortune out of grammatical error of parliament of course be lawyer who drew up bill do mean that one paid to put in split infinitive inquired king anxiously be quite unnecessary thing paid for good drafting be never to legal interest what wanted to say be here in house of educated men dealing with education nobody troubled to correct grammar of thing to mind stand out a moral portent of first magnitude bishop quite rightly sent back again for wrong reason reason be pure blind obscurantism if have returned because of split infinitive slovenly drafting requested that must be put into decent jingalese so that might pretend to understand must have have enlightened educationalist in country with a be be against be curious how spiritual chamber always seek popularity among fool instead of wise treat democracy like dog with bad name yet be to dog tail that pin faith so wag with tail king be not happy at hearing bishop so abused now word have fallen from son lip enabled to change subject to point more immediately concerned max said answer truly want flattery do think that be popular young man viewed father leniently indulgently even worn fussy over anxious face appealed to sense of pity oh yes believe so said think be trying to do best sort of thing enthuse a grandfather used to do then have grand manner grand way of speaking a if be oracle have put aside except when make speech have be written for by minister well decent people respect for have drawback crowd prefers other thing occasionally like still to pretend at moment of ceremony that belief in divine right hereditary principle so forth where like to pretend press government be always ready to play into hand yes be mixture must attend sometimes to unreality then with real moment get effect grandfather said king never talked to about anything did like idea of being succeeded hated to think of time when affair must have to go on without fancy that rather despised mental capacity else thought that by just looking at must learn so never talked to not on subject mean be still not sure whether ought to talk to really know where state secret begin where end whether have right to say anything of what go on in council to single living soul wanted to consult archbishop other day merely to hear statement of case from own side be not allowed be most solitary man in kingdom be kept so in order may remain powerless a charlotte must say observed max have taught other business yet be strange here be long established firm 'limited entire ' suppose must describe existing upon hereditary principle yet not allowed to extract of living value a detached force succeed other upon

down towards end of day did king become again obstreperous till noon must then quiet down by degree till at six o'clock spirit have reached strange nadir of depression have brasshay only caught then in period of reaction must have found unformidable a of old brasshay did not know then night after night came max with tangle of word whipped into fresh revolt still carried memory of last conversation that chapter max have composed into echoing cavity of brain when next encountered lord functionary certain question of court etiquette procedure having be disposed of by way said majesty be told yesterday that be being criticised in play department mean lord functionary have be spending sleepless night in scrambling attempt to acquire literary education own royal master be last person to whom must give away so only smiled with air of deference self complacence court official know how to combine have heard rumor of sir replied in tone of easy detachment who be making complaint certain member of parliament believe have constituent to satisfy under democracy of course autocrat can never do right be autocrat inquired king at majesty disposal returned lord functionary with bow

be prince who asked to go suggested be to say immediately official confidence be restored for to lord functionary max a reformer be still unknown while taste for frivolous diversion be more easily assumed so in due course copy of play reached king hand perhaps be through mere inadvertence that other six did not accompany king noted omission when once started to read single play have reached forgot about others for found that hand be full at one stroke of scythe have reaped plentiful harvest here be play on very eve of production reeking with sniggering impropriety keeper of king conscience have permitted to become popular vogue suggestion innuendo to ordinary theater going public have now grown accustomed struck inexperienced majesty a bold glaring novelty mere cheapness of wit passed uncritically by indecency be so bare bald even with innocence inexperience must not fail to understand explanation of course be easy new version of old accepted play have received official sanction through oversight providence have sent to rescue in nick of time delighted to have found something hand really must do took up blue pencil set to work snatch of dialogue half line of lyric especially when came to last verse here there everywhere scored through with ruthless hand with renewed sense of usefulness conscience well at ease returned much deleted copy to lord functionary before long that official visited presenting grave countenance be by mean enthusiastic over royal handiwork production be about to take place play have already practically be licensed silence up to so

oh yes sir be always read corrected lord functionary reader have necessarily to go upon certain line be guided by precedent custom must be highly inadvisable to disturb so pleaded that status quo ante might prevail yet man to man must not defend what king showed must inquired majesty indignantly read such thing aloud to own family must comfortably if called upon to do so read aloud to drama explained lord functionary be so different from anything else have not to observe same convention in light comedy especially thing really count people never trouble to think about mean nothing in case said king one will mind cutting out lord functionary seemed not so sure assurance went in fact in quite opposite direction pleaded hard for trade interest stood to represent play be in advanced state of rehearsal many thousand have be spent upon seeing that be revival doubt about new version passing have existed anywhere to entreaty king remained adamant in matter said have to consult conscience point must not be further argued be very unfortunate said lord functionary in acid tone must insist said majesty that see to omission being made lord functionary bowed pained body over hand king graciously extended majesty must be obeyed said be phrase that king very seldom heard gave taste of power max said to son upon next meeting have be doing a advised do believe be right what did advise

be known in dramatic world since public be forced to give up right to free sitting king be startled alarm crept into voice do mean have done harm not in least quite reverse have certainly doubled play fortune run be going to be tremendous majesty felt flattered have not reason for surely must mean that have rightly interpreted public taste that what popular will really wanted be pure carefully

indeed sir think that must have taken box under private name can go unobserved play have already begun if will keep to back one will know that be there besides be lent season when incognito of visit becomes recognized rule do think be justified in missing so vivid interpretation of popular will king hesitation ended suppose must go on doing unexpected said now have once begun must not make better rule said max so quite unexpectedly to extreme bewilderment of detective force taken suddenly by surprise king found in theater where performance number three of gaudy girl be going on house be packed tumultuous excited a entered sheltering gloom of box majesty recognized word of play remembered too that censored passage lay close ahead came sumptuously bosomed figure stepped into limelight sang in second verse threw out rhyme seemed to clamor for pair threw out a angler throw out fly for fish be sure to rise king held breath a blue penciled passage drew near voice quavered broke singer

mocked not at said max scandal have be eliminated ought to be put stop to law doe exist holding authority up to ridicule when authority have made absurd must wish better fate to mind have done noble work said king be not what intended at max smiled indulgently so much better said unexpected be just a good for sir a for others then king drew back again into corner to prepare for fresh shock a play went on managerial device be simple effective very easy to understand from start to finish be played with little variation though with ever increasing success here there where for long period blue penciled passage occurred imaginary censoring have be inserted merely to whip curiosity with result that atmosphere of innuendo suggestion be greatly increased indeed whole piece reeked of new situation have be evolved play have not previously contained stimulated audience sat metaphorically with eye to eye hole from key have be accommodatingly withdrawn then came sensation of evening whether in course of performance king have become so interested a to forget caution whether between act too much light have penetrated box at back of have be sitting be now impossible to say just

realizing what be about have first touched on raw then tickled dear good beast a max phrased recognizing only second part of performance have turned rapturously round given paw king have scruple did not like thus to win popularity by accident yet more looked into more saw for fact that by committing popular faux pa have secured far more consideration from minister than by doing correct thing john

well behaved monarchy be essential to very existence chapter vii old order reader will remember have taken place in lent king have done something according to accepted canon be quite incorrect have be to frivolous popular play during penitential season have got into paper instead of being blamed for have gained enormously in popularity now have majesty be merely aiming for a politician aim for deserting principle for party party when principle become hindrance might have followed lead given by people of jingalo recognizing that church calendar have lost hold upon popular imagination might thenceforward have secularized conduct paved way in court circle for separation of church state minister be itching to bring about did not yet dare john of jingalo have defect belong to conscientious

in feeling for public pulse by light of own conscience have proved that be right prime minister wrong yet though ostensibly in wrong prime minister have really be right have reckoned that move might prove popular one for monarchy though dull average of popularity for ancient institution suited book for present did not wish in view of certain eventuality to see greatly increased still le did wish

be mere matter of course occasion being important one of great event indeed of jubilee festivity be expected of that must give rather special consideration to final plan though wearied by circumlocution of council have lasted throughout morning named hour at six o'clock received minister in private audience professor began to explain matter in usual official tone before long perceived that attention paid to be merely formal king sat depressed listless cold renewal of official routine found mentally fagged out be evident that thought be elsewhere making matter a short a must in decency professor folded memoranda returned to pocket recalled to by ensuing silence king spoke really know enough about to say anything murmured doubt have arranged everything for best still remained seated a though interview be not ended minister have perforce to remain seated also fear that to day have wearied majesty said at last to fill up pause council be sometimes very trying king lifted forlorn eye in sort of gratitude upon least troublesome of minister at least answered have not to reproach for noticed that did not speak be listening answered professor be much struck by majesty line of argument agreed can not separate from colleague returned minister cautiously recognized strength of majesty case on own premise if well put becomes unanswerable hardly thought that have put well king voice showed despondency to be perfectly frank sir said professor tempering amiable twinkle of gaze with deferential movement of head did not historical argument requires knowledge of history remind of of deficiency professor be shared majesty by nearly whole of cabinet very few of sir knew anything more of than of who did be intent on concealing knowledge very considerate be sure not at sir knowledge must have given strength to argument king sat up little at confirmation of suspicion do mean then that minister make part of duty to conceal from truth truth sir submitted professor may have undue weight given to then becomes councilor duty to correct after history be only history if at time can not break from will never get anywhere yet to day protested king history precedent constitution be word have be drummed into ear for world a though not be preacher of subversive doctrine majesty will remember that in country have have three successful revolution against constitution in one monarchy be successful in two people be said a warning by mean sir merely to show that precedent lie on side like dry bone in wilderness requires power of prophet to call dry bone to life at present see prophet in israel yet member of government prophesies noticed sir that did not never once did pretend to know what future must bring forth only pointed to past deducing therefrom duty a conceived to constitution conditionally that commanded respect surely said king be bound whatever condition to hold sacred trust have be committed to by inheritance professor bowed with majesty assented hereditary principle must naturally be strong be implanted in blood have such impulse in mine father be born in workhouse be very remarkable said king to have attained to present position life must have be full of interest adventure full of interest yes adventure very plodding very uneventful almost monotonous apart from mental happening now then unsought stroke of fortune be how did ever get into cabinet inquired king in tone betrayed sort of puzzled respect merely to fill gap in ministry whose day be numbered then unexpected turn of wheel kept in power remained be inglorious arrival found must be of use sort of connecting line between incompatibles be not unpopular with colleague left alone in department go own way what be way inquired king still searching for guidance do nearly everything a permanent official tell recognizing that while minister come go permanent official remain acquire experience from side on other hand use own discretion in hastening suspension of superannuation clause promote by result not by seniority department in consequence be most efficient in whole civil service have le work to do than other minister thus be left with more leisure energy to devote to consideration of policy affair in general do approve inquired king of present policy minister paused think pace be about right said reflectively pace yes government to day sir be largely matter of pace actual measure so much matter modern democracy be making for something of be really governing class mean profoundly apprehensive problem now be to let come about without actual catastrophe when used word 'pace ' have certain graphic illustration in mind incident once heard from manager of railway recountal of will show majesty what mean passenger train before arriving at head of long evenly graded declivity have taken on three four good truck heavily laden owing to carelessness in coupling wagon became detached on very crest of descent falling to rear came almost to halt not quite sluggishly at first began to move gathering impetus from sheer weight followed in track of proceeding train halfway down declivity engine driver discovered loss danger threatened looking back saw in distance wagon weighted by labor of men hand drawing nearer with speed grew ever more formidable one chance therefore of avoiding catastrophe be to put on pace in hope of arriving at more level condition before impact took place yet must still limit to speed enabled train to keep to rail on certain sharp curve lay ahead be problem engine driver set to solve up to certain point more pace must allow greater chance of safety beyond point new danger arising out of pace lay ahead of minister paused what happened inquired king negotiated curve with success have got so far ahead that when wagon finally overtook impetus have be diminished by more level condition of road impact be slight only guard van be smashed guard rather badly disabled what happened afterwards to guard engine driver inquired majesty much interested guard be pensioned for life engine driver be promoted whose fault be guard well not exactly replied professor careless coupling be done by others guard have right have not chosen to exercise to refuse to accompany train in van be not put last so a to embrace whole combination at least have technical right suppose did not wish to give trouble said king meditatively very likely for of course have exercised right whole train must have be delayed by extra shunting in consequence le acceptable servant to employer one must have blamed not for excess of caution queried king did not say that on line government must become impossible have to run railway system seems with certain risk of accident otherwise must never be up to time be so said professor in political crisis be pace more than principle that find one have to consider if be solved in such such way pace will be so so question will take safely over curve if be solved in way so that pace slackens wagon in rear may be down upon guard whose control while train make running be nominal be then first to suffer saw in man place poor glow worm cried may change green light in tail to red be red to begin with be use proletarian force descending upon from rear be quite blind in purpose be merely dead weight impetus send along then pulled up abruptly astonished to find that be talking in max manner be so catching not wholly blind sir said professor believe mean well mainly to doubt be only human nature body in community whether energized sluggish have weight attached to more that body can agree to combine greater be weight politically one have to recognize that consensus of opinion carry with certain moral a well a physical force out of spring evolution of governing system only said king in nature of thing have always to stand alone sir have history said professor a have reminded know may inquire sir whether have real wish to know why naturally exclaimed king whereupon professor a though laying aside something of officialdom took up easier attitude addressed to point must think sir be quite compatible with duty to colleague be to send majesty few volume of constitutional history with certain appropriate passage marked must interest very greatly to hear argument developed on line have already laid down history must venture to send be thoroughly reliable standard authority written by eminent jurist to whose word later historian still bow a said sir pace be to day thing really matter beyond given pace certainly be not able to go luckily for present plan there be source from forcing of pace seems probable think other ministry dare attempt speaking for increase of present pace must conceive become grave embarrassment if therefore majesty have be apprehensive of adopting increase of speed think may be reassured after constitutional readjustment pace be scarcely likely to grow dangerous professor have managed to indicate that be if so might be allowed last word king rose will be much obliged professor said if will lend book have mentioned when may look for sir said professor in smooth matter of fact tone so happens have with in carriage will have conveyed to majesty immediately therewith bowed over king hand departed ii left to king stood considering for while be pleased puzzled what have man wise kindly be telling what advice be word intended to convey be quite sure now that minister have come talked to for purpose what have mainly talked about be pace be pace that mattered be very well with pace have nothing to do except in negative sort of way occupying position of guard with brake to hand steam power must only cause delay have mean object that must see for accelerating matter besides have not professor said that in estimation pace be about right effort to secure delay must be already aware of fail of effect ministerial resignation threatening must have to give in alternative mad alternative have for moment occurred to must not do result might be too tremendous might lead even to revolution republic so gave problem up then pile of six large volume with professor teller humble duty be brought in set down before john of jingalo sat down to read marked passage be reading for completion extended over many day what first attracted attention however be chronological series of plate showing map of europe in political change from tenth to twentieth century be in fact key to whole work for a author rightly pointed out in opening paragraph history of europe be inextricably bound up in history of jingalo one must not be properly studied without understanding of other map of europe turned from century to century there a marked many variation there always to be recognized be jingalo occupying proud historical position so often challenged yet still on whole unchanged have found room to live breathe not by own strength by careful adjustment of political balance between others neutralization artfully sometimes treacherously contrived of greater force than own have for neighbor two great military state several smaller one have at time be at war with nearly of often generally in fact have come out of war more vanquished than victorious though jingalese school book carefully concealed fact have lost for proof more territory than other power in world except england yet like england cherished curious conviction that have won really important battle dictated peace upon own term having be wholesomely driven out of france in fifteenth century have captured carried away with a trophy order of white feather with proud motto j ' suis j y reste in eighteenth century have adopted by compulsion from germany alteration in law of regal inheritance have marked adhesion to new formula by institution of order of dachshund with obsequious motto da ist mir ganz wurst popularly mistranslated by wag of day into be worst for beaten by infidel in crusade have joined thenceforth to regalia holy crown of jerusalem having thrown over papacy at time of reformation have added to armorial bearing key of st peter to royal claim title kingship of rome frequent murderous deposition of king have accentuated devotion to monarchic system while solemn confirmation of fresh breach of continuity have stood to reaffirm general belief in hereditary principle in divine providence a controlled by act of parliament only other country in world have acted with such scrupulous inconsistency unrepentant unashamed be england be wonder therefore that in history two country have much in common must have be through sheer inadvertence in view of rival claim to be constitutional pace maker of europe that while have often stood badly in way of other interest have never yet fallen to blow international politics however be not for moment king chief concern turned back from page of europe to study in detail constitutional history of own country power still reserved for king while pursued study many thing new strange presented to gaze there be discovered power of crown still extant though lapsing through gradual desuetude of have never dreamt a to existence of one have made duty to inform of have be in regular practice le than forty year ago be becoming obsolete merely because adviser of crown wished just a house of laity be now falling more more under control of cabinet whose power waxed a other waned so king be in hand of whose interest be to conceal from power possessed came on page where right of royal initiative in council have be thoughtfully underlined by professor discovered with astonishment that whole series of constitutional question lay altogether outside competence of minister to deal with until have be first formally submitted to king under heading found that financial proposal touching on crown land on grant to royal family must become matter of ministerial discussion without consent first given proposal to alter royal line of succession oath taken by king at

of ministerial policy word cried king perceiving for first time how unconstitutionally that word have be set at naught must hardly believe sens here under nose week lese majeste have be rampantly disporting knew nothing of possibly prime minister knew nothing of have not professor said that many of colleague be a ignorant of constitutional history a sovereign knew must know king who few hour before have believed most helpless of emblem mere ornamental topknot to constitutional edifice now found armed with weapon of far reaching precision must enable to carry war into enemy country

made own speech have only be allowed to have within gift of expression though not power of condensing have industry good case now at last behind back unimpeachable authority so at next meeting came down into council stuffed full of fact phrase quite determined that before thing went further ministry must hear constitutional crisis have reached head a soon a parliament again met defiant action of bishop have thrown government program so much into arrears that drastic quickening of pace have become necessary if in spite of scare warning bishop meant to go on doing a have hitherto done be evident that constitutional power must be limited archimandrite free churchman between might supply government with bare working majority that alone must not be sufficient to make legislation fruitful between then next general election unless government after striking blow must come before country bearing sheaf with there be very serious chance that patriotic intention of continuing in power must be frustrated even government busily engaged in marking time to suit own bureaucratic interest must appear to have covered ground mapped out for for reason cabinet minister have be meeting deciding on good many thing behind king back spiritual limitation bill world have since heard of be device have adopted a most suitable to need proposed to bring forward in late winter session on day before council draft of proposed bill reached hand of king majesty on reading after referring once again to certain passage in professor teller book of history smiled gleefully rubbed hand for though have heart of vegetarian be beginning to scent blood rather to enjoy smell of ii council be already standing about board when king entered having bowed to seat formally called on prime minister to read presented draft be done through whole of without word of interruption majesty sat quiet a good a gold polite exposition be about to follow a prime minister essayed enlargement of text flight be stayed gentleman said king be dissatisfied with position turned amazed professor with le amazement than rest for observed a confirmation of suspicion that king hand rested upon bulky pile of manuscript in bill said majesty be proposing to remodel constitution have lasted in unwritten form for five hundred year see in proposed emendation that crown be frequently mentioned power be nowhere defined unless

between bishop laity to day may to morrow be question involving crown also if now mean to impose limit on one branch of legislature must extend definition to cover whole ground require gentleman if matter be to be carried further that own power prerogative will be a accurately defined set a much on working basis a of two chamber 'working basis ' be distinctly good murmured professor teller looked admiringly at king whom prime minister hastened to reassure majesty power said be in way touched at single point of proposal be limitation suggested oh daresay not daresay not replied king though be there in text be between line yes written with invisible ink will be plain enough to read presently what be thinking about be future may be perfectly right a to wisdom of change must have chapter verse for ca treat matter longer a affair of honor used to be now be honor to day be not help impediment have found that out to have lately become question very grave question whether can in honor accept advice of minister intend to leave so disquieting problem for son to solve after there now have king panted little a spoke like dog have begun to feel pace of motor car too much for be sorry that majesty have found reason to complain said prime minister in tone of grieved considerateness be not complaining answered king be only saying what say be let have chapter verse for from beginning to end define power of crown a exist to day a wo exist to morrow unless do proposal will have most sympathetic consideration not otherwise surely question majesty raise interrupted prime minister be entirely separate one doubt must treat so replied king oh yes break stick one at time a wise man did in fable breath of protest blew round council board what must be accusing of next daresay mean went on will be said at future day that did do mean so if what can be objection to having put down in black white be sure have none have got everything written out here ready waiting king fingered manuscript feverishly one very obvious objection interposed prime minister in alarm be that there be demand for in country political situation have arisen matter be not in controversy must pardon said king be in controversy now though country know nothing about position be affected demand be mine be quite impossible majesty said prime minister with brevity be almost brusque must entirely confuse issue in public mind direct think mean in most dangerous inadvisable way dangerous to whom king inquired shrewdly function of crown must not be involved in party politics though party politics be involving function of crown oh yes mr prime minister be use for to shake head contend that without word said bill doe directly undermine power of initiative independence deprive bishop of right to vote on money bill very well that will include royal grant whether special annual maintenance annuity sort of thing at present be fixed by law can not be disturbed without agreement of house be safeguard in future leave bishop out have in hollow of hand oh gentleman need not protest good intention be merely putting case a will stand supposing well socialistic government bent on getting rid of monarchy altogether be to succeed where must be then be what want to consider oh need two stick to beat dog with if mean that let have said done with put in bill if country approves of well if approves of will be very much surprised prime minister rose doe majesty suggest began that such idea king cut short oh know what idea be be idea be bill prime minister sat down again council be looking at with mildly interrogating eye wondering what must do next king have often be voluble before time be reasonably articulate a pile of manuscript indicated have come armed with definite proposal be asking for safeguard said king how do know how do of know at what pace thing may not be moving few year hence be pace kill know yes very important thing pace eye caught friendly glance twinkled at humorously appealed to for support yes professor have anything to say professor rose bowed be only listener majesty said sat down again pace said king again having for moment lost thread of discourse then having clung to anchor to recover breath once more plunged on if royal prerogative still exist said if be to be still free to act upon then want to be told what be to have country told also yes before more of become obsolete at present seems to that anything of kind be obsolete when becomes inconvenient to party in power once more respectfully modulated wave of protest went round board oh yes gentleman have become quite aware from what have recently taken place that unexercised authority if not set down in black white come presently to be questioned a though did not exist if title deed be missing then be no longer on own premise well for future want to be upon mine here come to with bill not single one of have seen fit to advise a to how own position be affected by have have to go to other source find out for myself at word prime minister saw opening also possible explanation of manuscript lay under king hand put on bold front spoke without waiting for royal pause have then to understand inquired that majesty adviser have lost benefit of majesty confidence by mean replied king if be not confiding in now know what confidence be be putting difficulty before asking for advice want to have in hole in corner way bit at time first one then be in council be from whole council want to know how difficulty be to be met when be alone can get anybody to advise go to whomsoever like there be difficulty about that prime minister bristled seemed now to be on track must ask further then said whether upon question of new written constitution majesty have thought fit to consult others be to say who be politically opposing under air of deepest respect charge of unconstitutional usage be clearly conveyed oh mean bishop said king since trouble began have be deprived of consolation of church not single one of have dared to come near except in official capacity though a say have right to consult one prime minister raised eyebrow in order while formally agreeing to make denial visible of course if majesty informs of said will know where be be what be saying persisted king if consult about then know where be know where be there be twenty of here be be first time that have exchanged word on subject be unreasonable to expect to come to with mind made up on thing knew nothing about till yesterday why be only then discovered that for to discus bill among yourselves without having first sought permission bill affecting constitution power of crown be in unconstitutional what on earth did mean minister looked at other aghast there cried king be just a surprised a be be why say must get put into writing did know that be interfering with royal prerogative more did have forgotten to look up history now have done daresay that a historian professor teller will be able to inform whether be right here with flourish king named authority majesty have stated constitutional usage with accuracy acknowledged professor whether usage be decisive remains question there said king triumphantly be what happens if thing be not actually set down in law now see point prime minister brow grew dark think majesty said that be hardly question can discus in council in way be right acknowledged king must not have be discussed here a said just now without permission a have be brought forward do discus have to propose in matter rule out of order will pas on if please to next business king have finished leaned back in chair prime minister collecting authority from eye of colleague stood up spoke think majesty hardly recognizes said that can not legislate on matter a to there be public demand in regard to status of crown political situation have arisen such a must justify majesty adviser in adopting course might seem to indicate lack of confidence under representative government ministry can propose legislation have only theory to recommend if majesty will allow to make representation in private think will be able to show that course propose be only practical one must therefore most respectfully urge that for present point majesty raise may be set aside be a direct challenge of royal will a one minister must well make in presence of others never before have difference of opinion stood out so plainly for immediate decision under eye of whole cabinet king heard understood be crucial moment in exercise of partially recovered authority twenty pair of eye be looking at curiously intent one pair benevolently anxious prime minister be fingering brief ready to go on with interrupted disquisition even looked surreptitiously at watch to indicate time pressed that little touch of covert insolence be sufficient by sort of instinct incalculable value of heredity training position asserted king lip parted in shy nervous smile charmed one mr prime minister said be perfectly willing to meet at future time may like to name took up agenda paper a spoke turned to minister of interior home secretary said majesty will now read report before knew where be council have passed on to accustomed routine iii nobody looked at prime minister face just then for moment have be beaten though person who appeared least aware of be king of course be for moment only when at later hour of day with mind made resolute prime minister sought promised interview monarch be no longer at advantage dialectically must not meet match opponent have no longer that subtle advantage presidency at board of minister confers speaking a man to man head of government did not feel bound to observe tradition of half servile approach in hearing of others fetter mouth of minister jubilee celebration be now over parliamentary vacation approached what before have be mere talk threat must now be put into instant action so when have given king run listened to royal obstinacy in varying phrase of repetition contradiction reproach till reached final stage of blank immobility formally tendered ministry resignation king sat thought for while for now be clear that one way other must make up mind string of red tape have meant to tie with such dilatory cunning hung loose in grasp to cabinet really set on resignation must not apply just a hand have seemed full of power became empty again knew that at present moment other ministry be possible that general election be more likely to accentuate than to solve difficulty so in sober chagrin sat thought prime minister a noticed be so sure of power that did not even trouble to watch process of royal hesitation resolving when after appreciable time king spoke seemed to have arrived nowhere be fifth time said that have offered resignation know that be still unable to accept prime minister bowed head knew very well there be need for word know that be still entirely unconvinced for said minister must take blame since show that advocacy in so strong case have be very imperfect oh not at said king think have shown even more than accustomed ability be compliment if may be permitted can certainly return to majesty have felt very strongly upon matter said king do sir one way other with great question be inevitable admit be great question must never have so troubled majesty be small one king thought shifted what pity be said that minister have never be friend have not loyal service humble duty claim to be so regarded inquired prime minister king let official veneer of fact pas unregarded must have helped thing went on a be when differ from minister be alone be in moment of difficulty like that head of state realizes weakness there again sir do injustice ah be easily said what doe power amount to when be done perhaps at cost of constant friction with minister have be able to delay thing for while given country more time to make up mind then unfortunately be thinking of other thing provided counter attraction what be trying to do in one way be rendering of effect in intended politically have be swamped in ceremony majesty be never more popular than to day observed prime minister that in be power king paused to consider then said if be prepared eventually to give way what time of grace can allow must have bill ready for winter session sir will allow till then if may know what be in majesty mind what be in mind be that country must know what be about bill have not yet be seen by public nothing be known of well be what ask put before country let term of be clearly stated if when come to winter session be still determined that must form part of program then king drew up took breath then will no longer stand in way prime minister bowed low to conceal proud sense of triumph have majesty word for to day be th said king can claim fulfilment of promise in four month time till then till then said king slowly question be not again to come before council hold to point that introduction without express consent be unconstitutional to maintain constitution be bound by oath prime minister yielded point readily seeing in effort of dull obstinacy to score nominal triumph there be however accompanying condition said necessary for success of scheme to must once more refer in order to pas bill will need consecration of at least fifty new bishop nominated by government to that also majesty have hitherto be opposed oh mean free churchman queried king ah yes archimandrite in matter replied prime minister have reason to believe that bishop will eventually give way king felt little more alone yes said daresay will must wonder at then over too may look for majesty consent king repeated former word will not stand in way said again prime minister bowed low have to thank majesty for relieving of great difficulty oh why must have not persuaded in least have merely forced to certain course in still can not pretend that agree will always recognize that majesty have acted on highest motif in opposing in ceasing to oppose will ask to remember said king there will never be misunderstanding on part replied minister applying palm to hand graciously extended a though mere touch have power to heal took leave fateful audience be over for long time after king stood looking at door out of have gone think there have be misunderstanding though said to with slow faint smile think be mine paused perhaps though have better write down exactly what said going to desk made there then careful memorandum of word read over once again smiled be still quite contented with what have done wonder said to what max must say if knew there be great surprise waiting for max well might king wonder what that interesting young man must make of yes be just a well that max must not know anything about beforehand max might run away chapter xi royal commission while king prime minister have thus be giving other shock of somewhat unpleasant character prince max have received far pleasanter one only week after holding of king court lady of dream have written asking for interview letter be not dated from archbishop palace from home of little lay sister be thither that repaired in order to forestall humble yet amazing offer to wait upon in bare conventual parlor with high wall that echoed resoundingly board smelt of soap met once more face to face alone courtesied low addressed formally a sir thanked with due deference for coming otherwise there be change in demeanor flat frilled cap showed within border delicate ripple of hair above fair breastplate of linen face shone with tender warmth like white rose resting upon snow a lip moved in speech re encountered with fervor of delight curious quality of look have ever haunted dream communicativeness not limited to word though remained still whole face spoke to lip eye made music together harmony of two sens in alliance a into morning mist come yet unrisen light hidden singing of bird yet while be saying quite ordinary thing making brief embarrassment of first meeting since relative position have become explained have taken at word sir began when last met asked if must not be useful now can remembrance make grateful said prince perhaps ought not to be so confident went on since idea be only own came from something heard father saying a strongly disapproves of woman taking part in politics be use saying anything to oh politics explanation rather surprised sometimes just now then explained sister jenifer politics do touch social need to detriment acquaintance with politics answered prince be very chimerical added after pause pleased to have found term yes smiled have heard be full of happy idea many of somewhat contradictory have not yet fallen into groove to freedom mean rebellion represent no vested interest be that certificate of character have not finished said be keeping best to last have great position open mind important combination think unusual one so have unusual proposition to make to yes suppose will think so there be brand want plucked from burning royal commission saved from becoming merely official useless what be subject made inclusive gesture slum condition of sweated labor daily material have to work on about have taught that know really nothing said be anxious to learn at least half of commission will be anxious not to learn not to let others then ought to be on woman be on wish to be threw out hand what must be use voice must have weight whose must yours said eyeing full stopped dead wish to go upon commission cried prince max yes in spite of ignorance sitting begin till late autumn between now then must get more actual knowledge brought home made visible to mean than most of who will form majority then think must be of use looked at silent for moment think have mind capable of taking fire when learns fact fact only deaden people said yes be what crush here have such mountain of fact to deal with want fire to come down from mountain consume nodded prophetically know must run away be trying to feel call said little skeptically in truth be of divided mind not because have doubt of ability because temptation to insincerity be so strong must give very opportunity sought through vale of misery beheld way to own promised land be fair that must take advantage of without heart of pity conviction prince of ours rather prided on conscientious scruple will tell from beginning said at last what put thought into mind seem to be getting only by fragment three day ago answered heard father talking with others of projected commission be dissatisfied at church not being sufficiently represented so insufficiently indeed that took a intentional slight part of government policy for depriving bishop of standing be held that further representation be imperative what exclaimed max be to represent bishop then shook head laughing oh answered found one very much better for be really immediate danger be afraid that commission a stand will issue finding of one sided party character that minority report unless obtained chairman signature must have weight main hope therefore be to secure chairman of high standing on whose help can rely be thought that government must not oppose nomination of member of royal family must appeal to popular sentiment subject to majesty assent royal highness duke of nostrum have expressed willingness to serve max have great opinion of collateral of grandfather one least of oh ye heaven exclaimed for what use bone of ancestor why with to direct deliberation commission will run on into next century report be only applicable to last then a took stock of situation be expecting to head minority report instead of inquired be not report be concerned about answered for party care little be majority fear on paper commission look a if meant business church property have be squeezed into one small corner trade interest be very strong be there in concealed way outsider can not recognize for even over public medical department still more in press have now got control can give instance after instance of men known a philanthropist whose rich come from sweated labor whose munificent charity form not one tithe of inhuman profit drained from life of very poorest of great advertiser be to sit on commission press irrespective of party will praise appointment while to defend interest others will be attacked government may be quite ready a temporary expedient to make scapegoat of property owner be not so ready to antagonize trade believe sir on commission real source of evil will never be traced will hear of grinding middleman rack renter nothing dangerous to magnate to trade system unless paused left silence to carry message unless supplemented max one thoroughly indiscreet occupies chair somebody replied whose minority report of one must attract attention deserved think mind sparkled at prospect to be in minority of one have peculiar fascination for yes think may come to said if will honestly open eye then can not promise support of church shook head a though be last thing possible be to be alone tone invited commiseration while brain soared with dream of hashish eater think about three may be with not more said letting down to earth again why be so confident about gentle gray eye met with friendly understanding when found out who be said saw then hesitated saw that have rare gift of doing naturally what one must never expect in what way to begin with in coming here at then did thing imagine prince ever did before did quite easily 'for fun suppose must say well if must do that for fun what might not do when became serious man who doe mind being laughed at position be very rare ah cried max now be giving more credit than deserve set to do ridiculous thing for ridiculous mean in one dressed a be for fashion not for use be aware of nobody be aware of when come here into poor street be so unexpected that nobody recognizes if thought that did must not believe eye in alone there be sense of enlargement liberty who have not to live in position can hardly realize be like holiday felt a though have be let loose so became more can not say be happy while be here why did send away for same reason now ask to come back wanted to be of use independently yet here be dependent upon again have in own hand be position that secures chairmanship be at likely to be accepted from what hear nobody suspect of taking great interest in life of poor have therefore reason to be afraid of see said max a figure head chairman might even be valuable very have doubt part of game royalty trade be supposed to be natural ally remarked sister jenifer max be startled at discernment oh be true cried how wonderful then that must be able to trust at set smiling have advantage to begin with of not knowing who be that gave start finding out gave start certainly have not lost time can not say till have answer there be temporizing here max thought for while then drew breath spoke want quite to understand said that if take up work will be very largely for personal reason daresay will a say 'take fire ' when know more about at present be not so moved commission attract what undertake will do solely on faith faith in be content that must be so for beginning yes very well something else follows will need for guide be always here at certain hour said there be others who know far more than let point go unregarded then may come to for help always if really need need will be a real a can make said max how be to begin named one two book if follow up what read there said will find most of practically demonstrated in district alone for instance have strike on just now among tailor shirt maker men have made woman come out with did not want to woman can exist under condition where men can not go mix with be among for hour attend street corner meeting will hardly hear two idea of practical value will get many be theory be wanted be that life thousand be living must be known realized when eye have seen heart follows really want be brotherhood how be to bring about from be furthest away of said prince max cried be great mistake if king be not very symbol of community then have value left may tell two of most kingly thing ever heard done in present day one be by old king of montenegro smallest of balkan state found that chief gentry be becoming lazy too proud to put hand to labor making idleness class distinction sat down in courtyard of palace began to make shoe went on making daily while held court administered justice so new folly died other inquired prince may seem far fetched in present connection said yet a expression of real kingly instinct have mean year ago heir to english throne one who died young went out to india one day be holding durbar of indian chief with retinue stood drawn up in parade ready to offer homage a passed along rank opposite be great crowd of native watching spectacle at certain point in crowd stood a mere onlooker one whom britain have defeated driven into exile old ameer of afghanistan just before rode down prince heard of have man pointed out to when came there wheeled horse about gave full royal salute through great multitude went thrill because kingly thing have be done have seen tear glistened in eye a spoke be rather dull young man went on so one have be told be better than brain for be touch of human kindness done in grand manner royalty make possible ought to make natural done with pride have place beside humility of st francis well well said max put in touch then will see what can do have grand manner know ii king be considering request of revered uncle duke of nostrum to preside over commission on slum when max came asking also to be made useful what too cried majesty be one of enough quite said max want to be one be qualification willingness said brain capable of taking fire at fact great position open rebellious mind be quoting from authority be given

king said max brain be taking fire angel warned of in dream behold have come true have be seeing thing uncle nostrum wo be pleased remarked king never be said max discontent be prevailing virtue give something to be discontented about then can go down to house justified prime minister have already recommended went on king at least said must not oppose know what will say to do said max care neither do king opened eye a though have be surprised in secret how did max know then mind traveled few month further on yes be quite true did not now care in least what have made up mind to do have released from ministerial terror a contemplated relief in own case thought turned to bright youth over whose head so unlooked for fate be now impending how dramatic must be here be max unbeknownst harnessing to wheel of state pledged unable to run away be just one more turn in toil simple minded man of gentle retiring character be able to wind around scheming life of others by at last daring to be have become power very well will see that be arranged said yes be perhaps time have experience in presiding over over board sort of thing sha last for ever feel like shook head sadly for liked to be sorry for nothing helped more to bear up under trouble of life dear father said max with fondness of tone know that prospect of going for cure always depresses a insist on doing must pay penalty when be taking water so upset digestion deprive of flesh nature meant to wear then think of not talking longer really up doing preparing at last to follow in footstep now in land of jingalo in very heart of social commercial system be going to make history oh think so said king to young man before have much more than begun may have to come out of ca do sort of thing when be in shoe then bade benevolent

effect if turn into socialist therefore will be upon advice a far a politics go matter very little what turn into said sister jenifer what statement exclaimed max be perfectly true said at present what be fighting be ignorance indifference in comparison to that mere theory of government doe matter for nothing be going to succeed while one half of society know care how other half life politician be welcome to theory can find tenable if only will face fact be own politics have have room for only aim be just to get that one half of community to come look with understanding at other half then service know must follow wo until do well be making look said max yet have not be able to make father have never be here have opened church well believe in prayer depends on how define wanted to ask

ruthlessly to practical end set upon charm price hitherto have avoided having to pay a so moralized upon relation of sex sentimental desire grew in to kneel down there then at foot tell how good young man from point of view have always be how bad one from hers for time being resisted that temptation other thing that be not yet sure of must come first for before can allow beloved to think ill of at must first think far better of than deserve then for letting down process there be safe margin left confession becomes luxury with danger involved since to see retrospectively pardoned by heart virginally pure have surely restored to many weary disillusioned sensualist better opinion of than must ever have hoped to refurbish by own effort that oh ye men about town be good woman mission in

utmost discretion to address be taken there believe sir still remains dear dear said king very distressing very unfortunate have hoped be over there be reason sir to doubt that have be properly looked after certificated nurse have be in attendance at time be there danger how much of have got into paper nothing sir a to origin of affair there have be interrogation a to highness present whereabouts

hear from majesty that prince intends coming back into residence have be in communication with secretary have not that gentleman confidence have told nothing well said king at event cause of however much result of indiscretion be quite reputable oh quite commendable even be told that highness showed great dash determination yet whatever have be told there be embarrassment in general manner very well then said king if there be more tittle tattle in press mean might let fact be known surely ought to strike popular imagination be sure police need support can give just now general hesitated must not that tend somewhat to prejudice highness position a impartial head of commission talking to worker before sitting have yet begun have certain air of parti pris of commission fear must not like to tell truth said king very much doubt whether prince will serve upon commission at will probably be called elsewhere comptroller seemed considerably relieved ah that of course entirely remove difficulty be afraid sir thing be in very disturbed state so many people with new idea be airing just now sympathy be being shown for criminal respect for government be not increasing know that prime minister be getting very anxious hope that to morrow may see majesty king did not welcome news during past few month have quite lost remnant of liking that might once have have for head of government when prime minister arrived exchanged usual compliment be glad to see other looking so well after change of air occupation in prime minister case however be already over politician be in harness again to respective department on reopening portfolio have found pack of trouble awaiting nuisance of jingalese politics be that political situation never must keep within bound of ministerial program to day not only have certain voting interest become obstreperous other interest have not vote be obstreperous also in last few month while ruler have be taking well earned rest jingalo have remained agog obstinately progressive on foolish line of own nothing longer seemed content to stay a have be movement have become craze under monarch eye prime minister thumbed note spoke of falling revenue stagnation of trade strike increase of violence police have actually be killed riot leader be on trial presently came to lesser matter sedition said passing in review be now openly preached week in woman war cry why do not suppress inquired king be difficult to do sir without disturbing trade paper be highly offensive seditious have enormous advertising interest at back so like to touch when shop looting began three year ago a form of political propaganda be noticed that firm advertised in woman war cry escaped attention of rioter immediately rush to advertise in page became tremendous especially a further loot be then threatening have now forty page of advertisement can afford in consequence to retain upon staff best journalist critical writer of day war cry printed separately inserted a loose supplement with statement gratis ' stamped across in red ink occupies comparatively small portion of space rest be advertisement high class journalism circulation have gone up by leap bound profit be very considerable if prosecuted might only find in law two portion be wholly distinct independent of other be told that have even different printer failure of crown case must be blow to prestige of government while if succeeded altogether in suppressing must be more unpopular with great middle class trade interest than be already why must try to be popular inquired king government can not exist upon air remarked prime minister after do to deal fairly by interest go to make up prosperity of country mean trade prosperity prime minister did did not like to be stated thus baldly be only wondering went on king what price be prepared to pay for must tolerate sedition seems must also in same interest encourage disease fear that follow majesty argument be merely recalling what prince told for fact just before went abroad have be informed of by social worker who gave chapter verse two year ago medical profession published book exposing fraudulent patent quack medicine occupy so large space in advertising column of newspaper book be put authoritatively upon market a understand be advertised in leading paper when paid for advertisement terminated not single paper must renew contract holder of quack medicine patent have found mean to shut down so far a advertising of be concerned scientific work threatened to diminish profit be why ask what price be prepared to pay for protection of trade interest must like to be assured of truth of statement with respect to majesty before pas comment can write to college of medicine if really wish for fact made very much same query be shown a proof letter from president to one of medical journal even did not induce prime minister to regard matter very seriously after sir said viewed in certain light be only method of trade competition for when sale of patent medicine decrease doubt doctor begin to profit state have thought worth while said king to give to medical profession certificated monopoly be outside province to warn public against charlatan be not charlatan extreme term believe sir that many of patent be quite excellent in first effect stimulant to health in day when beuggestion 'faith healing ' be so much talked of be arguable proposition that drug give to mind body certain preliminary incentive afford best leverage for faith to work on of course there be great many matter need control supervision reform vested interest do tend to create abuse must remind majesty that in pushing of reform government have not be quite free agent in many respect have be greatly hindered that be still crux of political situation ah yes said king do well to remind be take now engaged in educating country term of proposal be before may ask whether anticipation of popular support have proved correct find reason to alter opinion a to necessary solution a to determination to proceed with prime minister be very urbane majesty have be good enough to indicate date when difficulty will be removed be sufficient statement of what be in store thank said king did wish to know have done well at by election beyond inevitable tear wear due to period of office have nothing to complain of have be longer in office than said king smiling rather sadly suppose that in case inevitable wear tear have be proportionately greater will make allowance therefore if have be slow in arriving at conclusion after date agreed upon think will have ground for complaint hope majesty have never regarded a complaint advice have felt bound to offer there be complaint somewhere said king perhaps constitutional one wanted to avoid be quack remedy be rather pleased with at thus rounding off discussion for while reiterating promise have indicated that own opinion be quite a unchanged a of minister so with little time still left in to turn round bethought of duty lay on to set house in order against future event then struck how very important be that max must now settle down eliminate for good certain element from life yes have become quite necessary that max must marry iii max be back again in proper quarter queen have be to pay visit of motherly condolence too be set upon eliminating from life thing ought not to be in finding still rather feeble from blow have fallen on with head still bandaged thought seasonable opportunity to press in way must go be not one of who have taste for probing into young men life have instinctive feeling that line of ethical exploration lay entirely beyond so when approached subject touch be only upon surface max dear said fondly do wish must marry max smiled at with filial indulgence then perceiving that there might be entertainment in conversation well packed with double meaning fell in with suggestion wish must said there be difficulty that understand oh yes think do answered of course with there be always difficulty choice be so limited must rather incline to say that be fixed mean just to two told of must have of perhaps ought to say that be fixed then ca very well see changing oh max say that cried mother alarmed be so very important that must marry people be beginning to expect yes a say there be difficulty religious one be strange news for queen have max conscience then be portent for have not be prepared of course said want to ask question perhaps have better not do want to settle be settled said max be dreadful to hear say so horrible idea that have contracted secret marriage with foreign woman crossed mind be difficulty that did not understand grew timorous afraid that be going to tell something set before moral problem must not possibly solve what if be trying to entrap to lure into taking side with over something no king government must countenance from such danger a conventional femininity gathered in panic stricken bundle fled max dear said must much rather did tell quite agree replied paused searching mind for succor then having found why not see archbishop about urged be sure must remove difficulty max almost jumped out of skin before perceived how guileless have be mother remark opportunity be certainly not to be missed must be delighted to see said indeed think more than one might solve difficulty then will cried mother fondly believed that without becoming entangled have wrought good work provided mean to solution archbishop must of course be able to solve for difficulty of conscience to put such thing a well anything might have done in past in right proper place majesty have great belief in archbishop at hand of one have be confirmed have taken two of to marry by one of four child have be well truly baptized have also preached sermon of eloquent optimism over two who have so prematurely died since regarded that have done for a eminently successful in result stood out in world a most efficient aid to spiritual etcetera of life if moral difficulty dimmed for moment clear horizon of soul must turn to nearest archbishop for advice encouragement so archbishop came to see prince max in

with shouting crowd behind palisade work have be knocked off for day cry of populace lulled down to mere murmur trampling of hoof echoed strangely a passed under vaulted arch along walled in track with huge baulk of timber on side supporting growth of stone wall ahead stood wide gateway opening by sharp turn into regency row whose broad thoroughfare of cream tinted facade now bright with flag formed ideal rallying ground for sightseeing multitude now there said king pointing ahead to high triangular building facing gate through be about to emerge there be place always think bomb might be

window reining jiggetty steed saluted with agitated air rather white face danger be over majesty gasped little out of breath only few horse be down one be killed king nodded acceptance of news a did so noticed tiny fleck of blood upon officer cheek no more than if have cut in shaving seemed to give correct measure of catastrophe to assure more than word must have done that damage be really small except for one moment when have impulsively put head through glass king have kept wit remained calm now royal instinct told right thing to be done if want to manage crowd said have much better drive on until do may think that anything have happened tell to start not to drive fast officer went forward bearing royal order alicia said king there really be nothing to cry about most important thing be to show people that be not hurt pull together dear there now be starting again if think can manage stand right up at window will stand at mine then nobody can have doubt at removed shattered glass from lap a spoke gave encouraging squeeze to hand a coach moved forward stood up confidently presented to public gaze sure enough that sight have magical effect equal to controlling force of thousand police crowd recovered wit allowed to be shoved back into place out through gate sallied piebald pony from end to end regency row broke into roar ahead went troop police pressing back once more amenable crowd men woman be weeping moist handkerchief be ecstatically waved quite new reputable hat be thrown up into air allowed to fall unreclaimed unregarded truly be sight well calculated to stir blood for there emerging unhurt from dust smoke from rumor sound of terror came monarch queen standing upon foot bowing undaunted to furore of cry through vast multitude word of outrage have sped like black raven flapping wing charged ominously with tidings of death a confusion have spread wide nothing more must be heard till once more resumption of processional movement be seen then came white faced footman quaking at knee after eight piebald pony rather badly behaved requiring good deal of holding in then royalty smiling quite unharmed straightway ordinary loyalty of sightseeing jingalese crowd be merged in passionate tumultuous cry of jubilant humanity royal procession became triumphal progress ii queen be still cry little when reached destination be very happy same for felt that between have risen to occasion have passed exceedingly well through ordeal fall only to few now at house of legislature strangely informal reception awaited word of what have happened have gone in to two chamber human nature proving too strong rule regulation of ceremony have be dispensed with out have streamed judge prelate laity in full force to attend upon own front door step belated arrival of mercifully preserved sovereign queen when did arrive whole house of laity there assembled broke into cheer not to be behindhand in demonstration of loyalty judge bishop cheered too thing that none of

giving earthly circumstance due rendered grateful thanks to beneficence have guided directed prime minister did not king in recalling afterwards happy impromptu of scene when prelate laity be vying with other in expression of relief remembered how once twice prime minister have halted gone back to repetition of former phrase like one who having learned lesson have momentarily lost hang of circumstance did not greatly impress at time be ready to make allowance for between minister situation be somewhat embarrassing have parted with unreconciled view by stretch of term must relationship longer be regarded a friendly same on occasion be incumbent upon prime minister to say correct thing have said have described outrage a dastardly attempt immunity of sovereign a happy almost miraculous escape for none have more reason to be thankful than colleague have also said that passionate attachment of people of jingalo to person of ruler have now be made abundantly evident trusted might ever so continue later in day when short ceremony of parliament closing be over for be impossible under circumstance to return to stiff formality one being in mood for later in day again presented besought private audience then while once more repeating what have said previously almost in same word showed that have something very serious of to deliver began with great parade of leaving matter to king decision only duty be merely to state case a must strike world be in majesty hand said have wish to revive discussion in majesty have by right last word have only to ask whether circumstance of last few hour have in way affected majesty decision a usual formal insistence upon majesty aroused king distrust with minister in privacy always disliked said be why must prime minister pursed lip elaborately paused a though finding difficult to express then said after attempted assassination so nearly successful abdication must have different effect to what majesty presumably intended how inquired king though asked already knew mentally jaw dropped a new apparition of failure rose up confronted might seem to reflect upon majesty personal courage about need hardly say have doubt see said king voice sounded depression have again begun to overwhelm have wish to press majesty premier went on at present moment be still under order to morrow definite irrevocable announcement be to be made public again paused king did not answer wish to ask therefore whether be majesty wish that announcement of abdication will be postponed yes said king word came slow suppose that must be a say postponed doe majesty wish to suggest later date king thought for while before answering be there reason must though thus spoke to temporize over position in now found

to present address of loyal congratulation immediately on reassembling of parliament that under new circumstance must take place almost at once in event address will of course have to be moved if have happened to day be followed by abdication then regret deep gratitude for gracious benefit of past must have to be added whole form of most carefully weighed considered may say therefore that be even now awaiting majesty instruction can hing till decide nothing practical sir eye met with lurking watchfulness be not difficult for to read something of other thought king knew behind aspect of deference humility lay sense of triumph almost malignant in intensity knew that circumstance have beaten that bomb of wretched assassin have made abdication impossible prime minister have said that have wish to press what pretense hypocrisy be when very night cabinet must have to meet register decision in one of two alternative form totally distinct yes ministry have now in cleft stick pressure be to be put upon only because there be possibility for decision to be delayed defeat following upon terrific event of day filled brain with weariness at moment when have hoped to be free of persecutor have come once again to blank wall further progress be barred further thinking have become useless event must take course once more felt sport of fate mere chip floating with stream very well mr prime minister said with resignation abdication be withdrawn sighed deeply then when left alone to cogitation for such weak comfort a mere saving of face must lend thought occurred to what good thing told nobody about even max did not know so in year of jubilee plenitude of popularity john of jingalo continued to reign be in consequence most saddened humiliated monarch who ever bowed head under crown resigned freedom to mixed sense of duty fear of what people might say chapter xvi concealment discovery there be plenty of hue cry to discover perpetrator of outrage nothing came of from somewhere in labyrinth of unfinished building scaffolding fenced in by high hoarding bomb have be thrown of insufficient power to do much damage to anybody prefect of police riding in close attendance on royal carriage have vaulted barrier on side whence have seemed to come reported that have found no trace of one piece of shell have be collected upon spot have not flown very far be much broken expert of detective department have be busy putting together bit whole performance turned out on investigation to have be so feeble amateurish that suspicion rapidly descended from more experienced practitioner of anarchy imported from other country to home product of later growth striker made desperate savage by recent sentence upon leader a must have woman chartist hoping by attack upon royalty to bring neglectful ministry to sens a there be real clue except industriously led nowhere police seemed delightedly to follow everybody be free to lay charge against agitating section of community happened to regard with special disfavor for reason woman chartist did in fact get most of blame in process also reaped certain advantage mere suspicion though malice directed be good for have be possible to convict cause must have gone down for generation there be really nothing to catch hold of power of organization to commit outrage without being detected to break glass of king coach make eight piebald pony rise up on end in horror be power raised greatly in eye of law abiding people suggested unknown potency for mischief far more ominous than have discovery conviction followed so while squib cracker be being thrown at sham bomb hurled into meeting to show how greatly law abiding people of jingalo disapproved of for incurring such suspicion politically unjustly suspected one moved little nearer to goal a for king queen be simply inundated with telegram letter of congratulation in many instance loyalty shown be extraordinarily touching one instance will suffice schoolboy in public school in jingalo contributed penny from pocket money to congratulatory telegram sent in name of school when a sometimes happened school numbered over six hundred boy telegram have necessarily to be lengthy proved severe tax upon literary ability of sender amid influx passionate outpouring of loyalty to king who have stood only few day before within ace of abdication there be of course message of more intimate personal kind crowned head in europe have written with fellow feeling on such occasion royalty be bound to express know what be like wrote one who have have six attempt made on have never have done to from behind how very devastating to nerve must be prince of schnapps wasser wired that must find language to express hoped in few week time to come show that felt max after brief wire have flown back to town obvious perturbation demonstrative affection have made happy meeting while message flowed there be one inexplicable silence charlotte wrote telegraphed did return home portent dawned upon majesty a breakfasted late next morning with correspondence telegram piled up beside what can have become of charlotte cried queen must know if knew must be here said king confident in daughter affection stared at other in surmise turned gradually to dismay unfilial silence upon escape from bomb of assassin told with staggering certainty that charlotte be missing have run away cried queen must be somewhere objected king wherever be must surely have heard news may be quite out in country suggested queen picking up hope still have friend who must know where have gone be incredible cried majesty heartless call simply doe know said king of that be quite certain be sure to hear from in course of day continued reassuringly meanwhile will have to make inquiry day went on sign from charlotte did inquiry bring definite news up to date have arrived with expectant hostess on day appointed after staying only one night have gone elsewhere from point in place time trace of be to be found before day be over king queen have become terribly anxious by end of week be almost at wit end here get yet instance of drawback danger attend upon royalty have charlotte belonged to ordinary rank of life must have be announced that be missing description must have be issued to press search for made reasonably effective a thing be must not be done charlotte be impulsive did indiscreet thing until one knew exactly what portended to publish disappearance to world must have be too rash sudden proceeding once be done there must be hushing up of matter jingalo nay europe must have to hear of including of course prince of schnapps wasser so at cost of private strain anxiety be necessary to conceal a long a possible that princess be not where ought to be be perhaps where ought not to be now please let reader at point think that be charlotte who have thrown bomb even for sake of literary effect must not for one moment deceive be not charlotte charlotte have nothing to do with did not even know of yet will give for while small problem to grapple with charlotte be quite well be in possession of sens be thoroughly enjoying be not outside land of inheritance most emphatically have not run away there for moment will leave matter attend to thing more important ii king have caught sight in newspaper of something annoyed very much annoyed more because seemed to betoken that moment abdication be withdrawn old ministerial encroachment on royal prerogative have begun again be officially informed so ran paragraph that minister of interior have advised majesty to grant reprieve to three strike leader now lying under sentence of death for part in recent riot police murder be understood that sentence will be commuted to penal servitude for life be first king have heard of sent at once for home minister within hour great official stood before mr secretary said king sharply a laid offending paragraph before since when may ask have crown prerogative of mercy become perquisite of home office think sir submitted secretary with outward humility that such change have come about in case circumstance be special very urgent why then be not consulted there be hardly time majesty be here apprehended that recent event so very upsetting to majesty come come interjected king if be able to read speech immediately after a did be quite able to attend to other business a well ought to have known king did not thus usually speak to one of minister having just have to face so heavy defeat of plan for honorable retirement be more bent on asserting majesty will pardon have to be issued to press without moment delay have received information made matter of great urgency will hear explanation said king coldly secretary went on be doubtless aware sir about sentence there have be very considerable agitation among worker utter failure of strike have not improved matter be aware of said king have always be intention a soon a march of striker have be dispersed in orderly manner to recommend exercise of royal clemency be in fact merely matter of hour when circumstance forestalled session closed before of strike marcher must arrive upon scene then came event diverted popular attention be for reason presume that only yesterday certain of men leader made very inflammatory speech of kind must be extremely difficult for authority to overlook make appearance of yielding to one speech in particular calling upon hangman to refuse to perform duty threatening life if did so be of peculiarly seditious character for need hardly point out that if functionary be not protected in fulfilment of official duty downfall of law order have begun be absolutely necessary therefore to forestall report of speech in metropolitan press for few hour be able to keep back news majesty clemency be announced in late issue of evening paper ' hang ' speech be not reported till morning thus coming after event have fallen comparatively flat think that now majesty will understand position secretary have finished be explanation queried king minister bowed have to say that doe not satisfy minister lifted sad eyebrow did not speak tell that for many day recommendation of mercy have be fixed intention why then did not consult why did assume at moment notice must be able to fall in with suggestion why even must think dispersal of certain riotous assembly convenient signal for exercise of royal prerogative have merely followed sir ordinary course of procedure observed in department until being unexpectedly pressed for time departed from after telephone be between be here might not have agreed at least must have be consulted minister pursed lip to sort of hectoring have really nothing to say did not comport with official dignity king rose mr secretary a have already said explanation doe not satisfy will communicate sentiment to prime minister majesty did not extend hand by motion of head showed that interview be over there be nothing left for minister of interior to do retire from room next day retired from office for though prime minister urged many thing in defense more particularly misapprehension present retirement might cause king remained obdurate be bent upon making example in great political game have miscalculated lamentably failed red tape be still cherished possession can do good deal with red tape when have unquestioned authority to fall back upon professor teller volume of constitutional history still lay upon retired shelf in royal library indeed be from one of that have extracted with slight change formal pronouncement of abdication if must not get anything else out of minister be determined to secure official correctness though slighted opinion must recognize authority punctiliousness at least must render a one remaining due so when prime minister urged how small accidental be omission majesty remarked that be one of many when argued how delay might have proved dangerous point at delay have begun be again icily indicated more pressingly still did invite king to consider in what light if unexplained resignation must be popularly regarded must not be taken a admission of blame by head of home department for occurrence of late outrage very likely assented king after took place on government premise whereat prime minister looking somewhat startled distressed inquired whether such imputation of blame have be majesty ulterior motive for present action have motif left said king wearily be merely doing duty in aspect be proving very difficult person to deal with be not arguing be only telling be attitude put in much stronger position with intellectual superior than attempt at converting to view from day on stood forth to minister a rigid constitutional reminder with six volume of minutia of constitutional usage at finger end amount of time be able to waste amount of trouble be able to give be simply amazing prime minister have be quite right resignation of home secretary caused just that flutter of unfavorable suspicion have expected for reason be extremely distressed by begged from majesty grant of full state pension to retired minister king must not hear of be not duty said to grant full pension to who fail in official obligation where be more personally concerned have not pressed have not asked for resignation of prefect of police though think might have reason to show for prevented nothing have discovered nothing do expect to open parliament for again next week with same ceremony along same route at same risk be assured that precaution must be taken hope so said in tone of one who very much doubted whether ministerial word be now worth anything under harassing unhandsome treatment prime minister be beginning to show age coming session gave promise that care in other respect must be le heavy than before woman chartist be threatening bigger outbreak in near future labor be now claiming to be freely supported from rate when out of work when on strike when address to throne be being moved labor woman chartist must be in renewed agitation asking for thing must make party politics quite impossible be therefore quite impossible for party politics to grant if government have not still got that thoroughly unpopular house of bishop to sit upon coerce thing must be looking very black indeed iii meanwhile where be princess charlotte seven horrible day have gone by inner circle of detective force have be running about in padded slipper so to speak giving accurate description of lady whose name nobody knew who have be last seen in vicinity of college for woman very privately confidentially titled lady who be head of institution have be interviewed information be limited came to only for one day said principal though thought be intending to stay week hardly know when missed have laid down so very emphatically that be to be left free treated without ceremony really did not trouble to look after whenever be here highness always mixed quite freely with student know that with of have made friend be far more likely to know what plan be than be further inquiry in direction thus indicated have to be carried on elsewhere since student have now separated for vacation wherever inquiry be made same stealthy secrecy have to be adopted nobody must be allowed to suppose that princess royal of jingalo be missing so on sort of four not at conducive to speed quest went on on fifth day however relief have arrived to reduce parental anxiety to bearable proportion letter dropped from nowhere bearing metropolitan postmark came to king hand gave only barest yet very essential information dearest papa ran be quite well enjoying will be back in fortnight news of arrival of letter be immediately conveyed to constabulary chief after three day of deep cogitation absence of reference to outrage to risk run by near dear to seemed to strike a peculiar supplied with what hitherto police have lacked clue after two more day of strenuously directed search bore fruit late one afternoon king be sitting at work in study when comptroller general entered hastily in evident excitement for though king be then busily engaged in writing presumed to interrupt not waiting for royal interrogating glance to give permission beg pardon sir said in tone of very urgent apology well well said king rather testily for did not like writing hour to be thus disturbed what be prime minister wish to see sir on matter of extreme urgency king have so long be pestered by minister on matter considered urgent did not that have little patience for such plea coming at wrong time what about inquired curtly comptroller general who be supposed not to know replied discreetly in tone of veiled meaning something in home department believe sir just now while there be chief secretary prime minister be seeing to matter dear dear sighed majesty do wish must manage to get urgent business done at proper time think sir said general that matter be one of sufficient importance to justify suspension of ordinary rule paused a though about to say more thought better of after matter did not lie within department very well said king let come in then in due course premier entered be evident at glance that be bearer of important nay even alarming intelligence eye be startled anxious manner full of discomposure without waste of moment opened abruptly upon business have brought have come to inform majesty said that have at last discovered princess charlotte whereabouts oh said king excluding from tone indication of gratitude over too long delayed discovery pray where be regret to say sir that royal highness be at moment in stonewall jail good heaven exclaimed king startled out of coldness took there be taken sir in beolly hold ' along with several others have be there for last ten day footnote jingalese equivalent for black maria yes yes what want to know be what have be doing in

evidence assaulting police exclaimed king petulantly what else be police there for when there be trouble mean how many of did assault pray believe only one sir replied prime minister at least only one of gave evidence against there be five witness to say that did not assault magistrate who convicted however accepted constable evidence be believe rather hard of hearing be told that thought witness in favor be giving evidence against if be so sufficiently account for conviction on other hand there can be doubt that princess did intend to get arrested when did take place in course of last chartist disturbance three day before rising of parliament sixty seventy woman then caused to be arrested seems that princess be one of must be mad exclaimed king in bewilderment whatever must have induced be majesty aware that have leaning towards politics have idea said king like other young people be generally very busy changing beyond notion that woman ought always to have own way never be asked to do what doe want to do then began to dawn upon though only darkly what charlotte be really after be demonstrating madly extravagantly claim to personal freedom to prove how much meant have gone to wild length well might father in essentially middle aged mind wonder what younger generation be coming to poor dear silly child exclaimed in fond irritation why ever must not have waited be question prime minister must not answer well well went on endeavoring to be philosophical over business have have lesson now after there be real harm done majesty must pardon have become very serious matter said prime minister gravely why who know anything about who need know be sentenced in own name suppose certainly not sir have be recognized thing must never have happened must to extent have altered dress appearance a to have particular name actually went in under be ann juggins preposterous exclaimed king supposing be to come out be trouble sir without full immediate exercise of

in street government must become impossible king did best to conceal delight at predicament in charlotte escapade have by confession of chief placed cabinet tyrannical government in spite of large majority strong party organization bureaucratic power be unable to stand up against ridicule mere breath false pretension to dignity must be exposed dry bone speciously clad in strong armor must rattle down into dust if chose to use knowledge suddenly gained what power must give yes have only to send for charlotte bid cry 'juggins that with so many month of anxious toil with threat of abdication have failed to bring about must immediately accomplish in other way unfortunately king be man of scrupulous conscience be bound by idea of what became monarch gentleman may have be quite mistaken in regarding a unclean weapon with heaven have supplied a did so regard must reluctantly admit that be right to throw aside well said when prime minister have finished must be made not to tell be fear sir be very determined determined to do what to serve out sentence king sat thought for while knew charlotte better than police did besides during past week have quite made up mind that prefect of police be in matter blunderer wonder how tried to get out meditated aloud did send message nothing direct sir know of take that ultimatum be also directed against possible action on part of majesty be quite determined to do full time said indeed that have promised fortnight what may mean know really cried king folly of official mind be past believing especially when concentrate in police

awkward meeting iv when first transport of joy at reunion be over have to settle down to naughty fact talk with serious disapproval to charlotte of past doings a did so though still wept little princess observed with secret satisfaction that have at rate cured mother of one thing of knitting namely while daughter fate be being dangled in parental balance from day on when charlotte showed that be really in queen put down knitting who have lived under certain domestic condition where tyranny be always a though by divine right benevolent wise self confident satisfied to verge of conceit

though own naughty doings be of further interest cried now tell about bomb queen who still liked to dwell upon episode of sight sound sensation strangely mingled triumphantly concluded by popular ovation such a have never met with in life before started off at once on detailed narrative corrected now then by king more sober commentary aided by eager question of daughter who sat in close fond contact with of mopping eye alternately with mother handkerchief own oh why be there cried incautiously when word came of great popular reception crowning ah why be inquired king waggishly when have

remedying of abuse be still own chapter xvii incredible thing happens since break up of plan king have be finding consolation in son book advance copy of have reached while max be still abroad consolation be perhaps hardly right word have distracted in more way than one partly in good sense from own personal depression over thing gone wrong more with scared apprehension of terrible hubbub must arise when content became known title government governed be sober enough post diluvian motto once threatened by max have be omitted content be of highly revolutionary character bland take leave attitude of author toward public must day be called upon to rule be on par with statement of prison doings charlotte be preparing for delectation of han fritz otto prince of schnapps wasser in case did seem likely that confession must draw party together so before king have even finished reading felt duty to write imploring son not to publish before answer must reach important event supervened reverberation of bomb brought max flying back to bosom of family then charlotte episode have followed over max have not be at sympathetic for in spite of emancipated view about thing in general have still particular notion that revolution belonged only to men woman incapable of conducting efficiently have far better leave alone so be that only when thing have begun to resettle be fresh reference made to book forthcoming publication a soon a subject be broached max presented face of polite astonishment thought knew sir said knew what most important event in recent history even thought might have instigated know what be talking about then must break news book have be burned to ground spoke a though have be edifice be told for consolation that burned extremely well 'fiercely ' paper said gave fireman lot of trouble letter news reached almost simultaneously knew therefore that must be glad say ' protested king in way be sorry even only wanted to be anonymous one can do thing anonymously how did come about be work of incendiary how do know that there be absolute proof something refused to burn box of match made in jingalo other fire resistant of similar kind perpetrator got off yes house of ganz wurst certainly seems at present moment particularly to attract attention of obscurantist in politics who know whether hand threw bomb at have not already be dipped in petrol have given so flaming account of claim to authorship what be going to do about reprint suppose a soon a can afford do still wish not to hold almost only copy be left king shook head a told max think publication must be very unwise must be sure to regret afterwards remember that day will come to throne what think can do now ca do then at once becomes impossible then king gave queer consternated gasp for remembered something something have conditionally promised believing that condition must never be fulfilled now fate have brought about if max so willed thing must presently be taking place much more disturbing to institution of royalty than publication of mere book to king last remark max merely replied at present sir be who be upon throne not circumstance over have very particular reason for being glad now sir something have just occurred to think that be going to anticipate date fixed be not till next week when be settled a so soon will be if remain of sane mind then will present preserved copy of book to lady whom so disapprove of will do with exactly a wish order new edition put on fire to help make soup for poor be little device of mine sir for bringing into good grace for if know anything of mind will maintain that to publish book without full intention of putting principle into practice be mere parade of insincerity foolishness so from point of view will be saving monarchy from danger one else can avert for be not prepared to surrender power to do mischief into hand hers copy of book may be interested to hear have already gone to silence about warns that epoch so strenuously make for be not one desire be still talking like book max said king sarcastically wishing to divert discussion for time being from be referring to ah yes said max a bird who mourns mate why for while must not indulge grief will never write have in to say be said there in future though may hear in voice echo of lost romance be going to be man not of word of deed king smiled look incredulous sir have already startled that commission put on compelled to include in scope of inquiry thing did not want to inquire into at believe sir if get before evidence that intend will find forced into making very unpopular report far more unpopular than book must have be far more subversive of established order of thing than at present can have idea even coat sir exorbitant though price now be be going to cost more a result of commission unless can so arrange that in future little le will be paid for 'cut little more for needle thread that join cutting together be going to have said in report of ours for have discovered to be fact that very clothes be daily wear mine be put together by men woman paid at something le than twopence half penny hour be going to get put in scandalously personal way clothes mine clothes go to open parliament in set fashion in when have worn half dozen time hand on to charity be going to have thus put that may be conscious ashamed when

doe not like to have thing brought home to royalty beocial evil ' be in way to be connected with other lest must be seen that help to make way easy only other day be credibly informed that man who headed with twenty thousand pound list of charity bearing mother name have be allowed by police to get out of country scot free though guilty of infamous conduct merely because contribution of tainted donation to royal fund must not have 'looked well oh stop talking to max cried king made irritable by increased sense of helplessness go do what like say what like report what like have got commission to play with run for be worth for heaven sake let have peace for while why must trouble know that can hing have done great deal said max whose admiration for father have grown very considerably during past year have missed doing great deal of that know nothing be not going to tell then must stand more do imagine must have made that idiotic promise cried if have supposed for moment must still be here when came to claim so saying got up diplomatic in retreat hurried out of room max left to own surmisings opened wide wondering eye did throw that bomb at murmured in astonishment look very much a if did ii parliament opened again without difficulty in middle of december enormous popularity of king queen be greatly enhanced by circumstance of reappearance within so short time for occasion so closely similar only bomb must have increased favorable impression made upon populace by affable return to charge if slow walking pace may be so described within three week of attempted outrage a prime minister have promised police spared pain to insure safety behind hoarding of new government office detective be packed like herring in barrel with special eye hole bored through so that might note actual passing of royal carriage have well under observation at point of danger be presumably that at last explosion have occurred then whole police force held breath coach got past without difficulty immediately waiting multitude in regency row became violently demonstrative a though great acrobatic feat have be achieved piebald pony came stepping like rope dancer held by groom everything except fresh bomb for so many stage preparation have be made went off with success imaginable king did not read own speech have sore throat for occasion only with ear did swallow bitter pill of foreshadowed scheme have so long vainly resisted for now be bound by own promise must no longer stand in way so by mouth of lord high commissioner bishop heard under smooth sounding title plan for approaching doom read out from step of throne a soon a king queen have retired budding member on ministerial side in house rose up to congratulate cabinet country on wise statesmanlike proposal hardened veteran upon other archbishop included rose up to condemn after for three four day general wrangling leading to nothing went on while parliament talked vacuously within outside came rumbling of storm discontent of certain section of community with condition unsettled unattended to be gathering to head on third day after session have opened charlotte said to father with rather tragic look papa do know what be going to happen to night then told be woman chartist again king have be true to word have made inquiry in way have even looked into matter have received from right official quarter bland assurance that there be nothing in merely general obstreperousness wish to cause trouble to police conscience so often ran away with be still troubled so when evening came sent once again for newly appointed home minister in reply to rather anxious question be given confidently to understand that police arrangement be quite adequate for occasion that everything must be done a quietly a leniently a possible that edge of disturbance must in case be allowed to overflow in direction of royal palace a listened to cocksure tone of new minister almost patronizing air with exposed official fitness for post so recently conferred on king ceased to ask question let man talk out then when silence seemed to give consent got rid of be now time that must go to dress for dinner motive force be absent stood for while considering then went to window opening let in distant hum of city traffic sounded a usual pleasant busy peaceable yet if what daughter told be true within hour quietly sounding street must be thronged with thousand upon thousand waiting for arrival of woman to claim old historical right of petition serried line of police thousand of also must be standing to bar way direction might go in quest of governing authority in hand of woman must be petition personally addressed to yet never have minister put to question whether must be willing to receive hear what have to say such idea seemed not to have entered head be fear lest reception might give cause too great importance in public eye here once again then proof met of conspiracy of modern government constantly going on to bring about disconnection between crown real life need aspiration of people suffocating tradition closed round making cypher of to scorn derision monster unto many just a much by denial of petition breaker of crown oath a who in past have paid penalty for with life there outside in nipping wintry air must hear sound of liberty no longer shared trotting of cab horse cry of whiffle hoot

in direction of small postern concealed in shrubbery a quitted grass sound of own footfall upon firm gravel made guiltily afraid be not without moral effort that king in own domain kept from stepping back secretively to turfed edge suppressing inclination proceeded at smart pace coming presently to door with slip latch on inner side opened passed through at sound of opening policeman stationed outside turned stood passively regarding muffled appearance seemed sufficiently in keeping with us to particular exit be put by others to awaken suspicion surprise with half waggish air of respect man touched helmet good evening sir said a though there subsisted between habitue of door sort of understanding to make quicker escape from man scrutiny glare of lamp commanding entrance king crossed road took up course along more dimly lighted footway on further side at hour park row in found be almost deserted now again single pedestrian went by a received from none of more than cursory inattentive

to think about be use going to bed for knew that must not sleep last few hour have be most wonderful most crowded yes quite literally most crowded that have ever experienced at last have really taken part in life of people have come into direct contact with thing very diverse contradictory representing popular will have talked with street urchin visionary have rubbed shoulder with men of brutal habit vile character with knave coward fool have be shut up with drunkard pickpocket policeman thumb have left bruise upon arm mind be one great bruise from bureaucratic police system have fast within grip now at last knew that knew nothing for only now did realize to what be going on outside ear have be stopped with official lie morally intellectually physically be prisoner just a much a when to cry of old goggles from jeering crowd have marched captive to police station knew now that even private life be watched spied on always of course with most benevolent intention be price paid for modern kingship what be worth out of pocket drew small sheet of crumpled paper in order to get to poor timid woman have gone out into raging crowd have borne brutality for hour then piteous bundle of broken nerve have by sheer accident accomplished that hundred of others braver abler more confident more deserving have tried to do failed morally small slip of paper have upon blood tear sweat agony despair of rest only by accident have ever come to know of here almost within stone throw of palace have seen something taking place to morrow paper must deride of official world must deny cognizance whether woman have truly grievance just reasonable cause for complaint did not know knew now that with most desperate earnestness conviction be belief that in getting petition to hand saw beginning of remedy spread out paper before for first time read word humbly showeth that by majesty minister law justice be delayed prayeth gracious majesty will so order govern that faithful subject grievance may forthwith be sought inquired into remedy granted thereto by act of parliament petitioner will ever pray be what grievance might be be not stated knew that to hear argument for against given case be outside function of crown knew equally well that to order inquiry to be made lay still within right though minister in cabinet except one must seek to deny to so sat looking at crumpled sheet meant so much to so many thousand of life slowly night went by long before first chitter of awakening bird before first hint of light have crept into east heard outside slow stir of city life breaking back from short uneasy slumber with stiffened limb got up from chair for room have grown cold body ached with strain exertion have so recently undergone slowly moved off towards own sleeping apartment in case queen when awoke must send to inquire after on way a short cut crossed minstrel gallery divided one from other two state drawing room broad half story colonnade with central opening corner draped into shade halfway across elevation paused to look down into vast chamber below at point among chandelier burned small pinhole of light revealed in strange dimness various form of furniture showing monstrous uncouth in night attire night gown rather than pajama seemed general wear only few leg be to be seen in sleeping aspect place be certainly more harmonious more chaste than by day mirror picture loomed from white wall with mystery must disappear when luster contained light king lingered to take in pleasant strangeness of to wonder what be new quality so attracted a did so ear caught from without faint reverberation of muffled sound even regular in beat drew near at far end door be thrown open flush of light entered chamber there came following troop of men wearing felt slipper long linen apron bearing upon shoulder broom feather head wash leather brush duster step vacuum cleaner other mysterious instrument of uninterpretable form with regularity precision of drilled army with word spoken moved forward to attack curtain be drawn cord pulled blind raised step mounted luster jingled to touch of feather cornice shed down minute particle of dust to charybdian maw of traveling gramophone over carpet metallic cow catcher wheezed groaned with loud trundling of wheel departed processionally to chamber beyond then by triple process simultaneously conducted furniture sheet be lifted drawn off folded large wicker table on wheel received bore away cloud of light skirmisher followed after over cushion seat polished surface plied manicurist skill then storming party escaladed gallery from below king to avoid embarrassment of encounter with body of servitor who have not pleasure of acquaintance be at last obliged to retire what wonderful machine have be here revealed to gaze manipulated without word marshaled by sign composed entirely of stranger to think that insect like marvel of industry so expeditious done on so huge scale have be going on daily under own roof have known nothing of so be how palace be cleaned for why never showed sign of wear mark of muddy boot yet never before have thought on matter occurred to what if fine day insect fired by revolutionary zeal have taken to heart to rise up in dozen by escalading ladder to first story rush private apartment murder in morning bath in bed what surprising unexplained apparition must have be now for future must know that daily about time large ant like colony be running about under very strong of arm very active of leg what protection wondered from peril of sudden inroad be that search under bed on ninth day of november did that really meet counter modern method of conspiracy assassination growing danger of labor unrest very much doubted so with head very full of wonder order underlying disturbance of passed on to own inner chamber have now something to tell queen a to how immediate domestic affair be conducted must entirely put aside awkward question a to what have be doing evening before where have spent night a matter of fact sleek officialdom have sheltered queen from anxiety have not notion that king have be anywhere except to consultation with minister thence late to bed in order that valet might find there got into when couple of hour later greeted majesty found that sanguine mind looking eagerly ahead concerning very little over thing be past remember dear said looking up from letter that in three day time prince of schnapps wasser come do hope while be here that will be fairly free not so free a thought must be said king sighed heavily iii majesty have good many thing day to discus with prime minister when at later hour met began on matter be most regular formal have be at likely to forget queen observation must have reminded by way mr premier said a already know prince of schnapps wasser arrives in day two there be certain possible eventuality arising out of visit must be prepared for hitherto princess charlotte have have definite grant made to while be still living with without establishment of own preferred to let matter stand over now well now change may be necessary prime minister face beamed with congratulatory smile majesty may be sure that matter will have immediate attention there will be difficulty oh none will leave question of amount to be discussed later believe that be etiquette in case of reigning prince for also to be consulted be so sir prince be very wealthy think that will find disinterested still there be of course certain balance to be observed oh quite leave matter then entirely in hand prime minister bowed then conversation changed know what happened to last night suppose said king ah yes indeed sir will pardon silence be most horrified thought that perhaps majesty did not wish to speak of on contrary replied king have got great deal to say then with much detail particularity narrated experience hour have spent in crowd prime minister listened saying nothing well said king when have done be what have seen can not tell be something doe not matter by mean sir admit that be very serious be never told so before did not wish unnecessarily to trouble majesty be hardly case for cabinet intervention home office doe duty take preventive measure a far a be possible put down disturbance when arise yes yes said king be nothing going to be done prime minister raised eyebrow a though asked to reply once more to question already answered everything possible be being done sir legislatively mean oh sir exclaimed head of government in tone of most deferential protest that surely be matter for cabinet quite so said king be why ask so then premier explained circumstantially at great length why in sense nothing must be done need not go into here who read jingalese history will find prime minister reason published elsewhere really came only to be duty of government to keep in power if can not do justice without endangering party majority then justice can not be done must not have more satisfactory more logical more unanswerable argument than at event whether agree with not be argument that minister act upon now day even when in house of legislature sits subservient to will there be majority ready waiting think differently of matter fear to act lest must lose touch with loaf fish for now be on life not of parliament of cabinet loss be counted reason be plain for member of cabinet have to think of saving for l year together with enormous amount of departmental power patronage while ordinary private member of parliament have only few hundred to think about rapidly diminishing right to independence at life death struggle of ministry be bound therefore to be more desperate more unscrupulous more pecuniarily corrupt than of other branch of legislature of course when put leading string into finger so buttered with gold political corruption be necessary inevitable result such incidental thing a mere justice must wait prime minister did not explain matter to king in such plain understandable term a a consequence explanation being incomplete majesty mind remained unsatisfied very well said when ministerial apologia be concluded will consider what say when have quite made up mind will send message to council with recommendation still have right under constitution prime minister stiffened here be conflict in council cropping up again must be put down right sir said have not be exercised for nearly hundred year beg pardon said king exercised only two month ago when sent in message of abdication majesty have be wise enough not to act upon nevertheless be forced to accept must have have to give effect to ultimately by act of parliament be true by way went on king arising out of withdrawal of abdication say be so wise there have come difficulty have not foreseen believing that by now son must be upon throne instead of gave consent to marriage with daughter of archbishop yes mr premier may well start be just a much perturbed about a for prince now come to claim fulfilment of promise impossible sir exclaimed prime minister be what tell doe not think so majesty be absolutely unheard of whole position must be intolerable indorse adjective statement said king coldly fact remains then sir must see prince immediately be use use replied majesty besides matter be still rather at private stage have much better wait till prince come to otherwise may accuse of having be premature what doe archbishop say cried premier aghast be point believe doe not yet know technically speaking engagement be scarcely day old prince note claiming promise reached only morning imagine be only now that archbishop will have to be informed matter have be in suspension will understand be dependent on abdication might say in case sir condition be not fulfilled fear be said king prince have promise in writing abdication be not mentioned see be bomb made difference very provoking that must have happened just then upset plan prime minister began to look very uncomfortable oh went on king observing change of countenance think that be blaming what said be quite true abdication after became impossible be only saying a excuse for position in now find be not who made mistake be that poor misguided person who threw bomb ought to have killed be confident have prince be actually on throne situation must have be radically altered that must not have persisted that must have seen a say how impossible position must be very unfortunate very there be again say sir even now though prince be not on throne long may majesty be spared whole thing be absolutely utterly impossible quite agree said king be situation before now have found in similar one have tried to get out of yet have seldom succeeded sir persisted prime minister be politically impossible thing must not go on yet mr premier know that will have to be very essence of politics tell majesty that rather than admit such possibility ministry must resign very well then must said king will find that prince will not regard inability to secure alternative government a reason why must not marry lady of choice may a well tell for information that have revolutionary idea be one of be confident exclaimed prime minister with gleam of hope that archbishop will forbid very likely replied majesty be not sure that will succeed wish must from hear lady be of rather determined character woman be very determined now day thought of charlotte sighed yet in heart must not help admiring envying will talk of again other time went on tired of profitless discussion after marriage be not going to take place day after to morrow sir said premier over matter of sort delay be impossible risk be too great must see prince very well said king do a like after ought to be glad that be with prince will have to discus matter not with smiled to for very much liked thought of prime minister tackling max chapter xix spiritual power prime minister though lost time be unable to catch quarry prince max have gone out secretary must give information a to whereabouts highness told that have very important engagement did not say with whom to apprehensive ear phrase sounded ominous fearing what risk delay might entail premier drove down to sheepcote precinct archiepiscopal residence there for three mortal hour archbishop sat with head together yet intellectually very much apart discussing what be to be done be during three hour that grace of ebury performed most brilliant feat of statesmanship redeemed that local off shoot of church of christ over ruled from political slough whereinto have fallen to solely by mean of daughter be to say in politics woman count be due fact that church of jingalo still stand on old established footing that bishop have decisive modicum of political power left to archbishop be in heart of heart that last infirmity of noble mind quite a much horrified at news a premier have be scarcely be dread tidings out of minister mouth when perceiving opportunity rose to a fish rise to fly pretended with due solemnity to be rather pleased than otherwise though daughter elevation to princely rank to prospect of future sovereignty must assuredly seal political doom professed presently to see in fresh stepping stone to influence power a conscientiously phrased to opportunity for good approach to point however be gradual circuitous of course be great honor began deliberately weighing proposition in earthly scale seeming not wholly to reject go without saying replied prime minister hardly need to be discussed sure point of agreement be that must not be grace lifted grizzled eyebrow in courteous interrogation beginning delicately to disentangle gold string of pince nez from pectoral cross to like penitent clung said of course perfectly understand how great shock have be to to also come a entire surprise daughter have told nothing therefore in sense can say nothing till have seen have influence with suppose said premier oh undoubtedly be confident then that grace will use to right end have never be habit trust to neglect parental responsibility replied grace be thinking rather of responsibility to state too will have in mind there be also church prime minister be puzzled matter doe not seem to impress grace quite a doe must have thought there must be two opinion about be too much to hope surely point of view be so very different premier felt that plain dealing have become necessary must make quite untenable position a leader of party remarked grimly be not concerned about replied grace with wonderful sweetness a for be growing old surely agree that thing be wholly impossible impossible be strong word that must profoundly alter constitutional status of crown possibly think not slow weighing of con in balance be having devastating effect upon minister nerve got upon foot doe grace mean to tell that thing be even conceivable conceivable wish must state to without fear of offense whole body of objection recognize of course that royal house in direct line have made such alliance for over two hundred year never in fact since ceased to be of pure native extraction also admit that for a party politician if impose upon that term be inconvenient destructive even to certain plan have formed putting altogether aside allowing that for precedent have to go very far back into past what real objection have to urge prime minister be beginning to get thoroughly uncomfortable be breach fatal breach to mind said in caste distinction alone make monarchy possible under modern condition mean personal disrespect to grace be question of own daughter must take same view disturbs tradition have worked well for safety have not be broken for hundred of year most destructively of threatens that aloofness from political entanglement absolute impartiality between party party to day constitutes strength of crown might be quite prepared said archbishop slowly in such event to withdraw from political action of party character can not so separate from past objected prime minister see difficulty in long varied career have twice changed party deserted if can be done with sincerity be equally possible to become of party at prime minister flushed at attack on past record struck back not for archbishop said little sneeringly church now day have become not merely part of political system stereotyped adjunct of party very one sided one at to answer charge adequately replied grace must be forced into political debate foreign to present discussion what concern here now be that something have taken place pregnant for good ill regard a impossible in case conclusion be reached be called upon to make sacrifice of complain what be bound to consider even before interest of state upon take different view be interest of church when last met be preparing to do interest something of injustice more recent proposal induce to think that have changed mind if church be to lose ground now hold in state must seek to recover elsewhere can not blind eye to fact that in high position now offered to daughter will be able to do great work for church believed that have sympathy with intrusion of woman into domain of politics not into politics church be different have in saint calendar woman queen of who be ready to lay down life for church to secure recognition by heathen people king why must not daughter be one spoke with exalted air hand resting upon cross grace said prime minister in changed tone may put one very crucial question have complete influence over daughter can hardly answer will only say that be dutiful never so far a be aware have questioned authority have combated judgment in matter where be duty to decide for what be right on showing seemed very estimable trustworthy young person with sense of encouragement prime minister went on then upon question of marriage with prince must do think be guided by must not marry without consent consent might be forthcoming under certain circumstance think yes a circumstance stand now at moment archbishop paused looked long at prime minister before answering how do stand inquired ii that evening when jenifer returned archbishop be waiting arrival door of private library stood ajar come in dear called hearing step in corridor come in wish to speak to entered with flushed face wanted to speak to father said saw that be come charged for delivery of soul perceiving what strategic advantage must give to hear story first from own lip waived prior claim very well dear replied for next hour be free at disposal may take longer than warned have something to tell seems to almost terrible anything wrong oh so tremendous hardly know how to begin breast labored with burden of message in face be look of dawn have to do with yes papa be engaged to marry prince max archbishop paused for moment thinking how best to avoid appearance of foreknowledge child said what prince max do mean only one know of answered mean heir to throne yes papa say be engaged to yes with whose knowledge may ask king know have just given consent be why be telling now why only now there be reproach in tone until have consent be not engaged now being engaged come for mine papa only to let know paused of course must be glad of approval archbishop sat silent for while how long have known prince max inquired at last about six month be not that rather short time yes for so important decision mean yes be know for learning man character will say character one learns more quickly than others know papa better than do may well be youth doe not easily understand age so question remains do know well enough to marry want to marry said know there be objection oh yes very serious one yes told said be quite impossible said must get king consent did not think so felt sure indeed that must not to day came showed to in writing promise made conditionally more than two month ago conditionally yes named date be why until to day there be nothing must tell not even fact that have asked to marry must not wish that to be known if nothing be to come if not by one must have be better child papa why must one know have have to give up of course must have be painful can understand can smile at now said at time be terrible for found then how much loved archbishop withheld speech for moment then said tenderly be very sorry for child ah there be need to be now cried joyfully once more paused then repeated word there be quick attention then in look showed fear shifted to easier ground tell said gently how came about how did come to know prince only by seeing at court then recognized that have met often before when have not known who be why must have concealed did not one day told must not believe seemed so unlikely did believe when told who be said that fact be incompatible mine be more unlikely story of two did did begin liking very soon began by almost hating used to scoff at everything seemed not to believe in anything be good almost first time that met told that dress wore be 'provocative ' ' lure of satan devising ' called said that nothing tempted men more than for woman to wear what described a 'the uniform of virginity declared that be because of dress that got lost following through slum did not that warn what sort of man be for be not true just happened to meet helped when be single handed confessed afterwards that have said everything must to shock to put to test have grown up distrusting religious profession scoffer did not even that warn under circumstance seemed most natural thing showed that be honest sounded dreadful word to archbishop coming from daughter lip felt that in passing from theory to practice have become shockingly latitudinarian in view again cautious circumspect shifted ground dear said do realize suppose that from worldly point of view prince have committed very grave indiscretion smiled tell so rather plea now king have given consent yes nominally have replied archbishop in there be good deal more than meet eye when majesty first gave that promise never intended that must take effect paled slightly at word saw that only now have scored point why do think that think know be not at liberty to reveal secret of state let put aside can not give proof if wish to disbelieve do now come to main point there be side to question about know nothing know that in state to day church have enemy indiscretion on part of prince supported by promise from king can not in honor withdraw have suddenly put into hand great opportunity must not be missed into hand papa under providence yes say reverently be daughter in service loyalty to church be a one looked at steadfastly did not respond in word great opportunity said again great power for righteousness to save church in dire need be great thing to be able to do worth more than anything else that life can offer to daughter that call have come how will answer face have grown white be still hard to appeal have not won yet yes said do partly understand will do for can then will release prince from bond doe not ask to be released may be then there be silence dear child murmured archbishop there be emotion in voice putting out hand laid upon hers drew gently from contact only if wish said will not wish then have word life contains other holier vow than child did not seem to think so father said be man love

be dream have told dream to prince smiled tenderly with confidence be already helping to make come true asked to be upon commission be why be there archbishop be now realizing that knew very little about daughter not only amazed frightened for first time feared that might lose great stake for be playing one thing be essential woman domestic pawn held in hand must never be allowed to become queen so with great pain forced spoke on how right have be when told prime minister that in one way sacrifice must be required of for now be going to sacrifice most sacred convention ideal of how unmarried woman must be trained child said do think that know man yes know better than one else in world do also know life jenifer look turned on little curiously know said that be not really christian ah exclaimed in sort of joy decorously flavored with grief did not know of course explains everything rest inevitably follows what follows man who be not christian lead life will stand looking into then

remained secret became known then date be mentioned be given to know how visit have still gone on while lover have be offering devotion of heart be there after recent accident that have gone to be nursed archbishop be extremely well informed told nothing did not absolutely believe to be true now at last advantage be on side for ignorance left almost without defense with sense of proportion stood looking out into non dimensional world dimly mind made struggle to escape what what doe mean asked there must be reason for be kind of disease corrupt nature said father solemnly be what church call in teaching 'the sin of flesh shuddered for to by religious training flesh have come to have dreadful sound in spiritual world pictured a shop hung with butcher meat yet why be dreadful did not know tell murmured with pained speech still trying for way out be natural be that doctrine be preached by said father christianity forbids such view said went on said when first asked to marry ' have done natural thing must hold to be wrong have loved ' said 'for mere comfort not for honor life ' asked if understood said 'yes 'that be confession ' said ' have be ' said 'no better than others hope not worse be thought meant that have be selfish worldly be that other thing what really meant doubt told said looked at with forlorn hope be best thing that must do for doubt guessed that eventually must come to know stood thinking back into past after have told kissed said have never done that before lip trembled tear ran down face know enough now dear will not happen again still love said a though confessing to shame archbishop have sufficient wisdom to accept statement without protest must be hard for to do otherwise said heart can not change at once believed that with must do good can believe that now know that sort of life enters blood said father taint make evil that must otherwise be holy mean speak of marriage drawing together of two into one still be marriage mystery have be profaned marriage then coming after may be only reminiscence of sin stood looking at face very pale will still have to ask if be true archbishop resigned to what must not avoid if must said then thinking forward to what might possibly happen added be duty to tell everything yes replied did not mean to tell at first hoped that might spare explained be not thing that one speaks of willingly if can be avoided be better that must not be known gave gesture of impatience pressing hand against eye say anything more to said voice sounded hopeless dead not now then very slowly turned went out of room archbishop told that have done duty personal aggrandizement great opportunity of power social position have put away have done true holy thing so sat down wrote to prime minister chapter xx thorn flesh next day prince max received letter written by hand have become for dearest in world be very simple straightforward methodical began with word beloved asked whether certain thing be true seemed then that for first time confession be understood not single one of question put to contained anything be untrue did not go much into detail commentary be made upon fact indicated max sat down wrote very beautiful letter in reply got answer for three day put up with rebuff to honesty of character literary ability then not finding lady where expected to be went called upon father archbishop be out max not to be denied sat down waited for return waited for over two hour be getting towards dusk when grace entered reverend high shouldered figure showing stoop beginning now to look old archbishop very formal greeting told max that here be enemy did not at dismay at time indeed be full of confidence temporary separation between beloved brought about in conventional way thoroughly despised be for moment hindrance have not yet taken to color of doom knew that jenifer heart be entirely that with common honesty have only to meet again to be made one what wanted to know therefore be not so much opinion of jenifer father about engagement a to find out present whereabouts from first moment of meeting knew that did not stand in archbishop good grace hardly concerned so be almost without circumlocution that asked for jenifer address archbishop by simultaneous depression of head raising of eyebrow managed to convey just sense of honor be being done liberty be being taken wrote other day explained max asking to arrange time when might come see in strict etiquette believe that grace ought first to call upon have so few precedent to go by have trust done honor to tell that be engaged have be informed of circumstance replied archbishop with stately formality prince took matter boldly in hand from manner have to presume that have not happiness of consent consent be not asked have be must not have given that think said prince must have be perfectly correct attitude until such time a king gave be for that have be waiting have not be so must have come to earlier early late answer to highness must always be same may ask upon what ground must ask sir in return upon what ground be suitable that must marry daughter so happens replied max be in love with what precisely sir to mind doe phrase 'being in love ' convey prince saw that tussle be coming gathered thought together then said intense personal desire to endow certain woman with motherhood archbishop flushed sharp enmity showed in eye made gesture of repulsion ah cried max doe that shock church challenge went unanswered instead came question have not have desire before in other direction never exclaimed max never archbishop eyed keenly have have experience have lived life openly said prince be aware of returned grace need trouble highness with further ground for refusal not with consent will daughter marry libertine great judge of heaven cried max springing to foot hark to old man shout said archbishop hears max scorn dropped back like rocket to earth yes retorted doubt question be be capable of hearing be always ready to be instructed replied grace sarcastically must remind said prince that a doctor of divinity have claim yes went on in answer to archbishop look of astonishment though have forgotten circumstance dubbed theologian by hitting over head with greek testament archbishop accepted reminiscence in case said bow to highness authority yes be shepherd of fold yet let in be clever one of family title be given when with three life standing between there be little likelihood of becoming head of church be to wear then a ornament a amulet to guide into right doctrine faith still hold fear that miracle have not be wrought in day said archbishop faith be great miracle that people must have faith in church be indeed miracle said max yet suppose be instance of how easily world accepts what find remain outwardly churchman merely because seems to hardly to matter because overt act on part must hurt whom love what spiritual experience have acquired a result of outward conformity have found pulpit most polished of social institution never once have heard from word troublesome to conscience have still can assure waking moment eloquence flow from never trespass beyond bound of polite conversation a regard 'unpleasant subject deal faithfully only with life of who form bulk of congregation if dealt faithfully with polite congregation must get up walk out think sir that experience put in position to know how church deal with conscience of faithful mean said max that in ear of royalty uncomfortable subject be avoided that merely indicates system a snail withdraws first horn into head then body into shell so church adapts to surroundings let give case in point touch on present discussion have heard often enough cheaper form of prostitution decorously alluded to when did ever hear dealt with for approval reprobation established practice among unmarried youth of aristocracy of keeping mistress think sir that must have be often inattentive virtue of purity be be sure constantly inculcated by clergy in such form replied prince that need not apply to ourselves betrayal of innocency yes have heard of for only touch small minority mistress whom most of keep be more innocent than ourselves be more innocent than yet while to social entrance be barred men be allowed to go in free society can not act on mere rumor suspicion said archbishop in woman case doe replied prince wonder whether have ever occurred to one to connect fact with cheapening of modern definition of chivalry be ever chivalrous be charity be greater thing than chivalry be not so sure of said prince have forgotten just now be doctor of divinity have also forgotten that share honor of one of most ancient knighthood in world will highness be so good a to explain grace will perhaps remember since officiated upon occasion a prelate of order investiture rather more than two year ago a knight of holy thorn archbishop bowed assent discourse upon occasion be learned eloquent did not really touch subject have brought together how must define subject inquired grace subject on hoped to be instructed said prince be real meaning of chivalry a expressed in order of thorn reason why be deemed worthy to be made knight of there have already be comment owing to fact that honor be not conferred immediately on attainment of majority perhaps shortened career at college have something to do with perhaps fact have brother who be older worthier than be not in least blaming father for delay rather be now inclined to be grateful that year death of two brother created more than vacancy further postponement must suppose have made omission too pointed stepped into dead shoe what talker man be said archbishop to etiquette held bound there be obliged to sit looking interested attentive while max went on ii for reason perhaps because be one thing for in spite of legitimate expectation have be kept waiting conceived for honor when be bestowed on sentimental regard did not experience toward other title have dropped upon without merit on part for one honor felt in curious way be not worthy may have be that feeling of unworthiness made before date of investiture study history of order legend of origin have hoped that must touch upon legend give modern application wonder now whether grace be aware of legend whether indeed be not only knight of order who have troubled to think anything about fancy said archbishop that legend refer to have flavor of medieval romanism must hardly commend to modern ear prince smiled bitterly grace persuades said to tell story at point where doe not commend will be glad to hear criticism founder ought not rather to say first knight of order be if story be true certain ancestor of royal house who have spent greater part of life in war of unjust aggression to atone for for other thing weighed more heavily on conscience went late in life on crusade to holy land after being there handsomely trounced by infidel be returning in dejection to sea coast with mutinous remnant of following when founding of order of thorn occurred to occurred to thus at event be own account of have become separated from company of knight darkness be coming on when a spurred tired steed with little mercy for exhausted condition passed by roadside beggar who cried out to for charity charity asked for be not alms only withdrawal from mendicant foot of thorn troubled ancestor softened by accent of gentleness patience in suppliant voice dismounted to do service required of in growing darkness drew out thorn when have got free from flesh seemed more thorn iron nail wound out of have drawn shone with celestial radiance then be founded order mendicant bade bind thorn upon heel in place of spur so whenever thereafter must be tempted to goad oppress whether man beast thorn must remind of pity mercy wait for grace criticism of legend archbishop made reply with courteous gesture of hand invited prince to continue hoped said young man to be instructed in connection between founding continuance of order spoke of chivalry loyalty chivalry invited to emulate be merely physical daring of ancestor a proved in war wherein be no longer allowed to take part loyalty be to form of monarchy modern condition now threaten with change looking at brother knight around at wondered by what right wore iron thorn upon heel among need not mention name be men whose life be far more notoriously evil than mine men whose wealth have be gained for by grinding of sweated humanity men who received enormous rent from house not fit for human habitation men who opposed act of remedial legislation disturbed own vested interest who did thing with untroubled conscience because condition fought for be outcome of custom of law remembered that day must be required to become grand master titular head of dead order of chivalry wondered what must happen if acted honestly upon conscience refused yet say sir for order of now speak so slightingly have sentiment of reverence for order yes none for men including who make up membership surely said archbishop highness must admit that be men of mark many of have spent life in public service leader of people in peace war can not regard thing a nothing for thing already have title said prince state pension wealth personally acquired on power influence be based have order of thorn ever once in history be given to man because be conspicuously good gentle forbearing unselfishly thoughtful for others have ever once be given to successful philanthropist who be not also of high lineage title have looked through list can find none grace be only one among whose profession be to serve god rather than to be served by men archbishop glanced uneasily at prince there be sarcasm in look tone max be never more of artist than in adaption of manner to theme sadly almost dejectedly went on now let come to myself seems that be not accounted worthy to receive daughter hand in marriage in certain sense admit that be unworthy seems true to man who ever loved woman well perhaps woman feel same of herself admit that reason for judgment be just deny claim because during early manhood have have illicit connection with one woman tell do propose that daughter will ever marry at archbishop looked at prince with half pitying surmise drew up a though have statement to make then putting inclination aside said be for to choose from own rank in life persisted max not limited mean to clerical profession impose limit on daughter freedom said archbishop do mean to tell inquired prince that of suitor for daughter hand lawyer soldier politician man of letter will make business to inquire will expect to be told truth whether have not at period of career have illicit connection with woman must recommend suitor said archbishop who have be at so little pain a highness to avoid setting of bad example to others be then merely secrecy that advocate respect for moral observance be in ground of recommendation answered grace though at time man may fall short of what know to be right mean said prince have flagrantly committed in upkeep of establishment where others have only paid extravagant price for night lodging highness put matter in way make impossible for to discus beg pardon really be trying to be delicately indirect that must beg off discussion because way of putting thing seems to indelicate be yet count in quarrel with established ministry seem to to be amateur where ought to be professional how can possibly deal with poor weak humanity in kid glove like surgeon before can hope to bring healing in wing too must be anatomical in research be anatomical civil churchman fight shy of well will endeavor to get at matter from more accessible side grace be take man of world archbishop be inclined to demur humbly firmly deprecated imputation surely protested prince have not be must not now be in place occupy one know that archbishop appointment be political ask then a man of world how short of miracle must expect man in position circumstance to have kept technically unblemished record surrounded with luxury from birth disciplined by real hardship having to make struggle for existence brought up to eat meat drink wine athletic without reason opportunity for leading strenuously athletic life with brain with compulsion to use passed for perfecting of education from one privileged grade to from university to army from thence to sport race course from where on god earth in modern curriculum for king be idea to have occurred to must do thing in attempting to do early hermit went hullabalooing to desert be now nearly twenty six father for reason of state married at twenty one for similar reason have be kept unmarried sufficiently eligible partner must be found for solved time of waiting by contracting non legal conjugal relationship with woman for whom have very real affection who be considerably senior in year who knew quite well that arrangement must only be temporary lord archbishop ask must in circumstance have shown better more blameless record be even punctilious enough to tell daughter excessive scruple think did not understand understands now said archbishop who be inquired prince sharply who have thus played bo peep with intelligence first shutting now opening eye when evil be encountered said grace instruction have to be extended still have stopped halfway just at point where serf best what doe pure soul know of problem to be only few hour old be daughter of church know what church answer have always be know then said max what school of historian have yet be able to decide see over in england to day how church clinging to establishment have to dodge shuffle over change in moral law arising out of national habit be church of jingalo so greatly superior think that can boast at moment clock upon chimney piece intoned hour archbishop reduced to extremity in order to get rid of distinguished unwelcome visitor permitted to throw involuntary glance in direction of sound prince perceiving indication rose at once to foot pardon said for having kept so long pardon returned grace unfortunately have to dine of course ought not to have forgotten mean have guest will not be kept waiting by said prince moved to door then stopped grace said know that can not be friend still paused there be silence greatly wish to see daughter surely can not deny that right can not said archbishop doe pulled max up with jerk not that yet believed however where be now inquired have joined sisterhood of poverty to day entered profession prince choked be horrible said mean have taken vow archbishop of ebury bowed head for remainder of life at event said in stricken tone will not return here house be left desolate to because of still have guest said prince be unworthy gibe retorted grace work have still to go on beg pardon said max have written to added after pause have not answered will grace be good enough think will prays for if came be to tell again there be silence for time when be child said prince have old nurse who did anything wrong a whipping be not allowed used to go down on knee pray for always did against blank wall suppose helped have always remained vision of prayer now will always think of daughter with dear face turned to blank wall praying for murderer went out upon word thought archbishop be dangerous man to be heir to throne chapter xxi night light meanwhile prince of schnapps wasser have arrived max instead of pursuing own love affair ought to have be busy entertaining first meeting between charlotte suitor have be tactfully arranged have met riding to review of troop in great field of mar occupied central space in largest of royal park princess have healthy taste for riding in thoroughly cold weather also particularly disliked to be in carriage when round be on horseback so by following own taste when prince met be looking very best down white frosted avenue of linden escort came trotting to saluting point there once more in sky blue with sable silver trimming prince be presented opening upon mild blue eye that looked curiously light in bronzed ruddy countenance with dutiful promptness fell in love with by little quiet maneuvering attendance to other matter king left side by side for while troop stood massed in distance waiting signal to advance do like soldier inquired prince rather depends upon uniform replied charlotte oh do like mine looked at smiled for there be sky blue tunic in jingalo such cerulean tone on man be to eye little incongruous must be rather trying to complexion observed look very well in have be abroad explained that have given color of red indian look just a if have dropped from sky said smiling still at oh not sky cast up grudging glance at opaque grayness overhead here seem to have sun look only other way threw back light remark while eye strayed over field presently returned to subject so only like soldier because of uniform when ride well like drum too added ah good can play on drum be one instrument doe require much practice oh yes be very difficult to play well have be very useful to took drum with to south america be music that native can understand can make afraid when one be by in forest then help that one will not feel lonely one night when have fire left be saved life from wild beast just by beating at with drum be funny that must like drum like something with a well said charlotte ah grunted prince depends there be music in world ought never to be allowed well there be of ours said princess a massed band of three regiment sent forth blast how doe that strike prince listened with ear of connoisseur for here be good said judicially be not musical nation there be man there be playing drum a ought not to be played then formal duty called away be first exchange of compliment old uncle nostrum who have kept within ear shot reported to king thing have gone sufficiently well there be secrecy about intended affair in royal circle now everybody knew of that evening at state ball given in prince honor destined pair met again nothing very much happened at ball prince danced once with charlotte once with queen with nobody else while charlotte danced nearly whole evening max moving about with pensive preoccupied air danced with nobody only reason why ball have to be mentioned be because of something happened immediately after quite unconnected with about to be linked about to be separated lover something take back to underground working of body politic majesty be only now beginning fully to apprehend state ball end punctually a be upon stroke a soon a royal countenance be withdrawn come to end so within hour of retirement of royal party great suite of chamber be empty in le than hour light movement have ceased in that part of palace wherein royal family resided king hindered during day by constant attendance upon guest have paper to look through before next meeting with prime minister went into study switched on light for hour sat at work outside traffic died away sense of silence grew deep whole palace became permeated by wearying for bed having got through last batch of paper king looked at clock be half past one just a be getting up from seat mere ghost of sound caught ear door silent on hinge have softly opened within frame stood figure in dark civil uniform who gave military salute ii mr inspector cried king in surprise recognizing face beg majesty pardon ah came to see that everything be safe time be little too early still a be here must rather like to know how far key do allow to penetrate everywhere majesty mean even to private apartment apparently did do often have occasion to use not after to night majesty never again oh suppose be objecting if be really necessary give key up to morrow sir said man ought to have given up to day wanted to see majesty king drew up seemed intrusion must have asked for interview said must have asked to day of death sir must never have heard of must have written doe majesty think that letter personally addressed be even reported to majesty suppose not of said king after considering matter not one in hundred sir still be important hear of mine sir must not have be reckoned important said man bitterly king looked hard at not with real suspicion for straightforward bearing inspired liking a well a confidence here be man whose measure must be carefully taken for be certainly doing very extraordinary thing have something really important to tell eye met on pause spoke better than word yes said man quietly shut door wo come nearer said king for depth of large chamber divided disciplined figure kept place slowly without hesitation gave what have to say be dismissed force began be not important at least only to though suppose be partly why be here for man must fight when living be taken from be dismissed because majesty got out of palace other night without hearing of king breathed astonishment said nothing admit ought to have known man have on duty at door did know majesty at least not so a to be sure asked yesterday who be went out said well sir thought be one of palace steward use that door good deal at night so be told that did not recognize be of course own doing said king know that sir replied man in detective force ca afford to make sort of allowance consequence be be out of be sorry inspector what do want to do well sir be here because know something ca tell to soul on earth if must have gone to with need have troubled majesty so happens have got proof be going to ask to believe without proof majesty can get proof see anyway be there at dean court dean court what be where police museum be sir proof of what be going to tell majesty lie there be getting interesting pray go on said king bomb said man one be thrown at majesty other day piece of be in museum now paused then added have gone back to place came from be evident then from man tone to own mind have stated essential part of case king brain working on unfamiliar ground missed connection quite understand said sir well then be like after bomb be thrown be put on to ground public be kept off piece picked up be brought to must have be very mild sort of charge sir nothing much besides gunpowder must say slug anything most of shell be able to put together again be blackened over partly by fire partly new painted think under black found lettering number quite faint have got here drew out pocket book a spoke dcm closed book with snap a though clinching argument bomb have that number on said came from dean court museum be be there fifteen year have be in to look number be missing now 'd have thought sir might have be more careful than that spoke with professional contempt for job have be bungled solemnity of man manner queer mystery of sent cold sensation through king blood felt now that be up against something dangerous sinister what do mean to understand from asked well sir said man doe need to tell majesty that when anarchist of sort want to do bit of bomb throwing go to police museum for material be not found out down at head office after be over only then that local authority have given permit for cinematograph record to be taken from stand just opposite overlooking new building so a to get procession a came along under arch so a happened film have got whole thing recorded only heard of when be announced to be shown at theater night be sent down to get hold of brought back with have be through one most people must see anything point where bomb went off be about fifty yard away film give view just take in bit of palisade at number see arm come up face just behind very small under scaffolding 'd hardly know be there if be put under good microscope must be surprised what must be recognized by time king understanding have become clear saw where argument be leading before must do that man went on be locked away did say anything about did point out to mean for 'd begun to have feeling thing be all right daresay have noticed what noticed if have number ten plate following will be gone whether have not that proof king be now following man narrative with tense interest moment import grew more clear yes clearer than day sharp bright a rocket shot up against blackness of midnight sky inspector paused for moment wiped hand over dry lip in telling of tale face have grown white whom do mean by 'they inquired king man hesitated well majesty 'd rather not say ought to know oh yes sir ca deny there have got proof so be not same thing do say majesty that to be able to lay hand on thing in first place now to keep locked away need somebody higher up in department than 'd like to name if may leave at will do said king majesty see must safely go to anybody else with proof must be somebody who must get at before be destroyed must be who have whole thing in own hand quite see said king be have to say then sir be very much in debt will not forget what owe there be one question want to ask say that charge must have be very feeble one yes sir much le than ordinary shell what do deduce from fact well majesty must say that killing have never be intended that be only done to frighten one be about majesty thank be what wanted to know if will leave name think can promise that will be at disadvantage after have gone into matter be much obliged majesty inspector came forward drew out card respectfully presenting retired again then for present be said king be now nearly two o'clock can believe let out in light of gentle half quizzical smile from royal countenance inspector withdrew what amazing thing said king to oh if be true iii knew that be true for in flash have seen meaning of instead of angering filled with almost intoxicating sense of power for meant that prime minister government must not do without have be necessary to plan must not distinctly see why whether be fear of max succeeding to throne at juncture of popular resentment at sovereign being driven to so desperate remedy for grief fear merely of damage might be done to monarchical system while bureaucracy be still depending upon a cloak for constitutional encroachment whether one of fear impelled minister king did not know saw clearly enough that to force into withdrawal of abdication prime minister have adopted desperate almost heroical remedy bore man grudge more envisaged risk more admired respected feebly though bomb have be charged carefully though directed by slow underhand bowling only at leg of horse at moment when royal carriage have actually passed still bomb be incalculable weapon piece of fly in most unexpected direction be evident that for execution of ministerial veto on crown action have be necessary to risk life not merely of picked body of troop of several high court official staff officer riding in close attendance upon royal coach child in politics must see that if risk have be run to make abdication impossible then abdication have be right card to play now that game be over have begun if in certain sense leading card have reverted to ministerial hand king have advantage of knowing what be by leading off in suit might prevent ministry from playing till too late for effect be necessary however first to get proof lay at dean court under official lock key hand held that key be for knew same have thrown bomb in order to frighten how then be to get at brilliant idea occurred to so simple easy that without worrying further went to bed slept upon next morning at first meeting said to prince of schnapps wasser must not like to come see police museum just now contains rather interesting exhibit especially for personally that bomb know proceeded to give detail actual piece be there whole set of photograph showing how explosion took place majesty hearing of project backed warmly will find quite intellectual treat said police be such intelligent creature went over museum once felt exactly like being in kaleidoscope everything so wonderfully arranged ah yes said prince must be very interesting so though be not in day program quite at early hour king guest drove down together to prefecture prefect have not arrived saw one of high permanent official stating purpose of visit be formally handed over to superintendent of detective department be mr superintendent said king come upon by surprise be sufficiently prepared for superintendent declared that department be ready at hour wanted to show prince of relic majesty went on particularly connected with recent outrage of course superintendent be delighted led way into museum before long prince of schnapps wasser became very much interested in thing be shown case after case be opened king seeing how smoothly matter be shaping made hurry toward attainment of goal presently pointing toward case stood in window recess official remarked with smile there lie majesty death warrant what be left of case be opened king took up fragment very interesting said there be also photograph showing actual event be there not be here majesty superintendent produced small box with numbered slide very interesting murmured king again a continued to handle shard presently detected in one of faint trace of figure lettering laid to one side took up film began to examine film after film held up to light scale be very small unable to decipher in detail sought only for identifying number under stood catalogued after while came to one be in search of other two three immediately followed selected for closer scrutiny two of handed to prince be just before said by way of explanation be from behind palisade that bomb be thrown after coach have passed here highness can see actual explosion taking place said guide ah very good very interesting murmured prince with cordial appreciation seems to have gone off quite well king meanwhile have re collected four innocuous looking film set apart from rest have be quite unable inquired to trace bomb to origin to discover anything a to who threw trace at sir whole thing be perfect mystery remarkable said king then with leisurely air of collector of curio took up again four film shard bearing faint trace of figure before astonished eye of superintendent put into breast pocket will keep a souvenir observed will always be of great interest to ask pardon majesty replied official little stiffly be against regulation for anything to go out of museum when have once be catalogued ah yes retorted king smiling pleasantly then be against regulation for bomb to be thrown at royal coach when be in so must allow for once small breach make in chain of evidence there be plenty of material for conviction still left must ever discover criminal be afraid sir said superintendent speaking gravely that will get into trouble with prefect may express hope that majesty will reconsider matter oh not at said king tell prefect that responsibility rest with prince here be witness that robbed that be helpless lay blame upon without scruple if be very grave breach of regulation well can inform prime minister then doubt will hear of superintendent stood mute have made protest must not pretend that be satisfied by way went on king have very particular request to make think concern department in connection with certain incident took place other night will be nameless one of special inspector have be dismissed hear be so majesty well wish to interfere in anything make for efficiency have to request will please to make particular note of that will be retired on full pension for moment official hesitated may ask why sir because practically have promised be that re engage for own personal service be man whom have trusted in matter of exceedingly confidential character pray see to head of department must hold out no longer will be a majesty wish said very well said king please report when have seen matter through now prince think that have exhausted everything including fear patience mr superintendent what very criminal part of society have to deal with hope that influence of place be not catching a to sir can hardly say replied other with wry smile majesty have just committed robbery will have to report first have ever taken place in department oh surely not quite first protested king then checked well if be so can take out order for arrest will find added slyly that be already well known to police so saying prince took departure iv if king be satisfied with morning exploit raid so successfully conducted have harassment to face before day be over message to council on matter of woman chartist grievance be received by prime minister not only with disfavor with clear though respectful intimation that must not be allowed to effect ministerial program must remind mr prime minister said majesty that constitution give right sir question give to also discretion a to when time can be found for attending to well said king may fix own date within reason can fix date majesty be flat monarch must not help showing annoyance if think that answer satisfies said be mistaken fear replied prime minister that be often duty to give majesty dissatisfaction well well said king will see have drawn out of pocket small shard be toying with a spoke by way said considerately changing subject be at prefecture morning took prince to see museum so be informed prime minister showed discomposure demeanor be wholly urbane conciliatory brought away with small memento went on king be told of too sir replied premier smiling be little irregular if majesty wish for think there can be real objection really thought king to be going to pretend that know nothing about yet good face minister put upon matter did not fail to win king admiration respected man courage ability to brazen thing out superintendent judged be not actually in secret of premier be now quite sure that air of calm be just little bit overdone suppose think that ca do anything mused king well well will see then inquired whether prime minister have interviewed prince max have not sir have seen archbishop have be talking to archbishop about cried king sharply at great length sir replied prime minister then must say that have taken most unwarranted liberty have gone entirely beyond behind authority be use for to protest mr premier did consent that must speak to prince beyond until have be thoroughly discussed with communicated to be entirely confidential private affair of such importance sir can not possibly be private can have private preliminary otherwise where must be diplomacy prince might day have taken overt action might even have announced engagement might did not without even seeing have be behind back discussed with archbishop pray with what result at present sir be not in position to say have good hope be still in correspondence assure majesty that conscience be clear in matter conscience mr prime minister have easy way of clearing lay burden of on yes be second bomb have be dropped upon from government back premise be tired of be not going to stand longer in matter of prince engagement be in entire agreement now have so acted that have endangered relation very friendly affectionate relation between prince hardly know how will be able to look in face give consent then suddenly turn round work against go behind back yes steal march upon be how will appear if so accuses what be to say appreciate majesty feeling say sir that sacrifice be necessary to prevent so dangerous proposal from going

anywhere to found that other matter have disturbed conscience tending with comparative smoothness toward solution in personally have have little share though jingalo know nothing of inner working of history peering behind scene may note how when bureaucracy be bent on keeping up appearance fear of scandal can become more potent to constitutional end than love of justice never in long career have prime minister known so flagrant instance of blackmail unpunishable by law a princess charlotte sprung on when in brief interview dictated term on alone ann juggins episode be to be allowed to sink into oblivion perhaps one can hardly wonder under circumstance even then did not feel secure be anxious to see so incalculable sport variant of royal breed removed to safe distance for even though might rely on word a to past where be guarantee that might not do same thing again that prime minister be very anxious to get rid of said prince fritz when at later date princess began once more to

flushed manner strangely discomposed barely returned respectful greeting of minister by postponement of customary invitation to be seated kept out of chair for quite appreciable time standing awkwardly about board looked like group of carrion crow awaiting symptom of death before descending to meal to none did accord word of personal recognition even when proceeding have commenced be

about to english government mean be not direct act of government sir need to be told said king be direct act of government when party of english undergraduate climbed to top of embassy hauled down national flag because jingalese have be made compulsory substitute for greek at university for that english government apologized publicly privately round do apologize for do offer to compensate for loss be to trade corresponding gain to theirs have be asked to apologize certainly not sir pray why not by time around ministerial board much open eyed interrogation be going on where seemed to be

infinitely more harm be merely development sir of new thing called beyndicalism ' be cropping up everywhere now may be new a like protested king say be that a stand be casus belli say be cropping up more reason why must be put down what else be government for take cattle disease put that down allow to be imported why must allow syndicalism to be imported council sought resignation of spirit in sigh looked to chief in mute appeal how must majesty propose to prevent importation of idea inquired prime minister dryly in tone tried to be patient tell said king that syndicalist subsidy to labor

extra taxation on ourselves in fact must save must simply raise railway hotel tariff fifteen twenty per cent to englishman except child in arm child up to thirteen half price there be whole thing in nutshell difficulty difficulty whatever at point to premier annoyance professor teller took up question with humorous appreciation of possibility sir inquired how must know that be englishman might disguise a american must said king englishman trying to talk american make a poor exhibition of a american trying to talk english besides know british character penalize in way be suggesting must flaunt nationality in face must wear union jack waistcoat carry in pocket gramophone played save king ' when touched must make point of showing that did care twopence for fifteen per cent in fact tariff reformer must applaud must put in large headline in newspaper call object lesson must demand general election on strength of supposing sir inquired professor that did not come at have to remember that live largely by tourist if eliminate english tourist better better said king think how popular must be with rest of europe english german must simply flock to hotel must be crammed must be turning away money at door prime minister tapped wearily upon table be such utter waste of time began to think that king be so intending be bent upon making royal council constitutional impossibility in curious magnetic way other member of cabinet be now beginning to be infected idea tickled national vanity though be put in very amateurish way many of saw well enough that for war to be retained a solution of international problem something on line must have to be done for syndicalism be merely showing of way majesty inquired president of board of way mean might not england retaliate by declaring tariff war on might said king not with liberal still in power must reduce to absurdity in way still supposing declaration of war threw liberal out what must others do trade in

of manufactured for in birmingham home of tariff reform in matter by taxing of article be only nominally made in jingalo english trade must suffer more than ours there might in consequence come about real revival of native craft advantage have not previously thought of lacking usual supply of bogus article must at last become honest in profession truthful in trademark let minister for home industry make note of prospect majesty hold out be certainly alluring replied minister thus appealed to if war be to teach moral lesson surely ought to have moral reason for engaging in a well a business one well if want have got said king if moral reason be to count ought to have be at war with england day for last fifty year england have become if have not always be center of infection to whole of europe disastrous experiment on have embarked have come from by gross mismanagement of established institution church peerage army land labor capital whole system of voluntary service voluntary education have driven rest of europe into revolutionary change for there be necessity whatever in avoiding woeful example have set of always standing still on wrong leg have run off own now be nourishing syndicalism like bed of weed sowing seed of into neighbor territory if be looking for moral excuse there be end to preferred however to put to a business proposition must assure majesty said prime minister that majesty present adviser have intention whatever of making responsible for war on england however advantageous circumstance may seem might a well have spoken to wind with increasing volubility of utterance king went on if be decided said that actual invasion of england be advisable have three separate plan now forming in head equally feasible promising capable of being put into operation at one same time one in fact must serve to divert attention from others may be noted at point professor teller suddenly ceased to be amused look of half quizzical detachment becoming changed to one of gravity almost of distress majesty pace have apparently become too much for know for instance pursued king that if succeeded in effecting landing german waiter must rise a one man join a volunteer germany must of course officially disown while for purpose of war must give letter of jingalese naturalization on enlistment must carry in knapsack must prevent from being shot in event of being taken prisoner own army of twenty thousand picked jingalese sharp shooter must go to england disguised a tourist in bag must carry complete military outfit new uniform be so

red then paled gave short cry threw out arm feebly wavered toppled crumpled like thing without bone fell back into chair god muttered prime minister oh great one more nimble of wit than rest dashed out of room to seek aid others impressed with true sense of incompetence stood looking at fallen king not one of knew how to handle whether be best to lay down leave alone first aid even to sovereign lord have formed part in education of counselor prime minister did one thing knew to be correct must not possibly do harm felt king heart nobody for moment supposed to be dead unconscious though lay heavy breathing must be seen heard chapter xxiv voice of thanksgiving for three whole week thereafter if paper be to be believed entire nation hung upon bulletin be issued hourly from royal palace king illness gave finishing touch to popularity devotion to affair of state have brought on brain fever more desperate symptom of illness must be made to appear more sublime became moral character of august victim more deeply rooted affection of people professional vanity have also to be flattered during fierce fluctuation of hope despair jingalo topmost place in world of medical science became vindicated to meanest intelligence if by scientific miracle king life be to be saved jingalese doctoring other doctoring in world must do nobly press performed task of giving to factor in situation due prominence even church got share when favorable bulletin became order of day origin be generously ascribed even by ministerial press almost a much to prayer of people publicly offered a to skill of six best medical authority when be said done be to king marvelous constitution patient courage quiet submission to hand of nurse foremost of whom be majesty queen that praise be chiefly due for be necessary in order to complete situation that loyalty so nobly tendered must be nobly earned nobly tendered certainly be never must nation have have so good opinion of a during dark week when taught by press meaning of various symptom sat by king bed feeling pulse holding breath scarcely daring to raise voice above whisper various section of public be informed in daily journal how other section be behaving how business men went to office almost apologetically only because must not help how nursemaid hushed voice of charge a wheeled past precinct of palace for morning airing in royal park how jingalo only consented to accustomed portion of beer in order that might drink to king health quick recovery week in street at back of palace fresh straw be laid down not so much for benefit of sufferer whose room be too far away for sound of traffic to disturb a stimulus to popular imagination men who laid down performed task a though eye of whole nation be upon even upon stock exchange one learned that rise fall of price be harmonious accompaniment of stupendous national anxiety thing jingalo be told by newspaper of be true in reading doing of how jingalo enjoyed have never have time of feeling good unselfish thoughtful on large homogeneous scale without having to do anything particularly unpleasant in return theater suffered not nearly so much a charity for though jingalo be still able decorously to amuse did so at majesty special request for sake of trade must not have heart successfully wrung by human compassion in more than one direction at time at least not to same extent so charitable appeal have to wait till livelier sense of gratitude prompted by king recovery must revive in conduct of human affair association play very curious part when man be shouting for joy can scatter largesse with free hand can not loosen purse string while be holding breath even when be only being held for by sort of hypnotic suggestion nature be still undergoing certain impedimental strain a visible embodiment to strain of calculation suspense small crowd must be seen standing constantly at gate of palace waiting for bulletin watching with curious fascination flag so obstinately continued to float mast high watched a crowd watch for similar sign outside wall of jail not that wanted to fall still if have to dearly wished that might be there to see thus even in grief did sporting instinct of jingalese people rise to surface bring consolation nothing else must afford reader will give credit trust for not having sought to impose on that fear of impending doom that apprehension of what next hour might bring forth on strength of jingalese press so sedulously ran extra edition from day to day have never for moment pretended that king be going to die seeing on contrary that be destined to make complete recovery be not to be quite same man again not at least that man whom have seen in page bumping way conscientiously through period of constitutional crisis
