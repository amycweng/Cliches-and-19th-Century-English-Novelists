have be pulverising force of wave mighty silt from except for few tumbled block of stone be dispersed distributed about shore below so that new cliff face clear of ruin went up in pretty clean sweep from beach to summit sixty foot above from lower curve of where ran out down into sand well projected not ten foot above like little tower of pisa yet thirty foot higher at point in hill face about on level with well top gaped jagged ruin of masonry storm have laid bare dick whispered harry dick be gulping gripping arm hard a stared up supposing must climb to there look in yes choked back knew what

swallowing fast trying to escape from fluttering spell mere suggestion have laid upon whether be earthquake gunpowder same must be just squash ruin inside thing stuck feeling that dare not speculate further harry released arm for time looked down making thoughtful pattern with foot in sand well dont know said raising face suddenly id mighty like to see be rather silent for rest of afternoon though of alluded to subject for day two afterwards be evident stood between avoided spot too until one evening long ramble brought back by shore past then by common impulse stopped stood gaping silent up once more light from sinking sun smote level upon face of cliff so that stood out a bright a grate back surface quite dried from tempest reflected glaze of water rivulet of mud have flowed over sealed scar of ruin above be hardened like plaster though shrinkage have opened black fissure in here there harry softly whistling left suddenly with hand in pocket toiled indifferently up slope

come put nose out here what doe mean that crypt aint a blocked a supposed there must be passage through of course murmured harry nodded primming lip well said why dont follow that where badger can go can doe with said shortly odd little silence fell between then harry turned away began to move off whistling at bound be after with furious red face seizing arm have whipped round im going to try to get into hill up there cried if youre afraid to come too stop behind like coward stared at amazed then fell grinning never said be coward retorted meant answered fuming be bristling actually a on that

jenicos geological hammer sturdy tool with heavy butt long steel pick to balance head with nothing else trust in issued forth after hasty early dinner word said to anybody to dare do have resolved after consultation to make attempt from above rather than below because in first place must be le likely to attract attention in second because descent of twenty foot appeared easier of accomplishment than climb of thirty up slippery glacis so started unregarded of one a supposed by way of valley be not long in reaching brow of mitre where overlooked well recent landfall be strangely altered here near edge risky footing at best stole up cautiously going upon stomach last yard two looked down below at rather giddy distance projected spar ledge of fractured masonry fortunately however interval between be not balked by bulge in cliff showed smooth descent not too sheer for essay still did not do to dwell upon be ready whispered im going down arent said harry first only answered by crooking elbow to keep back dont be fool protested will break away go faster than want if arent careful made reply to resist doggedly till at last with grunt let go turned lying flat faced swung leg over

to run on endlessly just high stone drain with floor of hammered earth driving straight into hill other diverged from did ruin block path be beginning to move quite merrily when suddenly end came in flight of dozen step going down at bottom great door torn off hinge shivered into splinter at sight drew back on very brink stood gaping dumbstruck afraid for moment to proceed dicky said harry staring over shoulder here come tug dont did not answer suddenly dipped under arm ran down terrified at thought of being left alone followed fragment of door stood wrenched at angle through black gap in wreck flowed sense of shattered space beyond now for said harry hand light when im in follow must have lingered yet broke from fearing to precipitate knew not what nameless ruin let go with only show of interference be through in moment calling back to pas light come on serene then in instant have followed draught be still strong enough here to flutter candle flame so for little must make out

under providence be given to to command if destiny have used instrument to precipitate tragedy long be sure hanging over head have done so consciously by higher command in order to neutralize effect of own inexorable decree so thought mr sant presently gratefully acquiesced giving thanks to providence like child have played with fire not realizing think deserving consequence honour then after god to little self possessed deputy who of confidence resolution helped to nerve to escape for time harry may surely admit without shame be beside to be thus cast away abandoned on sandbank in mid ocean

terror of ranging adrift beyond recovery from one hope of resource already grown desolate phantom behind in mist sent frantically back to side of motionless figure have not once stirred since parted from raving mr pilbrow cried what be to do ah answered sharp a echo to command yourselves be like tonic of steel served from pistol will do said harry forcing down terror in one great gulp dick dont

where men waste now tell nobody know of coming here nobody said saw take boat there isnt hope of being rescued from shore cant see even if must be made out here who abroad to mark besides even if one did there bare time even now to put off cover distance before hmph pondered frowning fondling gritty chin then turned to friend how long have asked harry gave desperate glance seaward say hour here perhaps two if climbed wreck there deep water between ah didnt know did there be joshua made gesture of dissent no said cant swim leave out of question two can know why shouldnt reach shore harry shook head tide running in true five mile in december ended with despairing shrug very well said joshua so prompt decided that made jump then wreck one asset well just go see best use can make of with word be striding over sand sprung to sudden thrill of hope at confidence followed heart thumping when came down to little strait found already undoubtedly widened cream of incoming surf showed more boldly over lip of further bank where wreck lay between there be sense of busier movement a might be water yawning stretching after sleep now said joshua sharp a lash swim across to swim at once

poor one have hardly considered think in agitation storm felt must have gutted carcase a clean a dressed ox nothing detachable must have be wrenched flung away from where stood indeed only framework of poop gaunt inflexible rigid in suggestion of rib spar shattered unyielding appeared to have survived furious sacking by wave moreover certain suspicion have come to that rampick have not now made first acquaintance with wreck even perhaps so early a serving of last ebb when fresh from hearing of plan have rowed over to examine ground by lantern light to make sure a so cunning madman must that contingency of crate cask loosened plank must be allowed to mar wicked purpose though might might not be right in in point of fact believe be right hope looking upon lean account of ruin be very little hope still for what be lost nothing in inspiration from self confidence of companion turned desperate inquiring glance on harry come said in answer without word between have slipped down taken

struggle with fractured balk of timber broken rib end might seem to promise yielding to frenzied blow kick be of avail like lost soul paused looking down on litter of splinter great need only recompense o god whispered harry staggered back where stood flung quite ill overcome upon bulwark be up by broken stern post sick to note rising of tide looked down on instant uttered wild exclamation jumped to foot went over side vanished be poising little below on slope of deck at cry dropped slipped landed at bottom recovered foot raced round to meet then too uttered yell for here unnoticed by

confidence be revivifying amazing heart for terror be beginning to expand in radiance of how gasped dont keep waiting old beast ill show said with word be down among tackle unknotting pulling watched breathless helped where must between in few minute have disentangled many fathom of unbroken rope still there be more to come wrought hurriedly feverishly with one eye always on rising water let only wait said harry through teeth till weve got clear then may come a fast a like worked on hard not asking why perhaps have lingering horror that answer must disillusion show shadow of hope heart breaking chimera still stealthily tide crept up still have not done at length last kink be unravelled rose with shout one end of rope be still fastened tight to ring bolt in spar at seaward end other

more than did before anyhow not to pull out of hold shant wait see o harry dont be such fiend why dicky stoopid look here examined thing didnt more than rampick if true he be here already thought wedged tight maybe safe from well tell only caught by tip of nose far enough in to baffle lying a doe easy enough to pull out floating stared at moment then gave wild hoot began to dance about a have done before threw up cap ended by hugging beauty beauty dear old positive genius darling will get away after with nothing ducking uncle jenico sudden choke stopped turned away so that friend shouldnt see shame dick old man said soberly mustnt be too wild even now right hope only well cold three of to drift five mile on spar wouldnt heed word of admonition recoil from despair have sent wit toppling clean head over heel if nothing bowl have offered must have be a joyous a wise man of gotham to commit destiny to to have mean to escape hideous nightmare of enchainment to living death hi gee whoa get on cried chuckling hysteric drove harry holding rope end up sand before paid out behind did not pull taut till be well on slope then for first time thought of joshua turned to look for be standing with suggestion of agitation on edge of further drift water have crept up since left widening ominously channel between waved hand to responded look here said harry mustnt be left in ignorance torture besides hold on dicky while go to why dont bawl across hed never gather must have ready cant explain here dont drop rope for moment while im gone right why not have pull first to see if itll come free without mighty not for world be rotting in water supposing snapped therell hardly be strain when tide lift thing get under seat of old girl believe did see name no well good hope hurrah scuttled from next moment be squattering through water of little strait watched chestnut ball of head lovingly a drew line across channel danced with excitement again to see streaming shoulder emerge presently joshua a near wrought up a run out knee deep to help ashore support a if needed support kneel to wring out clothes while faint gabble of voice came to then turned to look seaward once more behold comb of little wave struck spar end seethed up over sight made heart flutter harry screeched gripped rope a if feared unnamable wickedness be seeking to snatch out of hand did not dare to turn again watched hurrying tide fascinated almost before knew harry be at side lord dicky whispered eye glistening come dont dont let go mustnt give chance if have only answered to thought how slow crawled without haste flurry sometimes seeming to drop dormant a if to take off guard presently what with strain shivering be fain to squat gingerly upon sand grip watch setting chattering teeth what if expectation be to be cruelly baffled after what if spar be anchored by unexpected unseen grapnel to bank turned sick at thought water by now lipped along covering three foot of end still to gentle test of pulling responded nothing suddenly eccentric a always in motion tide bowled succession of heavier wavelet shorewards first found sitting rope taut between spar left sprawling backwards in puddle of water thought mere wash of have upset till in midst of spluttering clutching to recover purchase heard friend sing out get up hold on dick o come come then scrambling gasping to foot saw what have happened spar answering to strain in bobble of water have swung towards rope have slackened over have tumbled chattering with excitement got hold once more pulled still did not come free for long minute yet tugged hauled what dared ceased tugged again not to cut short that tale of agony suspense until be ankle deep in water not until rush of little incoming wave foamed high on stern of good hope kicking up loosening nip on grim held relic of own not until sand be whelmed near far so that seemed to sprout three fantastic trunk of humanity from surface of ocean did great surge vortex answering to last despairing wrench show that have be successful even then dreadful moment passed moment of terror lest rope have given before mass rolling sluggishly to surface revealed be panting

foot long perhaps with ring shroud fastening cut end of rigging yet attached floated massive on even keel so to speak so that in place must even walk on without fear of upsetting in tranquil sea now said harry at last to get to mr pilbrow swear till moment have realized no difficulty then with word be staring aghast at one spar sat too deep to move not till tide have risen two foot at least must ride over bank knew way round must plant firm in hurrying sway of water until reached stood up waved shouted be coming in little hold on till come dont know if heard stood there plunged to knee oddest most tragic sight waved back screeched something what must not understand few minute dropped overboard heaved utmost at great hulk only to have ride few foot ground again at last when water be up to shoulder gave little dip curtsey following wave washed on yelled then slipped into water for last time finding bottom kicked out frantic holding to loop of rope propelled slowly before tide took now do what must must not coax in direct course for friend saw must miss by full fathom be staggering desperate to keep foothold drove near fling forward shrieked harry only chance with word scrambled on to spar again be on joshua side dwelt in agony holding on to rope with one hand while strained to draw closer be use seeing must float past echoed harrys scream joshua sprang out forward on instant with mighty flounder of water disappeared impetus of leap carried towards suddenly like crooked bough borne on flood arm of be stuck out within yard of reach let go hold to dash clutch a swerved harry

reaction to consciousness of drenched overwrought half benumbed condition water have become fathomless horror lapping after with hiss hurry to devour what have seduced from willow there be heaviness deadliness in level undisturbed a seemed be sickening to contemplate so sat close drifted essayed did harry while joshua be recovering to reassure one with fitful banter most cheerless hollow stuff
