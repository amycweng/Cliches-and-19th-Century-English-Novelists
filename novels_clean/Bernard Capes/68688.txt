there for what reason fact merely be impressed upon by gradual change in nature of sensation something seemed to be asking question of be striving striving to answer didnt distress at first for nearer misery overwhelmed everything by by insistence pierced passage through dull obstacle something took up abode in reigned grew felt yielding yielding strove now to beat off inevitable horror of answer be rising in did not know what be question to be response only saw that if yielded to spoke must die then there of black terror of revelation sprung to foot with cry saw thought saw modred standing by water wheel beckoning to if have strength to escape be enough for more for everything seemed to go from till found sitting at foot of stair with jason looking oddly down upon neednt get up said modred

little stealthy rustle of sheet beside prickled through whole being with ghastly stirring then knew have secretly risen on elbow be leaning over looking down upon if must only perspire thought bond must loosen must escape from be cunning knew that too sealed surface of skin with acrid exhalation suddenly clutched in crooked arm bore down down to room of silence there be sickening odor there covering of wheel be open then with shudder a of death thought found answer for now be plain that great wheel be driven by blood not water a looked aghast straining over gave stealthy push with shriek splashed among paddle be whirled down for age be spun beaten round round mashed mangled gasping for breath choked with horrible crimson broth fed insane furious grinding of wheel at end glutted with torture flung forth into parching desert of sand spinning from became far away revolving disk of red that made low down sun of waste corner of world be alone now always alone footstep have ever trod that trackless level must knew till time be ended have hope no green memory for oasis power of speech even then knew be dead have be dead so long that body have crackled fallen to decay leaving soul

be buried alive moreover be evident that sexton be near monomaniac on subject of living interment moreover secondly be altogether improbable not to be accounted for that keen witted doctor must intrust secret so perilous to confederate what object have to gain by destruction of modred beyond satisfying of little private malice perhaps object quite incompatible with fearful danger of deed on other hand must not recall darkly that sexton on morning when apparently sane sensible have conducted to brother grave have thrown out certain vague hint implication hardly noticed by at time assumed lurider aspect in light of more definite charge by zyps statement to after illness must seem that dr crackenthorpe have shown eagerness made voluntary offer of service in matter of hushing up whole
