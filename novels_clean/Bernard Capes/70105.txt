night before last under pretty tragic circumstance there be attempt at murder yes indeed there be miss halifax of unhappy girl be victim arrived on scene too late to prevent crime not too late to have criminal arrested red handed be only then that reached final solution of problem have set to unravel solution needed no more than single piece of corroborative evidence since supplied to confirm by

slightest clue to what sought have in fact after hopeless investigation come to realise complete inability to make brick without straw when chance providence directed step in retreating past shop in kennington road in window of saw something brought to instant stand something be nothing le than bundle of bright coloured bird skin tied round with piece of red tape went at once into shop be one of second hand concern used by small broker for disposal of article picked up by at sale ascertained without difficulty that packet of skin bought there then represented remainder of considerable parcel bulk of have be sold to hat bonnet shop proprietor in borough original lot have learned figured in entirety among effect in sale at house in doddington grove with small pain be able to discover number of house date of auction name of late tenant who appeared have be mr barclay river widow so far so good have secured at length definite base from to conduct operation felt considerably elated must beg to bear always in mind that from first to last be own sole detective in matter doubt in respect must seem to tarnish laurel of be inordinately vain now to continue there be here will perceive at least certain relation established between mr barclay river packet of bird skin with man girl in lower marsh for hyphen connecting a be how to ascertain nature of relationship degree of kindred so to speak be question obviously simplest course be to hunt out widow to make frank offer to of service be course adopted auctioneer who have sold property be fortunately in position to acquaint with present address of lady be living in lodging in earl court road informed to supplement income be small gave music lesson opined that husband death occurred in malay peninsula eighteen month ago have left very ill provided for that sale of household effect have be due to cause must confess that here elsewhere did not hesitate to quote when necessary credential may think that hardly playing game in case offer defence saved world of explanation called upon mr river be accessible of course professionally took opportunity to introduce to state object in visiting fortunately be well acquainted with reputation of agency from first moment so far a be concerned be plain sailing be unnecessary for to enter into particular may say generally that gave complete confidence miss halifax fluttering butterfly lash shot one glance at secretary sat absorbed intent lid fell again be widow appeared continued gilead of captain barclay river who at time of death have be abroad on scientific expedition in malay peninsula contiguous island few week before news of death have reached there have arrived from through shipping agency directed in handwriting small bale of bird skin unaccompanied by letter notification of despatch there be nothing about parcel to lead to attach particular significance to content to part of content put skin aside after brief examination fully expecting to hear from husband by next mail instead there came to tragic information of death from swamp fever be left needle to elaborate reason in such restricted circumstance that became necessary for to realize on stick of property to retire into obscurity parcel of skin be included in sale found purchaser such be sum total of testimony have reason for assuming that parcel have contained anything extraordinary interested a be in view of case be inclined to belief fancy that must lead to more than discovery of beautiful mare nest questioned about content of bale admitted that to best of memory have contained single skin of sort described must not in least recollect if especial skin have be included in lot sold by auction have however reason for supposing otherwise well here be something more gained if little le than suggestive have of course already minutely examined purchase included rose ring yielded solution next step be to return to broker shop to enquire if previous customer have overhauled packet have bought judge of gratification when learned that week two before man answering in description to friend of lower marsh have considered after careful scrutiny have declined purchase from moment saw connection proved knew that needed no more than tact persistence to bring to heart of mystery now occurred to that bonnet shop in borough known a mlanies have acquired from broker bulk of lot purchased by must form next subject for enquiry thither bent step one morning about mid day a reached place by truly extraordinary chance hand be trooping out to dinner amongst saw recognised at once figure of girl whom have seen issuing from empty shop in lower marsh fortunately passed unobserved by might have suspected something came to in flash that be in league with jenniver whatever man name might be to trace rose ring to customer of firm that since have be presumably unsuccessful rose ring must not figure among stock at mlanies therefore be useless pursuing enquiry further in direction really think miss halifax be inspired in be sure be mr balm what be next step why to induce mr barclay river to come with to see if by chance must identify man jenniver be just possible might explain everything did came with great reluctance be by then be afraid so eager in quest must have abducted have refused intention be to introduce to man a one of fashionable acquaintance whose custom have desired saved trouble a approached shop accompanied by identical young woman of former acquaintance issued from two unconscious of presence be raining umbrella be up went down street before there be whispered very girl told about with quick do recognize be sure answered mr river much agitated girl be certain be annie milner former maid of mine whom have to send away for misconduct wait seem to know im so flustered at moment two stopped at door man knocked double rap o said companion on instant know be postman in district started turned swiftly about almost ran from neighbourhood for have given in few word clue desired from moment everything be clear to mr balm how o please go on one moment went straight after seeing home to scotland yard by virtue of same credential secured examination of portrait of convicted criminal man of lower marsh figured amongst who be asked george lightfoot be answer kennington postman sentenced to eighteen month imprisonment for letter stealing discharged after serving term within last few week there miss halifax o im not there indeed why see captain barclay river have written letter to wife telling that be forwarding bale of skin mentioning secret connected with one of that letter lightfoot have stolen amongst others before must formulate plan for acting upon information contained in be trapped arrested on charge sent to prison only to find upon release that lady have be made widow bale sold content scattered during confinement hence advertisement generally determined effort to trace several item of parcel hence moreover subornation ruin of unhappy girl at mlanies whom have known courted when be postman maid at mr river whom have since release tracked to shop in borough won to nefarious purpose saw through in single instant will not go so far have at least vision of truth still there remained to discover nature of secret whereabouts of lost skin for by now be convinced that rose ring rose ring alone one specimen of kind must seem parcel contained held solution of mystery well discovered at fatal moment for one poor creature o dont stop must hurry rather there be much ground to cover in few word will take for granted miss halifax tedious process of inquiry represent in brief questioned mr river a to former mnage learned that in time of annie milner there have be one other servant in house namely cook bessie cotton by name be just possible that might know something about lost rose ring traced girl to situation have procured through former mistress from situation to finally to small lodging be occupying in neighbourhood of newington butt found at home opened upon at once on subject of rose ring to amazement broke into passion of tear half coherent protestation denouncing a understood former fellow servant annie milner for having brought law on a supposed in person be long before must convince be not plain clothes constable long before must quiet reassure succeeded at length persuaded little by little to make full confession to of truth what do think be be who have stolen rose ring be mere impulsive misdemeanour mere sin of vanity committed for purpose of adorning cherished hat hat still survived so adorned seeing parcel of bright skin so little regarded have succumbed one day to temptation of rose ring attracted by eye singularity have appropriated to herself now observe irony of circumstance be perhaps instance of subconscious telepathy of simultaneous suggestion anyhow appeared annie milner have conceived at same moment same hypothesis about girl former fellow servant only annie have be hour so beforehand with in giving practical effect to hypothesis in short have paid visit very morning to bessie cotton during dinner hour have wormed truth out of have demanded hat a price of silence bessie have yielded up plunder intact annie have carried away whither for moment a may imagine felt completely nonplussed then occurred to that annie having already sacrificed dinner time to quest must for certain postpone carrying prize to lower marsh until after business hour acted promptly upon conjecture fortunately proved correct one will hear with what result gilead then related to absorbed listener adventure with be already acquainted can not gather said at end whether villain have predetermined upon murdering victim with view to silencing untrustworthy confederate whether a declares drove to madness at last by coquetting with witholding capture threatening to give whole thing away unless agreed to extravagant term fact that made
