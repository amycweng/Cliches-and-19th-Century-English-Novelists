aware of couple of figure approaching further end backed instinctively into shadow prepared with amiable humour of kind to detect intrigue surprise secret therefrom peering unseen saw two man woman stop in moonlight at mouth of archway where must very clearly distinguish identity of one of almost a certainly guess that of other ear pricked to catch whispered confidence be too far off to distinguish more than inarticulate giggling murmur then there appeared to occur little scuffle between pair to sound of distinct smack lady broke away entered passage alone obviously attention of cavalier having be promptly acknowledged by further escort on part have be peremptorily declined did not attempt indeed to follow standing alone in moonlight moment holding hand to cheek suddenly turned tail vanished hooded lady came on unconscious of watcher be nearing point of emergence when hamilton stepped across path barred way gave small irrepressible squeak stood stock still come said let see what little tib be after tom amorous night recognized voice let lead impassively to near mouth of passage just so a entering light might fall upon face then turned back shrouding wimple saw

cant of course said only dont want to part enemy come said kiss be more proof than word at with light laugh sprang past ran at twenty yard turned blew mocking salute again turning disappeared round corner in truth fascinating little devil thought hamilton with grim smile a continued way go to heart to lose if anything be needed to prove justice of surmise regarding double dealing equanimity with accepted dismissal must supply yet love well enough to wish to coax good opinion at end how what be mystery of mystery poor moll poor moll have got home meanwhile crouching catlike by unlatched window with eye peering above sill to see if coast be clear have presently re entered house by way have emerged from once in stood up shaking cloak from shoulder touched hair into order with rapid finger
