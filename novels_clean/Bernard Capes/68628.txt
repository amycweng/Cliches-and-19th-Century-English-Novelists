skeleton key by bernard cape author of great skene mystery castle in spain etc etc with introduction by g k chesterton new york george h doran company introduction to introduce last book by late bernard cape be sad sort of honour in more way than one for not only be death untimely unexpected have mind of fertile type must always leave behind with finished life sense of unfinished labour from first prose have strong element of poetry appreciative reader must feel even more perhaps when refined frankly modern even melodramatic theme like of mystery story than when gave dignity a in lady of darkness to more tragic more historic thing may seem paradox to say that be insufficiently appreciated because did popular thing well be true to say that always gave touch of distinction to detective story tale of adventure so gave where be not valued because be not expected in sense in department of work at least carried on tradition of artistic conscience of stevenson technical liberality of writing penny dreadful so a to make worth pound in short story a in historical study did indeed permit to be poetic in more direct serious fashion in touch upon such tale a same truth may be traced be good general rule that poet can be known not only in poem in very title of poem in case of many work of bernard cape lake of wine for instance title be poem case must alone illustrate what mean about certain transforming individual magic with touched mere melodrama of mere modernity numberless novel of crime have be concerned with lost stolen jewel lake of wine be merely name of ruby yet even name be original exactly in detail be hardly ever original hundred of such precious stone have be scattered through sensational fiction hundred of have be called sun of sultan eye of vishnu star of bengal even in such trifle a choice of title indescribable individual fancy be felt sub conscious dream of sea like sunset red a blood intoxicant a wine be small example same element cling a if unconsciously to course of same story many eighteenth century hero have ridden on long road to lonely house bernard cape by something fine personal in treatment doe succeed in suggesting at least along particular road to particular house man have ever ridden before might put truth flippantly therefore falsely by saying put superior work into inferior work must not admit distinction for deny that there be necessarily anything inferior in sensationalism when can really awaken sensation truer way of stating must perhaps be to type of work generally be for anybody else work of invention always added at least one touch of imagination detective mystery tale in last book be experiment involves in problem for artist a odd a of problem put to policeman detective story might well be in special sense spiritual tragedy since be story in even moral sympathy may be in doubt police romance be almost only romance in hero may turn out to be villain villain to be hero know that mr osbaldistones business have not be betrayed by son frank though possibly by nephew rashleigh be quite sure that colonel newcomes company have not be conspired against by son clive though possibly by nephew barnes there be stage in story like moonstone when be meant to suspect franklin blake hero a be suspected by rachel verinder heroine there be stage in mr bentleys trent last case when figure of mr marlowe be a sinister a figure of mr manderson obvious result of technical trick be to make impossible at least unfair to comment not only on plot even on character since of character must be unknown quantity italian say that translation be treason here at least be case where criticism be treason have too great love lust for roman policier to spoil sport in so unsportsmanlike fashion can not forbear to comment on ingenious inspiration by in story one of character contrives to remain really unknown quantity by trick of verbal evasion defends half convincingly a scruple of verbal veracity be quality of bernard cape romance that remains in own memory quality a be too subtle for own subject men may well go back to find poem thus embedded in prose g k chesterton dedication mr bernard cape wish to express gratitude to mr chesterton for appreciative introduction to husband last work to mr k cook for invaluable assistance in preparing for press winchester content introduction first meeting with

brought fortuitously acquainted with french baron sort of technical friendship might be called have procured latter occasional invitation of late to wildshott le sage came for chess proved very welcome for there be sort of soothing tolerance about well informed urbanity of polished man of world be a good a lenitive to splenetic invalid nobody unless be sir calvin appeared to know anything concerning whether be rich indigent what if dependent on wit did for living be meaning value of title in englishman if english be whether in short be shady baron of chevalier dindustrie order

being young man of caution in addition to great native curiosity kept wit active suspicion if have close game proceeded badly enough on part of hugo who be generally skilful player fouled missed so many shot that form presently became scandal phew whistled opponent after peculiarly villainous attempt whats gone wrong with young man laughed vexedly then in sudden transition to violence threw cue

amazingly pretty with cast of feature hebe like beauty of hair eye complexion about whose fascination two properly constituted mind must disagree be domestic servant be young morning goddess fresh from unsullied dawn of nature psyche butterfly cressid like enough if be younger thought le sage even carolled a went down to dinner chapter iv be interested in baron from bickerdike m seemed conscious somehow at dinner on night of arrival of feeling of electricity in domestic atmosphere having clue such a later course of event came to supply to origin diagnosed simply vulgarly a vibration from family jar of sort to even most dignified well regulated household can not always rise superior sir calvin exacting domineering must never at best of time be considered tactful autocrat prey to hereditary foe appeared often to go out of way to be thought detestable when such be case habit of harping on grievance must become exquisite torture propensity for persisting in unwelcome more saw

antonferry considerable market town lying eight nine mile north of wildshott have be robbed question be by whom that question have be answered in upshot by astute scotland yard detective who in spite of obloquy thrown upon kind by mr sherlock holmes have shown considerable sagacity in tracing crime to source in bank own manager startling dnouement accused on strength of expert evidence have be committed to stand trial at winton quarter session be issue of event be interesting sir calvin have have dealing with bank in question have even be brought into personal contact with delinquent official seems ended that there can be doubt about verdict ridgway be clever dog detective queried le sage general nodded sort must be sorry if thief to have laid on trail supposing left none questioned baron with smile ah said sir calvin having nothing better to reply have often thought said le sage that if crime realised own opportunity there must be use for detective at eh why not asked host because there must be nothing to find out answered baron how dye mean nothing to find out nothing idea now of successful crime be not crime baffle investigator crime doe not appear a crime at

exaggerated effect became suddenly talkative where have be taciturn almost boisterously communicative where have be reserved noticed that drank good deal detected curiously a thought hint of desperation under feverish gaiety in may be said be appropriating to myself without authority sort of watching brief on behalf of purely chimerical client have real justification for suspecting baron on own account in association with friend apparent state be presumptive that sir calvin knew at least a much about man a did still thought so long a preserved attitude of what may call sympathetic vigilance la sourdine nothing must be lost something even might be gained common atmosphere perhaps affected with others inclined to unusually observant mood mood may be prone to attach over importance to trifle thus must find food for in incident so ordinary a following there be certain picture on wall genre painting to le sage sitting opposite referred in connexion sir calvin replying remarked that so so have declared one of figure to be out of proportion too short too tall forget in order to measure discrepancy interposed after manner of connoisseur finger between eye subject

hugh disquieting business of gun insistence on sticking to weapon be inevitable that mind must instinctively leap to association between catastrophe so seemingly corollary in nature instrumentality be odd ever since meeting with baron in simpson smoking room sense a of vague fatality have seemed to overcloud be formless impalpable be there like unnerving atmosphere precedes according to people who know earthquake that first sick alarm be not long in dissipating in in fine scorn thing to recovered judgment be simply incredible apart from brutal clumsiness unthinking recklessness of such deed be there in knowledge of friend to justify such horrible assumption spoilt be selfish be doubt always last man in world to incline to personal violence sensitiveness to pain almost morbid on account of others be rather characteristic excess of affection charm weakness must not have done of course for mad reason a came to learn particular of tragedy so far a be known guessed suspicion le base though

murder must have be committed who have seen spoken with there that be keeping assignation with whom who must a yet say have too good reason to dread friend susceptibility where adorable feminine be concerned must not forget how time of assignation if such be have coincided with of leaving shoot thought may be a unjustified assumption a other still for sake of argument admit one thing at least be accounted for with wire strung nature a hughs consciousness of guilty intrigue must be quite enough to induce in state of recklessness excitability have so bothered perplexed be still in fact perplexing at dinner on night of murder when after withdrawal of audrey servant much discussion of tragic subject took place later when be for brief time alone together in billiard room be not so much that be not shocked horrified with rest of a emotion be expressed in such extraordinary form made lament one moment go into half hysterical laughter next now utter raging imprecation against dastard capable of so damnable crime now assert that jealousy be probably responsible for that man who have not felt jealousy have right to sit in judgment on passion be after not so much passion a demoniac possession then must declare that thing being done be good making miserable about rally on long face said made feel worse than hundred murder horror of thing have doubt unhinged coupled with knowledge

sanction within couple of hour of despatch sergeant be safe at wildshott already engaged over preliminary of business personally admit felt greatly relieved by appearance on scene notable writer have somewhat humoured belief in fatuity of professional detective be with view think to exalt own incomparable amateur rather than to discredit singularly capable body of men having pretty persistent record of success to justify being intellectuality be at least not absent by inference from face when saw felt that case be in safe hand that henceforth might one of cast burden of personal responsibility have unwittingly overhung spirit sergeant be installed in house lost time in getting to work in reassuring business like way went in first instance to view body have be laid on table in gun room with policeman one of two brought over night before by chief constable friend of sir calvin in person to watch door thereafter established in general study briefly reviewed evidence of such

remove body be present during whole think of examination for following reason happened that baron on way to study met in hall when attacked thought rather impertinently on question of punctilio do not think friend said that under circumstance must be decent of to offer to terminate visit supposing here now address sir calvin on subject be very much annoyed baron said be not accustomed to seek advice in matter of conduct certainly will not do a propose apart from question of deserting friend in crisis think that suggestion of leaving now must look like desire to avoid inquiry for part be far from wishing to do must bear very bad complexion can act a like be intention to see thing through o very well said then will speak for alone why must wish to escape instinctive suspicion of reawakened on moment wondered true must not have perpetrated crime hugo evidence must not permit of supposition must not be somehow implicated in a instigator abettor determined then there to keep very close observation on m le baron entered room together since must not suffer going in alone to misrepresent sir calvin be there with son detective saw last for first time be quite typical hawkshaw handsome at lithe man of middle height with keen dark aquiline face clean shaven jaw chin must have thought young man for work reputation did not look more than thirty five might have be le about mental ability if one must judge by indication there be question certain rather truculent dandyism in dress contrasted oddly with intellectuality of feature showed little over emphatic in matter of trouser crease collar scarf pin tilted black plush homburg hat when out of door at slightly theatrical angle taste after be question not of mind of breeding man who have like disraeli to stand on head for living may be excused little ostentation in process looked at searchingly a entered sergeant said sir calvin be baron le sage whom mentioned to a having encountered unfortunate young woman in copse little before detective nodded must like to ask question of sir le sage told what knew be very little only of value in so far a touched upon evidence of time must have be little before half past two when met said shortly after three said detective turning to hugo when came by same path sir have little talk with like gentleman talk said baron smiling be of briefest exchanged pleasant word two passed on yours said detective to hugh be perhaps of more prolonged sort may have be sergeant be friend answer be looking pale composed manner be absolutely frank unequivocal see said poor annie be after one of household there be nothing out of way in stopping to speak with may have chatted for ten minute must think no longer while put down gun lighted cigarette be back at house by quarter past three thereabouts remembered returned for gun must have be just about four oclock so that murder if murder be must have be committed time between pm be so suppose detective stood a if mutely weighing few fact at disposition for moment two then turned to general will want evidence of identity sir calvin said housekeeper suppose engaged young woman can see mr bingley be rung for in interval while awaiting appearance le sage approached host pardon sir calvin said before proceed further must not prefer must withdraw can not feel that visit be proving untimely that be better must relieve of embarrassment of general broke in forcibly not bit of there nothing to conceal damn man beyond helping sergeant what can to find out truth dont see why even tenour of way need disturb by so much a thought no came for chess youll stay for chess sentiment while justifying own attitude pretty effectually disposed of baron affected perhaps interested scruple smiled with tiny shrug well if be not in way addressed detective ruling passion see sergeant ridgway do play chess little answered man cautious even in admission great game game said baron well play one of day when youre needing distraction from labour very well sir responded detective civilly at moment mr bingley entered room wildshott be by common assent fortunate in housekeeper be good soul good manager strict tolerant ruling by tact alone spare wiry virgin angularity despite courtesy title be of sort one associate with blessed woman in old painted manuscript firmness patience showed in capable face to agitation have now lent rather red eyed pallor bowed to sir calvin faced detective quietly wanted to speak with sir just few word answered young woman name mr bingley be annie evans sir age be just by own statement turned twenty three have communicated with relation indeed never referred to have mean of finding out annie be very reserved girl surely when engaged did so by advertisement sir through lady time newspaper be in immediate need of under housemaid there be difficulty about local girl put advertisement in paper a have often done before preferring method to agency answered be about two month ago former employer be mr wilson sir have gone to new zealand left written character with annie be quite against custom to take servant with only written character in instance be persuaded to break rule character given be so excellent girl so modest attractive hm then saw before engaging went up to see at office of paper by own appointment be so struck by manner appearance settled with then there be to come down two day later to best of memory never inquired about people must have spoken of received letter never spoke of to knowledge that of fellow servant to whom have put question a to letter annie certainly did receive one now again one two quite recently have be looking can find trace of must have be just like funny sensitive way to destroy one of detective be silent for moment dark scrutinizing eye fixed on speaker face a if be pondering significance to in answer what became of written character asked presently returned to sir be customary to do so in case must want to use again that being so must have thought must have kept yes sir have not come across may be in box have not looked must overhaul box mr bingley did think now of making inquiry about mr wilson must have be useless have already sailed for new zealand do remember address wrote so far a can recollect from savoy hotel sergeant ridgway took envelope from pocket making note on back of returned into keeping

came down later on understand there be fine scene between two men be renewed next day at dinner when annie wasnt there in end after having come to blow be separated went out cabanis first mr cleghorn little later be truth sir now may go think be sorry for baron appeared so obvious whither trend of detective inquiry must henceforth carry sat quite quiet with only smile on face louis be not vindictive be sole thing contented with saying sir calvin turned to detective do need mr bingley more not for present answered sergeant housekeeper left room have expected from on disappearance significant look gesture betokening acceptance of inevitable conclusion made such sign merely resumed business conduct of case knew better than doubt that in crime most obvious be often most unreliable must find girl relation if possible sir calvin said can leave to however what must advise if box yield clue must be advertisement in paper examination of of servant ensued upon beyond fact of supplying corroborative testimony a to quarrel evidence be of little interest omit here baron disappeared during course of inquiry so secretively that think be only one who noticed going at end detective expressed desire to examine scene of crime if one of said must conduct there must be satisfied must ask more did not want crowd ventured to volunteer be accepted sir calvin have looked towards son hugh with reason sufficient have declined to go have sat throughout inquiry after giving own evidence perfectly still with sort of white small smile on lip thinking own thought be sorry for sergeant made for coppice passing constable at gun room door nodded to thats poor thing inside said a went on what lot of trouble shed save if must speak well suppose that did think shes got desert hope hell get answered ah agreed hope will turned bend a came near fatal beech tree there be baron before detective stopped with smart exclamation then went on slowly doing little amateur detective work on own sir asked sarcastically be considering friend answered baron becomes interesting to see since man be involved who said be involved sir ah who now can see very distinctly sergeant where body lay just one ugly token sign of struggle think ground too hard to have left trace of footprint wont disturb at work wouldnt sir said detective pretty bluntly can undertake fancy to leave to

body business began mr redstall winton solicitor watched case on behalf of sir calvin deceased family being unrepresented mr fyler barrister at law appeared for police report of subsequent proceeding be summarised in following note evidence of identification being in first instance required sergeant ridgway of scotland yard detective force stated that have be found impossible so far in spite of effort made to trace out deceased relation have made journey to london whence girl have be originally engaged for express purpose of inquiring have failed wholly to procure information on subject agency have be communicated with name did not figure anywhere on book advertisement appealing to next of kin have be inserted in number of newspaper without a yet eliciting response called on mr bingley to repeat statement have already made to regarding deceased engagement by housekeeper having complied asked coroner in default of more intimate proof to accept only evidence of identification procurable at moment further attempt must be made of course to elucidate mystery a by way of deceased former employer mr wilson that lady being gone to new zealand might prove a difficult to trace a evans own connexion in event long time must elapse before answer must be obtained from search of girl box personal belonging though minutely conducted by housekeeper have failed to yield clue whatsoever in short so far a thing went that be whole matter sergeant spoke now a hereafter always with visible effect not only on jury on coroner cool keen aspect pruned essential phrase awful halo with position a great london detective surrounded not to speak of local reputation have lately acquired weighted word to admiring provincial mind with gravity authority be final if said that thing be be coroner clerk entered on minute name of annie evans domestic servant age twenty three family condition unknown case proceeded mr hugo kennett be first witness called gave evidence quietly clearly though with sign of emotion when referred to discovery of dead body relation of event have already be given need not here be repeated essential fact be that have entered bishop walk on fatal afternoon shortly after three oclock have encountered stood talking with girl for period estimated at ten minute have then continued way to house may have reached about later just a struck four have suddenly remembered leaving gun in copse have returned to retrieve with result known body be lying on face from attitude nature of injury must appear that shot have be fired from direction of road went at once to raise alarm at conclusion of evidence counsel rose to put few question to witness q say mr kennett left at once on discovering body to give alarm yes q leaving gun where be forgot spoke generally not realising that point might be important q see that may be quite q secured gun first then yes did have to pas body to do not liking job driven to in sort of insane instinct to get thing into safe keeping when be too late see blamed for having in sort of way contributed to deed by carelessness be very much agitated q mean that in opinion crime might never have be committed have not gun offered to sudden temptation yes be what mean q be convinced then that shot be fired from particular weapon seems reasonable to conclude so q why have left with one of barrel loaded when saw again have be discharged q will swear to one barrel having be loaded when left leaning against tree to best of belief be q will swear to that can not actually swear to be practically convinced of fact q did notice when took up gun again if barrel barrel be warm never thought of q dont think must have be well if have occurred to dont think must have done better to leave gun alone altogether until police arrived witness for first time exhibiting little irritability under catechism dare say must have be better be agitated tell situation be new to one doesnt think of proper thing to do on occasion unless one be lawyer just took gun with chucked into gun room a passed hating infernal thing q very natural under circumstance be sure now question shot be fired consider from direction of road at what distance from deceased must knowledge a sportsman put judging roughly must say about fifteen foot q about distance be to say between tree against have leaned gun spot where body be found yes q then inference be that gun have suddenly be seized by one from position fired replaced where be suppose so q reached house say about left again on way to copse just a struck four must mind telling how disposed of interval with temper be in own den time what on earth have that to do with matter q everything sir touching on critical movement of witness in case of sort matter wish to ask for instance if during interval from to oclock heard sound report like of gun being discharged if have must probably have paid attention to sound of gun be nothing very uncommon with q ask if be aware of such sound not that can remember mr fyler be advocate of old bailey complexion colourless black eyebrowed moist thick rinded whose constant policy be to provoke hostility in witness with object of bullying for into submission committal with reason in present case to respect none to suspect deponent professional habit must nevertheless not permit to cast examination in wholly conciliatory form q now mr kennett must ask to be very particular in reply to question be about to put to came upon annie evans understand shortly after entering copse put down gun with purpose of speaking to with purpose of lighting cigarette q did speak with yes have said so q placed gun against tree where afterwards found yes q be deceased then standing near further in by tree where body be found be standing amazing purport in question seemed suddenly here to burst upon witness uttered violent ejaculation great god be meaning to suggest that fired shot sensation q be suggesting nothing of sort of course will answer if please whether after have put aside gun came towards walked towards recovering with obvious difficulty came towards q so a to bring within view will say of one who might be watching from road thereabouts just possibly might if person have come inside gate q must mind telling be subject of brief conversation with deceased asked what be doing there q just so answered kennett o what one might expect q evasively be to say yes q did twit possibly with being there for assignation something of sort might q admitted of course not laughter q what else must mind saying understood from that have come out to escape company in kitchen seemed there have be row regarding between cleghorn butler prisoner wanted to get away from said that foreigner have paid unwelcome attention have tried to kiss for have boxed ear that ever since have gone in fear of life from sensation took more for joke than formal complaint did not suppose to be serious did not occur to that be really frightened of man must have taken step for protection q be be essential q thank mr kennett will not trouble further witness turned retired evidence have yielded something of unexpected in incredulous little outburst in conclusion a to first be patent that counsel object in putting question have provoked be to suggest maddened jealousy a motive for crime on part of one to whom girl action have become suddenly visible through movement towards witness between whom have possibly occurred philandering passage such at least from witness own implied admission of certain freedom in conversation with deceased must appear justifiable assumption final statement though legally inadmissible inasmuch a supplied motive with name caused profound stir in court mr anna bingley housekeeper to sir calvin kennett be next witness

admire q one in especial to excite jealousy q did deceased give confidence not what might call confidence be very friendly q never spoke to of past life of former situation of relation never be not what might call communicative young woman q have reason to suspect that be carrying on with anybody unknown to reason sir cant answer for thought q what do mean by why might have wondered now again why be so obstinate in resisting q suspected rival in particular ask again man may think thing q will answer question well then didnt q be speaking truth yes witness be subjected to severe cross questioning on point persisted in refusal to associate suspicion with particular person argued only negatively said from deceased indifference to declared amid laughter be utterly incomprehensible to on other supposition than of previous attachment counsel then continued q when after leaving garden be making for red deer did observe other figure on hill going in same direction a in advance of there may have be wont answer for sure q will explain what mean by that be what might call preoccupied not thinking much of anything own trouble yes have idea there be one q how be dressed cant say

groome gardener be next called stated that be sweeping up leaf in drive to east side of house be to say side furthest from copse on afternoon of murder have heard stable clock strike three shortly afterwards have seen young master come out of head of bishop walk go towards house entered by front door be looking thought in bit of temper young master be like in stew one moment over little thing next laughing joking over something mattered have wondered at seeing back so soon from shooting supposed have shot wild a sometimes must be in pet about did not see again until witness be summoned to copse to help remove body q during time be sweeping in drive did hear sound of shot amany sir gentleman be out with gun q did one shot sound to nearer than others one sounded pretty loud q a if comparatively close by yes might be q from direction of bishop walk couldnt rightly say sir wasnt carrying day sound on such day travel very deceptive might have come from across road further q at what time did hear particular shot might have be three oclock little later couldnt be sure q think again couldnt be sure sir shouldnt like to swear q might have be nearer half past three very like dare say might point be urged witness persisted in refusing to commit to more definite statement john tugwood coachman edward noakes groom martha jolly lodge keeper be called examined on same subject have distinguished thought have distinguished louder shot in question evidence a to precise time be so hopelessly contradictory that reliance must be placed on sergeant detective ridgway deposed that having be put in charge of case by sir calvin kennett have proceeded to make examination of spot where body have be found be twenty four hour after commission of alleged crime might be thought possible that certain local change have occurred during interval understood however that police have when first called in conducted exhaustive investigation of place that conclusion differed in material degree from own so that be permitted to speak for in few detail have to place before jury briefly note comprised following observation measured distance from wicket in boundary hedge to tree against witness mr hugo kennett have stated that rested gun be nineteen quarter yard thence to beech tree by body have be found be fifteen foot between wicket first tree there be curve in track

then slipped into undergrowth silently worked way to point of concealment first mentioned where must be eye ear witness of what be passing between two have subsequently whether torn by passion of revenge of jealousy issued noiselessly forth few minute after mr kennetts departure seized up gun at once following brief altercation shot deceased dead a be moving to escape from conformably with theory there be sign of struggle having occurred there be sign that murderer have moved conducted with great caution circumspection unfortunately evidence a to footprint must be adduced ground being in too hard dry state to record impression finally be bound to say that there be nothing in theory incompatible with assumption that prisoner be one responsible for deed on other hand be true that man movement between time when witness henstridge have seen descending towards road time of commission of crime must not have be earlier than three oclock have still to be accounted for be possible of course that have occupied interval of three quarter of hour in stalking in finally running to earth victim if must produce witness to prove contrary theory of course collapsed sergeant delivered

uttered threat q on afternoon of murder on return to house a just described inquired for prisoner inquired for then again later on return from copse after have be to view body q be troubled about perhaps be uneasy until have seen questioned q when be that came in about five oclock be immediately sent up to q asked perhaps to account for absence did q what be explanation made frank confession

indecision have then said gone for long walk over down fighting way demon of rage jealousy possessed have finally getting better of black unreasoning mood grown thoroughly repentant ashamed of behaviour have returned to make amends q credited that wonderful story believed implicitly q well indeed sir did appear overcome by news have greeted on return appeared stupefied be word q did comment on at if mean in self incriminating sense did not q in what sense then cursed assassin capable of destroying so sweet paragon of womanhood laughter q very disinterested of im sure thank sir will suffice counsel sitting down mr redstall for sir calvin rose to put question two to witness q have never have reason m le baron to regard prisoner a vindictive man never impulsive yes q truthful transparently so to childish degree q must have difficulty in dissembling insuperable difficulty must think dr harding of longbridge be last witness called deposed to having be summoned to house on afternoon of murder to having examined body within hour half of first discovery in copse cause of death be gunshot wound in back from weapon fired at short range practically whole of charge have

yes completed evidence at conclusion of of remark by coroner jury after brief consultation among brought in verdict that deceased died from gunshot wound deliberately inflicted by prisoner louis

be to prove that isnt how can be done at expense only be afraid of finding real criminal have idea who be laughed actually laughed aloud have not have enough of cross examination must not help wondering why a have be told confessed to warning gave poor girl about danger of tempting hot blood so forth yes that be truth yes put finger to lip glancing at with solemnity be not going to say that be way to repress truth answered girl with little flush only not to blurt out unnecessarily dear said take word for always speak truth o only meant to say began stopped what must do if question be put to for reason of expediency good feeling did not wish to answer be afraid must fib try plan answer with question save world of responsibility be secret confide to answer may often be interpreted into innuendo be a false to speaker meaning a be unjust to subject love truth so much must not expose to misunderstanding in instance to have left truth for one else to discover might have cast suspicion on thereby darkening case against louis in general not to answer be surely not to lie suppose not baron thought little wonder if must answer just one question what be do put faith in talk about there having be man on hill besides did not reply for awhile went softly patting hand on arm presently looked up if be to say yes must not speak truth if be to say must not speak truth so follow bent will

servant girl said in hard sort of way be not kind to bother about consequence to others where own gratification be concerned ive knocked up against pretty bad case in time so thats what gather from medical report partly from that not wholly ah dare say now being on such friendly term with mr kennett youve be taken into confidence not directly in way invited to form own conclusion what then doesnt affect case doe except in suggesting possible motive for crime on part of jealous rival thats of consequence of course except to girl from other point of view assurance satisfied taken by sympathetic candour must not refrain from opening rankling mind to bit truth be said that moment came down saw there be something wrong with friend indeed have written to to imply a much be upset like be commented detective be in very odd mood said aggravated form of hysteria must call have never known quite like before though a dare say have gathered temperament be excitable one up down like see

have done what wanted to do left gun behind wretched business might never have happened ah said detective feel that dare say doesnt help to cheer up well sir id get out if be distract thought make forget wont mend whats done by moping very well answered to talk about making forget when im forced to affect ignorance of very thing want to forget if be right what be to do might think that after having have down for express purpose of advising a have doubt be case in scrape must take more into confidence not at least resent a seemingly doe allusion to well see said detective from point of view scrape ended for so there isnt same need for advice id keep at if be after time may get to unburden have not much hope after what have passed between held sergeant recommendation in mind resolved to watch for encourage least disposition to candour might show on friend part perhaps have gone little further than must have in taking detective into confidence about scandal after be more than surmise be so patent to that judgment ran must run with own that must have be simply idle to pretend ignorance of situation about two men of intelligence must possibly have come to differing conclusion moreover a ridgway have admitted true not incident have direct bearing on case day at wildshott otherwise little eventless for a outsider found certain mitigation of dullness in suspicion

stair cat footed at newel post crowned with great carved wyvern kennett device stood to reconnoitre pressing face to wood looking round with one eye at once perceived that must need venture further

proceed what course to take decision be not reached until after much debating within might be guided by general chance assertion that important document have be lost mislaid in room in case must act at once if on other hand made such statement might very well be day week before loss be brought home to in event must say nothing about discovery trusting to lead criminal on through sense of immunity to further depredation by then might have acquired what at present lacked insight into nature meaning of design holding key to must face with discovery must not tell sir calvin a yet in such case

when moment be ripe not before then having so far justified remaining on a guest must go in meanwhile must make especial individual province to expose rascal thereby refute audreys detestable calumny of a sort of unpleasant eavesdropper hanger on perhaps must learn to regret insult when saw in what fashion have retaliated on chapter xiii accumulating evidence wednesday of third week following inquest be appointed for magisterial inquiry during interval sergeant ridgway be busily occupied presumably in accumulating piecing together various evidence of what consisted one knew did appear whether not trend on whole be favourable disastrous to unhappy prisoner at expense possibly of cleghorn possibly to complete exculpation of injured man detective kept own counsel after manner of kind if have thought to extract from cover of sealed book hint of content reassuring message at least must have be gathered from unlettered sombreness nobody asked fearful of being thought to profane majestic muteness of oracle labouring atmosphere lowered unlightened a day went on even m le baron most individually concerned in fate of henchman made attempt to plumb official profundity that in spite of curiosity about most thing seemed indeed oddly passive about whole business never referring to indirectly so far a appeared taking step to interview prisoner supply with mean of defence if sneering allusion be made to insensibility by mr bickerdike audrey be present must be hot in friend vindication may have be that in course of queer association have confided to sufficient reason for behaviour old viv on other hand saw in attitude only proof of process of corruption have suspected whatever case cheerfully detached baron remained asking question of detective taking chess life with

more than house keeper mr bingley with whom have be accustomed to take meal who have found when once awe of office be overcome most entertaining guest full of intelligence rich in anecdote deeply interested in everything appertaining to wildshott from family portrait accumulated collection to beauty of ground of country in lay situated must have be said one day to master to whom be lamenting sergeant prolonged absence such relief to man of occupation to be able to forget even for hour two in such noble surroundings perhaps want to show that he taking advantage of attention paid lest might think be trying to worm into confidence can be that have already found out from that want to know observed le sage who be present on occasion with humorous look im sure sir said mr bingley with asperity that be incapable of meanness if have heard express sentiment have must never hint such charge there be delicacy of feeling take word for at bottom of change in cant help fearing that mean have found out something fresh something even more distressful to family make chary of accepting hospitality only hope paused with little sigh youre thinking of cleghorn broke in master damme ill never believe in respectability again if man done god forbid said housekeeper wish sergeant ridgway must appear more more in old way when doe honour with company wish however be not to be fulfilled detective more more absented a day went on became more more of asian mystery in fleeting glimpse of presence vouchsafed household dark taciturn abysmal flitted casual shadow through labyrinthine mystery of crime must never be said to be here before echo of footfall be sounding in hollow far away picturesque description of process perhaps consorting in way with housekeeper fanciful rendering perhaps delicacy rather than expediency be motive of tactic perhaps having virtually completed case be keeping out of way until time came to expound perhaps feature of revision be that distressful something menacing appalling foreseen by housekeeper have plenty otherwise to do doubt in way of collecting evidence consulting counsel so forth alone gave plenty of reason for neglecting social amenity explanation however issue be not to be long delayed baron came upon unexpectedly one morning in upper ground where fruit garden be espalier sign of prosperous vegetable order there be fair view of estate to be gained from elevation sergeant appeared to be absorbed for moment in gracious prospect waited unmoving for other to join nodded a came up pleasant to snatch minute sir said to give to view like people of profession dont get many such suppose not answered le sage of good many other profession proprietary view like income be very unfairly distributed dont think well thats so doubt among wrong sort of people often enough le sage laughed be one of right sort of people sergeant wont go so far a to say that sir will go so far a to say that if owned property id come to feast eye on here more often than what sir calvin doe baron without moving head took in face of speaker saw glow subdued passion in interested what spirit of romance to be sure might lurk unsuspected under hard official rind here be last man in world whom one must have credited with sense of beauty be wrought to emotion by landscape talk said of profession not affording many such moment a now to mind seems profession for man romantically inclined doe indeed sir why dont live in perpetual atmosphere of romance think of mystery be daily food thats daily food lodging too men who pull on rope for living dont think much see much of fairy scene theyre setting thats for prosperous folk in front youd rather be one of must rather sir be police officer owner of estate like if such thing be properly distributed a say thered be need perhaps for police officer at read paper about case like ours here see only romance whose necessity put behind scene see only in nine case out of ten dirty mishandling of fate give man right position in world hell commit crime thats belief founded on experience dare say youre right comforting to know in case that valet have always fitted into place like stopper into bottle detective stood silent moment then turned on speaker with queer enigmatic look well wouldnt lose heart about if be said drily thats good said le sage can leave with tolerably safe conscience then what sir youre going away before inquiry must im afraid have business in london can no longer postpone how about evidence after what have said can not afford to do without detective considered frowning rubbing chin then said simply very well made movement to go went down garden together parted at door in wall be on saturday on following monday officer appeared for last time to arrange for

between three four oclock in afternoon at three oclock accused be proved to have be at spot good three mile away from scene of crime again at at spot five mile away representing distance even on extravagant estimate must hardly have covered within period remaining to if theory of prosecution be to be substantiated there be case in fact prosecution therefore withdrew charge magistrate put

murder did notice anything peculiar about appeared to to be upset about something q wondered perhaps having only arrived afternoon a understand what domestic tribulation must have discomposed so stately character laughter may have have always considered cleghorn a immovable institution a monument laughter greeted sally appeared to reassure witness somewhat a did unexpected line on rather irregular examination seemed to be developing confidence be of short duration very next question brought aware of true purpose of preliminary catechism be merely to constitute pretext for getting into witness box at q be arrival that afternoon may ask in response to long invitation sudden call with sudden stiffening of shoulder a if rallying energy to meet ordeal foreseen sudden call came down in response to letter from friend mr hugo kennett inviting to few day shooting q mr hugo kennett be particular friend of yours be not have known one long time q intimate to degree mean that have few

hope will forgive saying that imagination be little wont to create emergency nothing friend immediate advice assistance can overcome be apt to be in depth one moment on height next be built that way thats q be case of emergency due to imagination wont go quite so far a to say that q then there be really reason time for having down at short notice may have thought so q will come to have mentioned reason in letter to letter only said that badly wanted bucking asked to come down at once q gave explanation none q in letter afterwards when met q found in uncommunicative mood somewhat q kindly say what mean by somewhat mean while told nothing definite about reason for having down did seem to hint that there be trouble somewhere q what be exact word cant remember q be to effect that be in devil

two mr bickerdike memory may need refreshing did find friend manner now a strange a talk might often have seemed strange on such occasion to who did not know q answer question please reluctantly well be strange q stranger than have ever known to be before perhaps so q suggest that be wild reckless to degree manner of man who have got into hopeless scrape saw way out of social material ruin be very strange can say more q must have considered state compatible with of young man of good position prospect who have entangled with girl greatly social inferior be threatened by with exposure unless in common phrase made honest woman of mr redstall rising to object bench ruled that question be inadmissible have created however profound impression in court from moment never abated counsel accepting

oclock fancy about time q at moment heard there have be murder committed that conjecture association between friend murdered girl came into mind be wholly preposterous of course dismissed idea moment occurred to q dismissed idea of mr kennetts having be involved with girl of having committed murder sensation q still thought entanglement possible thought might account for state q why did first idea associating mr kennett with crime occur to witness hesitating question be repeated in low voice o just because of something nothing important have happened at shoot extraordinary state have found in q will tell bench what be unimportant something happened at shoot with emotion be nothing probably fancy denied utterly q now mr bickerdike if please thought in in pulling gun through particular hedge

aloof from even cynical official fibre supposed must not be entirely insensitive to indecency of eating salt of be planning to betray be so wroth with must have wished if for other reason than discomfiture to vindicate friend innocence thought sent harking back once more over familiar ground if hugh be innocent who be guilty if must be proved guilty even reasonably suspect whole evidence against prisoner fell into discredit who then now not overwhelming business have be enough to dismiss wholly from mind haunting suspicion regarding baron so secret so subtle so inexplicable must still be possible that be somehow implicated in affair if not be not at least remarkable that must have coincided with coming involved servant be followed by midnight theft of paper then suddenly there came to with little shock of blood memory of conversation in keeper cottage on fatal day of shoot how curious have be then on subject of poacher of method of proneness to violence on occasion have asked so innocently yet shown such shrewdness in question that even orsden have laughingly commented on discrepancy mention of muffling property of mist in matter of gunshot why be a if have wished to assure of adequacy of precaution already calculated taken to mislead bewilder in certain issue thought came upon like thunderclap be must be possible that blackguard poacher have be made instrument of diabolical plot perhaps that fourth shadowy figure have never materialised perhaps henstridge who have volunteered damning evidence whom must be one instinct to mistrust le sage henstridge in

ordinary duty sir calvin reappeared white drawn showing disposition to suffer commiseration in form relaxation from iron discipline event of next few day will pas over at short length yielded pathos embraced preparation included visit may mention here decision of general little in one direction embarrassed design just unjust to man must not have cleghorn back one must not wonder perhaps over

have surprised girl over be haunting mind how did consort with latent suspicion of mystery somewhere hugh said presently wont tell what be doing when first wont interrupted bluntly think what became to allow little decency ive told thats necessary more than have ever intended to tell when promised confidence im sorry for viv god know if have spoken to at first might have altered thing couldnt make up mind while chance existed thought did put out of last conceit that day swearing be going to expose whole story be true said may have be waiting there on chance of passing swear didnt know have few word gave promise passed on evidence about shot be black lie can say no more than give word leave at making comment drawing conclusion if admission a to first emotion on learning of release might repel people can only plead that one man psychology like one man meat may be impossible of digestion by found confess hard to stomach then have never be spoilt wayward only son talked little time longer on matter have indeed be main object of visit nature of counsel for defence have undertaken at sir calvin instance to go to london interview lawyer on subject thus sparing father bitter trial

than own limitation must permit be pining for baron suppose said on day goaded at last to speak by insufferable manner towards taunt be effective at least in opening mouth be always hinting unpleasant thing about baron mr bickerdike answered turning sharply on dont think little mean to be continually slandering in underhand way saw be still to be battle prepared guard be perverse way of looking at audrey answered quietly from point of view be just trying to help friend by maligning to enemy answered suppose be why confided to sergeant ridgway knew about hughs affair gave certain shock knew that

thank for smile know be in heart be to help hugh over difficult place foresaw for weakness be in thinking other men a honourable a anyhow stab be rather misplaced since wasnt maligning a say friend to enemy other way about a see well dont see said insolently perhaps just consider a possible may happen to know more about baron than do o dare say he be yarning to answered quite plausibly enough to credulous listener if be wouldnt attach too much importance to what tell about ill say no more a to own suspicion though event have not modified can assure will say that regard for brother must at least incline to go warily in matter may have very strong bearing on interest stood conning moment two in silence please to be explicit said then do mean that believe baron to be real criminal positively jumped good heaven cried dont make responsible for such wild statement mean only that in face of brother awful situation must be scrupulously careful to hing might seem to impair effort of

left poor foolish creature be no good trying to convince gave up attempt then there chapter xvii audrey audrey have be starting for walk when detained by interview recorded in last chapter left burning with indignation passionate resentment that man must call friend of hughie conceive for one moment possibility of guilt pretended to be intimate did not even know how hated such laodicean ally that must dare to try to involve in doubt half concession be infamous have needed all sense of confidence father placed in of authority to act for have delegated to to stop from saying something so cuttingly rude that even must not have consented to swallow insult remain on did mr bickerdike a know sad injustice truth be one suspect that in business of friend exoneration unhappy gentleman be flying in face of own conscience doing for pure loyalty sake must not quite bring to argue against appearance in justice sense hoped tried to take rosy view of own hope be not to be expected of of disposition that must feel express that blind incorrigible staunchness to ideal natural in devoted blood relation yet must be counted to that be staunch too on behalf of cause in heart mistrusted

recall mr bickerdike how at dinner on night of first arrival here host in answer to observation of mine about certain picture hanging on wall raised second finger of right hand before eye to test alleged misproportion in one of figure of composition action though of course be already familiar with sir calvin injury instantly arrested attention vision of caf lunivers of busy hat sketcher leapt

confirm truth of man story news that second john ridgway be at work in neighbourhood in considered alone there lay ground perhaps for wondering entertainment surely none for suspicion be only when murder occurred that thought of connexion amongst part flashed inevitably into mind since fate have placed if in hand in mine what clue might exist to truth be determined from moment to pursue to end key to found in skeleton key again macuba came into requisition again baron savoured over refreshing pinch excitement of hearer skeleton key repeated discovered before ever sergeant john ridgway have have chance of looking for on very spot where poor thing body have lain must have be jerked from hand have probably just produced from pocket by shot killed have remained there undetected during after removal be fortunate in securing only few minute before sergeant came down to examine place of crime now what have annie evans to do with skeleton key modest servant girl of irreproachable character a housekeeper have just informed examined key be of usual burglarious pattern seemed newly turned have slight flaw projection on barrel end be splashed with ugly bluebeard red have annie after be quite impeccable person mr bingley supposed wondered thought of manner of engagement of untraceable connexion wondered wondered still at inquest when a seemed same relation be still hopelessly to seek wondered no longer when on day following inquiry came upon sergeant intently examining ground about scene of crime came upon unexpectedly surprised what be looking for have already overhauled detail of girl belonging have missed something have expected to find among skeleton key possibly how must have known possessed thing obviously there be only one answer because have provided with for what reason john ridgway naturally mind flew off at tangent to other john ridgway parisian jean extraordinary story reputedly sham marriage nevertheless have turned out genuine document in proof possessor host be conceivable that john ridgway be interested in recovery of document have employed female confederate to steal for be quite conceivable quite true for a appeared by degree be actually case why be john ridgway interested in recovery of paper will see in meanwhile to what conviction have reflection led that detective girl be in collusion for certain purpose much be to be deduced from conviction that girl be imposter that have secured situation very possibly by mean of false character written by confederate that quite certainly name be not annie evans at hence calculated impossibility of tracing out connexion so far then so good come now to frustrated business of theft crime be terrible consequence have inevitably occurred to that safe in sir calvin study must be

stalked poor vivian looked unutterably foolish without detecting in second descent occurred after have returned to room found easy to manipulate then girl have already be secretly at work there fumbling job maybe why in case have not secured plunder given notice to leave at once cleared out because a be perfectly legitimate to infer from evidence at inquest have in meantime fallen desperately in love with young friend have refused to take further part in transaction designed to dispossess of name inheritance now be to anticipate matter little perhaps grant deduction sound a indeed proved to be what followed necessarily breach between two confederate of very violent nature to detective meant betrayal ruin of plan must consideration be enough in to goad on to murder with man of ridgways character trained cautiousness of disposition did not think probable assuming then that murder be act what more overmastering motive must have driven to what jealousy one passion uncontrollable by even most self disciplining nature be passionately enamoured of own beautiful decoy have betrayed not only interest love crime have be in expressive french phrase in fullest sense crime passionel have to figure course of event even be now difficult task for imagination will begin with mr bingleys timely advertisement for housemaid upon confederate happened gave perhaps suggested to very opportunity desired once girl be established in house two corresponded know that received letter though none must be found after death of course not must have taken scrupulous care to destroy such incriminating evidence including fraudulent character corresponded probably on part very early in tone gave accomplice to suspect with growing uneasiness that be not right with

quite fortuitous a turned out most fateful contretemps must have happened came know from own confession what passed between with what upbraided with what threatened ridgway have overheard have arrived at place duly to appointment on first entering copse have probably heard perhaps caught distant sight of other male figure coming way have slipped into thick undergrowth for concealment propinquity

motive conduct of hated rival most of fact that to own hand by extraordinary freak of opportunism have be committed control of case how near came to success in inhuman design need retelling meanwhile there be murder committed in instant of madness probably have not much hope at time of escaping consequence probably in desperate state with scheme gone to wreck did not much care have have bloody revenge for intolerable wrong rest be indifference to replaced gun where have stood left spot possibly a sanity returned to instinct of self preservation may have induced in certain mood of precaution there be evidence to show think that lurked for time in wood before leaving for open hillside that did leave eventually to make way up hill have henstridges evidence to testify now from first have never succeeded in convincing that hypothetical figure on hill be a wholly figment of imagination a most people seemed to consider cap pulled over eye turned up collar what butler ever turned up coat

object possibly that in experience of sergeant ridgway have never seen wear on head other than black plush homburg hat answer on day of murder be wearing cloth cap easily in distance to be mistaken for cap worn by mr cleghorn know because in course of one of drive about country in company of very charming young lady have made point of calling at sergeant one time lodging at antonferry have procured address from sir calvin where at cost of little insinuative word play be able to ascertain that sergeant have gone out wearing cloth cap fairly early on day of murder that have returned late seemingly in exhausted condition from long walk have that hypothetical figure hurrying over hill at moment with little concern for safety have be figure of sergeant ridgway tramping back to lodging in antonferry after murder have passed by inn making north by west have long turned bend of lonely road before mr cleghorn mistaken by henstridge for same figure have arrived at red deer turned in at tap baron paused for refreshment while sir francis applauded softly whole face beaming delight approval have convinced so far continued narrator of efficiency of toil in be manuvring to entangle suspect very well here be little pice de conviction in spying about scene of crime have picked up in addition to skeleton key button be common horn coat button be lying on spot whence gun have be fired jerked off probably by recoil now sergeant overcoat be one of light covert coat button under overlapping hem took occasion to examine one day when occupied with sir calvin have left in hall have be fitted observed with set of brand new button nevertheless did not correspond with little button on cuff exactly matched button have found while others be of distinctly different pattern obviously have discovered loss have failed again to make good so for precaution sake have renewed entire set be unpardonable oversight in such man to have forgotten sleeve made button over to must be exact duplicate of have procured telling in innocence where have found took little blow very well without wince must see how disturbed never suspected think of more than amiable curiosity have often wondered why because wasnt fool interposed mr bickerdike with slight groan le sage laughed because be more of knave than appear said so let bygone be bygone helped to weighty pinch of rappee put down box with grave expression come now said to supreme crux of apparently damning evidence a to when fatal shot be fired if be fired somewhere about three oclock at time stated by two witness then hugo kennett none hugo kennett must be despite specious argument to contrary actual murderer be not fired at three oclock a believe will find reason to convince be fired good twenty twenty five minute later be justification for saying so will remember at magisterial inquiry witness daniel groome revising former evidence stated that have heard clock in master study strike quarter past three by then having gone round to back of house thereby proving that report of gun have reached while be still at front must have occurred during first quarter of hour now have taken pain since return to question daniel groome very closely on matter with what result will be surprised to hear stable clock to daniel be accustomed to listen strike quarter one for first two for second so on study clock to daniel be not accustomed to listen strike half hour only single stroke single stroke represented to daniel quarter past therefore concluded when heard that single stroke sound from master study that be recording first quarter instead of a actually be second on ingenuous evidence not realizing in least what be doing be that simple man prepared to tighten noose about young master neck if daniel groome be wrong followed of necessity that henstridge must be wrong also a of course be have be simply got at by detective officially bullied threatened into stating what be wanted of a matter of fact have have idea of what time be at have taken suggestion offered fellow be blackguard coward must swear man life away for thirty piece of silver did little persuasion with on own account again during one of refreshing drive sir francis taking leaf out of ridgways book have little difficulty in bringing to knee be abject when have finished with parenthetically may suggest here what be convinced be case that murdering friend have also got at mr fyler in sense have persuaded mean that astute lawyer into believing that there really be nothing worth considering in hypothetical figure may name fourth dimension be why take point be not taken up again by counsel before magistrate very well now have got so far a to convict sergeant ridgway of murder following on plot to disinherit with help of confederate very man whom schemed to charge with crime so arrive necessarily at question who be annie evans whom have chosen for accomplice in business whom have ended by so foully doing to death to get at whole truth of story be essential that mystery of connexion must be traced to source to one not possessed of clue fortune have placed in hand must have appeared nothing le than astonishing that with wide publicity given to case victim must have remained virtually unidentified unclaimed be beautiful be in domestic service two fact one might have thought favourable to easy solution of riddle still origin remained mystery so remains to few instructed to day very mystery to wanting master key appeared so insolvable be to who possessed key illuminating that girl be in domestic service at time of death be proof that have ever be in domestic service before must be much more in accord with conception of astute far seeing detective to suppose that have anticipated that danger of recognition by assigning to confederate part through must be impracticable must difficulty arise to trace have not be in service before in fact business of photograph confirmed in view will remember that travesty of annies likeness appeared enlarged reproduced from snap shot in official print be completely unrecognizable be intended by ridgway to be unrecognizable knew that other recent photograph of existed at for very good reason that have not for time be in position to be photographed will understand why in moment be of paramount importance to first last that accomplice must be remain unidentifiable essential to condition be innocence of former service absence of photographic record employment of false name be of use consequently thinking of running annie evans so called to earth must look for under title how be to ascertain title be here again that chance providence came will not say in totally unforeseen way at least in most obliging way to assistance occurred to that at stage of proceeding must be well for to pay visit to parisian john ridgway endeavour to extract from if must be persuaded to part with fullest detail possible of story with whose outline have already acquainted something might be much felt have remained untold if revealed must possibly throw such light upon obscure place of quest a must enable from moment to present case without flaw went to paris mr bickerdike not to london a supposed only to learn from jean bosom friend that caliste ribault of whom have already spoken that loved comrade have departed life in june of year be blow confess hope seemed baffled journey in vain yet be so far from being case not artist living lip must have more shouted truth into soul than did evidence of dead hand will tell how one day shortly before jean death caliste informed there have come to visit stepbrother englishman of whom caliste have never before heard jean spoken stepbrother bore same christian surname a jean have come accompanied by girl of such beauty that dying man must not dismiss thought of face from mind until have made from memory coloured drawing of on white washed wall writing name beneath now step brother being dead john ridgway have come once more to arrange about funeral disposition of deceased effect perceiving face on wall have be very angry so angry that have immediately seized cloth completely effaced drawing so that not vestige of remained why ask will understand later thus again fortune seemed to laugh at be laughter like of mother who dangles over mouth of child cherry to be in moment sure enough in such moment caliste informed that though picture be destroyed copy of remained in shape of photograph have taken of original showed photograph face saw be face of annie evans ivy mellor be name written underneath have found out what wanted more have discovered that two john ridgways be step brother light still light broadened on path before got ribault to part with photograph to cautioning to say nothing about possessing negative to one with prize came on following day to london thereafter task be easy one possessing face that name associating with name of famous scotland yard detective have only to place matter in hand of very clever trustworthy private inquiry agent of acquaintance to find out needed investigation with detail of need not trouble yielded following information ivy mellor have be not many month discharged from reformatory to have be committed for three year for procuring situation a nursery governess with forged character obtaining good by false pretence be illegitimate daughter of actress now dead be possessed herself of decided histrionic ability upon discharge ridgway have somehow got hold of have be got hold of by with result that have fallen complete slave to attraction be probably who have be evil genius from first probably who have planned perpetrated written character have procured entre to wildshott promised great thing in event of success in view of great thing held at arm length there be to be questionable relation between man be hopelessly infatuated used to visit under assumed name probably kept in unequivocal sense be giving here not only agent report of own conclusion drawn therefrom summarized showed case complete so far a effect be concerned have only now to penetrate to cause must be fathomed believed fathomed in one direction alone determined to go boldly to fountain head challenge there decision in sir calvin hand lay final verdict must hardly doubt what must be that for sake of whole truth must yield at last to daylight guarded secret of long past episode judged rightly need say more told story produced for examination written evidence left to deal with matter a must one remark more have to make before running a briefly a can through main point of narrative unfolded to while in paris have procured from very good friend m despard head of secret police introduction to own first commissioner saw latter confided to interested rather horrified ear whole truth of case so far a have then conceived mastered arranged with little trap be to entice john ridgway into midst again conditional always on procuring that supplementary evidence be to prove guilt beyond possibility of doubt rest know come now to final chapter like postscript to lady letter contains in hazlitt phrase pith of whole in relating choose own word must not be understood to aim at reproducing actual term in be revealed to by sir calvin wish to give mere brief abstract of painful story wish moreover to warn once more certain reflection conclusion of mine not affecting main body of narrative be be conjectural must so remain unless until accused will confirm accuracy that in soul anticipate will be case here then be story in early part of year sir calvin kennett then young cavalry officer of twenty six unmarried only latterly succeeded to inheritance be living in cairo attached a military representative to british legation there while in situation made acquaintance of very beautiful young frenchwoman mademoiselle desilles daughter of tobacconist in modest way of business between whom mutual attachment sprang up pure sincere on part passionate unscrupulous on madly enamoured yet hopeless of prevailing against virtue of lady young kennett have recourse to vile dishonourable stratagem of sham marriage effected through instrumentality of worthless acquaintance one barry skelton who have come abroad in connexion with oxford missionary society who though not yet in holy order be supposed to be qualifying for priesthood with aid of scamp cruel fraud be perpetrated mademoiselle desilles became wife a supposed of sir calvin union for reason seeming sufficient a urged by pseudo husband be kept present secret even from girl father whose death about time greatly facilitated success of imposture in july of year occurred definite revolt of arabi pasha landing at alexandria of considerable british force sir calvin be called upon to rejoin regiment in view of operation pending went leaving wife a will call in distant way to become mother in skirmish near mahmoudieh lost first finger of right hand casualty not without bearing on subsequent event be present at tel el kebir in mid september again two day later at entry of british troop into cairo when took occasion passion in interval having burned out a such mere animal transport will to break truth to mademoiselle desilles of fraud have practised on make part of business to comment on behaviour then previously to imagine spirit in revelation be received by unfortunate victim doubt of can supply probable text for a sympathy indignation may dictate be enough to state compromise by way of deceiver must find heart to propose to condone offence be other than in order to save credit that of unborn infant marriage must be instantly contrived between unhappy dupe certain quartermaster sergeant george ridgway widower with single young child boy who have be in secret yet who strangely enough have more inherent vice in than be consistent with good nature weakness for beauty in distress conscience of easiest capacity in matter of hush money man be doubt personable fellow woman situation very certainly desperate deplorable anyhow following distressful scene be brought to consent two be married shortly afterwards child be born in london whither couple have removed in interval be quite prepared to believe that george ridgway made wife good husband during few year remained to in company for did not very long survive marriage moreover sir calvin liberality have placed two in such comfortable circumstance that excuse for discontent existed quartermaster sergeant adhered honourably to part of bargain be not until long after death that question arose in widow mind a to whether not be justified in continuing to mislead son in matter of origin of in moment in meantime two child step brother in fact be brought up together considered a half brother be christened john younger through unconquerable perversity of mother in insisting on calling after seducer second name anomaly however open to curious comment at first be soon doubt lost sight of in inevitable nickname affection must come to bestow on pair still for purpose of distinction will continue to call one john other jean jean be popularly regarded a ridgways child though in truth child be born of union john though elder by three year be frequently a time went on mistaken by who did not know for younger of two boy error also not without bearing on subsequent event jean from outset betrayed if must have be guessed unmistakable sign of origin in use of second for digit finger inherited trick due to shock caused to mother by sight of sir calvin mutilation associated a have be with agony despair of time be dreamy boy early developed artistic proclivity have mean intention of tracing career of of child up to beyond manhood at period a know jean went to paris at period john joined metropolitan police force with subsequent promotion to valued position in criminal investigation department pas from ascertained fact to estimate of circumstance first engendered in latter mind thought of daring project have ended by bringing to present situation now have already told how jean on occasion of visit to england have be at last made acquainted by mother with true story of paternity told being under fear of death at time there be doubt that poor woman still believed perfectly honestly in legality of first marriage not only before heaven on practical testimony of little catholic vade mecum in name of contracting party with clerical witness have be inscribed believed moreover on strength of muddled innuendo gathered from quartermaster sergeant that creature barry skelton have deceived a much a have be deceived by sir calvin that have actually be ordained priest at time of marriage be not true think ordination having occurred subsequently a general took pain to make known to for wrote to on subject of vade mecum begging to return to hand whence have appropriated when deserted why may ask have after securing possession of persisted in retaining through year that damning witness to guilt for very same reason of evidence contained to stood for proof to for disproof of legality of marriage wherefore must not make up mind to destroy thought well to pay visit to correspondent to assure that be completely mistaken in surmise that continuance of support depended upon utter future abandonment by of such attempt on forbearance still thinking for boy fond soul be not convinced so little be convinced that when death came actually to be imminent called john to side confided to whole story begging to look after step brother interest to vindicate if possible true claim to name estate of kennett something about told jean already knew john promised be not mother remember may have be for be aware to contrary cold undutiful stepson promised know for went after death to paris to visit other to acquaint of mother end to discus with strange story have committed to keeping went accompanied by beautiful young creature of acquaintance whom have brought with probably for other reason than pleasure own infatuation only to find jean at point of death be then for first time that daring idea began to germinate in mind think so whether spontaneously at companion instance believe conception of plot dated from moment jean dead what be to prevent john from personating step brother from claiming to be sir calvin son from profiting by evidence be said to prove that son legitimacy a to that have only mr ridgways word have be uttered with such solemnity conviction by dying woman a to leave little doubt of truth at worst thing must be gamble there be that in very romantic hazard of to appeal to imagination at best must be prosperity beyond dream be odds to consider be to find already curiously in favour similarity of name fact that have always be regarded a younger early death of quartermaster sergeant consequent long removal of one most damaging witness to truth jean prolonged absence from home in foreign city own more apparent devotion to woman to be claimed a mother must find nothing in inimical to success of plot only first essential must be to obtain possession of vade mecum there be full reason to believe from what sir calvin have told mr ridgway that book to day be jealously retained by for reason stated in secure keeping how to recover so conspiracy be hatched ivy mellor be to be mean condition of success bestowal of spotless hand upon rightful heir of wildshott splendid dream transpontine melodrama john saw at once that first condition of success lay in scrupulous obliteration of clue pointing to identity of confederate hence anger on discovering portrait immediate measure taken by to wipe out of existence well know rest how beautiful accomplice betrayed trust how developed passion for very man whom be scheming to disinherit how to be sure came to recognize that must much more fully satisfactorily realize own ambition by baulking than by furthering design of fellow plotter to be wife of problematic heir of wildshott might be good thing to be wife of heir of wildshott in gentleman soldier antinous be certainly better so having surrendered to love played for greater stake lost can pity be frankly adventuress must pity be not for thought of inhuman revenge yet have provocation perhaps beyond gambler endurance to find very woman for worship of whom have be scheming away position reputation soul of truth honour not only turned traitor to best interest faithless in worse sense for rival sake to pledge to well one must pause before utterly condemning after be only moment madness served by opportunity yes can pity have notion too that told what be not truth that have already destroyed for love sake evidence of prayer book if have be last touch yes can pity gentleman be story m le baron ceased speaking for time silence held among then presently mr bickerdike asked there be only one thing baron remains to puzzle little be not ridgways employment in case originally agreed to by sir calvin in response to suggestion of yours be quite true be sir calvin then never moved to sort of emotion curiosity over association detective name must naturally awaken in mind emotion think not must hardly describe psychology so little superstitious a of general similarity of name must have struck a more than inconsiderable coincidence with practical quality imagination be last thing must care to be accused of curiosity well perhaps to certain extent though deep seated lasting have to remember that from first to last suppose never knew troubled to know what sergeant christian name be even have learned must have conveyed nothing to a knew better again probably have ever troubled to know by what name own disowned son be called very certainly have never condescended to note name of quartermaster sergeant individual offspring see have in suggesting sergeant for case arrire pense at time connecting have merely curiosity friend to observe owner of name really ipsissima verba to so oddly associated in mind with teller of certain fantastic story in paris then did not know of
