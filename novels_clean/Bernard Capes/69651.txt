presumably be to be sought have confidence somehow must alight on again without seeking however cautiously to identify run to earth a to that be jealous too of making quest public matter must dilute heady romance of situation deprive of most intimate charm so breathed word of secret to living soul carried in breast like anachronous electric torch alone aware of light dwelt within awaiting on touch to flash into being to vanish took to wandering far afield in day even affecting to topical interest in exploration while eye be unceasingly alert for sign token of real objective enough pride remained to to make feign nonchalance be remote from feeling returned to angling a be to give colour to persistent haunting of moor recalling clerivaults instruction dabbed dibbled assiduously in beck stream without much success however a happened pretext did actually at last lead to attainment of company coveted have pushed one glowing afternoon in may to point on moor where couple of little

effort of fish to slacken when with steady lift raised clear of pool swung swiftly to bank where lay kicking gasping grayling good fifteen inch long surveying prize with rapture stooped to release from hook when glancing up a knelt saw something on instant struck motionless side of hill on looked sloped down to glen be much confused with bush foliage for two third of height above beyond broke into open space be multiplied continuously until summit of bare grass be reached on ridge silhouetted against sky cropt little donkey brion waited while shock of tingling blood in vein subsided then very hurriedly rose discarding fish fly tackle began to climb hill in a straight line a must make for small dusk object perched up aloft picking way by bush boulder soon enough lost sight of open ground once reached must enable to correct course be for that be striving when little suppressed cough uttered from somewhere close at hand brought to stop a instant a though have answered to stand

fence about of silver birch sapling floor be level grass hidden from else must yet command through tree view of lovely glen with shining river looping through brion standing waist deep in bush looked up at goddess like young leander rising from sea for part returned look seemed without apprehension so remained speechless till something happened two little tell tale dimple suddenly appeared at wing

while bird sang about chiming of water came up to in warm high covert set signature of fealty on lovely tablet be ecstatic moment of brions life never forgotten never surpassed innocence fulfilling beauty beauty innocence trustfully confidingly so to such sexless kiss angel love flower ask fruit now sat on in silence shy since pledge have be sought yielded yet there seemed thought of strangeness in did appear to odd that must be so intimate on such short acquaintance why must do lamb meeting in same meadow seek introduction reserve only come with consciousness of sex with happy friendliness of youth be forborne for ever presently parted with due precaution taken against chance detection be not with brion that be actuated in by sentiment of shame guilt for felt none that feared for rude end being put to idyll whatever circumstance of pretty lady life being faithful to promise must not inquire into much a longed to comfort implied unhappiness must not suppose for moment that

pure good happiness only one thing lingered in mind to shadow disturb why have sir john likened to bird chapter xi two company motionless a trunk against leaned brion stood waiting in ilex grove be still misty morning with blurr of sun in east like lamp burning behind ground glass window for reason felt more reassuring to address face doggedly in direction than towards gloom lay behind back be gratifying to know that resolution puissant force impelling have conquered gloom to practical effect still point gained there seemed present reason for presuming on providence have so far favoured preferred to wait facing light near fringe of wood for appointment have brought there a hour struck passed nervous irritation must affect be strung to adventure wanted grappled done with why did not come girl woman seemed to regard time a jest have be same with mr angell have never known once in life punctual to engagement at last quarter of hour late appeared heard soft patter of grittys hoof on turf outside pair drew into sight even seen so figure dusk against light mistress brought to brions heart thrill of delighted surprise for ever conveyed never saw afresh seemed new thing to lovelier more winsome than when last encountered now be new in fact at least a regarded habit like young spirit of spring came to in tender green orchard sweetness in face eye be first speedwell of year hood

welcome with even show of severity lateness called for have not for precaution sake gone to meet have waited while tethered little as to branch on outskirt of grove now stood erect a greeted in soft voice with half eager half fearful eye have in truth found way brion mayhap way answered if be left to take sun will be through in little enough to reveal meeting must chance to be looking struck by something in tone perhaps by apparent failure to observe half proffered hand moved little back lip parted eye full of questioning wonder be mist then of thy bespeaking said engaged to up to certain
