have much ado to keep pace with ran a one urged on by sure sense of doom looking to right left mountain instinct have remained with when memory have closed around like fog leaving face to face isolated with one unconfessed point of terror swiftly made way ever slightly climbing along rugged hillside soon broke into country very wild dismal pastoral character of scene lessened altogether disappeared tree grew matted grotesquely gnarled huddling together in menacing battalion save where plunging rock have burst like shell forcing clearing strewing black moss with jagged wreck of splinter here flower crept for warmth sentinel marmot turned little scut with whistle of alarm to vanish like red shadow be melancholy silence massed defiance of ever impending ruin storm avalanche bitter snap of frost have wrought havoc year by year till uncrippled branch be rare distinction very sapling of stunted growth bore air of thief reared in rookery of crime strode with difficulty in inhuman twilight through great dark quickset of nature have paused moment where thronging trunk thinned somewhat when little mouthing moan came towards on crest of ripple of wind companion stopped on

on remember dream camille cried yes yes be good help monsieur will try yes will try drew arm within mine together stumbled on undergrowth grew denser more fantastic murmur filled out increased resolved into sound of falling water ever took shape volume depth till crash shook ground at foot then in moment white blaze of sky came at through trunk burst through fringe of wood to find facing opposite side of long cleft in mountain blade edge of roaring cataract shot out over lip of fall twenty foot above in curve like scimitar passed in one sheet spot where stood dived into sunless pool thirty foot below with thunderous boom what may have be in full phase of stream know not yet even now be sufficiently magnificent to give pause to dying soul eager to shake off restless horror of world flat of broad blade divided lofty black wall of deep savage ravine on whose jagged shelf starved clump of rhododendron shook in wind of torrent far down narrow gully must see passion of water tossing champed white with ravening of jaw until took bend of cliff at leap rushed from sight stood upon little platform of coarse grass bramble whose fringe dipped nodded fitfully a sprinkle caught beyond sliding sheet of water looked like great strap of steel reeled ceaselessly off whirling drum pivoted between hill midday sun shot like piston down shaft of valley painting purple spear angle behind abutting rock hitting full upon upper curve of fall half way down cataract slipped into shadow brain sickened with endless gliding turmoil of descent turned aside to speak to companion be kneeling upon grass eye fixed staring white lip mumbling crippled memory of prayer started cowered down a touched on shoulder can not go monsieur will die what next camille will go alone god monsieur cave under fall be there horror be pointed to little gap in fringing bush with shaking finger stole gingerly in direction indicated with step took awful fascination of descending water increased upon seemed hideous abnormal to stand mid way against perpendicularly rushing torrent above below effect must have be different here to look up be to feel one foot dragging towards unseen to look down pas from vision of lip of fall be to become waif of force be unaccountable have battle with nerve triumphed a approached opening in bramble became conscious of certain relief at little distance cataract have seemed to actually wash in descent edge of platform now found to be further away than have imagined ground dropping in sharp slope to sort of rocky buttress lay obliquely on slant of ravine be true margin of torrent before essayed descent glanced back at companion be kneeling where have left hand pressed to face feature hidden looking back once again when have with infinite caution accomplished downward climb saw that have crept to edge of slope be watching with wide terrified eye waved hand to turned to wonderful vision of water now passed almost within reach of arm stood near point where whole glassy breadth glided at once from sunlight into shadow fell silently without break for only foot far below trod thunder now a peered about noticed little cleft in rocky margin minute climb above be attracted to by appearance of smoke steam incessantly emerged from a though witch caldron be simmering alongside fall spray might be condensing of water splashed on granite of might not be sure therefore determined to investigate straightway began climbing rock with heart in mouth must be confessed for foothold be undesirable way perilous time be conscious that white face of camille watched from above a reached cleft fancied queer sort of gasping sob issue from lip to must give heed in sudden wonder broke upon for lo appeared that cleft led straight to narrow platform ledge of rock right underneath fall extending how far must not see by reason of steam filled passage for be unable to account footing carefully groping way set step in little water curtained chamber advanced pace two suddenly light grew about beautiful rose of fire appeared on wall of passage in midst of what seemed vitrified scoop in rock marvelling put out hand to touch fell back on narrow floor with scream of anguish inch farther line have not be written a be fall caught by finger with suck of cat fish be only gigantic wrench saved from slipping off ledge jerk brought head against rock with stunning blow for moment lay dizzy confused daring hardly to breathe conscious only of burning blistering agony in right hand at length summoned courage to gather limb together crawl out way have entered distance be few pace yet to traverse seemed interminable nightmare of swaying stumbling know only one other occasion upon liberal atmosphere of open earth seemed sweeter to sens when reached than did on tumbled somehow through cleft sat down shaking upon grass of slope beyond happening to throw backwards in reeling faintness induced by fright pain of head eye encountered sight woke at once to full activity balanced upon very verge of slope face neck craned forward jaw dropped sick tranced look upon feature stood camille saw topple shouted to before voice be well out swayed collapsed came down with running thud shook ground once wheeled over like shot rabbit bounding thwack with head against flat boulder not dozen yard from lay stunned motionless scrambled to quaking over breath came quick spirt of blood jerked from sliced cut in forehead at pump of heart kicked out wad of cool moist turf clapped in pad over wound handkerchief under for body be shaken bruised otherwise not seriously hurt presently came to to in best sense of word for camille be sane have explanation to offer only know that a fall will set long stopped watch pulsing again blow here seemed to have restored misplaced intellect to normal balance when woke there be new soft light of sanity in eye be pathetic in extreme monsieur whispered terror have passed god be thanked camille answered much moved jerked poor battered head in reverence little while said will know punishment be just what punishment poor camille hush cloud have rolled away stand naked before le bon dieu monsieur lift up be strong winced a complied palm of hand be scorched blistered in dozen place noticed at once kissed fondled wounded limb a softly a woman might ah poor hand murmured monsieur have touched disc of fire camille whispered what be monsieur will know ah yes will know not now monsieur mother thou art right good son bound up bruised forehead own burnt hand a well a be able helped to foot stood upon staggering in minute must essay to stumble on homeward journey with assistance be long toilsome progress in time accomplished often have to sit down in blasted wood rest awhile often moisten parched mouth at runnel of snow water thridded undergrowth shadow be slanting eastward a reached clearing have quitted hour earlier goat have disappeared petitjean be leading charge homewards in default of human commander presently overtook browsingly loitering desirous of definite instruction pas over camille meeting with mother wonder fear pity of hurt be attended to battery of question met with best armour of tact at command for myself said that have scorched hand against red hot rock be strictly true for camille that be wisest to take early advantage of reason that god have restored to be voluble tearful half hysterical with joy ecstasy of gratitude that blow must effect marvel monsieur pass comprehension night long heard stirring sobbing softly outside door for slept little owing to pain wonder in mind towards morning dozed dream be feverish full of terror next day camille kept bed room by at least escaped first onset of local curiosity for villager naturally made of camille restoration nine day wonder towards evening madame barbiere brought message from that must like to see monsieur alone if monsieur must condescend to visit in room went at once found a haydon found keats lying in white bed hectic on back greeted with smile peculiarly sweet restful doe monsieur wish to know said in low voice if will not hurt thee camille not now not now good god have made sound remember be not terrified closed door took seat by bedside there with hand shading eye from level glory of sunset flamed into room listened to strange tale of camille seizure once monsieur lived in be exultant with loneliness of fancied knowledge youth be excuse god must not pardon read where must find book chance put evil choice in way for learned to sneer at name heaven hell man have god in self will thought in pride through alone accepts responsibility of life death be own curse blessing here hereafter inheriting sin earning doom such a inflicts upon interpret from world about knowing have fear own tyrant own passion monsieur be through fear most terrible that god asserted to light be fading in west lance of shadow fell upon white bed a though hushed day be putting finger to lip a withdrew be coward then monsieur that at least may say lived among mountain on ledge foot of own goat be not surer often in summer spent night among wood hill reading in story of age exploring exploring till foot be wearier than brain stranger came from far to see great cascade none too monsieur now know track through thicket lead to cave under water found by chance like be scorched by fire though not badly camille cause monsieur will tell wonderful thing falling water there make monstrous burning glass when hot sun be upon have melted rock behind like wax can that be so be true dear jesus have fearful reason to know half rose on elbow face crossed by bandage grey a stone in gathering dusk hereafter spoke in awed whisper when knowledge broke upon grew great to myself in possession of wonderful secret day after day visited cave examined phenomenon yet more marvellous in connection with first huge lens be simple accident of curved rock convex water planed a crystal in other than droughty summer must probably not exist spouting torrent must overwhelm know not be not astonishing enough yet nature have worked second miracle to mock in anticipation self sufficient plagiarism of little man noticed that ray of sun concentrated in lens only during half hour of orb apparent crossing of ravine then light smote upon strange curved little fan of water spouted from high crevice at mouth of willow vitrified tunnel devoured played upon rock behind hissed sputtered like pitch place be blind with steam when tooth of fire be withdrawn tiny inner cascade fell again wrought coolness with sprinkling did not discover at once for at first fright took be enough to watch for moment of light appearance then flee with little laughter one day ventured back into cave after sun have crossed valley steam have died away rock cooled behind miniature cascade looked through lens seemed full of great white light blazed into eye so fell back through inner fan of water be well soused by sight presently recovering stood forward in scoop of rock admiring dainty hollow curve fan took in fall by by became aware that be looking out through smaller lens upon great one that strange whirling mist seemed to be sweeping across huge disc within touch of hand almost be long before grasped meaning of in flash came upon great lens formed object glass small eyeglass of natural telescope of tremendous power drew high summer cloud down within seeming touch opened out heaven before staring eye monsieur when dawned upon be wild that so astonishing discovery must have be reserved for poor ignorant swiss peasant filled with pride wicked in proportion with absence of gratitude to mighty dispenser of good came even to think individuality part of wonder necessary to existence 'be not for courage enterprise ' cried 'this phenomenon must have remained secret of nature gave birth to yield treasure to such only a fear not have read in book of huyghens guinand newton herschel great high priest of science who have striven through patient year to read hieroglyphic of heaven wise imbecile thought toiled died nature held mirror up to for poor camille have worked in secret while grew old passed unsatisfied ' brilliant project of astronomy whirled in brain evening of last discovery remained out on hill entered cave a grew dusk feeling of awe surged in a dark fell over valley first star glistened faintly dipped under fan of water took stand in hollow behind there be moon telescope be inclined a be at generous angle section of firmament be open before heart beat fast a looked through lens will tell saw then many night after ring cross in heaven of golden mist spangled a seemed with jewel star a big a cart wheel twinkling point no longer round like great boss of molten fire thing shadowy luminous of strange colour stranger form seemed to brush water a passed be in reality vast distance away sometimes thrust of wind up ravine must produce tremulous motion in image at focus of mirror be seldom for most part wonderful lens presented steady curvature not flawless of magnificent capacity now flashed upon that when moon be at full must top valley in direct path of telescope range of view at thought grew exultant little camille must first read aright history of strange instrument must give shape to star must interpret to composition of lonely orb a clearly a though stood upon surface a time of fulness drew near grew feverish with excitement be sickening a be to madness for never more must look upon willingly with eye speculative insane at point camille broke off for little space lay back on pillow when spoke again be out of darkness with face turned to wall monsieur can not dwell upon must hasten have right to peer beyond boundary god have drawn for saw hell saw hell tell be peopled with damned silent horrible distorted in midst of ash desolation be memory like snake of aaron devoured others till yesterday till yesterday by christ mercy seemed to a day wore on camille have recovered reason at expense of life that long rest deemed necessary for after bitter period of brain exhaustion might in end prove everlasting one possibly blow to head have in expelling seven devil wounded beyond cure vital function have fostered lay white patient sweet tempered to moved by inclination to rise re assume many coloured garment of life description of dreadful desert in sky looked upon merely a abiding memory of brain phantasm have finally overthrown reason already tottering under tremendous excitement induced by discovery of lens magnified image have presented to that there be truth in asserted fact of existence of own experience convinced curiosity a to alone impelled to determination of investigating further when hand must be sufficiently recovered to act a hindrance to in forcing way once more through dense wood bounded waterfall moreover dispassionate enquiry of mind le sensitive to impression might in result do more towards restoring warped imagination of friend to normal state than amount of spoken scepticism to camille said nothing of resolve waited on chafing at slow healing of wound in meantime period of full moon approached decided at cost to make venture on evening topped orbit if circumstance at worst must prevent doing so sooner thus turned out on eve of enterprise first fair spring of rain in drought of two month fell to disappointment among hill for feared increase of torrent effacement of mighty lens set off however on afternoon of following day in hot sunshine mentally prognosticating favourable termination to expedition telling madame barbiere not to expect back till late in leisurely fashion made way along track have previously traversed risking divergence through overhaste carefully examining landmark before deciding on direction thus slowly proceeding have good fortune to come within sound of cataract a sun be sinking behind mountain ridge to front presently emerged from wood at very spot have struck in former journey together chilly twilight reigned in ravine noise came up from ruin of torrent seemed doubly accented by reason of sound of water moving in darkness have always conveyed to impression of something horrible deadly be nothing of more moment than drip hollow tinkle of gutter pipe crash in echoing gorge be appalling indeed for moment stood on brink of slope looking across at great knife of fall with little shiver of fear then shook laughed without further ado took courage in hand scrambled down declivity up again towards cleft in rock here chill of heart gripped again watery sliding tunnel looked so evil in contracting gloom false step in humid chamber bone must pound crackle on rock forty foot below must be gone through with now however taking long breath set foot in passage under curving downpour seemed taut a arched muscle reaching burnt recess few moment sufficed to restore self confidence without further hesitation dived under inner little fan shaped fall be there indeed a camille have described recovered balance with pulse drumming thicker than must have desired in moment became conscious that great power be before across vast irregular disc filled with ashy whiteness of outer twilight strange unaccountable form misty undefined passed repassed vanished cirrus might have be shadow flung by homing flight of bird of must not be certain a dusk deepened showed more presently gazed only into violet fathomless darkness own excitement now be great found difficulty in keeping under control for moment seemed to pined greatly for free commune with liberal atmosphere of earth therefore dipped under little fall made cautious way to margin of cataract be surprised to find for how long time phenomenon have absorbed moon be already high in heaven making towards ravine with rapid step far below tumbling water flashed in ray on side great tier of solemn tree stood up at attention to salute when disc silvered inner rim of slope have descended returned to post of observation with tingling nerve field of great object lens be already suffused with radiance of approach suddenly pupil shrank before apparition of ghastly grey light in moment be face to face with segment of desolation more horrible than desert monstrous growth of leprosy have bubbled up stiffened field of ashen slime sloughing of world of corruption hill of demon fungus swollen with fatness of putrefaction in midst of dim convulsed shape wallowing protruding stumbling aimlessly onwards till sank disappeared madame barbiere threw up hand when let in at door appearance doubt be ghastly knew not hour lapse of time covered by wandering about hill face hidden in palm drawn feeling about heart lip muttering muttering fragment of prayer throat jerking with horrible laughter for hour lay face downwards on bed monsieur have seen have seen heard rain on hill lens will have be blurred monsieur have be spared much god in mercy pity thee oh camille too
