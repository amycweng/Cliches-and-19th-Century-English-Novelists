paramount importance to think upon apart from chapter iv love ambassador italy of eighteenth century have always given sense of distressing incongruity sense of incongruity a feel in presence of performing animal pitifully patiently caricaturing own native dignity in forced posture mirthless habiliment to see petticoated elephant seated on stool drinking tea to see dog on hind leg with shako on head shouldering musket make confess uneasy ashamed so in land of visconti of sforza of medici land where magnificence of crime magnificence of achievement have always gone habited in certain appropriate splendour akin to of leopard in forest tiger in jungle vision of powder patch with concomitant of mincing uncleanness affectation seems outrage on one conception of accepted fitness of
