stage at same time must be owned that raving appeal to almighty passionate assertion that be most unlucky woman that light of day have ever shone upon bitter foreboding of what daily life must be like when be safely landed in nearest workhouse did not avail anything no macdonald family be in for spell of bad luck asseveration in world must not alter gainsay at time nancy be like rock in midst of stormy sea after much self communing threw over promise to mother concerning time of writing felt a true artist feel that be in to do great thing even little money earned in such crisis must be of double value so moment that must steal from now greatly decreased house duty spent in own room working with feverish haste anxiety at new story story be not about lord lady majestic guardsman lovely

child born in poverty reared in boarding house form of child be crude be work of unpractised hand be strong be full of life be thing alive a line after line came from under hand a story assumed shape colour from under nervous finger nancy macdonald felt that be on right tack at last that time must not fail a soon a story be done sent with breathless hope to well known weekly magazine be almost household word then sat down to wait oh be weary waiting under such circumstance after three day of sickening suspense nancy decided in own mind that if have to wait a many week must be raving mad at end of so locked in room began story story of love affair came about in just house a own meantime can scarcely be said that macdonald fortune improved be true that fever stricken child recovered be sent away to superior convalescent home at seaside be true that one two fresh boarder came that there be hope that family must be able to weather storm supposing be that be able to tide over next few month still in london be not easy to tide over few month when resource have be drained income have be sorely diminished there be bill for claim for other came in with great rapidity with pressing demand for payment mr macdonald pitied more than ever tone a recalled virtue of past life be more tragic debit credit account with almighty showed to be clearly falsified never be so good woman so abominably used of providence humanity alike wept copiously over deservings railed furiously against fate poor mr macdonald for many weary year have toiled to best of ability have done duty by child according to light be pitiably dim lord must indeed love remarked with bitterest irony one day when mysterious visitor have put gruesome paper into unwilling hand be beginning of end nancy said resignedly beginning of end have sovereign in house how be to pay nine pound seventeen fourpence be beyond altogether wo last long will have roof of workhouse over head soon ca go on like where be money to come from that of course nancy knew more than mother must not sell something said looking round shabby little sitting room where be worst in house be gathered together because be only used by must sell something might sell cameo brooch said mr macdonald with huge sigh be last present poor father ever gave suppose must fetch anything like nine pound seventeen fourpence said nancy doubtfully father paid great deal for returned mr macdonald when one have to sell be different to buying one give one thing away a matter of fact late mr macdonald have given fifty shilling for cameo brooch in question having bought in pawnshop in strand mr macdonald nancy be aware of fact dear mother said nancy must not worry have still fortnight before need settle one way other great many thing may turn up in fortnight not ten pound note said mr macdonald with air of conviction know mother look how many thing have turned up when least expected money have come that seemed to have dropped from cloud at event must not break down over until very last day come must not indeed mother ah perhaps must not said mother must not have done so when be age when be mine will understand better yes dear perhaps will know even if worst happens oh will manage somehow depend upon will manage somehow nancy youthful philosophy did not tend to check flow of mr macdonald troubled spirit whole week went by passed chiefly in tear in drawing gloomy picture of detail of life must soon soon be hers will have to wear poke bonnet shawl remarked in doleful tone one day never must bear shawl even when be in fashion horrid cold thing at meal of course poor lady have to keep cheerful countenance so that guest must not suspect how badly thing be going with nancy noticed that ate very little like most young people chief idea for panacea for woe took form of food in mr macdonald case took form of fresh tea hot buttered toast really must be sorry to say how much tea be used in household during few day by way of bolstering mistress strength spirit against what might happen in immediate future fortnight of grace soon passed away with day mr macdonald spirit sank lower lower looked old aged worn nancy heart ached when realised that there be prospect of anything turning up apparently chance of danger threatened being averted what money have come in have mostly be imperatively required to meet daily expense seemed preposterous that people with large house a have must be in such strait for so small sum yet if began selling belonging with exception of cameo brooch mr macdonald keeper ring almost entirely consisted of furniture knew that must be impossible to replace even to dispose of without knowledge of guest hardly liked to suggest to mother yet felt that when last day came must have other course open to be evening before last day of grace still needful sum have not be set aside twice during day mr macdonald have subsided in tear wretchedness into old armchair by little sitting room fire while nancy have brought fresh fragrant tea little covered plate of hot buttered toast have delicately urged to decide between selling precious brooch appealing to one other of boarder for advance payment will just wait till morning said to herself a came down from drawing room after dispensing after dinner coffee nancy nancy cried younger sister edith at moment where be be here dear

hard with palpitating heart oh nancy what be cried edith staring in fright at sister chalk white face be bad news oh good news best news where be mother must not speak simply must not finish sentence trembling lip refused to perform office in shaking hand still clutched precious letter gathering wit together turned literally tore down stair to basement mother mother where be cried what be cried mr
