in way said regina hurriedly must confess that have greatest difficulty to choke down laugh have better not put in way 'the devil to pay ' be next door to swearing to say nothing of being what great many people must call excessively vulgar if be heard to say such thing at school must get yourselves into dreadful trouble too will be obliged julia if will not use expression again very well mother said julia with air of great meekness may say in passing be far from feeling with regard went on regina in most magnificent manner with regard to gwendoline hammond miserable party consider distinctly feather in cap maudie that be left uninvited if be told to a presume be told to mr hammond that one of have be brutally cruel to child many size smaller than incapable of self defence must mete out severest punishment that be possible for to give have never be punished because have never be necessary mother continued must punish for using such term a 'the devil to pay ' regard that a venial offence own common sense will teach be inexpedient a phrase for everyday conversation brutal cowardice be matter must find very difficult to forgive be extremely proud that must have taken part of poor little child who be not able to do for will tell father when come home will ask to reward in suitable manner meantime when see miss drummond if please mother broke in julia who be a have said dominant one of two sister if please mother just drop about miss drummond be quite able to fight own battle at school want miss drummond anybody else to think that come peaching to telling everything

peaching home be duty to tell everything said regina well might say same about gwendoline hammond remarked julia with matter of fact air be within right said mr whittaker be within right apologize oh please do said julia magnanimously be at necessary please wo say anything to miss drummond about not unless must speak to wo be very indignant with gwendoline when found whole truth out believe at least did hear that paid special visit to mr hammond made thing extremely unpleasant for gwendoline wonder did ask maudie to party because father happened to be there be very angry about almost stopped having party altogether only mr hammond have asked people did not like to go back upon word disgrace gwendoline before everybody so understand not word please to miss drummond dear child said regina dear original splendid child julia coughed must have liked to have taken praise to herself with maudie standing open mouthed at side be not altogether feasible coughed again forget maudie remarked mildly dear noble generous child forget nothing will forget nothing for of here went on in ringing accent must have brought down house if regina have be speaking at public meeting be small recognition from mother at dinner time to night father will speak to think remarked julia ten minute later when sister be on safe ground of part of garden belonged exclusively to think got out of uncommonly well maudie yes be skating on thin ice said maudie know how dared ju told did like telling lie well said julia be to be hoped will never come out for if doe there will be devil to pay mistake about be a well for regina peace of mind that thin ice never broke that actual truth never came to light know what poet say lie be lie be ever hardest to fight well same idea hold good for truth be truth say that julia account of difference between gwendoline hammond be wholly lie be certainly not wholly truth indeed be such garbled account nobody concerned therein must have found difficult to recognize be be little sermon about devil to pay lovely said julia swinging idly to fro while maudie stood contemplating gravely yes said maudie be quite right be best of mother be always so full of sound common sense except when call brave noble child rejoined sharp wit know said maudie reflectively that be altogether mother fault perhaps be will be just a well for for of a far a go if mother doe happen to just mention matter to tuppenny mother think be fool not to have safeguarded that point there be time enough said maudie can lead up to when go in because know ju if ever do find out yes there will be devil to pay put in julia be quite right be astonishing how sweet morsel phrase seemed to be to child will get saying to miss drummond said maudie warningly well if do retorted julia will have have pleasure of saying will be something now be one of many similar instance occurred during childhood of regina two girl be so sharp at least julia be a be devoted to maudie always put wit at service of sister other child whom knew not unnaturally resented fact that be invariably to be found in wrong box in discussion in whittaker child have share so became more more isolated a year went by why like whittakers said girl to mother who have met mr whittaker thought very remarkable woman well because yes why oh well exactly know why be queer have noticed dear reader how frequent be to set down who be too sharp for a queer well be just so at northampton park what girl did choose to put into plain word stigmatized a queer what do mean by queer mother asked well be queer think mother must be queer too because dress be so funny be oh awfully always wear brown what be like well maudie be fairish julia be darkish maudie have quite straight nose julia turn up oh be ugly turn up nose did mean be such guy what be worse care bit really what sort of guy asked mother who be immensely amused well never have anything like anybody else have got long pokey frock made of

wistfully well will if like must be awful bore must thank see said mother be wrong only thought saw so time sped on two child grew more more long legged more more definite in character a progressed towards what mr whittaker fondly believed to be originality unconventionalism so did mother heart bound yearn within be amply satisfied with result of scheme of education be wont to say be not easy be much easier to bring up child in conventional way result oh dear lady result when feel thrill of pride that child be different to others be worth sacrifice now wonder said lady in question in bosom of family did that foolish woman particularly have to sacrifice general feeling in park seems to be that whittakers be horrid child disagreeable ill bred sententious altogether ridiculous too sharp in one way too stupid for word in yet talk about sacrifice oh maudie be sharp at least not particularly so said own girl who being couple of year older than maudie whittaker knew fairly well lie of land julia sharp needle be in be julia who back maudie up in everything julia be horrid little beast whom everybody hate loathes tried on with once when be at school soon put young lady in right place with

because be one nothing must do must be in common can not thank enough for saying that if have chosen maudie husband must have chosen be so glad went on in lower tone that did not think necessary to

harry believe must find from one end of earth to other chapter xvi other god how little noise people make when be suddenly stricken with great mental anguish say that after storm there come calm very true saying be after storm of orange blossom raged around ye dene on july day there came calm be broken only by excitement of watching for postman most valuable of wedding present be safely packed up on evening of wedding day consigned to alfred whittaker private safe others be left in girl sitting room carefully covered up in preparation for long trip in bride bridegroom be indulging prior to regular housekeeping for year whittakers have made point of seeking fresh holiday resort with summer year by kind of instinct decided not to go to english watering place perhaps feeling that bride groom be enjoying in bernese oberland meant to cover good deal of ground before turned footstep homewards made feel that contrast of english watering place must be too much therefore decided that dieppe must be bright convenient change for be not due to leave home until ten day after wedding now happened that regina instead of following usual course of mother making little absent bride into sort of deity be possessed of feeling that must like in way to reward younger girl for helpfulness at time of wedding unselfish manner in have deferred in possible way to sister wish therefore determined that must give julia little surprise present be not birthday be not kind of commemoration felt that be occasion on must appropriately spend little money now regina be amply blessed with world good mean in own right alfred whittaker have done extremely well in world whereas regina have once loomed in horizon a heiress in modest way be now wife of exceedingly warm man happy in possession of tidy little income of own breathed not word of purpose to soul did not intend little gift to take form of raiment julia father gave ample dress allowance regina be in habit of adding to with special offering at such time a birthday season of christmas be not difficult for to carry out purpose for have seldom gone to town in company with girl be so busy woman have so many excuse so many appointment engagement of semi business kind that coming going be not often questioned what be doing to day julia asked one morning at breakfast about week after wedding to day mother dear well

earring not for bride for young lady who be with when bought bride earring solitaire earring yes turquoise be very nice fancied that miss whittaker did not care much about turquoise did fancy pink coral yes be happy idea so suitable for young lady so regina be shown various solitaire earring in most delicate girlish substance even then be not satisfied pink coral earring be set in diamond be not expense be not question mr whittaker thought that not even tiny diamond must find place in jewel box of very young girl pink coral without just few spark madam said gentleman on other side of counter will be little well little insignificant a earring perhaps mr whittaker admitted might let see turquoise must have without diamond yes pearl solitaire pearl be quite young lady jewelry be very expensive asked regina oh madam let show pearl so tray be handed out yet tray one containing manner of turquoise stud for ear other showing assortment of pearl earring from modest one at five guinea pair to be far beyond regina mean julia necessity eventually pair of pearl solitaire be chosen paid for yes will take with said regina opening smart black gold wrist bag in order that little jewel case might be comfortably nested in company with small purse pocket handkerchief hope madam said shopman that liked mr whittaker last present to like very much said regina smoothing back of hand gazing admiringly at big turquoise ring adorned think be very handsome ring then looked straight into young man eye be not speaking of said with gesture of hand to show that be speaking of ring madam stammered remember mr whittaker buying ring bangle for young lady be thinking of quite customer at moment figure came from office behind shop be indeed assistant who have actually attended to want on occasion of previous visit hope said that bracelet mr whittaker bought other day met with approval madam for moment regina felt a if earth be opening under foot wild impulse seized to catch violently hold of something scream in series of sharp intermittent yelp a locomotive doe when something have gone wrong wild instinct to catch two smooth faced young men on other side of counter by ear bang head together feeling a if heaven earth be slipping away from regina be remarkable woman have vanity weakness in emergency of life regina might be counted upon for not losing head in spite of sea of tempestuous emotion surged within at moment maintained dignity common sense said have not yet seen be afraid that have given husband away a matter of fact have birthday next week be first plump deliberate lie that regina have ever told in life did not hurry out of shop even went so far a to choose little present for lord going back with curious persistence to idea of pink coral bought for what julia must have described a perfectly sweet tie pin consisting of bit of pink coral set between two small fiery diamond mr johnson said younger of two assistant a door closed behind regina have put foot in time why how what d'you mean simply mr alfred whittaker of ye dene northampton park wo thank for letting on to good lady that be here last week buying bracelet that know anything about oh

hand like tittle tattling about other customer purchase ought to know better be quite right deserve anything may come of think have ever done idiotic thing in life what can do to make up for nothing said other if anything be said swear that mr whittaker told that present be for wife think did be a may be anyway stick to through thick thin that mentioned that actually be for wife well tell of others dick must dream of doing that be likely might make slip one day so be not going to point out slip of other people considering very near shave young gentleman have have of making very same slip not ten minute before might be considered very feeling remark meantime regina have gone blindly along arcade be dressed in summer garment not few very curious glance be cast at twice stopped to look in shop window with eye saw nothing first be gunsmith second be man window of distinguished bootmaker regina never knew exact object at have gazed during painful peregrination when got to end of arcade turned walked back again time there beat to fro in brain idea said that alfred noble alfred have gone after other god after other god well in worst trial of life in grief shock sorrow of newest most unaccustomed kind woman can not walk up down fashionable arcade forever when again reached entrance by have gone in occurred to that must sit down think must go somewhere where must be quiet where must face new sensation have come into life club not club must meet there woman who be interested in same work a if lunched must not be there in lunch hour without lunching someone must join there be little pastry cook where sometimes lunched when be in hurry have never seen anybody there knew must go there to eat not to eat regina whittaker be sure that must never eat with relish again so bent step toward little side street haven like woman in dire trouble ordered tea muffin chapter xvii regina come to conclusion have ever noticed how accurately woman judge from small circumstance men call intuition men think of intuition a being on same level a instinct if regina have ordered plate of soup must have be brought to immediately because at one o'clock comestible must have be ready awaiting wish of customer regina a have said like most woman in trouble ordered food drink be nearest heart therefore have to wait while tea be brewed muffin toasted waiting did good be alone a happened in comfortable room over shop thus be able to grasp situation more clearly than have done while still talking to jeweler assistant when have have to consider ordinary convention of existence poor regina sat there by tall mantelshelf stared at paper rose filled summer grate alfred noble alfred have fallen from pedestal be hers no longer in year of married life indeed in knowledge of other have never wronged alfred by even so much a doubt of nobility to have be noble truly noble kind affectionate dignified highly successful man now be over house of matrimony have fallen about ear like pack of card have be supplanted by truly regina thought be very bitter have be supplanted by what be going to do came to memory that in time gone by when other woman have fallen upon evil day of like description have helped to bear sorrow with very light heart well have not then entered head that portion might one day be hers now blow have fallen upon must perforce give same advice that have given to others dear have remarked once to poor little woman whose husband have be spoiled by over much adoration have made one mistake in life have be too good to husband of yours what nobody must be too good to have dear doe do to be too good to man for time whether behaves not doe do to put ware in front window keep something back let there be always little corner of womanly dignity men even husband must respect mr whittaker little woman have replied have dignity where jack be concerned want dignity only want jack have gone away left how well remembered word a sat alone in pastry cook shop in regent street how well remembered well felt very much a little woman have felt did not care about dignity more only wanted alfred if alfred be deceiving if alfred be living double life sharing heart with only wanted to go back to blissful time of blind ignorance when to have be embodiment of manly dignity robust virtue got up looked at in long strip of glass be set between two tall window be not becoming glass be placed in particularly becoming light regina who have be through storm of tempestuous emotion who bore upon strongly marked countenance visible sign of mental upheaval looked frankly speaking quite hideous at moment young lady who have taken order for tea muffin came into room carrying little tray regina made slight pretence of adjusting hair before went back to table must prefer to sit here by window think by window said regina tone be admirably careless so careless that almost deceived will have cream also with tea yes think will have cream thank very much couple of minute later regina be once more alone certainly open window be more comfortable than empty fireplace with paper rose tea be freshly made be good of kind cream be rich muffin be perfection of muffin regina sat with summer wind fanning troubled brow ate drank simple fare be comforted a sat stole glance at herself in strip of looking glass in must see by turning head inch two a sat there storm tossed soul be soothed comforted by little meal began to turn thing over in mind with le tragic spirit than have done before perhaps if alfred have be drawn away to other god have be own fault alfred be so handsome so manly have such presence have despised trifling feminine womanly thing have given up so much of time to regeneration of woman that have let material part of regina whittaker take own course nature left to take own course be never very attractive be too stout there be people of plump little partridge order who must look frightful in nearer approach to bone regina have gone fat in lump regina eye have never be aware of fact until morning too much chin too much nape of neck too much at top of arm too much of even back in scripture day when coupled with proud look be ever subject for derision never proud to alfred said leaning back in chair here crossed hand just below waist other be indisputable fact a decided question in own mind laid hand upon little bell stood beside on table did ring said oh be not conscious of think made mistake in having kind of meal be not accustomed to feel a if have taken nothing try sandwich madam said young lady sandwich think be not equal to sandwich to day something have happened to have have shock know how weak woman fly to feminine article of food when be in trouble be sorry be in trouble madam came in here knowing must be quiet be very quiet be end of july in week will be more quiet still after when country people come will not know where to turn when come back from abroad from sojourn by sea will be a always see think will have muffin must madam will tell to put plenty of butter on pot of tea little more cream yes said regina rather weakly girl disappeared again regina sat back in chair very comfortable one felt that be pleasant to be ministered to then fell to thinking about again how strange that have never noticed change in alfred have never seemed to find wanting in way more than once even of late year have told that girl must never be patch upon for look have accepted tribute to charm in good faith then turned to glass again regarded with new eye critical eye saw that dress be hideous bonnet travesty hair fine in quality very decent in color made nothing of glove be too small hand too large what did matter result be same be inelegant unfashionable grotesquely stout be wrong seemed a if have done by work for regeneration of womanhood have be to cut adrift from own husband have said that regina whittaker be very remarkable character have tried to show that be woman who be accustomed to judge for in most circumstance of life who even if took wrong line took on own so to speak now in what may honestly say be bitterest moment of life decided judged determined on own line of action just a have done in previous time at moment relay of muffin fresh tea arrived regina with smile of thanks began with excellent appetite to eat second half of meal a ate thought be working busily alfred have fallen victim to hussy that be hussy of tender year a compared with regina herself be evident there be evidence to prove once idea have entered regina mind remained there throve apace ignorant youthful gay little hussy must be supplanted influence must be undermined alfred must be lured back to original nobility be curious that shadow of blame for noble alfred presented to regina if have be unfaithful be because have be tempted by hussy from allegiance have stood test of over twenty year if have left for other divinity be because have not made sufficiently alluring to regina a ate last piece of second muffin determined there then that must mend way will go to beauty doctor told will get rid of blemish have lessened attraction for will put in hand of expert dressmaker will dress like fashion plate will be young will be slim will be attractive will win husband heart back again then thought ran towards society for regeneration of woman that darling project of later year now realized have cost very dear from that must free not publicly not with ostensible reason except have worked sufficiently long others must take rein from hand must put forward plea that new blood be necessary even essential in such undertaking when have arrived at point be already quite cheerful took out purse from black gold bag deposited bright new sixpence under muffin plate a delicate little reward to girl whose kindly word have be first solace then satisfied with long look at julia earring then opened little case contained tie pin that intended a offering to lord master determined must not present to curious fancy took possession of that must give little symbol of unaltered affection for have never heard that pink coral be coupled with particular meaning have place among what may be called birthday stone now alfred birthday be in october so must choose opal yes little tie pin of opal with single diamond like crystallized tear drop must say to opal be to bring luck in later year diamond have meaning will tell at future time not now then regina rose up strong in new resolve having paid money at desk went out into summer sunshine chapter xviii first little vanity be often blamed for not speaking out a soon a doubt enters mind yet oftentimes reticence doubt begets be saving grace redeems sanctifies whole character be with cheerful countenance that regina went through rest of day work arriving home at ye dene in time for dinner changed dress for cool light tea gown in be bound to confess looked more than anything like gigantic perambulating baby bassinette laved face with

sigh of relief well hussy might have got hold of yes heart be with owned to herself that there be little bit of hypocrite in forgave infinitesimal sin because alfred have noticed instantly that be

powder tied broad blue ribbon round waist bringing bow low down pinning with huge brooch at point about six inch lower than usually wore buckle in past one of regina landmark have be what be usually

period of detention along with three other lady much fatter than be cheerful paper be of newest be not always case let remind in house of medical specialist at last turn came to penetrate to sanctum

be many explicit not only gave food might eat also food might not eat drink might take drink might not take gave weight of portion number of special biscuit acting according to instruction from specialist regina have ordered sufficient quantity of specially prepared diet biscuit be part of regime occurred to when parcel arrived little later than diet sheet reached that must have to account to husband family for startling change in diet now regina be perfectly sure of one thing that must be most unwise to tell alfred exact nature of regime on be about to start felt that wife who be taking elaborate mean undergoing great self sacrifice putting into prison so to speak for sole express purpose of thinning down must show to great disadvantage beside person of plump order who be probably twenty year junior able to peck greedily at most fattening kind of food so regina entered upon course of what may call harmless prevarication have something to tell dear alfred said that

away leave be talking of queenie if be to go away leave for man must blow brain out here began to walk about room if did must go to devil be ashamed to record that there arose in regina mind picture of alfred noble alfred going headlong to devil with hussy of plump proportion alfred continued excitedly if be to leave in other sense know what must do dear alfred must probably marry again observed quietly never never put that thought out of mind once for must live out rest of life a best must really ca talk about be perfectly right to go to specialist must follow out treatment to very letter
