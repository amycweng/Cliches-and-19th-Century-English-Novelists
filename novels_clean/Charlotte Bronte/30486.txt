by girl of age station very glad be to avail herself of kind offer made by cousin hortense soon after arrival of latter at hollow mill to teach french fine needle work mdlle moore for part delighted

progress be to talent application in scholar ascribed improvement entirely to own superior method of teaching when found that caroline unskilled in routine have knowledge of own desultory varied discovery caused surprise for still imagined that from conversation have girl unawares gleaned treasure thought even when forced to feel that pupil knew much on subject whereof knew little idea be not logical hortense have perfect faith in mademoiselle who prided on possessing un esprit positif on entertaining decided preference for dry study kept young cousin to same a closely a must worked unrelentingly at grammar of french language assigning a most improving exercise must devise interminable analysis logiques analysis be by mean source of particular pleasure to caroline thought must

admiring grateful smile rather shed at foot than lifted to face must leave mill reluctantly to go back to cottage then while completed exercise worked out sum for mdlle moore taught arithmetic too must wish nature have made boy instead of girl that might ask robert to let be clerk sit with in counting house instead of sitting with hortense in parlour occasionally happened very rarely spent evening at hollow cottage sometimes during visit moore be away attending market sometimes be gone to mr yorke often be engaged with male visitor in room sometimes too be at home disengaged free to

must keep bright with use not let lie for week aside till get rusty yet be careful not to put in practice own theory much a liked evening visit to cottage never paid one unasked often indeed when pressed by hortense to come must refuse because robert did not second slightly seconded request morning be first time have ever of own unprompted will given invitation then have spoken so kindly that in hearing have received sense of happiness sufficient to keep glad for whole day morning passed a usual mademoiselle ever breathlessly busy spent in bustling from kitchen to parlour now scolding

unpalatable dish green oddly bruised formed accompanying vegetable pt of fruit conserved after recipe devised by madame grard moore grandbere from taste of appeared probable that mlasse have be substituted for sugar completed dinner caroline have objection to belgian cookery indeed rather liked for change be well did so for have evinced disrelish thereof such manifestation must have injured in mademoiselle good grace for ever positive crime might have be more easily pardoned than symptom of distaste for foreign comestible soon after dinner caroline coaxed governess cousin upstairs to dress manuvre required management to have hinted that jupon camisole curl paper be odious object indeed other than quite meritorious point must have be felony premature attempt to urge disappearance be therefore unwise must be likely to issue in persevering wear of during whole day carefully avoiding rock quicksand however pupil on pretence of requiring change of scene contrived to get teacher aloft once in bedroom persuaded that be not worth while returning thither that might a well make toilet now while mademoiselle delivered solemn homily on own surpassing merit in disregarding frivolity of fashion caroline denuded her of camisole invested with decent gown arranged collar hair etc made quite presentable hortense must put finishing touch finishing touch consisted in thick handkerchief tied round throat large servant like black apron spoiled everything on account must mademoiselle have appeared in own house without thick handkerchief voluminous apron first be positive matter of

caroline similar equipment only serious quarrel have ever have still left soreness in elder cousin soul have arisen from refusal of younger one to accept of profit by elegant present wear high dress collar said caroline must feel suffocated with handkerchief in addition short apron do quite a well a very long one must rather make change yet hortense by dint of perseverance must probably have compelled to make change have not mr moore chanced to overhear dispute on subject decided that caroline little apron must suffice that in opinion a be still child might for present dispense with fichu especially a curl be long almost touched shoulder there be appeal against robert opinion therefore sister be compelled to yield disapproved entirely of piquant neatness of caroline costume ladylike grace of appearance something more solid homely must have considered beaucoup convenable afternoon be devoted to sewing mademoiselle like most belgian lady be specially skilful with needle by mean

assistance yielded aid when asked with such quiet yet obvious enjoyment caroline ere long took delight in depending on shirley keeldar complete docility with mr pryor have at first surprised miss helstone not le fact of reserved ex governess being so much at home at ease in residence of young pupil where filled with such quiet independency very dependent post soon found that needed to know lady to comprehend fully enigma one seemed to must like must love must prize mr pryor when knew matter that perseveringly wore old fashioned gown that speech be formal manner cool that have twenty little way such a nobody else have be still such stay such counsellor so truthful so kind in way that in caroline idea none once accustomed to presence must easily afford to dispense with a to

miss keeldar have first taken interest because be quiet retiring looked delicate seemed a if needed one to take care of predilection increased greatly when discovered that own way of thinking talking be understood responded to by new acquaintance have hardly expected miss helstone fancied have too pretty face manner voice too soft to be anything out of common way in mind attainment very much wondered to see gentle feature light up archly to reveille of dry sally two risked by more did wonder to discover self won knowledge treasured untaught speculation working in girlish curl veiled head caroline instinct of taste too be like own such book a miss keeldar have read with most pleasure be miss helstone delight also held many aversion too in common must have comfort of laughing together over work of false sentimentality pompous pretension few shirley conceived men woman have right taste in poetry right sense for discriminating between what be real what be false have again again heard very clever people pronounce passage in that versifier altogether admirable when read soul refused to acknowledge a anything cant flourish tinsel at best elaborate wordiness curious clever learned

allayed light propitious shone when snatched from effectual aid perished alone beneath rougher sea whelmed in deeper gulf than hope william cowper be safe calm in heaven now said caroline do pity what suffered on earth asked miss keeldar pity shirley what can do else be nearly broken hearted when wrote that poem almost break one heart to read found relief in writing know did that gift of poetry most divine bestowed on man be believe granted to allay emotion when strength threatens harm seems to shirley that nobody must write poetry to exhibit intellect attainment who care for sort of poetry who care for learning who care for fine word in poetry who doe not care for feeling real feeling however simply even rudely expressed seems care for at event certainly in hearing that poem one discovers that cowper be under impulse strong a of wind drove ship impulse while must not suffer to stop to add ornament to single stanza filled with force to achieve whole with consummate perfection managed to recite with steady voice caroline wonder thereat cowper hand did not tremble in writing line why must voice falter in repeating depend on shirley tear blistered manuscript of 'the castaway ' hear in sob of sorrow only cry of despair that cry uttered believe deadly spasm passed from heart that wept abundantly be comforted shirley resumed ballad minstrelsy stopping short remarked ere long one must have loved cowper if be only for sake of having privilege of comforting never must have loved cowper rejoined caroline promptly be not made to be loved by woman what do mean what say know there be kind of nature in world very noble elevated nature too whom love never come near might have sought cowper with intention of loving must have looked at pitied left forced away by sense of
