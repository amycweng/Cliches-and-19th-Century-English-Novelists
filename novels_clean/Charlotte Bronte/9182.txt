clear glass might see through boy seem very cheerful want to go to want to be with graham watch friend what hinders from going feel afraid may try do think may knock at door ask to be let in thought perhaps might not object to have a playmate therefore encouraged attempt knocked too faintly at first to be heard on second essay door unclosed graham head appeared looked in high spirit impatient what do want little monkey to come to do indeed a if must be troubled with away to mamma mistress snowe tell to put to bed auburn head bright flushed face vanished door shut peremptorily be stunned why doe speak so never spoke so before said in consternation what have done nothing polly graham be busy with school friend like better than turn away now be here have thought of consoling of improving occasion by inculcating of maxim of philosophy whereof have ever tolerable stock ready for application stopped however by putting finger in ear at first word uttered then lying down on mat with face against flag must either warren cook root from position be allowed to lie therefore till chose to rise of own accord graham forgot impatience same evening must have accosted a usual when friend be gone wrenched from hand eye quite flashed must not bid good night must not look in face next day treated with indifference grew like bit of marble day after teased to know what be matter lip must not unclose of course must not feel real anger on side match be too unequal in way tried soothing coaxing why be so angry what have done by by tear answered petted be friend be one on whom such

ca see know find most excellent on sunday then have whole day be quiet in evening so kind observation be not altogether groundless going to church c kept graham quiet on sunday evening generally dedicated to serene though rather indolent sort of enjoyment by parlour fireside must take possession of couch then must call polly graham be boy not quite a other boy be delight did not lie in action be capable of interval of contemplation must take pleasure too in reading be selection of book wholly indiscriminate there be glimmering of characteristic preference even of instinctive taste in choice rarely be true remarked on what read have seen sit think of polly being near kneeling on little cushion carpet conversation must begin in murmur not inaudible though subdued caught snatch of tenor now then in truth influence better finer than of day seemed to soothe graham at such time into ungentle mood have learned hymn week polly have learned very pretty one four verse long will say speak nicely then be in hurry hymn being rehearsed rather half chanted in little singing voice graham must take exception at manner proceed to give lesson in recitation be quick in learning apt in

chapter very well when subject be such a must understand take interest in expression emphasis be something remarkable joseph cast into pit calling of samuel daniel in lion den be favourite passage of first especially seemed perfectly to feel pathos poor jacob must sometimes say with quivering lip how loved son joseph a much once added a much graham a love if be to die re opened book sought verse read must refuse to be comforted go down into grave to mourning with word gathered graham in little arm drawing long tressed head towards action remember struck a strangely rash exciting feeling one might experience on seeing animal dangerous by nature half tamed by art too heedlessly fondled not that feared graham must hurt very roughly check thought ran risk of incurring such careless impatient repulse a must be worse almost to than blow on whole however demonstration be borne passively sometimes even sort of complacent wonder at earnest partiality must smile not unkindly in eye once said like almost a well a if be little sister polly oh do like said do like very much be not long allowed amusement of study of character have scarcely be at bretton two month when letter came from mr home
