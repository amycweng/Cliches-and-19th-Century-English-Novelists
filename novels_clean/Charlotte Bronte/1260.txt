in blubbering tone commence tale of how nasty jane eyre have flown at like mad cat be stopped rather harshly dont talk to about john told not to go near be not worthy of notice choose that sister must associate with here leaning over banister cried out suddenly without at deliberating on word be not fit to associate with mr reed be rather stout woman on hearing strange audacious declaration ran nimbly up stair swept like whirlwind into nursery crushing down on edge of crib dared in emphatic voice to rise from place utter one syllable during remainder of day what must uncle reed say to if be alive be scarcely voluntary demand say scarcely voluntary for seemed a if tongue pronounced word without will consenting to utterance something spoke out of over have control what said mr reed under

have be celebrated at gateshead with usual festive cheer present have be interchanged dinner evening party given from enjoyment be of course excluded share of gaiety consisted in witnessing daily apparelling of eliza georgiana seeing descend to drawing room dressed out in thin muslin frock scarlet sash with hair elaborately ringletted afterwards in listening to sound of piano harp played below to passing to fro of butler footman to jingling of glass china a refreshment be handed to broken hum of conversation a drawing room door opened closed when tired of occupation must retire from stairhead to solitary silent nursery there though somewhat sad be not miserable to speak truth have not least wish to go into company for in company be very rarely noticed if bessie have be kind companionable must have deemed treat to spend evening quietly with instead of passing under formidable eye of mr reed in room full of lady gentleman bessie a soon a have dressed young lady used to

disproportionate almost to length of limb be sure most people must have thought ugly man yet there be so much unconscious pride in port so much ease in demeanour look of complete indifference to own external appearance so haughty reliance on power of other quality intrinsic adventitious to atone for lack of mere personal attractiveness that in looking at one inevitably shared indifference even in blind imperfect sense put faith in confidence be disposed to be gregarious communicative to night repeated be why sent for fire chandelier be not sufficient company for must pilot have be for none of

sense must resist delirium judgment must warn passion too feverish to rest rose a soon a day dawned chapter xvi wished feared to see mr rochester on day followed sleepless night wanted to hear voice again yet feared to meet eye during early part of morning momentarily expected coming be not in frequent habit of entering schoolroom did step in for few minute sometimes have impression that be sure to visit day morning passed just a usual nothing happened to interrupt quiet course of adles study only soon after breakfast heard bustle in neighbourhood of mr rochester chamber mr fairfaxs voice leahs cooksthat be john wifeand even john own gruff tone there be exclamation of what mercy master be not burnt in bed be always dangerous to keep candle lit at night how providential that have presence of mind to think of water jug wonder waked nobody be to be hoped will not take cold with sleeping on library sofa c to much confabulation succeeded sound of scrubbing setting to right when passed room in going downstairs to dinner saw through open door that be again restored to complete order only bed be stripped of hanging leah stood up in window seat rubbing pane of glass dimmed with smoke be about to address for wished to know what account have be given of affair on advancing saw second person in chambera woman sitting on chair by bedside sewing ring to new curtain that woman be other than grace poole there sat staid taciturn looking a usual in brown stuff gown check apron white handkerchief cap be intent on work in whole thought seemed absorbed on hard forehead in commonplace feature be nothing either of paleness desperation one must have expected to see marking countenance of woman who have attempted murder whose intended victim have followed last night to lair a believed charged with crime wished to perpetrate be amazedconfounded looked up while still gazed at start increase failure of colour betrayed emotion consciousness of guilt fear of detection said good morning miss in usual phlegmatic brief manner taking up ring more tape went on with sewing will put to test thought such absolute impenetrability be past comprehension good morning grace said have anything happened here thought heard servant talking together while ago only master have be reading in bed last night fell asleep with candle lit curtain got on fire fortunately awoke before bed clothes wood work caught contrived to quench flame with water in ewer strange affair said in low voice then looking at fixedlydid mr rochester wake nobody did one hear move again raised eye to time there be something of consciousness in expression seemed to examine warily then answered servant sleep so far off know miss must not be likely to hear mr fairfaxs room yours be nearest to master mr fairfax said heard nothing when people get elderly often sleep heavy paused then added with sort of assumed indifference still in marked significant tonebut be young miss must say light sleeper

needleful of thread waxed carefully threaded needle with steady hand then observed with perfect composure be hardly likely master must laugh must think miss when be in such danger must have be dreaming be not dreaming said with warmth for brazen coolness provoked again looked at with same scrutinising conscious eye have told master that heard laugh inquired have not have opportunity of speaking to morning did not think of opening door looking out into gallery further asked appeared to be cross questioning attempting to draw from information unawares idea struck that if discovered knew suspected guilt must be playing of of malignant prank on thought advisable to be on guard on contrary said bolted door then be not in habit of bolting door night before get into bed fiend want to know habit that may lay plan accordingly indignation again prevailed over prudence replied sharply hitherto have often omitted to fasten bolt did not think necessary be not aware danger annoyance be

before teatime ill make cook here turned to saying that mr fairfax be waiting for so departed hardly heard mr fairfaxs account of curtain conflagration during dinner so much be occupied in puzzling brain over enigmatical character of grace poole still more in pondering problem of position at thornfield questioning why have not be given into custody that morning at very least dismissed from master service have almost a much a declared conviction of criminality last night what mysterious cause withheld from accusing why have enjoined too to secrecy be strange bold vindictive haughty gentleman seemed somehow in power of one of meanest of dependent so much in power that even when lifted hand against life dared not openly charge with attempt much le punish for have grace be young handsome must have be tempted to think that tenderer feeling than prudence fear influenced mr rochester in behalf hard favoured matronly a be idea must not be admitted yet reflected have be young once youth must be contemporary with master mr fairfax told once have lived here many year dont think can ever have be pretty for aught know may posse originality strength of character to compensate for
