chapter iv cromwell ironside gilbert clayton harry drury kept on weary tramp to london at length reached little village of whitechapel be outside city wall have run risk from highwayman footpad now thought danger be over for have almost reached destination just a be about to leave village party of king pikemen rode in at once seized upon traveller to compel to enter king service be dilemma neither of have foreseen to declare be in favour of parliament must be signal for arrest a traitor to majesty to escape on other pretext without telling actual lie seemed equally impossible gilbert be seized first asked name condition latter be not easy to comply with a have left army on account of wound be not at sure that must be received back again therefore gave former occupation mercer of city of london harry gave a farmer for although did not look much like one spoke of being occupation after few more question have be asked answered be marched off to captain of band who began examination by asking name drury repeated be one of hayslope drurys father life at hayslope grange said harry ay right true trusty servant of king be master drury marvel that have not sent to do service for king

through village doubt not will bid wield arm for king charles after visit to london may pursue journey now young man nathless will speed return for king need trusty men to do service in troublous time wish not to force friend too much in matter therefore will suffer to depart time be speaking eyed gilbert most narrowly a if trying to recall where have seen that face before a in truth have for have met in first battle fought between charles parliament at edgehill on border of warwickshire gilbert remembered captain stanhope quite well for have be prisoner for little while until exchange of prisoner took place long illness have however altered gilbert far more than two year campaign have altered captain rode away thinking eye have played false for once perhaps being in company of one whose family be known to be so strongly attached to royal cause helped escape for must not think possible that drury must hold intimacy with claytons have have narrow escape harry must not stay long in london said gilbert a left village saw soldier ride out towards essex then told companion of former acquaintance with captain stanhope harry must not help laughing in spite of sorrow quite agreed that stay in london must be a short a possible must only stay few hour to rest to replenish purse ascertain where lieutenant cromwell be now with army then hasten to join long tramp from essex to london in heat dust have somewhat wearied harry unused to such exertion sooner did hear that horse have be provided than be anxious to start again be soon on great road leading to yorkshire where lord kimbolton lieutenant cromwell be mustering force be sad to pas along edge of uncultivated field in bright summer weather yet what encouragement be there for farmer to plant sow when crop might be trodden down by foot of horse soldier if allowed to ripen to see grain cut down by lawless prince rupert band of soldier robber truly land might be said to mourn a well a inhabitant although a yet have not reached scene of actual strife gilbert be anxious to reach kinsman cromwell a soon a possible so pressed on with speed making inquiry now then at village where slept of people met on road a to whereabouts of two army seems almost incredible in day of rapid communication that necessary intelligence must not be furnished in london that force lay somewhere in near yorkshire be utmost gilbert must learn about illustration ride to north farther travelled northward more people did meet soon became plain that be many of fugitive flying from impending ruin tale told be of course conflicting in fright anxiety to escape save family often confused gilbert be able to make out that scot army have marched over border to help of parliament have be shut up in sunderland by royalist under earl of newcastle parliamentary force under fairfax coming to relief earl have retired to york english scotch together have now laid siege to city a drew near to yorkshire evidence of commotion became still more apparent road be strewed with bed bedding various article of household furniture fugitive have attempted to take with afterwards have thrown away for rumour have gone abroad that prince rupert be coming enough have be heard of atrocity in cheshire lancashire to make people dread approach a must plague at length a neared besieged city heard that lord kimbolton army be in neighbourhood gilbert be not long in discovering encampment seeking out lieutenant cromwell warmly welcomed young kinsman at once accepted service that of companion harry drury be not unused to arm have be taught fencing a part of education must use singlestick arquebus crossbow while fashion of gentleman wearing sword have rendered necessary that weapon must be handled skilfully necessary drill be therefore soon learned by harry be admitted to serve in same corp a friend addition to army be welcome now work of drilling recruit went on day often far into night too life of soldier here in cromwell camp be very different from gay scene of revel have sometimes heard royalist trooper describe there be rioting drunkenness shouting brawling for be sober minded earnest men who felt have real work to do sacrificed much in doing of none have be forced to come here have left home wife little one of own accord to fight country battle set england free wonder that be earnest when thought of dear one far away be not like paid soldier of regular army must not afford to trifle lose time in play when might be at work preparing for battle so when not at drill cleaning of armour furbishing of arm went on ceaselessly clatter of ring of blacksmith tool be broken only by singing of pious hymn voice of one reading to comrade from word of life day be begun closed with prayer for tramp of sentry when once word of command have be given that work must cease camp be a quiet still a sleeping village harry joyfully took share of labour going forward be willing to do anything bear fatigue to prepare to take part in expected action when prince rupert must show july be drawing near now have almost reached united army besieging york be expected that when prince rupert came into field battle must be fought scout be sent out in direction to give timely notice of approach be able to reach force of fairfax before came however only just in time on second of july prince rupert came upon by way of marston moor kimbolton lieutenant be prepared for coming desperate battle be fought for time seemed that royalist must be victorious for prince rupert fought with most desperate bravery driving several general from field thus disconcerting plan tried to do same with cromwell cavalry kept together like iron phalanx rupert dashing charge feigned retreat failed to throw into disorder be rightly named ironside for kept field turned tide of battle in favour of parliamentarian when once royalist saw that day be lost rout be complete retired from field leaving artillery military store baggage to enemy battle of marston moor decided royalist cause in north be lost to charles for ever there might well be hymn of rejoicing solemn thanksgiving for victory for cause of parliament have looked desperate enough only short time before in rejoicing gilbert harry must take part gilbert have again be seriously wounded harry fighting by side have shared same fate news be carried to cromwell just a be giving last instruction to messenger who be to bear despatch to london giving information of victory clayton young drury of hayslope wounded repeated will come see soon then went on giving

clever man of business a be soldier although nominal head of army be lord kimbolton be well known that actual direction of affair rested with lieutenant men looked up to a leader cromwell ironside a troop be now called be everywhere spoken of a having gained battle of marston moor be daily rising into greater prominence be more frequently consulted a to general direction of affair did not forget young kinsman lying sick wounded provision have be made for beforehand medicament hospital store must call have be secured now cromwell went round to see who have be carried from awful battle field where four thousand lay dead many arm be raised when be seen approaching many feeble voice attempted to cheer gilbert lay quiet unconscious while harry be talking in delirium of fever moaning out one

always truce of few month during winter war must not be carried on regardless of weather a be now thus be that often lasted year after departure of captain life seemed to pas more slowly monotonously than ever at hayslope grange out of direct main road stranger rarely came way so little be known of how event be tending in mortal strife going on so near trial of archbishop laud be still being carried on by london parliament oxford be supporting king in combat with subject north having yielded to fairfax parliamentary general be news came to hayslope through remaining day of july sultry

to oxford two seemed mutually pleased with other quite satisfied with bargain maud must not tell whether loved other hoped did mary never gave opportunity of speaking upon subject indeed preparation for coming event seemed to occupy mind so fully that have thought for anything else wedding afforded villager most satisfaction perhaps for master drury be to give ox to be roasted on green prospect

with horror put master drury into fever of mingled anger sorrow man have stopped at blacksmith shed on way from london brought news that archbishop laud have be beheaded on tower hill day before left mistress mabel be speechless with indignation for few minute first act be to take bright cherry coloured bow off bessie hair little girl looked up in surprise saw aunt taking ruffle from own neck wrist be not time for such bravery a said lady looking angrily at ribbon ruffle bessie wondered what have to do with while mistress mabel stood upright watching brother a walked up down room murmuring have slain archbishop murdered lord anointed for good christian ought to fast mourn put in mistress mabel hope brother that will see to that household be not lacking in matter added nay nay leave such

often thinking of maud spoke of a though be sure be so a in truth be have noticed great alteration in guardian lately hair be rapidly changing from brown to silver white tall erect form be bowed a with weight of added twenty year thought with keen pang that if harry did not soon come must never see father again then arose question where be harry for news have come that one voice from battle field telling be sick wounded chapter ix wounded messenger there be little fear that fast must be kept month that archbishop be executed so many be compelled to fast for want of food throughout england that land might be said to mourn although did not put on outward semblance of a mistress mabel did just a men be thinking of leaving home again in early spring came faint rumour peace might be established many heart beat high with hope that commissioner who be to meet at uxbridge negotiate reconciliation between king people might be able to conclude term of adjustment satisfactory to party maud felt sure that peace must be established at last when heard news bertram asked in whisper if harry must come home then to question must only shake head look up at cloud racing across stormy february sky think that harry have probably gone to father home where ambition injustice must never mar peace of one great family have come to conclusion because thought if be living must surely have

to take up sword leaving plough to be guided by woman hand roger rest of companion again left hayslope maud went in out tried to comfort woman for loss master drury seemed to feel failure of uxbridge commission most keenly although did not say much about yet even mistress mabel must not fail to notice whitening hair failing strength of brother spoke to maud about too have noted change long since now felt sure that secret grief for harry be preying upon guardian heart bowing down with premature old age yet dare not mention name must have be relief for to utter to hear spoken so spring passed into summer without outward change at hayslope grange except short visit from mistress mary stanhope at end of june came tidings of battle have be fought fortnight before at naseby in northamptonshire where king army have be completely defeated leaving on field five thousand prisoner immense quantity of war material what be worse than for royalist king private cabinet of paper letter be captured
