god openly fearlessly tell stewart take brave man not coward to declare determined to serve god have said enough about perhaps look tired head ache said must soon be all right if must only know there be chance for poor frank to get better too wish have better news for stewart mother can only pray for chandos be going away a said caught hand held back will pray too whispered if god hears now how will ever keep square afterwards must know to keep from being sneak look here stewart be mistaken altogether in thinking god service dreadful bondage know be boy doe not expect to be prim precise always praying singing psalm be not sure that must not displease if tried to do for know must be poor preparation for work in world by by what must want to do then said first of to think of a friend lord jesus be boy once know so know about boy feeling temptation almost father last word to be 'be honest upright pure ' know god will help to keep father command if seek help a will if will take to be friend be that what want said to be honest upright pure believe do stewart be what god want to be what will help to be if will let what else must do religious folk always be different from others know well ought to be religious sailor ought to be bravest most fearless man on board ship do work better more cheerfully than anybody else well uncle did tell of fellow like once thought must like

ai many like know chandos might make stewart captain mean to be captain know captain of pattern might do a much even more good than common sailor yes be beginning see that boy have anything to do with religion what can do learn better learn lesson more thoroughly so a to be better fitted to do work in world by by suppose will admit that will be men by by if be spared well yes of course then be just religion seems to be for who live to prepare for death that know if be very ill dying must want to be religious of course now be quite mistake stewart to suppose that because be likely to live many year matter of serving god ought to be put off might ask how can be sure that will live even six month longer that may not be carried off by sudden accident like to think of religion a just something to sneak out of world comfortably with religion be to fit to live to live well to fill life full of joy happiness stare stewart can tell happiest people in world to day be who serve god best then what

ask mamma to send for who have be telling tale about burglar robber be nothing to be afraid of burglar such a be thinking of come to steal pie custard will find out thief thief very soon have doubt have be wondering ever since heard whether swain suspect after whether just said to pacify youngster not word have be said about by governor so be inclined to think will get off without further punishment will only be fair after for if governor knew how precious pie spoiled holiday how miserable sick made feel must want to serve out more by way of making remember be not likely to forget repeat again for day like be worse than hardest grind at euclid chapter vii surprise april th there be be most awful row fellow say turned rat at least jackson collins have sent to coventry over must do again if there be same occasion for how must let poor servant lose place character through one of lark governor must be drivelling donkey not to suspect instead of servant always fancied that swain did smell rat until young came tearing up to with tale that police be to be sent for to search kitchen maid box why what be row now asked ca find out anything clear about pie be pretty certain kitchen maid have be giving away bread meat seems be against rule think have handed pie away too sold perhaps sold grandmother young be not such muff a to think servant did that be know what to think must be

study must hardly wait for to say come in when opened door courage seemed to have gone felt ready to run away again did wish to speak to stewart yes sir please sir be about pie said hardly knowing how to begin mean robbery have be committed lately please sir never thought about be being robbery when took took robbed pantry stewart be robbery sir be only lark did not want pie to eat be just for fun what did do with asked governor sternly well sir mr swain helped get away although did know then bit by bit came out tried to screen collins rest somehow there be getting over governor close question sent for gave lecture then long imposition hate imposition sort of grind did mind so much for after governor did give so stiff a might a thought must that poor girl be not to lose place after thought when imposition be got over there must be end of affair seems will for ever be nagged about called rat sneak coward tom say need not have be in such hurry to run off to governor that if police have come must not have found empty dish in box so must not have lost place must still have kept secret chandos too talk something like governor according to be actual robbery although did in fun result be same say might have led to disastrous consequence if have not told whole truth about then went on to say be not keeping promise have made when frank be so ill well how in world be fellow to keep straight for ever said what pleasure did get out of none at a happened be last pantry will rob still there stopped suppose mean to say will get into other mischief at first opportunity well how be to keep out of asked what pleasure did ever get by now know did not enjoy holiday at dinglewell a did yet did said be most miserable day ever spent will never rob pantry more even for fun tell chandos 'd like to keep straight if must how can have tried tried hard ever since affair of poor frank have never touched crib since give word know how hard be to leave off when once have begun on tack know must be hard work think have done very well in resisting a have temptation to use crib might have done better stewart if be not so proud proud said nobody ever called that before sailor be never proud know well be must accept help friend be waiting to give if be not now chandos be fair said have always be willing to accept help take advice from be speaking of of one who care for far more than do although feel sorry enough when go wrong get into scrape make people miserable a often do through thoughtlessness suppose mean mother tell chandos expects know boy ca keep out of mischief know can be mother be thinking of just now god think care much about do chandos ca know believe that care at least little well yes do for have always be friend helped out of scrape given good advice be different about god said why be different be friend who care far more for welfare than do be more anxious to see do well live pure honest upright life than can be yet will not accept help alone can give by alone can conquer inclination to get into mischief often do such great wrong god be friend repeated look here chandos if must believe well know what must do somehow must want to be different almost wish must be true be true stewart a true a truth a true a be standing here wish must believe that god feel personal interest in a much a though be only schoolboy in world wish must somehow chandos seems so strange too wonderful know to be true that god great god who made heaven earth can care for harum scarum lot like yes be wonderful know lord jesus christ cared so much for harum scarum world people in that be content to die to lay down life to bring to god yes have heard something about in church since have be trying to do square thing write bit of sermon have heard about there too then never seemed to that must be for boy god friend of boy like why look here chandos if governor be to proclaim friend must be honour know look at difference take that mean must go tell god about little scrape trouble got into must help out of help to bear a case might be be exactly what do mean stewart do believe believe of course believe know how must get on if did not said chandos be sure spoke truly well perhaps may come to believe too day ca now not just in way do of course know ought to pray do square thing a long a do go to church always seemed to that god must trouble about further have be doing square thing too lately at least have tried at be that enough stewart according to belief must all be slave of god doing just what be obliged for fear of punishment more god doe not ask will not accept such service a that remember text of last sunday son give thine heart what minister said of god desiring will affection to be given to service must follow then quite naturally said when heard be thinking of thinking have begun at wrong end trying to force into giving god service without heart love pleasure in yes be about right chandos said see how must be different god made frank well promised that if must do save from being miserable life 'd do square thing be not mean enough to back out of bargain if can help stewart surely think that god answered prayer for frank just because wanted to tie to miserable bondage for be bondage slavery service know ought to be be 'perfect freedom ' to who begin at right end not wrong by giving heart will love to god well know of course god want to be good suppose must never take such advantage of a suppose making bargain with a be stewart have made great mistake about god heard answered prayer because pitied distress loved too well to let miserable consequence of thoughtless mischief follow through life ought to return love for love not treat god a though thought hard taskmaster well know may be right chandos see how be to begin what pity be be not going to be parson must help saying that meant too may th something have happened that never thought did happen anywhere except in book chandos that so many of boy have looked down upon a being poor beneath because never seemed to have pocket money to spend like rest of have suddenly become baronet sir eustace chandos of chandos court know how many other place besides came upon like thunderbolt for chandos never told uncle be baronet that have relative merchant uncle did tell few week ago that have just heard of sudden death of two cousin did not say more except that have not seen above twice in life suppose may have thought must make great difference to a uncle be not very old man now uncle have just died too miss chandos becomes sir eustace well only wish uncle have put off dying little bit longer just till felt more settled about thing now feel sure will run away to sea if mother come round give consent may th bravo sir eustace be not going to leave just yet seems brother frank be just coming back prefers to stay year then will go to college suppose seem to have made bit of difference in thought perhaps might like to drop friendship now be so rich still poor charley stewart seemed hurt at bare suggestion so be to call chandos a usual will share room just same a though nothing have happened have thought good deal about last two day know good many fellow must have packed up trap gone off at once else held head so high that poor chap like must never be able to speak to have be wondering whether be chandos having learned so many thing about god make different in have thought too that perhaps after a chandos be just a willing to be friend now be sir eustace that god may be friend a said though can hardly get used to thought yet may th there have be tremendous row over prize essay by tom won watch last christmas after time when everybody thought be forgotten though good many of did wonder then how tom managed now be found out that be made up of crib taken from book from note that one of older fellow lost somebody must have turned rat tom say be in awful rage at having to give up watch governor insisted now tom be a dull look a miserable a can be for school have sent to coventry over be very mean think seeing upheld last winter when good many at least knew have right to try for prize must wish have let chandos take

bad time be afraid of other boy will catch infection know what mean be afraid brother may learn to like sea from hearing so much about from tom for two be always together now think need to be afraid frank must never do for sea be sure have persuaded not to tease mother too much about plan of mine holiday to go in for lot of grind next half get prize at christmas then perhaps when see have really be industrious with lesson yet love sea a dearly a ever will be more likely to yield plan may be good one think be be precious hard grind be not quite such trouble a be at first still be bad enough what with crib extra will have to do if be to have chance of taking prize be just enough to turn brain scratch head pull long face time think of still think will try hard a be june th mr chandos have sent very pressing invitation for mamma to pay visit at chandos court of course sir eustace be quite eager must accept not that want to show off grandeur must never believe that of chandos chapter
