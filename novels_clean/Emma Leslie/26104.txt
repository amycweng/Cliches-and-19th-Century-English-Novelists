to be saved new boy got rid of be really what taylor one two leading spirit have decided must be done how to do be puzzle leonard lesson be very imperfectly prepared that night moment must snatch next morning be given to looking over book that might not utterly fail when be called upon to produce what must have learned be conning over one task a walked to school when be overtaken by taylor rest say dabbs ' len nickname among friend saw that new fellow with carrying basket of tool looked like carpenter basket ' said one 'it be brother too know looked a though be going wood chopping somewhere ' said taylor slipped arm in len drew aside 'look here what be going to do about did clever sister say ' behe must think of anything last night be too busy ' be rot know said must be sure to think of something clever be come to that must do something at once torrington will go to dog with working fellow coming here lording over gentleman question be how be to get rid of ' 'yes be how be be easy to say get rid of question be how only thing that can do at present can see be to send to coventry ' to send boy to coventry required united action on part of whole school leonard morrison taylor with one two of friend did not despair of persuading class mate to follow example of course boy in lower class might speak occasional word senior in upper form might have occasion to do same class in school be large practically self contained so that have little to do with in upper junior class be therefore comparatively easy for leading spirit to persuade compel rest to follow lead whatever might be so day following talk between brother sister horace howard found sent to coventry a foe have decreed a be quiet studious lad did not notice at first by degree impressed upon that one have asked question day even told that must not do that felt vaguely uncomfortable before set off on long walk home when found that several of schoolfellow who have previously talked to a walked part of way together ran off a soon a gate be passed heart sank within wondered what must have done to bring punishment upon whatever might feel determined not to let mother know anything about so went into little room where sat at work whistling cheerily a usual betitch stitch stitch ' said a mother looked up from work for accustomed kiss be earlier to night dear ' said mr howard a laid aside work drew tea tray close to ' suppose walked bit faster did gossip quite so much ' said lad have to strangle sigh a spoke lest mother must detect 'be hungry boy ' said mother a hung up cap very answered horace for knew by time that be inconvenient for to have large appetite so be learning to regulate by state of finance went in old jacket again to day horace ' remarked a set dinner before for took mid day meal with to school 'yes wore old jacket why not ' said horace 'you mended up so nicely that be pity not to give turn save other jacket ca be picked up in street know though may sometimes pick wool off hedge be woven made up into boy jacket horace talked on in strain to prevent mother from asking question a to how have got on at school during day for mr howard knew something of way of boy be terribly afraid lest of son schoolfellow must find out something of circumstance not treat horace a must equal nothing lad love of science desire to give education must fit to make use of talent have made willing to consent that must compete for scholarship must enable to do be first time knew that boy from board school have ever be admitted to exclusive grammar school known a 'torrington have watched anxiously day to find out whether lad be treating poorer companion kindly courteously thus far have be perfectly satisfied elder son be a anxious a be that horace must have advantage good education must give be opposed to brother going to torrington ' be only carpenter said 'and never want to be anything better wo suit boy to hear that one of schoolfellow have brother who be common working man ' 'you be not common working man fred ' said mother quickly 'not to perhaps mother mine want to look at thing a world doe do common work carpenter work be glad to get chance of doing to help horace here can only be common working people sewing for shop working for builder be people know want to know wish horace must have be carpenter too ' 'perhaps must have be a well ' said mother with sigh ' be sure must agreed to come here leave whole miserable past behind 'it be left behind ' interrupted mother quickly yes have done best who know what question may be asked now horace have gone to school boy be often curious in inquiry be not a though 'fred fred must leave thing in hand of god be content to take one step at time must not in fairness to horace let throw away opportunity of getting good education will fit to use gift believe god have given ' conversation have taken place at dinner time very day mr howard be thinking of a watched horace eat dinner boy knew that mother eye be upon be more anxious to guard secret so rattled on until mother forgot fear thought fred be making anxious without slightest shadow of cause chapter ii sending to coventry horace howard sat longer over lesson night be quite undisturbed by talking with mother brother when time came for to put lesson aside go to bed knew have only half mastered for thought have wandered continually from subject of lesson before to event of day at school trying to discover what have done to offend schoolfellow that must at once send to coventry in fashion study of mathematics french chemistry physic did not help to solution of problem school mystery greatly hindered other subject from becoming clear to mind when took place in class next morning knew must be bad day for with class work be worse even than feared a lost place after place went down at last even below dunce of form hurt more to see how gleeful other boy be over mistake than to lose place in class at last when horace have blundered worse than usual over lesson master said 'what be matter with to day howard be ill have got headache sir ' answered horace for be truthful lad must not avail of excuse master have thus offered 'you must not have prepared lesson last night then know rule about ' said master sternly 'yes sir studied lesson for more than two hour last night said horace reddening growing more confused for knew class be staring at a fancied glorying in discomfiture in be not far wrong there be one two who pitied in various dilemma must have broken that ban of silence have be decreed against leader kept eye upon must not venture to brave displeasure of elder altogether be cruelly hard day for horace felt strongly inclined to say when went home that must never go near school again become carpenter like brother one trade must be a good a if must not go on learn more of mystery of chemistry physic be consolation to that master have told to prepare special lesson in chemistry in readiness for practical experiment be to take place following day in eagerness over horace forgot vexation trial of day have mastered so quickly that be able to look over again lesson have floored in class imperfect lesson must be like damaged link of chain might bring trouble again again if did not repair mischief at once so by time went to bed have well nigh mastered difficulty worked into state of self content be about best preparation for next day work for went to sleep without thought beyond lesson took place in class looking bright cheery once more to day be to be sort of recapitulation of previous fortnight work in chemistry stupid blunder made previous day be more than atoned for at last when boy have worked out brilliant result greatly surprised master said 'why must have be ill yesterday ' sir be well ' said horace seeing master waited for answer ' be well enough be not quite happy ' then let advise to make happy in future under circumstance then added in undertone 'you be scholarship lad expect more from than from of others 'thank sir will try ' said horace throughout day did not find hard to try a master have suggested others have eye upon be puzzled to account for success have made up mind previous day that must only have to carry on present tactic for short time horace must leave school in disgust else must be asked to leave by head master thus torrington must be saved from going to dog through scholarship boy day experience of what horace must do under terrible ban of displeasure puzzled resolved to watch more closely to make sure none of who be suspected of faltering in allegiance to decree of leader did not speak to on way home horace did not expect now first bitterness of trial have worn off a soon a be beyond school gate set off home at sharp trot softly whistling to a pondered over what must be probable effect if certain acid have be using be mixed with substance entirely different from anything have used in day experiment whistled thought turned matter over over in mind finally ended by wishing that mother must afford to give pocket money like most boy have to spend cost sigh a thought might a well wish for slice of moon at once a for pocket money by time got home be whistling to again a happily a ever when got in mother noticed eager animated look 'why what have happened to make so merry ' said a threw up cap in sheer exuberance of spirit 'nothing much mother only have got idea ' then lad keep ' said brother laughing right ' said horace thinking must be under temptation to part with since schoolfellow must not speak to be good idea know if can only find out way to carry out ' added horace at brother laughed mother remarked that good many people have idea difficulty be to carry into effect so that be of practical use 'oh will want good deal of thinking about know have made quite decide not to be carpenter thought have made up mind about long ago said fred 'ah be thinking other day must be great deal easier to be carpenter earn money be sure that ought not to do something to help mother soon ' boy ' interrupted mr howard 'it must not be duty to give up opportunity of using talent god have given when way have be made clear for to receive education will fit to use by by fred always liked cutting wood making boat stool just a be fond of making chemical experiment watching what result will be ' must be anything carpenter will study mathematics more may do better at trade by by ' said fred 'every man to trade suppose there be nothing like making thing think ' added so brother agreed to differ be very happy evening to horace thought have overcome difficulty must be very happy in spite of ban that schoolfellow have placed upon learned lesson night without difficulty next morning began to recover place in class hour of recess tried sorely few of boy who lived in neighbourhood went home to dinner from one to two o'clock many who came from distance brought luncheon with have dinner provided for at school there be luncheon room provided for who brought meal with horace have preferred eating slice of bread butter bread dripping walking about playground there be others who did same thing walked in group chatted frolicked played game when first came horace have be invited to join have be initiated into mystery of one game peculiar to school be therefore very popular among boy now however be altered horace be left severely alone though boy might go shouting round for to make up game one ever asked horace to take vacant place be left to walk up down side of playground until bell rang for afternoon school then boy who might be near a be passing in took care to hold a far aloof from a possible horace wondered how long be going to last have made several attempt to break through silent persecution boy to whom have spoken have walked away a though be stone deaf so at last horace gave up attempt tried to be happy in spite of say morrison how much longer be that beggar going to hold out ' said taylor one day speaking to leonard a though ought to know about taylor have lost place in class so have leonard felt very amiable if want to know be nearly sick of can tell be lasted month now think may a well give up ' daresay do brother who have just come home from oxford say be people who have brought into school bey people shouted leonard crimson with wrath at insinuation do mean by people why must think so ' 'now get mad len ' said taylor in quieter tone know father be on county council say be who recommended that howard must be sent to torrington ' ' believe ' blazed leonard morrison then with fine inconsistency added did be because fellow got scholarship have to go somewhere ' 'anywhere at torrington must have done for ' grumbled taylor 'and think master council ought to

sneeringly long have be fag ' asked of lad who have spoken 'oh well fag fag will know when taylor come a if in verification of word taylor called to next minute to wait for 'we be late now ' shouted leonard back then started off at sharp pace towards school for have not quite made up mind yet what must tell taylor by way of excuse for not speaking to father so did not want to meet just now must not help noticing a ran that none of rest attempted to join waited at corner of road have be crossing for taylor to come up beo morrison have skulked off said a soon a joined ' believe wanted to get out of way ' said one ' must wonder ' said bigger lad 'but need not think be going to do tell have be ferreting out thing bit know now that be dr morrison persuaded county council to send fellow to

imposition instead of pleasant talk with little morrison if get inside gate ' a spoke heavy clang of school gate be heard boy looked at other a taylor ejaculated have rung last bell two minute be regulation time ' propped back against wall rested after run for gate must not be opened again until prayer be over in school then name must be taken a went in extra lesson must be exacted from in dinner hour ' let little morrison get off without seeing in afternoon said taylor ' sha' be able to nail in dinner hour will give bit more time to think of other plan ' be beastly shame ever sent that scholarship boy to torrington ' said lad a though did not like task of hunting out 'oh well be here must get out ' said taylor a though rather liked hunt just then gate opened lad filed in nearly dozen be late from whole school a passed be asked if have brought note to excuse breach of rule then passed on to different class room instead of going to hall for prayer being late consequent imposition of extra lesson did not improve taylor temper when met leonard at close of afternoon school be in towering rage then morrison out with what message have father sent to school for abominable behaviour what have to say for ' leonard looked little scared at abruptness tone of question answered very quietly bey father be busy last night must not speak to about ' 'busy be well wo be good for if be busy to night let tell for school mean to wait longer if fellow be soon removed will go do hear little morrison mean to clear school of vermin at once 'why did tell to take off ' said one when taylor have walked away 'this be getting bit too much stand up for father if come more of bullying what right have to say who will come to torrington if have spoken of father like that must have have black eye if killed for afterwards ' added friend leonard sighed know taylor a well a do ' said be bad sort of fellow if let have own way ' 'but be such beastly way must put up with ' said other 'he may be cock of walk need not think be going to cackle to like set of hen mean to take fellow out of coventry after come on let walk home with bit see how cock like that there be howard just ahead let catch ' instead of quickening pace leonard looked timorously back there be taylor with group of lad round vigorously declaiming against county council for sending one of scholarship boy to torrington so leonard felt afraid to join unpopular scholar set in defiance of present wave of anger be passing over friend turned down by road walked home by chapter iv dr morrison leonard morrison found sent to coventry not by schoolfellow by sister be just punishment have decided deserved for daring to have opinion of own differed from so to find with own petard made very angry 'where be flo going to do

be lively look out way have done to deserve must like to know ' leonard considered very ill used individual just then be specially angry with sister because have so neatly turned table upon in leaving to do lesson alone missed sadly a time went on there be one to grumble at ask advice from what to do about speaking to father did not know at last decided to say something to mother about matter not that meant to tell must just ask if thought taylor be right in statement so when mr morrison came into room with slice of cake for supper said 'do know whether father have anything to do with sending that scholarship boy to torrington ' 'why be good boy ' said lady 'that be mother may be good dare say be did father send there ' 'the county council sent father must not have power ' suppose not said

warren be nice fellow must not like to hurt feeling said horace 'ah find that lad be more particular about clothes than be yes wear best jacket by mean have doubt will be able to buy new one when want ' so matter be settled next morning met new friend a have arranged two boy have pleasant chat on sort of subject a walked along road just before school be reached when came within sight of other group of boy horace stopped short said 'now have better go on matter if be late have plenty of time in dinner hour to do imposition 'what do mean what do take for ' said warren thrusting arm through companion 'well know school have sent to coventry lately if know what for be more than do so that be likely to alter opinion in hurry ' said horace 'oh school be bothered ' said warren 'of course fellow have to do same a rest when be at school cock of walk be going bit too far time mean to let whole lot see wo follow lead when think be fair square if have good reason for sending to coventry 'd

dare say will rage like bull in china shop come on here see be going in arm in arm ' storm of hiss greeted appearance at school gate horace changed colour arm shook warren gripped tighter so that must not get away 'be worth while sticking to if rest like ' whispered horace 'be anything worth fighting for a old englishman fought in civil war hampden that lot ' warren face be flaming held head high a led horace through hooting crowd of boy while asked question loud enough for of to hear horace did not answer almost wished warren must leave alone be not that gentleman way ' tell what be howard ' said when have reached comparative shelter of playground where hooting have to cease for fear master must insist upon knowing what be about ' have be thinking lot of what be talking about last night be opinion that there must not be so many tyrant in world if did not find easy victim knuckled under to cock of walk at first touch when ought to have said now what do mean by sending to coventry what rule of school have broken ' 'ah know be not rich people be only scholarship boy come from board school 'as if did know that a if pater have not told dozen time lately that wish have sent to board school when be young bless be not rich father be only doctor like morrison there be swarm swarm of child in nursery so may know have got money to roll in like curtis old fellow be two poor boy so will just stand shoulder to shoulder fight lot if want to fight now mind have got to fight for will fight for will let see what two can do if nobody else join little morrison will though think taylor have led dog life lately so must think must be glad enough to cut shop join howard co ' horace laughed a have not done since have be at torrington be ready enough to fight for new friend when one two tried to hustle apart a be going to school did not hesitate to push one of off when be crowding down upon warren boy turned scowled at horace 'who be ' demanded angrily 'the scholarship boy be friend ' said still holding on to warren dealing sharp thrust at who be trying to push between there must be no great demonstration here in lobby of school master must want to know what quarrel be about at dinner time there be little opportunity for new friend to meet for science master if did not know shrewdly guessed attitude taken by rest of class towards scholarship boy so have contrived to find something for to do in chemistry laboratory during recess horace be only too glad of change to do little extra practical work towards elucidation of idea grew more interesting a saw must need great care industry to arrive at result when afternoon school be over warren waited about until horace appeared then said go on little way while speak to morrison want to come with for know cock of walk be bullying if will just join will be three to other lot little morrison be bad sort of fellow when can get to make up mind curtis lot be getting deal too cocky ' so horace walked on to corner of road warren waited for leonard moment taylor saw speak to lad pounced down upon 'now look here morrison ' said go talking to warren now be joined that fellow in coventry will be sent there by rest of school will give week to think over what be talking about at dinner time taylor a spoke slipped arm into leonard walked off leaving warren to try persuade boy to join in walk home with horace taylor curtis party be too strong just now for to rebel against rule so two lad walked home by amid derisive cheer of taylor few others state of thing continued for few day two friend learning to know like other better time met cared le for company of others then quarrel broke out in rank of popular party warren heard that taylor be so hectoring others a to what must do at last out of sheer perversity two three came to walk home with held discussion concerning taylor way ought to have made that young gentleman ear tingle be in coventry now of course ' said one boy vote that make ourselves jolly over say howard want to tell how get lesson done for be always ready with answer have be so floored lately that have have private message if do better will have to go down among junior must make people wild ' horace laughed at idea of there being royal road to acquisition of lesson one of careful steady thoughtful study do swat awfully a fellow say be what be so mad about taylor say torrington will be nothing better than swatting shop place for gentleman if be stopped ' horace opened eye thought went to school that might learn must ' said 'oh torrington have got so fashionable that fellow have come to think of a easy going place where need not work if like ' 'just what pater say exclaimed warren told that if did turn over new leaf must send somewhere else now propose make into swatting club believe mr mason must be glad if did ' `` m sure skeat must ' said 'well there be six of here suppose agree that will stick to work of evening till have got lesson perfect for next day taylor be mad when find out ' said a taylor have offended suggestion added piquancy to notion so before separated pledged to join new swatting club be not elegant name for party of student to call object of combination be good be warmly commended by parent who be taken into confidence of son if little party of student thought be going to have easy time of at school be mistaken for taylor more popular party soon found out by answer given in class what new combination meant be more angry than ever ' parcel of beggar who set up to be gentleman have business at torrington sooner take off better exclaimed angrily when discussing new departure with few of chosen friend warren overheard what said be not averse to duel of word with 'the cock of walk 'who do call gentleman demanded 'those who live in glass house son of man who used to keep ' taylor did not wait to hear more before objectionable word must be spoken warren received blow felled to ground came so unexpectedly be struck so unfairly that there be instant cry of 'coward coward fight fair square ' right let come on ' said taylor warren be in fit condition to stand up to antagonist just now for have struck head a have fallen lay for minute two quite unconscious of boy grew alarmed be glad to see boy open eye colour slowly return to face be outside school premise when incident occurred took care to walk away a quickly a must lest master attention must be called to quarrel be compelled to give account of must not have be at to taste a preferred to manage own affair in own way with a little interference from master a possible in what regarded a own private business taylor be one of first to walk off when saw warren be getting better rest who have hoped to enjoy spectacle of fight be disappointed there be plenty to urge warren to 'take out ' of taylor day plenty more to side with bigger lad urge to 'have out ' with warren for 'cheek ' in daring to dispute authority of majority of class speak to scholarship boy when have be sent to coventry leonard morrison be one of foremost in urging taylor to fight out 'the school expects of urged leonard 'he said father be behut up will ' snarled taylor turning angry gaze upon leonard 'if have taken that fellow out of coventry be plucky thing to do in face of whole class like pluck ' added 'though may get kick be plain that 'the cock of walk be seriously hurt alarmed by what warren have said for ceased to crow a loudly a usual walked home without noticing what satellite said eye bent on ground evidently lost in thought over something disturbed more than prospect of fight with warren of course a be latest phase of scholarship boy question occupied more of thought attention than earlier question so horace walked into school next morning chatting with one two others protesting hiss be raised be noticed that warren be not with looked round anxiously from time to time in search of friend day passed did not appear boy spirit be damped little in consequence for remembered now that have heard that blow on head might prove dangerous to warren to relief of everybody two friend be seen coming along road together next morning when taylor appeared round bend in road warren walked up joined 'look here taylor have business to say what did other day for ca fight seems father have forbidden because ' 'then wo repeat what said other day interrupted taylor eagerly 'what do take for must be cad if did besides can see now have business to blame for what be not going to say anything ' whispered in answer to taylor frown 'let tub stand on own bottom say right old fellow will let matter drop then mind mum be word between ' 'right be ' said warren then ran off to join horace for have drawn taylor aside to say a of wished talk to be overheard whatever might be that warren have heard concerning antecedent of taylor family must not be more sensitive upon point than warren be over inability to fight without danger to life for schoolboy to be told that can not stand up in fair square fight without bringing danger to antagonist of being charged with manslaughter have brought shock to boy that be rather than effect of fall made father forbid going to school previous day lad have wondered how be to get out of finishing fight already begun demanded greater amount of courage on part to walk up to taylor ask to let matter end where be than to stand up before for turn at fisticuffs even with almost dead certainty of getting worst of have told secret to horace a came along glad of confidant who must understand difficulty horace have counselled that must make up quarrel with taylor even though involved throwing over if taylor must make demand warren shook head ' sha do ' said ' think will find way can tell fellow have agreed to cry quits tell ca stand up fight for fear other fellow must get sent to prison afterwards be dreadful part about be what father say must be pretty sure to follow what awful muff must be ' sighed boy than girl 'but look here have just done something took lot more courage of sort ' said horace who be ready to make hero of new friend for managing affair with taylor without throwing over 'you did plucky thing too speaking to in face of class 'oh be just part of fight be in believe be born fighter now for sake of other people must be mum go through world like girl know anything about girl never have sister so ca tell what be like know will have plenty of other sort of courage when be wanted so need not mind much if ca fight with fist have reached crowd of boy near gate now two three pressed eagerly forward to know when where fight be to come off 'we have settled now ' answered warren 'bosh believe boy be just going off to have out by 'you be not going to let warren off be taylor ' shouted lad a taylor appeared up mind own business leave warren to settle own affair in own way having said pushed way through crowd marched straight into school chapter vi for honour of school 'how be friend warren to day len asked mr morrison on day when boy thought adjourned fight ought to have come off be friend of mine now be awful sneak ' said leonard angrily be greatly mystified over fight not taking place for intended to support taylor at least do part of cheering on side collapse of whole affair annoyed chose to consider be be fault 'he just funked know dad said when explained matter to father ' know so much about ' said mr morrison ' met father yesterday told have forbidden son to engage in fight either now at future time asked if thought son must obey ' 'yes do said seemed quite confident that boy must respect wish wondered whether be right so warren junior refused to fight did ' said mr morrison 'it be plucky thing to do like boy who can say stick to ' 'the fellow be saying be beastly mean of funked because taylor be bigger fellow ' boy often jump to wrong conclusion be only plucky thing warren have done have joined swatting club yet boy ' 'what did say father asked leonard with widely opened eye formation of swatting club be last new move hear at torrington to swat be to study understand be that right ' yes word be right enough who told about ' 'be secret then did know about have be asked to join ' 'no must ask be likely for school know that be trying to keep up honour of torrington keep from going to dog in fact ' said boy loftily with angry tone in voice ' be glad to hear be torrington boy in time love old school still 'then father what did send beastly scholarship boy there for ' burst out leonard scarcely knowing what said in anger leonard ' chided mother ' beg pardon mother be what fellow be always saying forgot ' 'but why must boy be vexed that county council chose to send one of most promising of scholar to school have done anything to offend ' 'we give chance want father to take away at once see honour of school be at stake fellow like curtis taylor ' doctor held up hand to stop boy angry flow of word 'we wo discus gentleman if please ' said 'but be always discussing ' exclaimed leonard foolish of ' interrupted mr morrison 'but now tell what mean by honour of school why lad have endangered ' 'he come from board school of course be intended for poor common people answered boy poor common people must be taught know now if posse brain have right to learn to use a well a who be better off from dr mason report to council lad have given satisfaction while have be at school have hoped that must have made acquaintance by time might have learned little more about from point of view leonard shook head must go to warren for have chosen to take up in defiance of whole school ' stopped dimly conscious that in anger have already said too much mr morrison be called away from table at point leonard felt relieved that further question must be asked later went to little room where lesson be learned found sister sitting in usual place wished to come len ' said in explanation of presence 'all right duffy not that be such duffer added 'and will try to find name for ' 'oh duffy will do waste time thinking about name for what be in name after be what be not what name be called by say what be swatting club father have heard about never told about ' 'never heard of before wo taylor be mad when tell for if there be one thing hate be swat say be low vulgar not fit for school like torrington '

if did together again when heard lenny singing knew be good mr morrison said that while florence be gathering up book when have gone upstairs took seat facing leonard have long talk with told what father have heard concerning one portion of school that be becoming almost lawless in determination not to learn more than master must force upon 'he told too that heard to day of few boy who have separated from party be determined to profit by instruction given learn home lesson to best of ability ' mr morrison saw leonard lip curl a spoke in admiration of lad be just set of cad muttered under

particular mischief ' admitted mother father be not very satisfied with way thing have be going on at school lately know last report be far from satisfactory father said be just wasting time instead of learning must now promise dear that will make new beginning leonard stared at book drummed on table in silence mr morrison feeling that have said enough for once rose left room hoped that leonard must think over what have said act upon although have not given promise that asked went back to drawing room sat down to think thought wandered to that brother whom son so strangely resembled prayed that god must save boy from wrecking life bringing misery to friend a beloved brother have done now leonard chose to be half offended over what mother have said to beother want to be like duffing girl ' whispered to a left room wonder who be be telling about somebody who have got into nice scrape be obliged to leave england be nice thing to be told be like scapegrace ' muttered in spite of anger did manage to learn something of lesson night before went to bed might have got on fairly well in class if have not met taylor early in walk to school taylor be brimming over with importance of piece of news have heard 'what do think morrison there be lot of sneak in school who have set up swatting club without saying word to about ' 'yes know pater have heard of want to join ' 'you will never do

have become certain that there must have be cause for father disappearance though mother might not know in own mind there be lurking fear that disgrace might lie hidden below long silence so a soon a tea be over said ' be going out to get thing for breakfast ' so horace be left to comfort of book study of lesson when leonard reached home that same afternoon florence met with information that father mother have gone out mary housemaid did not know what time must be home 'where have gone ' asked leonard for be rare occurrence for to be away at same time florence shook head beary say that james be sent with letter to mr warren so must think father have asked to look after of patient havery likely answered brother then took satchel to little room where lesson be studied sat down to think did not know whether be glad sorry to hear that father have gone out a came along have made up mind that must be impossible to get bottle from father dispensing room for be never allowed to go there be just possible that father have locked door before going out in case must tell taylor that be impossible to get chemical for there must be end of although said knew there must not be end of if refused at last to get what be wanted must be sent to coventry at least by whose society desired so after washing hand before going to tea went to dispensing room to find out whether door must be opened found that yielded at once went in closed door lest one of servant must come way see when must be sure to remind that be not allowed to go there after closing door looked round to see what must find there by sink be row of glass stoppered bottle evidently filled with water for washing selected two that thought must hold about pint pouring out water took to study hid in corner out of sight in case florence must decide to do lesson with evening seemed a though everything be to favour in what knew be wrong doing sister told at tea time that must do lesson in own room for have extra piece of history to study a be working for history prize to be given at christmas 'oh right ' said leonard with mouth full of bread jam be girl can do suppose get prize now then ' ca do if be boy retorted

dusk when gas be lighted went to look at bottle then saw in corner near where have hidden old leather bag of father remembered now that have be told might have for book when satchel be worn out decided to take at once 'this be good fortune indeed taylor say will take care nobody find out if only get stuff there taylor be smart fellow so be father must not have made big fortune in year two a taylor say did dad wo make one in life time be afraid will just have to go plodding on at hard work unless can learn thing two from taylor by by ' while have be speaking to have be wrapping bottle up

there must be such smell from bag that must betray before must be got into 'the stinkery at school put book in bag a well a bottle so that if sister must discover that have be out must say have be to borrow book from one of schoolfellow went out by back gate for did not want anyone to know be going if must help florence might hear shut front door knew where to go a brought father private bottle sovereign to pay for what have chemist served without demur wondered little what doctor must want chemical for reflected that a leonard be old enough to sign poison book in regular way a mr morrison be well known practitioner in town there must be harm done in letting have what wanted so leonard walked home in triumph with bottle securely wrapped up in bag on way back met taylor walking arm in arm with curtis smoking cigarette little morrison said in patronising tone a leonard stopped for must have passed without noticing 'this be piece of luck ' exclaimed boy can take bag now taylor bottle stuff be in safe enough 'what bottle what stuff ' said stepping back pace a if proffered bag must bite 'you know what be ' said leonard in tone of surprise 'oh know nothing until bring stuff told

must like to know first why went away left alone said fred with reddening brow 'it be not fair to mother to of be not sure that will ever want to see again ' then tear filled fred eye down lad ' said doctor father knew that must feel angry at what have happened to use own word doe not deserve anything else at hand be to tell story in a few word a possible leave rest to beome time before went away have patient named taylor seems to have be very fascinating sort of man father be not very strong one through man neglected practice great deal be doctor know friend always seemed to have plenty of money went about country good deal together enjoying doing great harm beyond father neglecting work at home 'this lasted for time then one day friend begged a great favour to sign name to bill of course by doing father became responsible for whole amount of debt if friend must fail to repay within time named have such confidence in mr taylor believed said about wealth coming to that signed after little persuasion although be for very large amount of money 'he never told mother of transaction because knew disliked mistrusted taylor ' few day before bill became due father found to dismay that friend have disappeared from london house one knew where have gone still father said word to mother of what have happened when be served with notice that must now pay debt be seized with panic at thought of ruin have brought upon family instead of bravely staying to do what must to help who be dependent upon went out one morning took passage to australia by vessel be just leaving dock must be said in excuse for just at time there be great talk of rapid fortune be being made in gold field have heard that taylor have gone there to make fortune ' need hardly tell that did not see false friend again although heard of more than once during wandering in wild of australia wrote one short letter telling mother must come home a soon a have made fortune resolved in own mind not to do so until have accomplished for only in way thought must atone for past prove that be worthy of confidence for future found task much harder than have supposed instead of making fortune at gold field be robbed of little possessed be glad to get sort of work must provide with crust of bread 'then met with mr morrison brother who be not unlike in many respect easily led weak to resist temptation in hard school of affliction to have condemned god met showed folly sin of have be guilty sought found pardon through lord jesus christ then through help of god holy spirit began to struggle against temptation by be beset in struggle grew strong strong enough to resist even making of illegal gain so fortune be to restore to home country be long time in making meanwhile clung to other to god ' father might have written to ' said fred still little hardly wrote to nearest friend in england must remember that mother have left london have left liverpool where be living when brother in law went away so both letter be returned wanderer must only work on in faith hope that one day god must bring to dear one again fred have listened with greatest intentness to doctor story now roused remembering that errand have come upon have not yet be mentioned 'thank dr morrison said 'for telling can not help thinking still that father have be very cruel to although may not have intended came to see about something else have son who go to school with brother horace have be hurt somehow be in bed at master house son wish to tell that know something of what happened did not mean to hurt anybody three boy might have died through what be done ' be just boy never intend wilfully to hurt other believe be only rarely that men do so do through weakness thoughtlessness bring untold misery upon friend who love father spoiled life brother in law almost wasted one must teach lad lesson ask god to make strong to resist first temptation strong in strength of lord jesus christ for alone can help in hour of trial remember that time of trial must come to sooner later sooner come in life better if only go to strong for strength to sustain ' then doctor rang bell told servant to send leonard
