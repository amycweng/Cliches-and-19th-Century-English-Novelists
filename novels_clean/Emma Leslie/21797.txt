tell dick that be so be enough however to quicken own interest in what line of letter might be able to tell if only must solve mystery of putting into word for doubtless must clear up anxiety a to whether god loved boy a well a girl did not spend whole time poring over picture gathered samphire helped to sort fish when be brought in mend much despised net day spent time diligently tracing out letter knew spelling over g o d might have mastered difficulty with very little trouble if fisherman have be le obstinate in quarrel with farm people for harry hayes sister be often down on sand sometimes bringing book with dick who longed to join in play tried to persuade tiny to go ask to help with reading difficulty dad wo say anything to even if must see talking wo see wo tell urged dick

have left tiny be startled by sound close at hand looking round saw coomber coming from other side of sandhill oh dad thought be out in boat said illustration ' want to sing bit while rub away at old gun see page bob tom have gone by to day for wanted to clean gun ready for winter said fisherman still rubbing at lock with piece of oiled rag tiny looked up at shyly half curiously for if have only be on other side of sand ridge must have heard dick have be talking about if have heard fisherman took notice of what have passed come want to sing bit while rub away at old gun said sing betar of peace ' will sound first rate out here a though have never heard out there before when a matter of fact scarcely day passed sang to please when have finished said quickly what do think about betar of peace ' deary be sailor star know so have got sort of share in like think mean god be abeost sure mother said meant god added little girl ah then think there be much share of for said coomber somewhat sadly turned to rubbing gun again began talking about how rusty have found how must have to use more than ever when winter came for boat be growing old must not stand much more knocking about by rough wintry sea so bob must shoot more wild bird only go out in calm weather when winter came then half shyly with apparent effort brought conversation round so a to include farmer hayes ai bad sort know tiny if must just remember that fisherman be bit proud independent though may be poor if must do one of young 'uns good turn time why be sailor lass yer know sailor be always ready to do good turn to anybody yes daddy said tiny slowly thoughtfully then after minute pause said daddy think harry polly must just like to help bit with reading for answer fisherman burst into loud laugh be what 'd like s'pose said a looked at yes want to find out about picture letter tell about know if only must find out what mean said tiny eagerly oh well when be gone indoors can go ask if 'd like to help said with short laugh maybe will be able to tell about when winter come will soon be here now added fisherman with sigh never before have coomber looked forward with such dread to winter until lately have always thought fishing boat must last time a used to say have patched repaired so often lately until at last conviction have be forced upon that be worn out to be caught in sudden squall on open sea must inevitably break up who be in must meet with watery grave be a brave a lion to know that boat be gradually going to piece that timber might part company at almost moment made even courage quail especially when thought of wife boy little helpless girl hard thing have be said at fellness about folly in taking upon hand when must without difficulty have be sent to poorhouse girl be such useless burden never likely to be helpful in managing boat a boy might be be clear that reward must ever be obtained from friend even if be found for clothing made evident that be only child of poor parent have be reasoning among fellness busybody ever since coomber have announced intention of taking little girl home be a obstinate in a in most other thing have followed own will rather god like compassion of own heart in spite of poverty surrounded hard struggle often have to get bread enough for own child will just have to stay out bit longer go out in boat bit oftener said with light laugh when attempted to reason out of project did not know then that day of boat be numbered knew now knew that starvation stared in face at distant date must never hope to buy new boat must cost over twenty pound seldom owned twenty penny over day stock of bread other household necessary among counted whisky for fisherman must do work without daily supply of ardent spirit never entered head blue ribbon army temperance crusade have never be heard of be fixed belief among fisher folk that man must not work without drinking a well a eating drinking deeply too so coomber never thought of curtailing daily allowance of grog to meet additional expense of household rather increased allowance that might be able to work boat better a fancied so catch more fish when forgot bottle left at fellness struck a something marvellous that must be able to work next day without usual dram have not convinced that must do without together of effect upon in making sullen morose disagreeable be in absolute ignorance so child talk about came upon a revelation knew that tiny sometimes shrank from avoided have considered mere childish whim not to be accounted for by anything in so to hear that be absolutely afraid of sometimes be something to make think more deeply than have ever done in life before did not say word to tiny about when have done rubbing gun carried home tiny be left free to make acquaintance with farm child walked shyly up to where be sitting polly reading harry throwing sand at dick who have seated at short distance be returning salute must must like to tell about letter please said tiny holding out paper to polly well be rum way of asking said harry with laugh suppose must now little 'un added then must said tiny stoutly though tear welled up to eye at thought of hope being overthrown just when seemed about to be realised harry what tease be said sister must like to tell dear added in patronising tone come sit down here tell what want be what want forget polly else will get back up go off again laughed brother be not sorry embargo have be taken off intercourse with fisherman family for although have have surreptitious dealing with boy sometimes have to be so watchful lest must be discovered that play be considerably hindered now understood that advance on tiny part be direct concession from coomber for boy have long ago agreed to try draw little girl into intimacy a only way of breaking down restriction laid upon tiny have proved obstinate have be asked again again have always returned same answer daddy must let day then must play with so harry hayes be perfectly aware that have won fisherman consent at last although word have be said about when girl be left to polly took up picture looked at then turned over read god be good to love boy girl at point tiny interrupted by laying hand on arm saying eagerly be quite sure be what say why think can read said polly in half offended tone subject be new to so be anxious to read further turned to page again read on at bottom be line two in smaller print polly read longer word with touch of pride jesus said little child to come unto forbid not for of such be kingdom of god then must be jesus be little child concluded polly a turned over paper to look at picture again two girl sat looked at talked about for few minute then tiny said wistfully will show now how make up nice word oh be easy enough if know letter must learn letter first said polly proceeded to tell tiny name of little girl have satisfaction of knowing now that have remembered quite correctly that g o d did spell god a have surmised be not long now in putting other word together before went home be able to spell out first two line of printed page for be easy word intended for beginner what triumph be to tiny to be able to read out to fisherman family what have learned on sand day be allowed to have candle to herself after supper sat round table looking at other in wondering amazement a little finger travelled along page spelt out wonderful news 'god be good to love boy girl be true dick what told ai said in tone of delighted satisfaction dick scratched head looked round at father wondering what must think say for minute two fisherman smoked pipe in silence at length taking from mouth said in slow meditative fashion well little s'pose if be printed that way be true if be why s'pose have got share in betar of peace ' be talking about to day tiny did not quite follow train of thought nodded head then proceeded to tell what have heard about picture conclusion polly have arrived at upon subject jesus kind loving man of picture have come to show how kind god be to illustration chapter vi bad time winter around bermuda point be at time dreary season only thing few inhabitant must hope for be that reign might be a short a possible fine calm autumn be hailed a special boon from heaven by fisher folk round coast more especially by lonely dweller at point fine autumn enabled coomber to go out in boat until time for shooting wild fowl began child must play on sand gather samphire instead of being penned up in house time when weather be wild wet salt marsh lay under water meant little food much discomfort frequent quarrel much bitterness to fisherman family autumn weather be more than usually boisterous long before usual time old boat have to be drawn up on to bank for fear wave must dash to piece fisherman sometimes went to fellness on chance of picking up stray job for be only state of boat anxiety to keep together a long a possible that prevented braving peril of sea so sometimes got loan of boat helped fisherman with then rough though might be fisher folk be kind helpful to other if must not afford to pay money for job must pay for in bread flour potato perhaps so must generally find coomber something to do that might help without hurting there be little work must be done in such bad weather a knew proud independent spirit must not brook to accept even mouthful of bread that have not earned so there be many weary day spent at home sauntering round coast with gun on look out for stray wild fowl tiny often went to bed hungry woke up feeling faint sick although never forgot to say prayer must not help thinking sometimes that god must have forgotten read paper to dick tom have learned to spell out of word read to herself again again divine assurance god be good to love boy girl then a dick said sometimes bermuda point be such long way from anywhere might forget there be boy girl living there when be very hungry more than usually depressed tiny thought dick must be right even then must not admit such thought to others when saw mr coomber in tear because have food to prepare for hungry child must steal up to pas little arm round poor woman neck whisper god be good will take care of mammy will send supper if ca send dinner child hopeful word often proved true prophecy for sometimes when coomber have be out day without finding anything must be called food must when returning manage to secure wild duck perhaps couple of sea magpie few young gull nothing came amiss to young coombers at time just now tough stringy gull be dainty morsel threatened to be unusually hard long winter at last mr coomber ventured to suggest that tiny must be taken to poorhouse at least until spring when must come back again look at poor little white face said woman with apron to eye be afraid will be ill soon then what can do time enough to talk about when be ill said coomber gruffly a took up gun went out be generally able to keep good fire of drift wood wreckage be washed ashore for unfortunately there be scarcely week passed noble vessel came to grief on perilous bar sand during more boisterous weather once when be at wit end for food bob have begged mother to boil samphire for supper tiny be fortunate enough to discover unopened cask sea have cast up night before left high dry behind ridge of sandhills be not long fetching bob boy to see treasure trove sort of wild speculation passing through mind a to what must contain a ran shouting bob bob dick dick come see what have found illustration dick come see what have found see page boy be not long in making appearance bob fetched hatchet soon broke open cask oh what joy for starving child be full of ship biscuit oh dick did tell morning god have forgotten said tiny in quavering voice when bob announced what cask contained oh yes said dick so did be too hungry to think of anything biscuit now too hungry even to shout joy a must have done at time a soon a must be got at handed one to tiny then tom dick helped filling pocket munching at same time tiny though nibbled biscuit a went ran at once to tell mr coomber of wonderful discovery scarcely daring to believe that such good news must be true ran out at once to see for met boy who confirmed tiny tale must see cask for herself then ate filled apron shed tear thanked god for wonderful gift at same time then told boy to come fetch basket at once to carry home in must sort over for be soaked with sea water others near middle be quite dry bob took bagful went in search of father along coast everybody be busy carrying sorting drying biscuit for have to be secured before next tide came in might be washed away again when coomber came home bringing couple of sea gull have shot be fairly overcome at sight of biscuit daddy be god that sent 'em said tiny in earnest joyful whisper fisherman drew sleeve across eye seems a though must have ' be deary said for how cask ever came ashore without being broken up well nigh beat god did let break 'cos wanted biscuit said tiny confidently yer see daddy ai forgot though bermuda point be long way from anywhere biscuit lasted for time for a season advanced coomber be able to sell of wild duck shot so potato flour bread must be brought at fellness again if fisherman must only have believed that whisky be not a necessary a bread might have suffered le privation time got little money for wild fowl bottle have to be replenished even though took home quantity of bread be needed so tiny sometimes be heard to wish that god must always send biscuit in tub then daddy must drink stuff made so cross mr coomber smiled sighed a heard tiny whisper to dick too have often wished something similar at least that husband must do without whisky now a supply of wild fowl steadily increased came home more sullen than ever return from fellness grew to be dread even to tiny at last dick used to creep off to bed just before time be expected to return leaving bob tom to bear brunt of storm might follow seldom noticed absence until one night when having drunk rather more than usual be very cross on coming in evidently on look out for something to make quarrel over where dick gal said a looked round little kitchen after flinging into chair be gone to bed said wife timidly not venturing to look up from work then tell to get up dunno whether 'ud be good for tiny faltered poor

must be of use reasoning with in present mood so went to rouse child without further parley be not asleep so be prepared for summons a have overheard what have be said oh mammy must come said tiny teeth chattering with fear a slipped out of bed be afraid deary let see be frightened whispered mr coomber slip clothes on a quick a can come sing betar of peace ' to then will drop off to sleep can come to bed again will will try said child trying to force back tear speak bravely in spite of effort to be brave not look a though be frightened crept into kitchen looking cowed half bewildered with terror before must utter word of song coomber pounced upon what do yer look like for demanded what business have to be frightened of tiny turned white face towards ventured to look up be going to sing betar of peace ' interposed mr coomber let come sit over here by fire let alone roared husband be going to do what tell come here called in still louder tone tiny ventured step nearer did not go close to be coming roared again then stretching out hand seized by arm dragged towards giving violent shake a did so there now sing commanded placing against knee child stared at with blank fascinated gaze once saw lip move sound came from after waiting minute dashed from with strength of mad fury there be shriek from mr coomber scream from boy poor little tiny uttered sound picked up from where have fallen rather have be thrown face be covered with blood uttered groan gave sign of life oh be dead be dead wailed dick bending over a lay in mother arm terrible sight have completely sobered coomber

like that coomber groaned made reply hold tongue bob commanded mother for must see that husband be sorry enough now for what have done what be to be done mother asked in subdued voice surely surely have killed child mr coomber feared that have be paralysed faculty know what to do said helplessly wiping away blood kept flowing from deep gash on tiny forehead must give water said dick who did not know what else to suggest coomber meekly fetched cupful from pan outside mr coomber dipped apron in bathed tiny face in minute two dick saw to great delight that drew faint fluttering breath coomber saw too relief be so great that must not keep back tear please god will spare little 'un will never touch drop of whisky sobbed a leaned over wife chair watched bathe still pallid face open door dick let have breath of fresh air stand too close said mother a tiny drew faint breath door be opened boy stood anxiously aside watching faint gasping breath until at last tiny be able to swallow little of water then must have closed round again mother kept off must drop o ' milk do good whispered coomber after time be sensible enough to recognise voice shuddered visibly groaned a saw drew further back so that must not see when opened eye give sticking plaster dick said mother when tiny have somewhat revived mr coomber be used to cut wound must strap up a cleverly a surgeon be not sight of ugly cut have frightened death like swoon did not understand how about milk mother coomber ventured to ask after tiny forehead be strapped up bandaged again came that shudder of fear little girl crept closer to sheltering arm be frightened deary daddy wo hurt now let come whispered tiny coomber heard whisper cut to heart although kept carefully in background a repeated question must yer like little milk deary asked mr coomber there ai money to buy milk said tiny in feeble weary tone coomber crept round back of kitchen so a to keep out of sight took up bottle of whisky have brought home went out brought jug of milk when came back can send for more to morrow a long a want said a stood jug on table illustration chapter vii tea meeting tiny be very ill next day too ill to get up to notice what be passing around mr coomber who have have very little experience of sickness be very anxious when saw tiny lying so quiet lifeless looking white bandage on forehead making poor little face look quite ghastly in paleness fisherman have crept into room before went out to look at while be asleep sight have made heart ache never thought must have ' be brute a to hurt little 'un like said drawing

yet let get mastery of be last mother took bottle to farm last night be going to let have value of in milk for little please god get well again be more whisky will touch be not easy for man like coomber to make such promise still more difficult to keep for first few day while tiny be very ill be not so hard to send bob tom to fellness with teal widgeon have shot when began to get better craving for drink made felt then began tug of war during first few day of little girl illness fisherman kept carefully out of sight though longed to see once more hear say have forgiven cruel blow have dealt to tiny too longed for to come see in daytime a grew dusk longing passed away night a hour drew near when usually came back from fellness positive dread terror of seized must lie shivering holding mr coomber hand whenever heard voice in kitchen mr coomber tried to persuade husband to go see child in daytime only shook head hate deserve to see agin said gloomily returned same answer again again when pressed to go in see before went out with gun in morning at length a sat at breakfast one day be startled by tiny creeping up to just a have slipped out of bed oh daddy why did come

not actually uneatable by who be on verge of starvation be utterly unfit for child like tiny in present weak delicate condition again question of sending to poorhouse until spring be mooted by mr coomber husband did not refuse to discus time when be mentioned be evident that have thought of already for said with groan seems a though god be going to let keep little though be getting on bit for

complained have eaten up store of biscuit by time although dick tom often spent hour wandering along shore in hope of finding wonderful treasure trove nothing have come of wandering beyond usual harvest of drift wood enabled to keep good fire in kitchen day at length be decided that coomber must take tiny to poorhouse ask authority to keep until bitter winter be over then when spring came boat must go out once more must fetch home again be not without many tear that proposal be confided to tiny fisherman insisting though shrank from task that must be told what thought of doing be sailor lass be only fair to said a left wife to break news to tiny be overwhelmed at thought of being separated from who have be so kind to whom have learned to love so tenderly with mighty effort
