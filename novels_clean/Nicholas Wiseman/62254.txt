be formed author of following little work be consulted upon not only approved of design ventured to suggest among others series of tale illustrative of condition of church in different period of past existence one for instance might be called church of catacomb second church of basilica comprising three hundred year third must be on church of cloister then perhaps fourth might be added called church of school in proposing sketch added perhaps reader will find indiscreetly that felt half inclined to undertake first by way of illustrating proposed plan be taken at word urged strongly to begin work after reflection consented with understanding that be not to be occupation only recreation of leisure hour with condition work be commenced early in year have be carried on entirely on principle have therefore be written at sort of time in sort of place early late when duty urged in scrap fragment of time when body be too fatigued mind too worn for heavier occupation in road side inn in halt of travel in strange house in variety of situation circumstance sometimes trying one have thus be composed bit by bit in portion varying from ten line to half dozen page at most generally with few book resource at hand once begun have proved what be taken for recreation often solace sedative from memory have revived association have renewed scattered broken remnant of old study early reading have combined by familiarity have cherished with better time better thing than surround in age why need reader be told for two reason first method of composition may possibly be reflected on work may find patchy ill assorted not well connected in part if so account will explain cause secondly will thus be led not to expect treatise learned work even upon ecclesiastical antiquity nothing must have be easier than to cast air of erudition over little book fill half of page with note reference be never writer idea desire be rather to make reader familiar with usage habit condition idea feeling spirit of early age of christianity required certain acquaintance with place object connected with period familiarity more habitual than learned with record of time for instance such writing a act of primitive martyr must have be frequently read so a to leave impression on author mind rather than have be examined scientifically critically for mere antiquarian purpose so such place monument a have to be explained must seem to stand before eye of describer from frequently almost casually seeing rather than have to be drawn from book source of instruction have be freely used one acquainted with roman breviary must have observed that in office of certain saint peculiar style prevails present holy person commemorated in distinct characteristic form be not result so much of continuous narrative a of expression put into mouth brief description of event in life repeated often again again in antiphon responsoria to lesson even versicle till put before individuality portrait clear definite of singular excellence to class belong office of s agnes agatha ccilia lucia of st clement st martin of saint stand out before mind with distinct feature almost a if have seen known if for instance take first that have named clearly draw out following circumstance be evidently pursued by heathen admirer whose suit for hand repeatedly reject sometimes tell that be forestalled by to whom be betrothed sometimes describes object of choice under various image representing even a object of homage to sun moon on occasion describes rich gift beautiful garland with have adorned chaste caress by have endeared to then at last a if more importunately pressed reject love of perishable man food of death triumphantly proclaims spouse of christ threat be used declares under protection of angel who will shield history be a plainly written by fragment of office a word be by scattered letter brought joined together throughout one discerns peculiarity truly beautiful one in character be clearly represented to that saint have ever before unseen object of love saw heard felt entertained have returned real affection such a heart on earth have for one seems to walk in perpetual vision almost in ecstatic fruition of spouse presence have actually put ring upon finger have transferred blood from own cheek to hers have crowned with budding rose eye be really upon with unerring gaze returned look of gracious love what writer introduced person must venture to alter character who must presume to attempt one at variance with who must hope to draw portrait more life like more exquisite than church have done for putting aside inquiry a to genuineness of act by passage be suggested still more waving question whether hard critical spirit of former age too lightly rejected such ecclesiastical document a guranger think be clear that church in office intends to place before certain type of high virtue embodied in character of saint writer of following page considered therefore bound to adhere to view whether object have be attained be for reader to judge at rate even looking at amount of information to be expected from work in form one intended for general reading comparison between subject introduced formally casually given in elementary work such a fleurys manner of christian embrace several century more will show that a much positive knowledge on practice belief of early period be here imparted a be usual to communicate in more didactic form at same time reader must remember that book be not historical take in period of few month extended in concluding chapter consists rather of series of picture than of narrative of event occurrence therefore of different epoch different country have be condensed into small space chronology have be sacrificed to purpose date of dioclesians edict have be anticipated by two month martyrdom of st agnes by year period of st sebastian though uncertain have be brought down later relates to christian topography have be kept a accurate a possible martyrdom have be transferred from imola to fondi illustration bark of peter a found in catacomb be necessary to introduce view of moral opinion of pagan world a contrast to of christian worst aspect have be carefully suppressed a nothing must be admitted here most sensitive catholic eye must shrink from contemplating be indeed earnestly desired that little work written solely for recreation be read also a relaxation from graver pursuit at same time reader may rise from perusal with feeling that time have not be lost mind occupied with frivolous idea rather let be hoped that admiration love may be inspired by of primitive time over excited interest in later more brilliant epoch of church be too apt to diminish obscure content page preface to illustrated edition

owed crown to popular fury to hatred of christianity in local ruler hence also read of bitter persecution being carried on in one part of empire while other portion enjoyed complete peace perhaps few example of various phase of persecution will illustrate real relation of primitive church with state better than mere description more learned reader can pas over digression must have patience to hear

scillita in africa s perpetua felicitas with companion act of whose martyrdom containing diary of first noble lady twenty year of age brought down by to eve of death form one of most touching exquisitely beautiful document preserved to from ancient church from historical fact will be evident that while there be from time to time more active severe general persecution of christian name through empire there be partial local cessation sometimes even general suspension of rigor occurrence of sort have secured for most interesting information connected with subject when persecution of severus have relaxed in other part happened that scapula pro consul of africa prolonged in province with unrelenting cruelty have condemned among others mavilus of adrumetum to be devoured by beast

must encourage tumult asper seeing one ready to yield upon application of slight torment must not press further expressed regret that case must have be brought before pudens on reading act of accusation declared title informal because calumnious tore up thus see how much might depend upon temper perhaps tendency of governor judge in enforcing even of imperial edict of persecution st ambrose tell that governor boasted that have brought back from province sword unstained with blood incruentos en can also easily understand how at particular time savage persecution might rage in gaul africa asia while main part of church be enjoying peace rome be undoubtedly place most subject to frequent outbreak of hostile spirit so that might be considered a privilege of pontiff during first

before seen at house that gave entertainment that have freed country slave many of have preferred remaining with that if numerous whole establishment seemed very happy though boisterous sport frolicsome meeting seemed to be indulged in stimulated fabiolas curiosity in addition to wish to discharge pleasing duty of courtesy to most kind friend of hers from childhood longed to see with own eye what appeared to to be very platonic a must say utopian experiment in light country carriage with good horse fabiola started early dashed gaily along level road across happy campania autumnal

perhaps so difficult matter for prefect son in one day two hundred pagan statue be broken in piece including of course in villa a well a in house at rome image indeed be broken chromatius be not cured sebastian be sent for sharply rebuked be calm inflexible be sure said that have not be destroyed something have be withheld from demolition proved right small object have be treated a work of art

for moment that have adopted compound of stupidity knavery called by name let ask one question have taken trouble of reading christian writing by might know what be really held done by despised body oh not indeed must not waste time over must not have patience to learn thing about scorn too much a enemy of intellectual progress a doubtful citizen a credulous to last degree a sanctioning abominable crime ever to give chance of nearer acquaintance with well dear fabiola thought just same about once have much altered opinion of late be indeed strange since a prefect of city must have have to punish many of wretched people for constant transgression of law cloud came over cheerful countenance of old man tear stood in eye thought of st paul who have once persecuted church of god fabiola saw change be distressed in most affectionate manner said to have said something very thoughtless fear stirred up recollection of what must be painful to kind heart forgive dear chromatius let talk of something else one purpose of visit to be to ask if knew of one going immediately to rome have heard from several quarter of father projected journey be anxious to write to lest repeat what

entered apartment on ground floor full of book chest at table in middle of room young man be seated transcribing large volume on seeing stranger enter closed put aside torquatus said chromatius addressing lady desire to send letter to father in rome will always give great pleasure replied young man to serve noble fabiola illustrious father what do know asked judge rather surprised have honor when very young a father have have before to be employed by noble fabius in asia ill health compelled to leave service several sheet of fine vellum cut to size evidently for transcription of book lay on table one of good old man placed before lady with ink reed wrote few affectionate line to father doubled paper tied thread round attached wax to impressed seal drew from embroidered bag upon wax anxious time to reward messenger when must better know how took piece of vellum made on memorandum of name residence carefully put into bosom after partaking of slight refreshment mounted car bid chromatius affectionate farewell there be something touchingly paternal in look a though felt must never see again so thought be very different feeling softened heart must always remain thus must leave to perish in obstinate ignorance be that generous heart that noble intellect to grovel on in slime of bitter paganism when feeling thought in seemed formed of strong yet finest fibre across truth might weave richest web must not be yet thousand motif restrained from avowal felt must at present only repulse fatally from nearer approach to faith farewell child exclaimed may be blessed hundredfold in way a yet know not turned away face a dropped hand hastily withdrew fabiola too be moved by mystery a well a tenderness of word be startled before reaching gate to find chariot stopped by torquatus be at moment painfully struck by contrast between easy rather familiar though respectful manner of youth mild gravity mixed with cheerfulness of old ex prefect pardon interruption madam said be anxious to have letter quickly delivered certainly be most anxious that must reach father a speedily a possible then fear will hardly be able to serve can only afford to travel on foot by chance cheap conveyance will be day upon road fabiola hesitating said must be taking too great liberty if must offer to defray expense of more rapid journey by mean answered torquatus rather eagerly if can thereby better serve noble house fabiola handed purse abundantly supplied not only for journey for ample recompense received with smiling readiness disappeared by side alley there be something in manner made disagreeable impression must not think be fit company for dear old friend if chromatius have witnessed transaction must have seen likeness to juda in eager clutching of purse fabiola however be not sorry to have discharged by sum of money once for obligation might have contracted by making messenger therefore drew out memorandum to destroy a useless when perceived that other side

said how many turn have passed by before leaving main gallery great many answered severus drily how many do think ten twenty full that fancy for never have counted torquatus have however wished to

torquatus with pettishness sarcasm what have to do with christianity be allegory torquatus replied pancratius gently favorite one use of gentile image when in harmless have be permitted see mask for instance other pagan ornament in ceiling belong generally to very ancient period so lord be represented under symbol of orpheus to conceal sacred representation from gentile blasphemy sacrilege look now in arch have more recent representation of same subject illustration lord under symbol of orpheus from picture in cemetery of domitilius see said shepherd with sheep over shoulder good shepherd

novatian heresy so much plagued church answered severus pray what heresy be that asked torquatus carelessly for thought be losing time be indeed be heresy answered pancratius that teach that there be sin church have not power to forgive be too great for god to pardon pancratius be not aware of effect of word severus who never took off eye from torquatus saw blood come go violently in countenance be that heresy asked traitor confused surely dreadful one replied pancratius to limit mercy forgiveness of who came to call not just sinner to repentance catholic church have always held that sinner however dark dye however huge mass of crime on truly repenting may receive forgiveness through penitential remedy left in hand therefore have always so much loved type of good shepherd ready to run into wilderness to bring back lost sheep suppose said torquatus evidently moved that one who have become christian received sacred gift be to fall away plunge into vice voice faltered almost betray

inconsistently enough of being unbeliever serving god tale be most firmly believed though probably reciter knew perfectly well be good sound heathen lie very useful in keeping up horror of christianity at length up rose man who be considered to have most deeply studied doctrine of enemy best to know dangerous tactic be supposed to have read own book to be drawing up confutation of error must fairly crush indeed so great be weight with own side that when asserted that christian held monstrous principle have supreme pontiff in person contradicted one must have laughed at very idea of taking word for own belief against assertion of calpurnius struck up different strain learning quite astonished fellow sophist have read original book said not only of christian of forefather jew who having come into egypt in reign of ptolemy philadelphus to escape from famine in own country through art of leader josephus bought up corn there sent home upon ptolemy imprisoned telling that a have eaten up corn must live on straw by making brick with for building great city then demetrius phalerius hearing from of great many curious history of ancestor shut up moses aaron most learned men in

hewed in piece now continued christian be still under domination of same priesthood be quite a ready to day under direction to overthrow great roman empire burn in forum even sacrilegiously assail sacred venerable head of divine emperor thrill of horror ran through assembly at recital be soon hushed a emperor opened mouth to speak for part said have stronger reason for abhorrence of christian have dared to establish in heart of empire in very city supreme religious authority unknown here before independent of government of state equally powerful over mind a formerly acknowledged emperor a supreme in religious a in civil rule hence bear still title of pontifex maximus men have raised up divided power consequently bear divided loyalty hate therefore a usurpation in dominion sacerdotal

received with immense applause plan be formed for simultaneous publication of edict through west for complete exterminating execution then turning sharp upon tertullus emperor said prefect said have one to propose for superintending arrangement for merciless dealing with traitor be here sire son corvinus tertullus handed youthful candidate to grim tyrant footstool where knelt maximian eyed keenly burst into hideous laugh said upon word think hell do why prefect have idea have such ugly son must think be just thing quality of thoroughpaced unconscientious scape grace be stamped upon feature then turning to corvinus who be scarlet with rage terror shame said to mind sirrah must have clean work of hacking hewing blundering pay up well if be well served pay off well too if badly served so now go remember that if back can answer for small fault head will for greater lictors fasces contain axe a well a rod emperor rose to depart when eye caught fulvius who have be summoned a paid court spy who kept a much in back ground a possible ho there eastern worthy called out to draw nearer fulvius obeyed with apparent cheerfulness with real reluctance much same a if have be invited to go very near tiger strength of whose chain be not quite sure about have seen from beginning that coming to rome have not be acceptable to maximian though knew not fully cause be not merely that tyrant have plenty of favorite of own to enrich spy to pay without dioclesians sending more from asia though have weight be more believed in heart that fulvius have be sent principally to act spy upon to report to nicomedia saying doings of court while therefore be obliged to tolerate employ mistrusted disliked in be equivalent to hating be compensation therefore to corvinus when heard more polished

therefore may have to look at something very sharp before property of convicted will be divided between accuser treasury unless see particular reason for taking whole to myself now may go illustration monogram of christ found in catacomb most thought that particular reason must turn out to be very general chapter vii dark death few day after fabiolas return from country sebastian considered duty to wait upon to communicate so much of dialogue between corvinus black slave a must without causing unnecessary suffering have already observed that of many noble youth whom fabiola have met in father house none have excited admiration respect except sebastian so frank so generous so brave yet so unboasting so mild so kind in act speech so unselfish so careful of others blending so completely in one character nobleness simplicity high wisdom practical sense seemed to most finished type of manly virtue one must not easily suffer by time weary by familiarity when therefore be announced to that officer sebastian wished to speak to alone in one of hall below heart beat at unusual tidings conjured up thousand strange fancy about possible topic of interview agitation be not diminished when after apologizing for seeming intrusion remarked with smile well knowing how sufficiently be already annoyed by many candidate for hand felt regret at idea that be going to add yet undeclared to list if ambiguous preface surprised perhaps elated be soon depressed again upon being told be vulgar stupid corvinus for father even little a knew how to discriminate character out of business have seen enough of at late banquet to characterize to daughter by epithet sebastian fearing rather physical than moral activity of afras drug thought right to inform her of compact between two dabbler in black art principal efficacy of however seemed to consist in drawing money from purse of reluctant dupe of course said nothing of what related to christian in dialogue put on guard promised to prevent nightly excursion of necromancer slave what afra have engaged to do did not for moment believe be ever intention to attempt neither did fear art utterly despised indeed afras last soliloquy seemed satisfactorily to prove that be only deceiving victim certainly felt indignant at having be bargained about by two such vile character having be represented a grasping avaricious woman whose price be gold feel said at last to sebastian how very kind be of to come thus to put on guard admire delicacy with have unfolded so disagreeable matter tenderness with have treated one concerned have only done in instance replied soldier what must have done for human being save if possible from pain danger friend hope mean said fabiola smiling otherwise fear whole life must go in work of unrequited benevolence so let go must not be better spent surely be not in earnest sebastian if saw one who have ever hated sought destruction threatened with calamity must make harmless must stretch out hand to save succor certainly must while god sends sunshine rain equally upon enemy a upon friend will weak man frame rule of justice at word fabiola wondered be so like of mysterious parchment identical with moral theory of slave have be in east believe sebastian asked rather abruptly be there that learnt principle for have one near who be yet by own choice servant woman of rare moral perception who have propounded to same idea be asiatic be not in distant country learnt for here sucked in with mother milk though originally doubtless came from east be certainly beautiful in abstract remarked fabiola death must overtake before must half carry out be to make principle of conduct how better must death find though not surprise than in thus doing duty even if not to completion for part resumed lady be of old epicurean poet mind world be banquet from will be ready to depart when have have fill ut conviva satur not till then wish to read life book through close calmly only when have finished last page sebastian shook head smiling said last page of world book come in middle of volume wherever death may happen to be written on next page begin illuminated book of new life without last page understand replied fabiola good humoredly be brave soldier speak a such must be always prepared for death from thousand casualty seldom see approach suddenly come more mercifully stealthily upon weak doubt be musing on more glorious fate on receiving in front full sheaf of arrow from enemy falling covered with honor look to soldier funeral pile with trophy erected over to after death open bright page book of glory gentle lady exclaimed sebastian emphatically mean not so care not for glory can only be enjoyed by anticipating fancy speak of vulgar death a may come to in common with poorest slave consuming by slow burning fever wasting by long lingering consumption racking by slowly eating ulcer nay if please by still crueller infliction of men wrath in form let come come from hand love do really mean that death so contemplated must be welcomed by a joyful a be epicure when door of banqueting hall be thrown wide open see beyond brilliant lamp glittering table delicious viand with attendant minister well girt crowned with rose a blithe a be bride when bridegroom be announced coming with rich gift to conduct to new home will exulting heart be when death under form throw back gate iron on side golden on other lead to new perennial life care not how grim messenger may be that proclaims approach of who be celestially beautiful who be asked fabiola eagerly can not be seen save through fleshless rib of death replied sebastian for be who must reward not only for life for death also happy whose inmost heart have ever read have be kept pure innocent a well a deed have be virtuous for be bright vision of whose true reward only then begin how very like syras doctrine thought before must speak again to ask whence came slave entered stood on threshold respectfully said courier madam be just arrived from bai pardon sebastian exclaimed let enter immediately messenger came in covered with dust jaded having left tired horse at gate offered sealed packet hand trembled a took while be unloosening band hesitatingly asked from father about at least be ominous reply opened sheet glanced over shrieked fell sebastian caught before reached ground laid on couch delicately left in hand of handmaid who have rushed in at cry illustration monogram of christ found in catacomb one glance have told father be dead chapter viii darker still when sebastian came into court found little crowd of domestic gathered round courier listening to detail of master death letter of torquatus be bearer to have produced desired effect called at villa spent few day with daughter on way to asia be more than usually affectionate when parted father daughter seemed to have melancholy foreboding that must meet no more soon however recovered spirit at bai where party of good liver anxiously awaited where considered obliged to stay while galley be being fitted up stored with best wine provision campania afforded for voyage indulged however luxurious taste to excess on coming out of bath after hearty supper be seized with chill in four twenty hour be corpse have left undivided wealth to only child in fine body be being embalmed when courier started be to be brought by galley to ostia on hearing sad tale sebastian be almost sorry that have spoken a have done of death left house with mournful thought fabiolas first plunge into dark abyss of grief be deep dismal down into unconsciousness then buoyancy of youth mind bore up again to surface view of life to horizon be a of boundless ocean of black seething wave on floated living thing save woe seemed utter unmeasured closed eye with shudder suffered to sink again into obliviousness till once more roused to wakefulness of mind again again be thus tossed up down between transient death life while attendant applied remedy to what deemed succession of alarming fit convulsion at length sat up pale staring tearless gently pushing aside hand tried to administer restorative to in state remained long stupor fixed deadly seemed to have entranced pupil be almost insensible to light fear be whispered of brain becoming oppressed physician who have be called uttered distinctly forcibly into ear question fabiola do know that father be dead started fell back bursting flood of tear relieved heart head spoke of father called for amidst sob said wild incoherent affectionate thing about to sometimes seemed to think still alive then remembered be dead so wept moaned till sleep took turn of tear in nursing shattered mind frame euphrosyne syra alone watched by former have from time to time put in commonplace of heathen consolation have reminded too how kind master how honest man how loving father have be christian sat in silence except to speak gentle soothing word to mistress served with active delicacy even then be not unnoticed what must do more unless be to pray what hope for else than that new grace be folded up like flower in tribulation that bright angel be riding in dark cloud overshadowed humbled lady a grief receded left room for thought came to fabiola in gloomy searching form what be become of father whither be gone have melted into unexistence have be crushed into annihilation have life be searched through by unseen eye see invisible have stood proof of scrutiny sebastian syra have described impossible then what have become of shuddered a thought put away reflection from mind oh for ray from unknown light must dart into grave show what be poetry have pretended to enlighten even glorify have only in truth remained at door a genius with drooping head torch reversed science have stepped in come out scared with tarnished wing lamp extinguished in fetid air for have only discovered charnel house philosophy have barely ventured to wander round round peep in with dread recoil then prate babble shrugging shoulder own that problem be yet unsolved mystery still veiled oh for something one better than to remove dismal perplexity while thought dwell like gloomy night on heart of fabiola slave be enjoying vision of light clothed in mortal form translucid radiant rising from grave a from alembic in have remained grosser quality of matter without impairing essence of nature

fragrant incorruption from day grave have ceased to be object of dread to christian soul for continued what have made furrow into seed of immortality must need be cast time be not come for speaking of

cemetery determined to assail early very day after publication of decree fulvius took course determined to become acquainted by sight with principal clergy leading christian of rome once possessed of knowledge be sure disguise must conceal from piercing eye must easily pick up one by one therefore insisted upon torquatuss taking a companion to first great function must collect many priest deacon round pope overruled illustration christ apostle from picture in catacomb remonstrance dispelled fear assured torquatus once in by password must behave perfectly like christian torquatus soon informed that there must be excellent opportunity at coming ordination in very month of december chapter x ordination in december whoever have read history of early pope will have become familiar with fact recorded almost invariably of that held certain ordination in month of december wherein created so many priest deacon so many bishop for different place first two order be conferred to supply clergy for city third be evidently to furnish pastor for other diocese in later time ember day in december regulated by festival of st lucy be on supreme pontiff held consistory in named cardinal priest deacon preconized a be called bishop of part of world though function be not now coincident with period of ordination still be continued essentially for same purpose marcellinus under whose pontificate narrative be placed be stated to have held two ordination in month be of course in different year be to one of that have alluded a about to take place where be solemn function to be performed be fulviuss first inquiry can not think that answer will be interesting to christian antiquary can acquaintance with ancient roman church be complete without knowing favored spot where pontiff after pontiff preached celebrated divine mystery held council glorious ordination sent forth not only bishop martyr to govern other church gave to st laurence diaconate to st novatus st timotheus priesthood there too polycarp irenus visited successor of st peter thence received commission apostle who converted king lucius to faith house roman pontiff inhabited church in officiated till constantine installed in lateran palace basilica residence cathedral of illustrious line of martyr pope for year can be ignoble spot that in tracing out may not be misguided by national personal prepossession will follow learned living antiquarian who intent upon research accidentally have put together data requisite for purpose have described house of agness parent a situated in vicus patricius patrician street have name for be also called street of cornelii vicus corneliorum because in lived illustrious family of name centurion whom st peter converted belonged to family possibly to apostle owed introduction at rome to head of house cornelius pudens senator married claudia noble british lady be singular how unchaste poet martial vies with purest writer when sings wedding song of two virtuous spouse be in house that st peter lived fellow apostle st paul enumerates among familiar friend a well eubulus pudens linus claudia illustration st pudentiana st priscilla st praxedes brother salute thee from house then went forth bishop whom prince of apostle sent in direction to propagate die for faith of christ after death of pudens house became property of child grandchild two son two daughter latter be better known because have found place in general calendar of church because have given name to two of most illustrious church of rome of st praxedes st pudentiana be latter alban butler call most ancient church in world mark at once vicus patricius house of pudens a in other city so in rome eucharistic sacrifice be offered originally in only one place by bishop even after more church be erected faithful met in communion be brought to from one altar by deacon distributed by priest be pope evaristus fourth successor of st peter who multiplied church of rome with circumstance peculiarly interesting pope then did two thing first enacted that from thenceforward altar must be erected except of stone that must be consecrated secondly distributed title be divided rome into parish to church of gave name of title connection of two act will be apparent to one looking at genesis xxviii where after jacob have enjoyed angelic vision while sleeping with stone for pillow be told that trembling said how terrible be place be other than house of god gate of heaven jacob arising in morning took stone set up for title pouring oil on top of church oratory where sacred mystery be celebrated be truly to christian house of god stone altar set up in be consecrated by pouring of oil upon a be done to day for whole law of evaristus remains in full force thus became title monument two interesting fact be elicited from narrative one be that to time there be only one church with altar in rome doubt have ever be raised that be church afterwards yet known by name of st pudentiana be that one altar till then existing be not of stone be in fact wooden altar used by st peter kept in church till transferred by st sylvester to lateran basilica of form high altar further conclude that law be not retrospective that wooden altar of pope be preserved at church where have be first erected though from time to time might be carried used elsewhere church in vicus patricius therefore existed previous to creation of title be not title continued to be episcopal rather pontifical church of rome pontificate of st pius from to form interesting period in history for two reason first that pope without altering character of church added to oratory made title having collated to brother pastor be called titulus pastoris designation for long time of cardinalate attached to church show that church be more than title secondly in pontificate came to rome for second time suffered martyrdom holy learned apologist st justin by comparing writing with act come to interesting conclusion respecting christian worship in time of persecution in what place do christian meet be asked by judge do think reply that meet in one place be not so when interrogated where lived where held meeting with disciple answered have lived till now near house of certain martin at bath known a timotine have come to rome for second time do know other place one have mentioned timotine timothean bath be part of house of pudens family be at have said that fulvius corvinus met early one morning novatus timotheus be brother of holy virgin praxedes pudentiana hence bath be called novatian timotine a passed from one brother to st justin therefore lived on spot a knew other in rome attended divine worship there very claim of hospitality must suggest now in apology describing christian liturgy of course such a saw speaks of officiating priest in term sufficiently describe bishop supreme pastor of place not only by giving title applied to bishop in antiquity by describing a person who have care of orphan widow succor sick indigent prisoner stranger who come a guest who in one word undertakes to provide for in want must be no other than bishop pope must further observe st pius be recorded to have erected fixed baptismal font in church prerogative of cathedral transferred with papal altar to lateran be related that holy pope stephen ad baptized tribune nemesius family with many others in title of pastor here be that blessed deacon laurentius distributed rich vessel of church to poor in time name have given way to place be same doubt can exist that church of st pudentiana be for first three century humble cathedral of rome be to spot therefore that torquatus unwillingly consented to lead fulvius that might witness december

occupied with same theme in great antonian therm group of regular frequenter be talking over there be scaurus lawyer proculus fulvius philosopher calpurnius who seemed very busy with musty volume several others what strange affair be about edict said one say rather what treasonable outrage against divine emperor answered fulvius how be done asked third have not heard said proculus that dacian guard stationed at puteal be found dead with twenty seven poniard wound on nineteen of must have sufficed by to cause death be quite false report interrupted scaurus be not done by violence entirely

exclaimed what extraordinary people christian must be dont believe word of observed there be such power in magic certainly dont see why wretched men must posse more than better come calpurnius continued put by old book answer question learnt more one day after dinner about christian from than have heard in life before what wonderful memory must have to remember so accurately genealogy history of barbarous people be what scaurus have just told possible not calpurnius delivered with great pompousness a follows there be reason to suppose thing impossible for power of magic have bound

too severe against fulvius have be keenly eyeing sebastian who have entered during conversation now pointedly addressed doubt think so too sebastian do not think calmly replied that if christian be such a calpurnius describes infamous sorcerer deserve to be exterminated from face of earth even so must gladly give one chance of escape what be sneeringly asked fulvius that one must be allowed to join in destroying who must not prove freer from crime than must have one raise hand against who can not show that have never be adulterer extortioner deceiver drunkard bad husband father child profligate thief for with being of one charge poor christian fulvius winced under catalogue of vice still more under indignant serene glance of sebastian at word thief fairly leapt have soldier seen pick up scarf in fabiuss house be so not dislike have taken to sebastian at first meeting have ripened into hatred at second hatred in heart be only written in blood have only intensity now to add to

must not hear word about only object of hatred to generous mind be christian name true dearest agnes yet think that have known that sebastian be christian must not have hated must have loved thing in think so now fabiola know not force of universal prejudice weight of falsehood daily repeated how many noble mind fine intellect loving heart have enslaved induced to believe to be that be not something even worse than worst of others well agnes be selfish in to argue thus with in present position will of course compel fulvius to prove that be christian oh dear fabiola have already confessed intend to do so again publicly in morning in morning what to morrow asked fabiola shocked at idea of thing so immediate yes to morrow to prevent clamor disturbance about though suspect few people will care much be to be interrogated early summary proceeding will be taken be not that good news dear asked agnes eagerly seizing cousin hand then putting on one of ecstatic look exclaimed

for fabiolas hand there have not be one who must not justly be rather called aspirant after fortune included dear corvinus yes so far not if succeed in offering with lady agness great wealth in manner too methinks will more easily gain upon what hear of generous lofty disposition giving that wealth independent of condition then offering to will put under one of two obligation to accept a husband throw back fortune admirable father never saw second alternative before do think there be possibility of securing except through none fulvius of course will apply for share probability be that emperor will declare intends to take for for hate fulvius if propose more popular palpably reasonable plan of giving property to nearest relation who worship god fabiola doe dont certainly father think will embrace while be sure there be chance of making free gift to proposal from judge must enrage then how will manage father will have imperial rescript prepared during night ready for signature will proceed immediately after execution to palace magnify unpopularity be sure to follow lay on fulvius show emperor how granting property to next in settlement of will redound greatly to credit glory be a vain a be cruel rapacious one vice must be made to fight nothing must be better dear father will retire to rest with easy mind to morrow will be critical day of life future depends upon whether be

day always for be on day that to gain anothers wealth committed peace peace interrupted fulvius in agony why will always remind of thing most wish to forget because of wish to forget must not be must take from pretence to be guided by conscience virtue even honor be folly to affect compassion for one life who stand in way of fortune after what did to fulvius bit lip in silent rage covered crimson
