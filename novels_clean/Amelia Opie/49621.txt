prosperity have borne faculty so meekly have be so careful never to humble one by showing consciousness of superiority that have be beloved even more than have be admired hard indeed must heart of man have be who must have rejoiced that be humbled dead nay solemn silence took place on entrance one present beheld with surprise with stolen look of pity ravage remorse anguish have made in form striking change in apparel for one have often followed with delight graceful figure through dance gazed with admiration on tasteful variety of dress one have listened with pleasure to winning sound of

medical attendant belonging to institution ordered that agnes must be permitted two hour at time morning evening to see fitzhenry who have not dared to flatter that must obtain so much be too full of emotion to show otherwise than by incoherent expression broken sentence sense of obligation next care observed president must be a friend of poor father to see what can do for future support sir will provide for replied agnes will not eat bread of idleness a well a of shame affliction will even rejoice in being obliged to labour for support that of child happy if in fulfilling well duty of mother

go look for grave then walked hastily round garden while agnes whom word of song by recalling painful recollection have almost deprived of reason sat down on bench nearly insensible till again came to taking hand said in hurried manner will not leave will on answering in very earnest passionate manner looked delighted saying poor thing again gazed on intently again agnes hope that must in time know returned very pale very pale cried fitzhenry next moment stroking cheek have such bloom sing again for love of god sing again in hoarse broken voice agnes complied sung better than rejoined when have done so sweet so clear be be gone so saying relapsed into total indifference to agnes thing around again new raised hope vanished keeper now told be time for to depart mournfully arose first seizing

clanking of iron burst upon ear be abode of father provided for by be recompense bestowed on by daughter whom loved trusted in return for year of unparalleled fondness indulgence idea be too horrible

considerable shawl manufacture being carried on in town be settled that must procure same employment for agnes that small back room in fanny little dwelling must be fitted up for use in mean while governor of bedlam have returned to respective habitation with feeling towards agnes very different to with have assembled too prudent to make even penitent sinner subject of praise in own family gave
