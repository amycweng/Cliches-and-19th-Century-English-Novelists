walking in circle heard named by gentleman next a lady bell singleton dashing widow more famed for beauty fascination than moral pendarves said nothing though looked very earnestly at examined from head to foot a passed saw that never turned eye on seemed resolved not to see have therefore reason to be pleased with husband conduct felt great distrust of lord charles thought be man from what have overheard whom must never like a companion for pendarves disliked more because if have given slightest encouragement must have be devoted public admirer must have delighted to make attachment to intimacy theme of conversation also saw that cold reserve have changed partiality into dislike must readily believe that must be glad in revenge to wean husband from still must not wish that have

have have that threw arm round bursting into agony of tear exclaimed what must have ever made amends for losing very idea of kill mother be excessively affected when said soon saw that tear be not tear of tenderness alone looking at with expression of sadness on countenance said two year ago poor child must have better borne idea of such separation have be jealous person must have be hurt to see how completely husband can supersede even mother be pleased to see because saw in proof that be happy wife perhaps have now idea though still happy wife trust of great value of parent can appreciate more justly that love nothing can ever alienate ever render le what must answer how did not attempt to speak continued to hold in arm at last must utter never never can bear to part with day lord charles belmour came according to promise just a have convinced that be duty to overcome dislike to to endeavour to convert from enemy into friend accordingly went down to dinner prepared to receive with even smile recollecting when saw impudent assertion that admiration of meant nothing be alarmed prude usual coldness came over while deepest blush dyed cheek however extended hand to kissed pressed a relinquished turned up eye muttered angelic woman in manner so equivocal consistent a seemed with joke against must not help giving way to evident laughter lord charles be too quick of apprehension to be affronted at mirth on contrary felt assured flattered by have expressed admiration only in derision impertinence a saw that understood felt be much nearer being friend than have ever be before when eye met look almost amounting to one of kindness passed between lord charles now became particularly animated allusion made to lady bell singleton while addressing husband made distrustful again relapsed into usual manner be lord lordship during rest of dinner must be insensible to look of menace subsequently beheld in countenance be not long before storm burst on devoted

delighted consciousness look expressed stolen glance hush hush cried pendarves anger struggling with confusion be fancy painting like nothing portrait during time observed struggle in mother breast sat in terror lest must say something severe to noble mimick make matter worse after evident struggle alone observed leaned arm on table fixed powerful eye steadfastly on lord charles looking at a if must have dived into inmost recess of heart be in vain that endeavoured to escape searching glance even assurance felt abashed malignant spirit awed till audacious ill intentioned banter be looked into silence asked for bumper of claret to drink health be before overpowered with gratitude to judicious yet quiet interference of admirable parent recollection of morning conversation be still present to wonder therefore that spirit be easily affected that felt eye fill with tear at moment luckily heard child cry faltering out hark be child voice hastened to door unfortunately pocket hole of muslin gown caught in arm of mother chair lord charles insisted on extricating must now no longer prevent tear from flowing down cheek being perceived by said in sort of undertone amiable sensibility there see mother feeling on mother provoked beyond endurance said in low voice overheard lord daughter have wife feeling also be now disengaged happily ran out of room when arrived in nursery found be not wanted therefore retired to own apartment where gave way to violent burst of tear have scarcely recovered have bathed eye again again in rose water when husband entered room have witnessed emotion must not be easy without coming to inquire after on pretence that child cry have alarmed affectionate attention be not lost upon went down stair with with restored spirit in perfect composure mother who have walked to own house be only just entering door a appeared therefore lord charles have be left alone whether thought affront to dignity not can not tell did not find in more amiable mood than when left after looking at very earnestly while sipping coffee came close up to said resuming most affected tone pray what eye water do use rose water only be reply very bad 'pon

eye have thus opened to utmost extent be of description known by name of boiled gooseberry be really dead eye except when ray of satirical intelligence forced through for sake of exciting laugh have now dismissed from trace of meaning consequently tint of colour purpose effected resumed sarcastic expression turning from with look full of sarcastic meaning said ah comme de coutume after tragedy come farce mother now asked whether have ever seen house garden on answering in negative challenged to take walk with never replied bowing very low refused challenge of fine woman in life till horse come round be at service madam then hiding real chagrin under thousand impertinent grimace followed mother must give something to hear conversation said pendarves thoughtfully so must doubt will be monitory on part monitory what for if know be sure will not tell with expression of conscious embarrassment on countenance husband asked to walk with round shrubbery mother lord charles did not return till carriage be driving up examined countenance with very scrutinizing eye on mother must distinguish be usual expression of placid dignified intelligence that of lord charles exhibited usual cattish alarming look what have passed therefore must not guess saw very clearly that must not be justified in joking on subject of tete tete simply saying that be beyond time fixed for departure lord charles now respectfully kissed hand told pendarves hoped must soon see in london then left room without taking smallest notice of mother be driving off before husband must ask reason of conduct so strange pray madam said pendarves when returned into room did lord charles take leave of did not then solemnly declare that before ever meet again will give sufficient reason for impertinence apologize to for there life not being who will dare while live to affront with impunity dear dear son cried mother look not so like so very like here voice failed leant on seymour shoulder while affectionately embraced dear to heart be token of love passed between mother husband seymour strong likeness to father in moment of great excitement always affected thus endeared to when mother recovered desired pendarves must remain quiet not trouble to revenge quarrel indeed said be much flattered not affronted by rudeness of lord charles a prof that what said to gave pain intended wound therefore will rankle for time produce good effect must be surprised if be to send letter of apology in day two for if read aright have understanding enough to value good opinion of respectable woman must rather be on amicable term with than not hope be right replied pendarves for wish to quarrel with yet will never own a friend man who fails in respect to thank dear son said mother with great feeling evening passed in most delightful intimate communion really believe be charlotte jermyn lord charles again remembered so true be that when tide of family affection run smooth unbroken bear bark of happiness securely on bosom shortly after lord charles visit be so unwell that be forbidden to nurse child longer have to endure painful trial of weaning surrendering to bosom of most evil in life even to mortal vision be attended with counter balancing good at time be height of gay season in london saw that husband began to grow tired of home sigh for busy scene of metropolis whither have be still nurse must not have accompanied now however unwilling might be to leave infant felt that must not interfere with duty owed father for mother have often said own observation confirmed truth of saying that alienation between husband wife have often originated in woman losing sight of duty attention owes father of child in exclusive fondness attention to child often warned against falling into error therefore highly approved intention to leave babe under care accompany pendarves to london where well knew be exposed to temptation to danger against presence might probably secure yes child said a if thinking aloud for be sure did not intend to grieve yes go with husband while can have a few separate pleasure divided hour a possible for lead to divided heart if have large family will not be able to leave home go therefore while can while be with turn to account while be still here to serve that time know will be short enough be not in power of language to convey adequate idea of agony with listened to word never before have mother so pointedly alluded to conviction that health be decaying if idea of separation from by happy marriage be so painful to feeling what must be idea of terrible eternal separation pendarves came in in midst of distress almost fiercely demanded who have be so cruelly afflicting fearing doubt have heard something concerning naturally enough conceiving that great grief must reach except through from mother gently replied have be afflicting foolish child said unwillingly allow what might have prepared for unavoidable evil chooses to fancy poor thing be not mortal yet see here seymour a said turned up long loose sleeve showed once fine arm fallen away comparatively to nothing never saw husband much more affected seized that faded arm pressing repeatedly to lip turned away burst into tear then folding in one embrace faltered out poor helen well indeed might find thus mother solemnly promised that must never so afflict again in midst of scene letter be brought to mother be from lord charles be so like man that will transcribe doubt not be amazed probably offended at quitting house of son in law without taking leave of a be not woman

token of forgiveness be madam with liveliest esteem deepest respect obliged though stricken servant charles firebrand ridiculous person said mother when have finished letter giving to at same time when have read asked to tell have said to why said pendarves doe sign charles firebrand oh thereby hang tale said mother blushing assure will not tell therefore ask question if ever lord charles meet again white hand will be tendered to nay perhaps will answer letter so did never saw what wrote however be convinced that have called firebrand reproved for evident desire of making mischief between husband can doubt that justice of reproof made more stinging to heart of offender that felt at time degree of unspeakable unutterable resentment on cooler judgment made feel impolitic to act for have a mother said too much good sense not to value acquaintance must now return to charlotte jermyn forgot to say that wrote very fawning letter of thanks to after return home thanking for kindness to hoping must send for again whenever must be of service to have reason to think that also wrote more than once to husband never communicated what wrote to have mortification to find how vainly have

renewing caress praise banished from remembrance for while affectionate heart at dinner however restored to fear of dislike to visit for called husband mr seymour pendarves at word though mother called julia helen wishing a saw to point out to one that be not in good grace why ala doubted not must hear too soon feeling coward carefully avoided being alone with that evening what have to tell knew not whether regarded charlotte jermyn lady bell summoned up resolution to ask pendarves whether have ever visited lady bell singleton in company with lord charles without hesitation though with great confusion owned that have what more than once yes why did not tell of because thought after what have heard might make uneasy must ever do replied forcing smile what in relative situation must make uneasy to be informed of not if uneasiness must be at well founded concealment implies consciousness of something indiscreet if not wrong have told of visit to lady bell must have set mr pendarves insinuation at defiance can not now perhaps so thanks to ingenuousness however must own said smiling affectionately that one answer question more readily have judged rightly in preparing for encounter with mr pendarves a took first opportunity of telling how much pitied for have heard of affair with young lady who came to nurse in lying in be of piece with renewal of intercourse with lady bell singleton assure added uncle mean to tell piece of mind if doe not will on hearing thought proper to laugh a well a must perfectly astonished aunt a knew must do demanded reason of ill timed mirth told that laughed at mountain having brought forth mouse for that affair with young lady ended in marrying young ensign soon after left for love that have given wedding present that knew from

london more without for lord charles took care to tell often have not be with pendarves must have gone thither always adding so see what tame domestic animal have made of what tractable obedient husband be there be perhaps nothing more insiduous pernicious than to tell proud man that be governed by wife mistress provided have great conscious weakness of character lord charles knew be case with pendarves be very sure that accepted many invitation must otherwise have declined because insiduous friend reproached with being afraid of ranelagh be still fashion husband have still pride in showing in circle even there be sensible of change now be not unwilling to resign care of to other men while went to pay compliment to dashing woman of fashion give arm once exclusively mine still

gracious now be requested to sing venetian air to spanish guitar to have written english word complied glad to do something to escape from own painful reflection also from earnest manner in de walden examined countenance watched what have just passed in order doubt to mortify vanity by calling off attention from to herself moment began lady martindale set little dog down who be lying in lap began to make dance to tune a did not get up dance a usual with poor beast did not know what to make of set up most violent barking have have resolution to go on singing playing during grimace of dog mistress even though own husband instead of resenting affront to have seemed to enjoy when dog spoke be silent on de walden seized little animal in arm in spite of lady martindale resistance put out of room then stooping down whispered something in ear silenced at once during scene trembled in limb for feared that seymour might be mad enough to resent de walden conduct be therefore relieved when lord martindale came up to a if meant to resent violence offered to lady dog on approaching de walden said with great good humour be right count de walden if have not done must only think that beast

be now requested to favour company with song with great good nature instantly complied while lord charles whispered across to mother what disgrace that fellow be to peerage by vice grant replied mother not by obliging compliance lord charles shrugged up shoulder be about to reply when silence be vociferated rather angrily by lady of house who have not be blind to air a said lord charles have given whole evening lord martindale a may be supposed be greatly applauded on same principle a mentioned by poet with regard to noble author for if lord once own happy line how wit brightens how taste refines noisy expression of admiration rewarded very mediocre performance did not increase good humour of noble guest against whom saw attack preparing at bottom of table at length very pretty girl who have sung with considerable skill tried to engage attention of lord charles finding sir be not sufficient added mr belmour sir one whispered be lord on said dear well then lord lord belmour lord charles turned towards pretty speaker while half muttered vulgar animal be audible to mother formed ludicrous contrast to affectedly respectful attention bent head with listened to what have to

carry glass to young lady indignantly rejected repeated request beg pardon replied impracticable lord charles thought said champagne then take claret to young lady who in vain exerted voice remained quite deaf holding ear like deaf person much to amusement of company confusion of fair supplicant who have be encouraged by admiring glance lord charles have till now bestowed on to think that request from must have be attended to thus far lord charles endangered dignity have come off with flying colour a be great affront to be requested to sing by pretty girl even though have told that have singing face looked like singer for turn have given to application got laugh on side be very sure that must not so presume again be not to be let off so easily for mr oswald who being almost a drunk a lord felt quite a great a one now came behind lord charles giving sounding blow across back exclaimed with oath come now belmour there be good fellow do sing for have heard be comical dog when like if look must have annihilated that instant must little fat man have disappeared from off face of earth glance of lord charles be powerless even to wound mr oswald be equally unmoved when scorning even to answer importunate host friend suddenly addressed mother saying think mr pendarves desired to call carriage be mistaken lord replied mother with reproving look well understood tormentor be going to assail again when seymour to relieve lord charles drew into conversation have just advised still irritated guest to remember that oswald be intoxicated when attention be attracted to conversation between mr oswald lady of lord charles be subject be evident that mr oswald spoke of in friendly tone yes lord said may look be certainly talking of lordship do much honour madam be a may be lord be

charles thrown off guard by sarcasm echoed last word gave tone manner so exactly that effect upon company be irresistible general laugh ensued to do justice shocked more than gratified self condemned mimic who must only for moment be provoked to violate rule of good breeding be completely subdued when mr oswald with degree of forbearance good humour exalted in esteem observed well lord have condescended to exert talent of mimicry though must not sing though be at expense be grateful to a have contributed to amuse company admirably replied exclaimed mother excellent excellent bravo cried pendarves while lord charles admonished penitent ashamed be not slow to redeem from sort of disgrace have incurred rising gracefully bowing head on clasped hand solicited pardon for liberty evident nature have emboldened to take declaring at same time that if forgave must be long before must forgive mr oswald who be really a kind hearted a seemed readily granted pardon asked respectfully pressed

unnecessary humiliation to pride expose have civilly though firmly refused young lady mr oswald request to sing not discovered in evening haughty contempt for company host insulted hostess needed not to have condescended to expiatory exhibition from under other circumstance pride must have properly revolted thus ended to disagreeable evening extended far into morning drive home be pleasant for lord charles having reconciled to by ample amende honorable by generous candour with received reproof thought be privileged to indulge le amiable feeling by turning of company into ridicule exhibiting to very life before must own again felt ungenerous pleasure in part of entertainment namely mimicry of lady martindale vainly endeavoured to subdue be glad that a pendarves rode on box did not witness degradation must add that mother be gratified to observe lord charles forbore to mimic kind vulgar host hostess mother took care to let know indirectly that delicacy be not lost upon performance be
