suffering from very excess mother be a well know woman of high aspirings loved to be pre eminent in thing be proud of conjugal love be proud of danger have dared under influence of suffering to rose superior to prove tender excess of love be proud also of good fortune in having husband life so long preserved to gloried in devoted faithful affection now of idolized husband be bereaved in moment

be after having shared husband danger struggle of war to see perish at home victim of ignoble accident have died in field of glory might have found cried solace in renown be prepared to see fall when others fell around to perish thus oh never be woman trial so severe thus while descanting on pre eminence of misfortune got rid of much of severity remember with what eloquence mother used to describe what have endured in america have also believe heard speak of manner of poor father death never heard have often listened to with pity must not utter lady helen assertion of own trying sorrow when mother have harrowed up feeling by painful comparison may remember that be happy many year here tear choked voice remember that while be allowed to prove love by soothing suffering of being whom adored have smile to reward be forced to prove mine only in privacy of solitary almost maddening recollection till recently have never known real affliction oh when have for year experienced enjoyment language used to silence if did not convince mother however might dispute on superiority of trial loved other better for be now scarcely ever separated hence seymour be in measure educated together

did not own assured that in spite of everything carried more hope away in heart than have ever yet known hope even precious conviction have never known before be sure cousin helen must wish to posse a must be to strongest shield against temptation dear said mother after long consideration how stupid have be not to understand sooner certainly mean that be become very religious that hope sweet conviction be faith world dear seymour be so glad for though choose must marry methodist one extreme be to a unpleasant a still believe methodist to be very happy people hope seymour for own sake will not change again smiled said nothing for put very different interpretation on word a appeared to hope conviction be that possessed love that compliance with mother will be wholly against own for

vacation be to remain with till returned to college mother now urged to admit address of de walden showing at same time letter from uncle in expressed earnest desire that nephew must be successful suitor offering to make splendid addition to fortune whenever must become husband in short must prospect of rank fortune must manly beauty superior sense unspotted virtue uncommon acquirement have made unfaithful to first attachment unfaithful must soon have become though attention of de walden must not annihilate certainly weakened wonder that must do so when be so little sure of stability of seymour affection be fearful must be weakened by change in external appearance a have often heard say did not admire tall woman own be weak enough to be uneasy at growth consequent upon fever be glad when met in coach not only that veil concealed altered look that a be seated must not discover almost may pole height de walden on contrary admired tall woman declared that have now reached exact height gave majesty to female figure without diminishing grace a really thought too tall praise for flattery be not be particularly welcome to be cause whether liked de walden so well that liked seymour so much le a to cease to be fretted by absence can not tell certain be that recovered bloom that from increase of embonpoint mother feared must become too fat for girl of seventeen spirit too recovered former gaiety so that october time for departure of de walden arrived before be conscious that have be with accustomed time mother now naturally enough augured well for success of suit owned be longer averse to listen to love must on account engage to till be quite sure have conquered attachment to pendarves be certainly conceding great deal de walden left full of hope for first time

dictate of own judgment de walden must have returned to college in january betrothed husband though have not received tidings from pendarves mother felt assured of inconstancy persevered firmly in resolution not to engage till have seen again must be assured by seeing with indifference that heart have really changed master will wonder perhaps how man of ferdinand delicacy must wish to accept heart have be so long wedded to that other living object mother have convinced have difficulty in convincing be deceived in strength of former attachment that have originally though unconsciously directed thought to that like romantic girl have thought pretty to be in love that fancied passion have be irritated by obstacle when once wife must find that alone have ever be real possessor of affection be curious to observe how easily even most sensible person can forget believe according to wish mother have absolutely forgotten proof of strong attachment to seymour have once so much deplored forgot illness if not caused be increased by letter of reproach forgot tell tale misery have exhibited on road to oxford did not read in firmness with still persisted to see seymour again
