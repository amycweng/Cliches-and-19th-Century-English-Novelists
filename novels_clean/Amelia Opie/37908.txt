not understand looked up to a superior being must exceed adeline in deference to mother ability when a advanced in life be sometimes tempted to think deficient in maternal fondness idea of mr mowbray bending with pale speechless anxiety over sleepless pillow used to recur to remembrance in moment recent indifference be forgotten must entirely acquit of ingratitude in observing seeming indifference for whence did abstraction apparent coldness of mr mowbray proceed from mind being wholly engrossed in study for future benefit of adeline why did leave concern of family to others why did allow infirm active mother to superintend household duty why did seclude from society save that of own family dr norberry physician friend that might devote hour to endeavour to perfect system of education for beloved only daughter to whom work be to be dedicated 'and yet said adeline mentally be so ungrateful sometimes a to think doe not love sufficiently ' while mr mowbray be busying in plan for

excessive fear of losing only child have indeed awakened to unusual exertion a that have to do be to get down at stated time certain quantity of wine nourishment task though wearisome be not difficult to sooth declining hour of aged parent to please capricious appetite of decay to assist with ready skilful alacrity shaking hand of invalid jealous of waiting on wanting to be cheated into being waited upon trifling yet important detail did not suit habit of mr mowbray adeline be versed in mother conscious of superiority in thing be at last contented to sit by inactive though not unmoved one day when mr mowbray have be prevailed upon to lie down for hour two in apartment adeline be administering to mr woodville broth have made old lady pressed hand affectionately cried 'ah child in lucky

though to be sure squire lady about be none of brightest not to compare with edith yet still must have done for dear good man to gossip bit with so be vexed when daughter declared wanted time for study must not visit body not even mr norberry who be to be sure very good sort of woman though little given to speak ill of neighbour then so be know a say why if one spoke well of alike what must be

assure quite natural pleasant like besides know will not be able to talk much longer so let make most of time now speech brought tear into eye of adeline seeing mother re enter room withdrew to conceal emotion felt lest cheerful loquacity of invalid be fond of indulging must be checked by seeing tear have already received check from presence of mr mowbray of whose superior ability mr woodville be so much in awe that concluding daughter must not bear to hear nonsense old lady smiled kindly on when with look of tender anxiety hastened to bedside then holding hand composed to sleep in few day more breathed last on supporting arm of adeline lamented in dying moment that have nothing valuable in money to leave in order to show adeline how sensible be of affectionate attention 'but be only child added 'and mother have will be yours 'no doubt ' observed mr mowbray eagerly mother died contented chapter iii at period adeline ambition have led to form new plan mr woodville death left at liberty to put in execution whenever old lady reminded that be genius adeline have felt a much degraded a if have said that be conjuror though be too humble to suppose that must ever equal mother be resolved to try to make more worthy of by imitating in pursuit study on be founded mr mowbray pretension to superior talent therefore made business to inquire what study pursuit be finding that mr mowbray noted superiority be built on passion for abstruse speculation adeline eagerly devoted leisure hour to similar study unfortunately new theory romantic revery only served to amuse mr mowbray fancy more enthusiastic daughter resolved to make conscientiously rule of practice while mr mowbray expended eccentric philosophy in word a mr shandy did grief adeline carefully treasured up hers in heart to be manifested only by fruit one author in particular by train of reasoning captivating though sophistical plausible though absurd made delighted convert to opinion prepared young impassioned heart for practice of vice by filling mind ardent in love of virtue with new singular opinion on subject of moral duty on work of writer adeline have often heard mother descant in term of highest praise did not feel so completely convert on own conviction till have experienced fatal fascination of style be conveyed by bewitching pen from world a be into world a ought to be writer whose name be glenmurray amongst other institution attacked institution of marriage after having elaborately pointed out folly wickedness drew so delightful picture of superior purity a well a happiness of union cemented by tie of love honour adeline wrought to highest pitch of enthusiasm for new order of thing entered into solemn compact with to act when be introduced into society according to rule laid down by writer unfortunately for have opportunity of hearing opinion combated by good sense sober experience of dr norberry then sole visitant for at time american war be object of attention to europe a mr mowbray a well a dr norberry be deeply interested in subject scarcely ever talked on other even glenmurray theory be driven from mr mowbray remembrance by political tract eager anxiety of politician have even leisure to observe while be feeling generous anxiety of citizen of world for son daughter of american independence own child be imbibing through mean opinion dangerous to well being a member of civilized society laying perhaps foundation to herself mother of future misery disgrace ala astrologer in fable be too like mr mowbray even have adeline have opportunity of discussing new opinion with dr norberry be not at certain that must have have power mr mowbray be if may be allowed expression showing off woman loved information acquired le for own sake than for supposed importance gave amongst acquaintance mean of displaying superiority over other woman before secluded from society in order to study education have be terror of lady in neighbourhood since despising small talk must always insist on making gentleman of acquaintance a much terrified sometimes a wife engage with in literary political conversation wanted to convert drawing room into arena for mind guest into intellectual gladiator be often heard to interrupt two grave matron in interesting discussion of accouchement by asking if have read new theological tract pamphlet against minister if softly expatiated on lady like fatigue of body have endured discoursed in choice term on energy of mind never received paid visit without convincing company that be most wise most learned most disagreeable of companion adeline on contrary studied merely from love of study not with view to shine in conversation dared venture to expatiate on subject have often heard mr woodville say be very rarely canvassed even alluded to by woman remained silent therefore on subject nearest heart from choice a well a necessity in presence of dr norberry till at length imbibed political mania soon found impossible to conceal interest took in success of infant republic therefore one day put into doctor hand bout rime have written on recent victory of american arm exclaiming with smile too be politician be rewarded by exclamation of 'why girl protest be a clever a mother ' unexpected declaration fixed in path of literary ambition though wisely resolved to fulfil a usual feminine duty adeline be convinced that like mother have right to be author politician philosopher while dr norberry praise of daughter convinced mr mowbray almost unconsciously have educated into prodigy confirmed in intention of exhibiting adeline to admiring world during next season at bath for at bath expected to receive admiration have vainly sought in london soon after marriage mr mowbray have carried lively bride to metropolis where expected to receive same homage have be paid to charm at assize ball in neighbourhood what then must have be disappointment when instead of hearing a passed 'that be miss woodville rich heiress great genius great beauty ' 'that be beautiful mr mowbray ' walked unknown unobserved in public in private found herself of a little importance in wide world of metropolis a most humble of acquaintance in country ball room true have beauty then be unset off by fashion nay more be eclipsed by unfashionable tasteless attire manner though stately imposing in assembly where be known be wholly unlike manner of world in london party appeared arrogant offensive remark too wise a appeared to mr mowbray excited little attention a few person to whom be known in metropolis be wholly ignorant of high pretension knew not that be discoursing with professed genius oracle of provincial circle person indeed surprised at hearing from lip of eighteen observation on moral theology politics listened to with wonder even attention turned away observing beuch thing be true be new rare only wonder be how got there ' till at length disappointed mortified disgusted mr mowbray impatiently returned to rosevalley where in beauty in learning in grandeur be unrivalled where might deal out dogma sure of exciting respectful attention however might fail of calling for more flattering tribute from auditor in narrower field of bath expected to shine forth with greater eclat than in london to obtain admiration more worthy of acceptance than country circle must offer to bath therefore prepared to go young heart of adeline beat high with pleasure at idea of mixing with busy world fancy have often clothed in most winning attraction joy mr mowbray be little over clouded at moment of departure by sight of dr norberry melancholy countenance what be to be a fondly imagined gain be loss with full heart came to bid adieu for adeline have conceived not only affection esteem amounting almost to veneration for appeared to to unite various opposing excellency though possessed of taste talent for literature be skilled in minutest detail of housewifery feminine occupation at same time bore faculty so meekly that never wounded self love of one by arrogating to herself superiority such adeline appeared to excellent old friend affection for be perhaps increased by necessity be under of concealing at home praise of mr mowbray adeline be odious to ear of mr norberry daughter especially praise of latter a merit of adeline be so uniform that even eye of envy must not at period discover thing in vulnerable to censure a sound of name excited in family number of bad passion corresponding expression of countenance doctor wisely resolved to keep feeling with regard to locked up in own bosom persisted in visiting at park daily be wonder therefore that loss even for few month of society of inhabitant must by be anticipated a serious calamity 'pshaw cried a adeline with exulting bound sprung after mother into carriage gay delighted be though heart feel sadly queer heavy ' bey dear friend ' cried mr mowbray ' must miss society wherever go ' ' wish be going too ' said adeline ' will often think of ' 'pshaw girl lie replied dr norberry swallowing sigh a spoke 'you will soon forget old fellow like ' 'then conclude that will soon forget ' how what think so at peril ' must think so a usually judge of others by ' 'go to go miss mal pert well drive on coachman taking leave be plaguey disagreeable so shake hand be off gave hand pressed very affectionately carriage drove on ' be old fool cried doctor wiping eye a carriage disappeared 'well heaven grant sweet innocent that may return to a happy spotless a now be ' mr mowbray have be married at very early age have accepted in mr mowbray first man who addressed consequently that passion for personal admiration so natural to woman have in never be gratified even called forth seeing at age of thirty eight possessed of almost undiminished beauty recollected that charm have never received that general homage for nature intended who at twenty have disregarded even to fault ornament of dress be now at age of thirty eight eager to indulge in extreme of decoration to share in delight of conquest admiration with youthful attractive daughter attractive rather than handsome be epithet best suited to describe adeline mowbray beauty be beauty of expression of countenance not regularity of feature though uncommon fairness delicacy of complexion lustre of hazel eye long dark eye lash profusion of soft light hair curled over ever mantling colour of cheek gave pretension to what be denominated beauty own sex declared be plain perhaps be right though other protested against decision probably be right also woman criticize in detail men admire in aggregate woman reason men feel when passing judgment on female beauty when woman declares to be plain chance be that be right in opinion a can not from being woman feel charm of power to please that beomething than beauty dearer often throw veil over irregularity of feature obtains for even plain woman from men at least appellation of pretty whether adeline face be plain not form must defy even severity of female criticism be indeed tall almost to masculine degree such be roundness proportion of limb such symmetry of whole person such lightness gracefulness of movement so truly feminine be look manner that superior height be forgotten in superior loveliness of figure be not to be wondered at then miss mowbray be object of attention admiration at bath a soon a appeared that mother have share of flattery follower indeed when be known that mr mowbray be rich widow adeline dependent upon mother became in eye of people much more attractive than daughter be impossible however that in place a bath mr mowbray adeline must make rather retain general acquaintance opinion on most subject be so very different from of world be so little conscious from retirement in lived that difference existed be likely to make enemy that not day elapsed in did not shock prejudice of excite contemptuous pity of others soon saw acquaintance coolly dropped by who a person of family fortune have on first arrival sought with eagerness be not entirely owing to freedom of sentiment on politics on other subject because associated with well known obnoxious author man whose speculation have delighted inquiring ignorant lover of novelty terrified timid idolater of ancient usage excited regret of cool rational observer regret eloquence so overwhelming power of reasoning so acute activity of research so praise worthy love of investigation so ardent must be thrown away on discussion of moral political subject incapable of teaching world to build up again with more beauty propriety fabric be perhaps calculated to pull down in short mr mowbray adeline associated with glenmurray author over whose work have long delighted to meditate who have completely led imagination captive before fascination of countenance manner have come in aid of eloquence chapter iv frederic glenmurray be man of family of small independent estate in case died without child be to go to next male heir to heir be certain must go a glenmurray on principle be enemy to marriage consequently not likely to have child born in wedlock be unfortunate circumstance for

conversation displayed excellent understanding improved by education reading colonel mordaunt be not marrying man a be called therefore a soon a began to feel influence of adeline growing too powerful for freedom to observe that attention be far from unpleasing to too honourable to excite attachment in resolved to combat in resolved to fly from danger knew must not face overcome after formal embarrassed adieu to mr mowbray adeline suddenly left bath unexpected departure surprised grieved adeline a feeling of delicacy be too strong to allow to sigh for man who evidently have thought of sighing for dismissed colonel mordaunt from remembrance tried to find a much interest still in ball room promenade a presence have given be long before found in attraction interest stronger than have yet felt be naturally to be supposed that adeline have often wished to know personally author whose writing delighted a much a glenmurray have done that fancy have often portrayed though have clothed in form at once pleasing respectable still from idea of superior wisdom have imagined past meridian of life not likely to excite warmer feeling than of esteem veneration such continued to be adeline idea of glenmurray when arrived at bath having be sent thither by physician for benefit of health glenmurray though sense of unpopularity have long banished from scene of public resort in general be so pleased with novelty of bath that though walked wholly unnoticed except by lover of genius in whatsoever shape showed frequented daily pump room promenade adeline have long admired countenance dignified person of young interesting invalid without slightest suspicion of being man of others whom most wished to see have glenmurray be slow to admire adeline so strong so irresistible be feeling of admiration have excited in that a soon a appeared other object vanished from sight a woman be generally quick sighted to effect of charm adeline never beheld stranger without suffusion of pleasurable confusion on cheek one morning at pump room when glenmurray unconscious that adeline be near be reading newspaper with great attention adeline for first time be looking at unobserved heard name of glenmurray pronounced turned head towards person who spoke in hope of seeing glenmurray when mr mowbray turning round looking at invalid said to gentleman next 'did say sir that tall pale dark interesting looking young man be mr glenmurray celebrated author ' ma'be ' replied gentleman with sneer be mr glenmurray celebrated author ' how must like to speak to ' cried mr mowbray will be difficult matter replied informant 'the gentleman be always quite a much at leisure a see now for person have not same taste a mr mowbray ' so saying bowed departed leaving mr mowbray to whom sight of great author be new so lost in contemplating glenmurray that sarcasm with spoke entirely escaped observation be adeline le abstracted too be contemplating glenmurray with mixed delightful feeling then be young handsome too said mentally 'it be pity look so ill ' added sighing sigh be caused rather by looking so well though adeline be not conscious of by time glenmurray have observed who be neighbour newspaper be immediately laid down 'be there news to day ' said mr mowbray to glenmurray resolved to make bold effort to become acquainted with glenmurray with bow blush of mingled surprise pleasure replied that there be great deal immediately presented to paper have relinquished setting chair at same time for adeline mr mowbray however only slightly glanced eye over paper desire be to talk to glenmurray in order to accomplish point prejudice in favour told how much rejoiced in seeing author whose work be delight instruction of life adeline ' cried turning to blushing daughter not almost daily read daily admire mr glenmurray writing 'yes certainly replied adeline unable to articulate more awed doubt by presence of so superior being while glenmurray more proud of being author than ever said internally 'be possible that sweet creature must have read admired work in vain encouraged by smile even by blush of adeline did endeavour to engage in conversation adeline be unusually silent unusually bashful mr mowbray made ample amends for deficiency mr glenmurray flattered amused must have continued to converse with look at adeline have not observed impertinent sneer rude laughter to conversing so familiarly with exposed mr mowbray a soon a observed arose to depart for glenmurray be according to rochefoucault maxim so exquisitely selfish that always considered welfare of others before own heroically sacrificing own gratification to save mr mowbray adeline from further censure bowed with greatest respect to mr mowbray sighed a paid same compliment to adeline lamenting being forced to quit so soon with evident reluctance left room 'what elegant bow make ' exclaimed mr mowbray adeline have observed nothing sigh on that did not choose to make comment next day mr mowbray having learned glenmurray address sent card for party at lodging nothing glenmurray delight must exceed astonishment at invitation have observed mr mowbray adeline even before adeline have observed a gazed upon fascinating adeline have sighed to think that too must be taught to avoid dangerous disreputable acquaintance of glenmurray to therefore mark of attention be source of consolation joy being well convinced that be owing to ignorance of usual custom opinion of with whom associated be too generous to accept invitation a knew that presence at rout at bath must cause general dismay expose mistress to disagreeable remark at least endeavoured to make amends for self denial by asking leave to wait on when be alone chapter v day two after a adeline be leaning on arm of young lady glenmurray passed to respectful bow returned most cordial salutation 'gracious dear ' said companion 'do know who man be 'certainly be mr glenmurray 'and do speak to ' 'yes why must not

found prey to so much self reproach after have forfeited claim to consistency of conduct felt so strongly aware of value of have not time of meeting be near at hand must certainly have deliberated upon mean of retracting consent to being resolved to do a little mischief a must determined on having second in business accordingly repaired to field accompanied only by trusty servant who have order to wait master pleasure at distance contrary to glenmurray expectation sir patrick also came unattended by second while servant who be with be like other desired to remain in back ground wish mr

principle can have few friend 'and men of practice ought to have none sir patrick ' retorted glenmurray a think worth while to explain to reason for not having second a fear that be incapable of understanding must desire to take ground ' heart ' replied antagonist then taking aim agreed to fire at same moment did so servant hearing report of pistol ran to scene of action saw sir patrick bleeding in sword arm glenmurray also wounded leaning against tree 'this be cursed unlucky said sir patrick coolly have disabled right arm ca go on with business at present when be well again command

insensible from loss of blood with assistance of antagonist be carried to chaise supported by terrified servant conveyed back to bath be not to be supposed that event of nature must be long unknown be soon told over city sir patrick o'carrol mr glenmurray have fought duel that latter be dangerously wounded quarrel having originated in mr glenmurray scoffing at religion king constitution before pious loyal baronet story soon reached ear of mr mowbray who in agony of tender sorrow in defiance of decorum went in person to call on admired sir patrick adeline who heard of affair soon after a regardless of appearance a mother more alarmed went in person to inquire concerning wounded glenmurray by time that have arrived at lodging not only own surgeon sir patrick have seen a antagonist thought necessary to ascertain true state of wound that might know whether ought to stay fly country account of surgeon be however so favourable glenmurray in respect so well that sir patrick alarm be soon quite at end wounded man be lying on sofa lost in very pleasant reflection when adeline knocked at door glenmurray at very moment be saying to 'well so much for principle consistency now next step must be to marry then will have made complete fool worst of fool man presuming to instruct others by precept when find incapable of influencing even own action at moment servant came up with miss mowbray compliment if be well enough to see must come up speak to in instant self reproach be forgotten when adeline hung weeping silent on shoulder must not rejoice in affair have procured moment of such heartfelt delight at first adeline expressed nothing terror at consequence of wound pity for suffering when found that be in danger in very little pain tender mistress yielded to severe monitress began to upbraid glenmurray for having acted not only in defiance of wish principle of own of principle laid down by to world in strongest point of view in manner convincing to mind 'dearest adeline consider provocation cried glenmurray ' gross insult offered to woman love ' 'but who ever fought duel without provocation glenmurray if provocation be justification book be unnecessary did not offer insult to understanding of woman love in supposing that must be obliged to for playing fool on account ' 'but must have be called coward have declined challenge though can bear world hatred must not contempt must not endure loss of what world call ' possible ' rejoined adeline 'that hear philosophical glenmurray talking thus in silly jargon of man of world 'alas be man not philosopher adeline ' least be sensible one consistent dare not now call have forgotten distinction in volume on subject of duel so strongly lay down between real apparent honour in of two class do put honour of in

glenmurray observation of mine be own replied adeline see have book in muff will punish for badness of practice by giving dose of theory ' girl ' cried glenmurray ' be not ordered sleeping draught ' adeline be however resolved opening book read argument after argument with unyielding perseverance till glenmurray who like eagle in song saw on dart wounded own feather cried 'quarter 'but tell dear adeline ' said glenmurray little piqued at too just reproof 'you who be so severe on want of consistency be capable of acting up in respect to precept 'after weakness ' replied adeline smiling 'it becomes to doubt own strength assure make scruple of conscience to show by conduct confidence in truth of opinion 'then in defiance of world opinion that opinion see have not resolution to brave will be mine not according to tie of marriage with other tie sanction than of love reason ' ' will ' said adeline 'and may whom worship ' raising fine eye white arm to heaven 'desert when desert ' who that have seen countenance gesture at moment must have imagined be calling on heaven to witness engagement to lead life of infamy rather must have thought sublime enthusiast breathing forth worship of grateful soul may be supposed that glenmurray heart beat with exultation at confession from adeline that forgot in promised indulgence of passion bound strict decorum required glenmurray did justice beheld a be purity of feeling delicacy if possible slight favour by true love be long contented to be fed though granted by adeline with more conscious emotion be received by with more devoted respect besides again felt that mixture of pain with pleasure on assurance of love have experienced before for knew though adeline did not extent of degradation into step conscience approved must necessarily precipitate experience alone must convince that sensibility to shame when be for first time exposed to must not overcome supposed fortitude boasted contempt of world opinion change rose of love into thorn of regret remorse must who doted on too who admired a much for consummate purity a for other of quality must bear to behold fair creature whose open eye beamed with consciousness of virtue casting timid glance to earth shrinking with horror from conviction of having in world eye forfeited pretension to virtue alone be end of action must approbation of own mind be sufficient to support under trial though have with such sweet earnestness talked to of efficacy reflection have for time past be continually occurring to now came across mind blighting triumph of successful passion nay from dread of incurring yet more ridicule on account of opposition of practice to theory perhaps indignant contempt of adeline must have thrown at foot conjuring to submit to degradation of being wife unknown to glenmurray perhaps reason prompted to desire concession from adeline be never more likely to be in reality slave of selfishness than when fancy acting with most heroic disinterestedness egotism love becoming dress be always on watch to hide ugliness by robe of benevolence glenmurray thought that be willing to marry adeline merely for sake suspect be chiefly for true delicate lover be always monopolizer always desirous of calling woman of affection own be not only because considers marriage a holy institution that lover lead mistress to altar because give right to appropriate fair treasure to because sanction perpetuates dearest of monopoly erects sacred barrier to guard right around be respectable in society be most powerful effectual in organization be proud eager to rally while glenmurray in spite of happiness be sensible to alloy of adeline be tenderly imputing to pain of wound occasionally mournful expression of countenance adeline took occasion to declare that must live with glenmurray only on condition that step met with mother approbation 'then be hope for ever at end ' said glenmurray 'or spite of eye sparkled a spoke 'or must submit to absurd ceremony of marriage ' bearriage ' replied astonished adeline think so meanly of mother a to suppose practice so totally opposite to principle that must require daughter to submit to ceremony herself regard with contempt impossible be sure when solicit consent to being yours will be pleased to find that sentiment observation have not be thrown away on ' glenmurray thought otherwise however bowed be silent adeline declared that to put end to doubt on subject must instantly go in search of mr mowbray propose question to glenmurray feeling more weak indisposed than chose to own to allowed though reluctantly to depart chapter vii mr mowbray be just returned from charitable visit when adeline entered room pray miss mowbray where have be ' exclaimed seeing adeline with hat cloak on ' have be visiting poor mr glenmurray replied ' cried mr mowbray 'and without leave pray who went with ' 'nobody ma'be ' what visit man alone at lodging after education have received ' madam replied adeline meekly education never taught that such conduct be improper a did same afternoon must have dared to think so ' 'you be mistaken miss mowbray replied mother ' did not do same for term be upon with sir patrick made visiting impropriety at think have acted wrong replied adeline timidly 'no doubt have done so though be quite right in visiting sir patrick a respectability of age character sir patrick

so often have heard admire ' a said adeline pointed to passage in instant mr mowbray seized book threw on fire before adeline have recovered consternation mr mowbray fell into violent hysteric long be before be restored to composure when recovered be so exhausted that adeline dared not renew conversation leaving to rest made up bed on floor in mother room passed night of wretchedness watchfulness first of kind have ever known must have be last in morning mr mowbray awoke refreshed calm affected at seeing pale cheek sunk eye of adeline indicative of sleepless unhappy night held out hand to with look of kindness adeline pressed to lip a knelt by bed side moistened with tear of regret for past alarm for future dear child ' said mr mowbray in faint voice hope will no longer think of putting design in execution so fraught with mischief to horror to little did think that be so romantic a to see difference between amusing one imagination with new theory new system acting upon in defiance of common custom received usage of society admire convenient trouser graceful dress of turkish woman must not wear lest must expose to derision 'be there difference ' thought adeline 'between importance of dress opinion be one to be taken up laid down again with same indifference a other continued silent mr mowbray went on 'the poetical philosophy have so much delighted to study have served to ornament conversation make person le enlightened than wonder at superior boldness of fancy acuteness of reasoning power must a soon have thought of making little gold chain round neck fasten hall door a act upon precept laid down in delightful book though think say be true believe purity inculcate too much for world ' adeline listened in silent astonishment consternation conscience conviction of what be right then for first time learned be not to be rule of action though filial tenderness made resolve never to be mistress of glenmurray also resolved never to be wife that of other man while in spite of great respect with have hitherto regarded mother conduct opinion began to diminish 'must to heaven dear mother ' said adeline when mr mowbray have done speaking 'that have said to ere mind have be indelibly impressed with truth of forbidden doctrine for now conscience tell ought to act up to ' 'how exclaimed mr mowbray starting up in bed in voice shrill with emotion 'be then resolved to disobey dishonour ' 'oh never never ' replied adeline alarmed at mother violence fearful of relapse kind affectionate parent that have ever be to though will never marry out of regard to own principle will also never contract other union out of respect to wish will lead with quiet if not happy life for never never can forget glenmurray ' 'there speaks excellent child always thought to be ' replied mr mowbray 'and will leave to time good counsel to convince that opinion of girl of eighteen a be not founded on long experience may possibly be erroneous mr mowbray never made truer observation adeline be not in frame of mind to assent to 'besides ' continued mr mowbray 'have ever be disposed to accept of mr glenmurray a son in law be very unlikely that must be so now a duel took place not only find from treasonable opinion put forth from disrespectful language held concerning ' 'who must dare to invent so infamous calumny exclaimed adeline authority be unquestionable miss mowbray speak from sir patrick ' add falsehood to other villanies returned adeline almost inarticulate with rage what must be expected from man who must dare to insult young woman under roof of mother with licentious address 'what mean ' cried mr mowbray turning pale ' mean that sir patrick yesterday morning insulted by grossest familiarity bey dear child replied mr mowbray laughing 'that be only usual freedom of manner manner ignorance of world led to mistake did not mean to insult believe be sure that spite of ardent passion for never even when alone with hazarded improper liberty ' ardent passion feel for madam ' exclaimed adeline turning pale in turn miss mowbray what suppose think too old to inspire one assure there be people who think mother handsomer than daughter doubt dear mother one ought to think so must to heaven sir patrick be one of unfortunately ' 'be of opinion ' interrupted mr mowbray angrily 'and to convince so tenderly doe love so fondly do return passion that in few day will become wife ' adeline on hearing terrible information fell insensible on ground when recovered saw mr mowbray anxiously watching by not with look of alarm tenderness with have attended during long illness that look be always present to graceful affectionate remembrance mr mowbray eye be cast down with half mournful half reproachful half fearful expression when met that of adeline emotion of anguish fainting have evinced be reproach to proud heart of mr mowbray adeline felt that be so when recollected that mother be going to marry man who have so lately declared criminal passion for be very near relapsing into insensibility however struggled with feeling in order to gain resolution to disclose to mr mowbray have passed between sir patrick a soon a offered to renew conversation mr mowbray sternly commanded to be silent insisting on going to bed left to own reflection till wearied exhausted fell into sound sleep a be late in evening when awoke did rise again till next morning mr mowbray entered room a be dressing inquired how did with kindness will be better dear mother if will hear have to say concerning sir patrick replied adeline bursting into tear can say nothing will shake opinion of miss mowbray ' replied mother coldly advise to reconcile to circumstance be not in power to prevent ' so saying left room adeline convinced that must say must be vain endeavoured to console by thinking that a soon a sir patrick became husband of mother wicked design on must undoubtedly cease therefore in one respect ill assorted union must be beneficial to sir patrick meanwhile be le sanguine in expectation from marriage unlike innocent adeline did not consider union with mother a necessary check to attempt on daughter emboldened by what to appeared libertine sentiment of adeline relying on opportunity of being with must infallibly enjoy under same roof in country looked on a certain prey though believed glenmurray to be at moment preferred to thought impossible that superior beauty of person must not in end have due weight a passion founded in esteem admiration of intellectual beauty must not in opinion subsist besides adeline appeared in eye not deceived enthusiast susceptible forward girl endeavouring to hide frailty under fine sentiment high sounding theory be sir patrick inference unnatural one man of world must have thought same on very plausible ground chapter viii a sir patrick be not 'punctual a lover to moment sworn mr mowbray resolved to sit down write immediately to glenmurray flattering at same time that letter be designed to confound

when sir patrick arrived to be immediately shown 'heh what have here ' cried laughing violently a perused 'here talk of being pierced by shaft be warded off now have said that must have be called bull a to concluding paragraph ' o that flatter ' said mr mowbray 'will tear with remorse ' 'he must first understand ' cried sir patrick ' can just comprehend be sure will be botheration to ' ' be sorry to find such be opinion ' replied mr mowbray think that sentence best written of did not say be not fine writing ' replied baronet only said be not to be understood with leave will send letter will drop subject ' so said so done to great satisfaction of sir patrick who felt that be for interest to suffer part of mr mowbray letter alluded to glenmurray supposed calumny against to remain obscurely worded a well knew that what have asserted on subject be wholly void of foundation glenmurray did not receive with equal satisfaction be indignant at charge of having advised adeline to become mistress rather than wife a so much of concluding passage a must understand seemed to imply that have calumniated mother to remain silent moment must have be to confess guilty therefore answered mr mowbray letter immediately answer be a follows beadam 'to clear from charge of having advised miss mowbray to step contrary to common custom however erroneous of society at period appeal to testimony

have difficulty in declaring have encouraged feeling uttered word capable of giving lie to declaration be now going to make be 'with respect esteem 'your obedient servant f glenmurray ' letter have effect on mr mowbray feeling so much in favour of glenmurray that be almost determined to let marry adeline felt that owed amends for contracting marriage so suddenly without knowledge approbation thought that by marrying to man of heart must make peace with adeline unfortunately design a soon a began to be formed be communicated to sir patrick beo then exclaimed 'you have forgotten forgiven impertinent thing puppy said thing obliged to wear little useless appendage in sling thus pointing to wounded arm o dear sir patrick though what mr glenmurray said might alarm scrupulous tenderness of lover perhaps be remark might only suit sincerity of friend perhaps if mr glenmurray have made to must have heard with thanks with candour have approved ' bey sweet soul replied sir patrick may be a candid amiable a ever please 'by st patrick ' never will sir patrick o'carrol be father in law to notorious infamous glenmurray that subverter of religion order scourge of civilized society ' so saying stalked about room mr mowbray a gazed on handsome person thought must be absurd for to sacrifice own happiness to daughter give up sir patrick a husband in order to make glenmurray son therefore wrote letter to glenmurray forbidding further intercourse with adeline on pretence whatever delayed not moment to send final decision 'that be acting like sensible woman took for ' said sir patrick 'the fellow have now gotten quietus trust dear little adeline be reserved for happier fate sweet soul know how fond will be of protest that will be so kind to will be difficult for people to

resolved that adeline must not accompany to church even know of ceremony till be over be difficult matter adeline remained in own apartment preceding day endeavouring in vain to reconcile to what justly termed degradation of mother felt ala most painful of feeling next to of self abasement consciousness of abasement of one to whom have life looked up with love veneration to write to glenmurray while oppressed by such contending emotion knew to be impossible therefore contented with sending verbal message importing that must hear from next day poor glenmurray passed rest of day night in

of protection strange irrational ' thought adeline 'be prejudice of society because idle ceremony have not be muttered over at altar be liable to be thought woman of vicious inclination to be exposed

condemned ' while adeline said berrendale almost shuddering at picture drew paced room in great agitation even gratification of passion used a be to indulgence of wish seemed for moment motive not sufficiently powerful to enable to unite fate to of woman so degraded a adeline appeared to be must perhaps have hesitated to accept hand offered have not added a contrast to picture have drawn 'but if in spite of unwelcome consideration persist in resolution of making yours have resolution enough to conquer repugnance feel to make second connexion may depend on possessing in one who will study

tenderly supporting head that while vision of approaching gout adeline bending over restless couch floated before prudent consideration vanished eagerly pressing proffered hand to lip thanked most ardently for kind promise putting arm round waist must have pressed to bosom familiarity be ill timed adeline be already surprised even shocked at length to have gone starting almost with loathing from embrace told grew late be time for to go to lodging then retired to own room spent half night at least in weeping over remembrance of glenmurray in loudly apostrophizing departed spirit next day adeline out of money have earned discharged lodging having written farewell note to mr beauclerc begging to hear of now then mulatto proceeded to town with berrendale in search of apartment having

on possibility of claiming sum of money glenmurray have bequeathed to without a berrendale have assured customary formality money be near l berrendale have allowed to go to glenmurray legal heir because be sure that writing bequeathed must not hold good in law still adeline be so unwilling to be under so many pecuniary obligation to man whom did not love that resolved to take advice on subject much against will of berrendale who thought money for fee might a well be saved a chance for saving fee resolved to let adeline go to lawyer chamber alone thinking likely that fee must be accepted from so fine woman accordingly more alive to economy than to delicacy decorum berrendale when adeline desiring coach to be called summoned to accompany to temple pleaded terror of impending fit of gout begged to excuse attendance adeline unsuspicious of real cause of refusal kindly expressing sorrow for one feigned took counsellor address got into coach berrendale taking care to tell a

jamaica while adeline night of departure endeavoured by conjuring up horror of tempest at sea on passage of hurricane earthquake on shore when arrived to force to feel such sorrow a tenderness have expressed at moment of parting seemed to make duty to feel morning came with feeling of liberty independence so delightful that no longer tried to grieve on speculation a be giving up whole soul to joy of maternal fondness looked forward with pious gratitude to day of tranquil repose save when thought with bitter regret of obdurate anger of mother with tender regret of lost ever lamented glenmurray berrendale have be arrived at jamaica month when adeline observed most alarming change in savanna became thin appetite entirely failed looked image of despondence in vain did adeline ask reason of change so apparent only answer must obtain be bee better soon continuing day to give answer in short time became so languid a to be obliged to lie down day adeline then found that be necessary to be more serious in interrogatory mulatto at first only answered 'no die never break duty vow to die never leave ' word implying wish to leave with resolution not to do so how much soever might cost alarmed in moment ever disinterested sensibility of adeline at length wrung from confession that dear william who be gone to jamaica a servant to gentleman be be credibly informed very ill

instantly restored to wonted health by mind being lightened of load oppressed took passage on board friend vessel set sail for jamaica carrying with letter from adeline to berrendale while adeline felt want of savanna in various way so forcibly that not even editha must for time at least console for loss have be so grateful to feeling to meet day eye of one being fixed with never varying affection on hers that when beheld eye no longer felt alone in universe have single female friend to whom must turn for relief consolation mr beauclerc to whose society have expected to be restored by marriage have be forced to give up intercourse with in compliance with peremptory wish of rich old maid from whom child have great expectation who threatened to leave fortune away from if mr beauclerc persisted in corresponding with woman so bad in principle so wicked in practice a adeline appeared to to be at length from mother employment from writing above from idea that by suffering be making atonement for past sin derived consolation became resigned to evil have befallen to evil might still befall perhaps did not consider a evil what now took place increasing coldness in letter of berrendale till said openly at last that a be be forced to confess far from happy together a air of jamaica agreed with a be resolved to stay there thought have better remain in england must remit a much money occasionally a circumstance must admit of thought greater evil than at first appeared when agent of berrendale father in law in england friend of berrendale called on pretending that came to inquire concerning health raised in mind suspicion of very painful nature after usual compliment find madam ' said mr drury 'that friend be very much admired by lady in jamaica be glad to hear sir ' coolly answered adeline 'well be kind generous now replied drury very disinterested ' see virtue sir in rejoicing of what must make mr berrendale abode in jamaica pleasant to ' beay be so most woman

'good heaven sir ' replied adeline 'what can mean mr berrendale form advantageous marriage when be already married to ' bearried to ma'be ' answered mr drury with look of incredulity 'excuse know that such marriage a yours may be easily dissolved ' at first adeline be startled at assertion recollecting that be impossible form ceremony must have be wanting at marriage recovered demanded with air of severity what mr drury meant by so alarming ill founded speech bey meaning ma'be ' replied beust be pretty evident to mean that look upon though bear mr berrendale name to be lawful wife that live with on same term on lived with mr glenmurray 'and on what sir must build such erroneous supposition mr berrendale own word madam who always spoke of connexion with a of connexion have formed in compliance with love in defiance of prudence 'and be possible that must be such villain exclaimed adeline child doe thy father brand thee with stain of illegitimacy sir appellation mr berrendale might choose to give union with to friend in england be sure will not dare to incur penalty attendant on man marrying one wife while have living for be wife can bring pretty sufficient evidence to prove ' madam can produce witness of ceremony then presume ' 'no sir woman who attended to altar clergyman who married be dead only witness be child now only ten year old 'that be unfortunate ' with look of incredulity 'but doubt when hear that mr berrendale be married to west indian heiress will come forward with incontrovertible proof of prior claim if do madam may command good office till then humbly take leave ' saying with very visible sneer on countenance departed leaving adeline in state of distress more painful to endure from having none to participate in one to whom must impart cause of mr drury did not speak of possible marriage of berrendale from mere conjecture be very apparent adeline resolved not to delay writing to husband immediately to inform of what have passed put before eye in strongest possible manner guilt of what be about to do also utter impossibility of being successful guilt a be resolved to assert claim for sake of child if not for own letter concluded with truth too with protestation of believing mr drury said to be false for indeed more considered berrendale character more be convinced that however selfish defective disposition might be be more likely mr drury must be mistaken than berrendale be villain where man conduct be not founded on virtuous motif immutable principle may not err while temptation be absent once expose to presence be capable of falling into very vice most abhorrent to nature though adeline knew not man be berrendale adeline having relieved mind by appeal to husband being assured that berrendale must not be married before letter must reach a be impossible that must dare to marry while mulatto be in very town near resided felt capable of attending to usual employment again have recovered tranquillity when answer to letter arrived adeline being certain that letter must be proof of marriage have resolved to show in justification of claim to mr drury what then must have be surprise to find exactly letter a must be evidence against marriage between berrendale having ever taken place thanked for expression of fond regret letter contained for many happy hour owed to society hoped that a fate have now separated destiny must be a happy without a have be with assuring that must according to promise regularly remit l year if possible that must at present only inclose draft for l adeline be absolutely stupified with horror at reading apparent confirmation of villany of husband father of child roused to indignant exertion by sense of berrendale baseness of what owed daughter resolved to take counsel opinion in what manner must proceed to prove marriage a soon a be assured that berrendale have doubt be fixed upon must have taken place intelligence received short time after mulatto who worn out with sorrow sickness hardship one day tottered into house seeming a if indeed only returned to die with mistress at first joy of seeing savanna restored to swallowed up other feeling tender apprehension for poor creature health soon took possession of mind adeline drew from narrative exhibited berrendale to eye a capable of most atrocious action chapter xix be very certain that when berrendale left england though meant to conceal marriage entirely have not even slightest wish to contract have one told that be capable of such wicked conduct must have answered like hazael 'be thy servant dog that must do thing ' be then unassailed by temptation habituated a be to selfish indulgence be impossible that to strong temptation must not fall immediate victim strong temptation assailed soon after arrival in person of very lovely rich widow relation of first wife who having child of own have long be very fond of child then very fine boy with great readiness transferred to father affection bore son for time conscience adeline stood ground against new mistress immense property at length being pressed by father in law who wished match to assign sufficient reason for coldness to so fine woman not daring to give true one returned lady fondness though have not yet courage enough to name marriage day be known that must time other take place scruple soon yielded to dominion attraction of lady who be well versed in art of seduction obtained over sens to strong power sight of splendour in lived acquired over avarice when just a thing be on point of being concluded poor mulatto who have found husband dead arrived almost broken hearted at place of berrendale abode delivered to letter from adeline terrified confounded at presence received with such evident mark of guilty confusion in face that savanna apprehensive suspicious attachment to mistress took alarm a have seen very fine woman leave room a entered on pretence of leaving berrendale alone to read letter repaired to servant

step of conscious integrity going to confound vice in moment of triumph berrendale read doom moment beheld in dark fiery eye awaited in trembling silence torrent of reproach trembled on lip will not repeat what passed suffice that berrendale pretended to be moved by what said promised to break off marriage only exacting from savanna in return promise of not imparting to servant to one that have

looked for with great anxiety still in midst of distress sudden thought struck adeline converted anger into joy sorrow into exultation mother may now forgive without violating part of oath ' exclaimed ' be now forsaken despised disgraced ' instantly wrote to mr mowbray letter calculated to call forth sympathy affection then with mind relieved beyond expression sat down to deliberate in what manner

tawny boy soon discovered cry out 'oh sir do bring news of friend ' sprang to hung almost breathless on arm savanna who be conscious enough to know what passed though too much weakened from own suffering anxiety to be able to struggle with new affliction started up on hearing word screamed out 'does live blessed man say so dat ' in tone so affecting with expression of agonized curiosity so overwhelming to feeling colonel mordaunt whose spirit be not very high be so choked that must not immediately answer when at last faltered out behe life be quite well ' frantic joy of mulatto overcame still more jumped about neck hugged tawny boy delight be a extravagant a grief have be till exhausted silent sunk upon bed be unable for minute to listen quietly to story colonel mordaunt came to relate when be composed enough to listen to did not long remain so for a soon a heard that colonel mordaunt have met adeline in phrensy conveyed to place of safety fell at foot embraced knee making tawny boy kneel down by invoked blessing of god on so fervently so eloquently that colonel mordaunt wept like child exclaiming soul good woman can not bear ' be forced to run out of house to recover emotion when returned savanna said 'well now blessed sir take to dear lady ' 'indeed replied ' must not be forbidden to see ' 'forbidden replied eye flashing fire 'and who dare to keep savanna from own mistress will see ' 'not if forbids savanna if child life must be endangered by ' ' o to be sure not cried tawny boy who doted upon editha having fetched back from next house be lulling to sleep in arm colonel mordaunt started at sight of child stooping down to kiss rosy cheek sighed deeply a turned away again 'well cried savanna talk very strange understand 'but will excellent creature ' replied colonel 'immediately then entered on full explanation to savanna who have sooner heard that mistress feared that have be so much exposed to infection of small pox a to make certain of giving to child than exclaimed good god save protect own self never have may get die ' beurely must be mistaken ' replied colonel berrendale must have recollected mentioned own danger if be case behe hastily interrupted mulatto tink of herself never only mind others good do tink if be one selfish beast like husban savanna love so dear mr colonel know know though may save child may lose mother here began to weep bitterly while colonel more in love than ever with adeline from proof of goodness resolved to lose time in urging to undergo operation desired for editha then begging mulatto to send for surgeon directly in spite of tear of tawny boy who thought cruel to run risk of spoiling miss editha pretty face took leave saying to 'what heart have adeline how capable of feeling affection for one can inspire who be not able to feel creature be thrown away on man undeserving seems ' on intelligence continued to muse till arrived at adeline lodging to whom communicated have passed from whom learned with great anxiety that be too true that have never have small pox that therefore must probably show symptom of disease in few day consequently a considered too late for to be inoculated must do now remained to be done for security by low living good air same evening colonel mordaunt returned to savanna in hope of learning from further particular respecting adeline husband a felt that conscience must not be much hurt by inducing adeline to leave protection of man who be unworthy of possessing fortunately for wish must not wish to hear more than savanna wished to tell thing relating to adored lady colonel mordaunt heard with generous indignation of perfidious conduct of berrendale vowing at same time that time interest fortune must be devoted to bring villain to justice to secure to injured editha rightful inheritance mulatto be in rapture told colonel mordaunt that be charming man infinitely handsomer than berrendale though must own be very good to look at wished with soul that colonel mordaunt be married to lady for then believed must have never known sorrow be a happy a day be long colonel mordaunt must not hear without secret pang 'have followed ' said mentally dictate of heart when saw adeline at bath might now perhaps instead of being forlorn unattached being have be happy husband father adeline instead of having be mistress of one man disowned wife of might have be happy beloved a respectable in eye of world a be in of grateful mulatto ' however there be hope left for yet adeline thought be not woman likely to be over scrupulous in idea might very naturally think at liberty to accept protection of lover when from fault of hers have lost that of husband be natural to suppose that while elevated with hope did not fail to be very constant in visit to adeline at length more led by passion than policy abruptly at end of ten day informed adeline that knew situation that trusted that must allow to hope that in due time love have be proof against time absence disdain must meet with reward that on settling handsome income on child for joint life must allow to endeavour to make a happy a only must make to proposal be in form of letter colonel mordaunt did not receive immediate answer be at first likely that must ever receive answer to at a adeline be at moment of arrival confined to bed according to expectation with disease have be too fearful of imbibing while half distracted mulatto be forced to give up to others care of sickening editha to watch over delirious unconscious adeline tawny boy generous benefactress gave leave to remain at adeline lodging in order to calm fear for editha assist in amusing keeping quiet if attention have share in preserving life beauty of editha be to affectionate tawny boy that owed be soon rewarded for care anxiety by seeing little charge able to play about a usual colonel mordaunt mulatto meanwhile did not obtain so speedy termination to anxiety adeline recovery be for long time matter of doubt weakness so great after crisis of disorder be past that none ventured to pronounce even then out of danger at length be in great measure restored to health able to determine what line of conduct be necessary for to pursue to return answer to colonel mordaunt proposal be certainly first business a felt that situation in have once known made offer le affronting than must have be under

gave into savanna hand first day that be permitted to see attested certificate of chapter xxi first question adeline asked on recovery be whether letter have come by general post during illness savanna gave one to immediately be letter so ardently desired for direction be in mother hand writing opened full of eager expectation while whole existence seemed to depend on nature of content what then must have be agony on finding that enveloppe contained nothing own letter returned for time spoke not breathed not while savanna mixed with expression of terror at sight of mistress distress poured execration on unnatural parent who have so cruelly occasioned after few day incessant struggle to overcome violence of sorrow adeline recovered shock in appearance at least yet to savanna self congratulation must not help answering laying hand on heart blow be here savanna wound incurable soon after thought well enough to see colonel mordaunt to thank for recent proof of attention to interest obligation however great must shut now vigilant eye of adeline to impropriety of receiving further visit from to guilt of welcoming to house man who made open profession to of illicit love however thought duty to see once more in order to try to reconcile to necessity of rule of conduct be going to lay down for be without hope that yet recent trace of disease to have so nearly fallen victim must make appearance so unpleasing to eye of lover that must be very willing to absent from house for time at least probably give up thought of did colonel mordaunt justice be formed to inspire real lasting passion passion that external change must destroy since be founded on unchanging quality of heart mind colonel mordaunt felt for such attachment in force have always admired attractive person winning grace of adeline felt for what denominated love that rational though enthusiastic preference be deserving of name of true love never felt till have have opportunity to appreciate justly real character of adeline still there be time when felt almost gratified to reflect that must not legally be for might have be cause excuse of error have erred delicacy of mind revolted at idea of

debility death like meagreness of aspect made fear that though one malady be conquered even more dangerous remained idea overcame be forced to turn to window to hide emotion manner be so indicative of ardent yet respectful attachment adeline began to feel in spite of herself that projected task be difficult of execution for minute of spoke mordaunt held hand gave to heart kissed a withdrew again turned away head to conceal starting tear while adeline be not sorry to have few moment in to recover before addressed on subject at time nearest to heart of at length summoned resolution enough to say beuch a have be mortified degraded colonel mordaunt by letter have received from still rejoice that did receive in first place rejoice because look on suffering mortification meet with a merciful chastisement a expiation inflicted on in mercy by being whom adore for sin of have be guilty in second place because give opportunity of proving incontrovertibly full conviction of fallacy of past opinion became wife after idle declamation against marriage from change of principle on assurance of error not from interest necessity ' here paused overcome with effort have made colonel mordaunt must have interrupted earnestly conjuring to give patient hearing proceeded thus 'have change in practice be result of thing rational conviction must now unfortunate a have be in choice of husband regret that ever formed so foolish tie perhaps be induced to enter into le sacred connexion from idea that state forced to drag out existence in hopeless misery be contrary to reason justice benefit of society that sooner tie be dissolved better must be for individual happiness for world at large 'and do not think so cried colonel mordaunt ' can not own individual experience convince of ' from ' replied adeline 'and bless god that doe not for thence thence only do begin to be reconciled to have doubt that there be great deal of individual suffering in marriage state from contrariety of temper other cause believe that mass of happiness virtue be certainly increased by individual suffering therefore be argument for abolition of marriage than accidental bursting of musket must be for total abolition of fire arm 'but surely dear mr berrendale must wish divorce to be made easier than be ' 'by mean interrupted adeline understanding what be going to say 'to bear forbear believe to be grand

lesson so needful in order to perfect human character believe difficulty of divorce to be one of greatest blessing of society ' 'what can have so completely changed opinion on subject ' replied colonel mordaunt own experience returned adeline 'for painful situation in have be placed might attribute not to fallacy of system on have acted to existing prejudice in society wish to see destroyed

intuitive knowledge of human heart a be person of quick talent sensibility posse however defective experience adeline resolved to try to soothe self love have wounded knowing self love be scarcely to be distinguished in effect from love that agony of disappointed passion be always greater when be inflicted by coldness falsehood of beloved object than when proceeds from parental prohibition cruel separation enjoined by conscious poverty therefore told colonel mordaunt that be once very near being first choice of heart when first saw said person manner attention have so strongly prepossessed in

to procure two apartment at small house within two mile of mr mowbray 'then breathe once more same air with mother ' exclaimed adeline a took possession of lodging beavanna methinks breathe freer

feeling in other way than by writing kind letter to adeline enclosing draft on banker letter be on point of being sent when drury arrived with very little ceremony informed that adeline be dead 'dead exclaimed berrendale falling almost sensless on couch oh for god sake tell of what died surely surely ' here voice failed drury coolly replied that child died of small pox 'but when dear fellow when

of guest at mr maynard mr wallington miss maynard indeed received with such pointed mark of distinction preference a to make visible to observer that be not a friend only be desirous of considering colonel mordaunt while by spiteful look acrimonious remark directed to other sister expressed jealousy rankled in heart whenever seemed by design inadvertency to make one of particular object of attention of emma douglas chance for favour be not at fearful thought too plain too unattractive to be capable of rivalling especially in favour of officer man of fashion therefore beheld without emotion attention colonel mordaunt paid to whenever spoke deference evidently felt for opinion a remark on subject conversed be formed always to interest often to instruct one evening while major douglas be amusing in looking over magazine have lately be bound up together have not yet be deposited in mr maynard library suddenly started down book turning to window with exclamation of 'poor

between adeline glenmurray concluded with saying that 'from almost idolatrous respect with glenmurray spoke apparently thought of adeline from account of conduct motif so fully detailed be convinced that so far from being influenced by depravity in connecting with glenmurray adeline be victim of romantic absurd false conception of virtue must have thought duty to have endeavoured assisted by
