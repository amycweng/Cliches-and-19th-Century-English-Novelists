illustration thackeray in study at onslow square from painting by e m ward know exceedingly little of genesis progress of esmond did not seem to be part of life a pendennis be say lady ritchie though wrote part of to dictation only heard esmond spoken of very rarely perhaps state be not le gracious milton girl found paradise lost very considerable part of life be not happier parallel be respectable greatest thing have way of coming so still into world wrangle be of who be not content simply not to know about composition of homer purpose of divina commedia probable plan of canterbury tale ur hamlet nobody put preliminary advertisement in paper see about thing there be discreditable neglect of first requirement of public so be with esmond there be thought reference to in brookfield letter in several search can not find to mother speaks of book a grand melancholy to lady stanley a of cut throat melancholy be said to have be sold for thousand pound same sum that master willow lent falstaff on probably inferior security who knew thought well of be not wholly surprising be still perhaps in possession of success rather of esteem than of affection company of young men maiden to whom be not long ago submitted pronounced with one two exception inferior a work of hitting of little harry in eye with potato be admitted humorous hardly anything else a representing generation point of view faithful dr john brown did not wholly like esmond marriage with rachel after love for beatrix being apparently fly in ointment to even author must only plead there be deal of pain in go for nothing a say in one of rare published reference to subject be wrong undoubtedly mere taking of pain will not do be when be taken in not right manner by not right person on not right subject here everything be right accordingly went for everything greater novel than esmond know know many greater book may be melancholy none worse for that be grand for though there may not be much humour of potato throwing sort in esmond will perhaps be found that in book of thackeray of one else be that deeper higher humour take life for province be humour of humanity more absolutely pervading may be found likewise at least by that in book be there to be found constant intertwist of passion in humanity higher representative go with humour hand in hand loving yet mutually critical pair of extraordinarily difficult form of autobiography know such masterly presentment be very difficult to recognize mean by mastery be attained though heaven know be not easy to understand skill with be applied success be in fact result of curious doubleness amounting in fact here to something like triplicity distinguishes thackeray attitude handling thus henry esmond who be on whole must say most like of character though of course romanced little be other fellow also a be human criticism of at time have tolerably unsophisticated account of action may be even thought at thought action a present might present to mind yet at other time reasoned view of a be that of impartial historian mixed form of narrative mono drama lends to a nothing else must so doe author well known much discussed sometimes heartily abused habit of parabasis soliloquy to audience of nothing have yet be directly said anything be said must have to be repeated a to novel so that may a well keep for last late example virginian philip efficacy in peculiar kind of double treble handling be almost indisputable even by who may dispute legitimacy a constantly applied method one result however have a regard hero spokesman be curious believe thoroughly in henry esmond be to one of most real of illustrious henry a well of thackeray character reality be of rather different kind from of most of fellow be somewhat more abstract more typical more generalized than reality of english hero usually be be not in least shadowy allegoric still be somehow esmondity a well a esmond melancholy rather than melancholy clearsighted aloofminded man heart head act to other a governing power passion humour have be sketched a acting above be man never likely to be very successful famous fortunate in world not what be generally called happy man yet enjoying constant glow glimmer of cloudy happiness must hardly exchange for other light late professor masson posture monger man of megrim one of genial temper steady sense described thackeray a man apart so be marquis of esmond yet thackeray be very real man so be marquis too illustration onslow square brompton where thackeray lived from to element of abstraction disappears rather retires into background when pas to beatrix also have ewigweibliche in a much of a almost of shakespeare woman therefore more than anybody else be very much more than type be beatrix esmond in flesh blood damask diamond born for destruction of mankind fortunately for delight of of a well beatrix be beyond eulogy cease cease to sing praise be really only motto though perhaps something more may be said when come to terrible pendant only thackeray have have courage skill to draw with truth without disgusting result if have died when esmond close doubt whether in wood of fair lady even cleopatra must have dared to summon to side lest comparison must not be favourable enough to herself throne have to be shared a usual with thackeray must not look to hero heroine too exclusively even when there be such heroine a for be there not here heroine cause of dubiety of doctor fidelis a above cited a to that may perhaps be pointed out to extreme sentimentalist that after harry have be in love with mother a well a with daughter all along if consider aggravation can not be helped except from extreme point of view of miss marianne dashwood in earlier stage ought rather to be considered palliative if say further that thing be made worse still by fact that harry be rachel second love that did not exactly wait to be widow before fell in love with why there be again nothing for to confess that be very shocking excessively human indeed fact be that rachel be a human a beatrix though in different way may not only love le in different sense of contrast from of roman poet like little le can not if have knowledge of human nature call unnatural really know that third lady of family isabel marchioness of esmond though there be le written about be not a real almost a wonderful a other two be not so fairly treated however poor thing for have bernstein period without beatrix one a for lord castlewood thomas francis pere et fils creator have not taken so much trouble with be never out least of piece think be rachel too fortunate too unfortunate husband people who regard ibsen great triumph in doll house a consisting in conduct of husband a to incriminating document ought to admire thackeray management of temporary loss of rachel beauty be certainly touch of baser side of human nature ingeniously worked in question be what in wonderful book be not ingeniously worked in character incident description speech if champion of unity be wise must take esmond a battle horse for be certain that great a be part whole be greater than almost one of be certainly not case with pendennis be further certain that of part personage of hero heroine stand out commandingly be certainly not case with pendennis again unity however be of peculiar kind differs from ordinary non classical unity of interest thackeray almost invariably exhibit be rather unity of temper be also present a pervading motto vanitas vanitatum almost necessitates in book here reach transcendence not elsewhere attained brooding spirit of ecclesiastes here cover a be with shadow of one of wing joy sorrow failure success of private family friend with other fate of england europe fortune of marlborough of swift on way from dictatorship in case to dotage death big war notable literary triumph a well a hopeless passion acquiescent loss be thus instance greatest of revival of historical novel be taking place in novel of scott simpler though not so very simple a be sometimes thought be being dashed with far heavier dose of novel element a opposed to romance yet without abandonment of romance quality proper of novel romance scene a may be called famous mock duel at end be of course greatest that where duke of hamilton have to acknowledge marquis of esmond where beatrix give kiss of beatrix be almost a great there be many others be possible that very transcendence account to extent for somewhat lukewarm admiration have received usual devotee of novel of analysis dislike historic have taught to consider childish common lover of romance not better kind feel hampered by character study a emile de girardin subscriber felt hampered by gautier style happier who can make best of dispensation nothing however have yet be said of one of most salient characteristic of esmond one perhaps have have a much to do with love of lover qualified esteem of who quite love a anything else be of course attempt certainly very audacious one at once to give very form pressure of time of story sometimes in actual diction yet to suffuse with modern thought colour most certainly be not of time boldness peril of attempt be quite indisputable peril be in way double there be malcontent who will say may be very fine like bother tease want to be talked to in language of addison steele there will be possibly le ingenuous more obtrusive malcontent who will say that ought never to have be done that be not a be done well with first who probably exists in squadron gross band argument be of course impossible may be taught better if be caught young be certainly last thing that honest lover of literature must wish must be to make say that like thing when doe not may be left to who preach follow fashion of moment perhaps be there very much to do with who say that double attempt be not successful except to disable judgement a for doctrine that attempt deserves to fail must fail that be wrong in there one may take up cudgel with confidence so far from there being anything illegitimate in attempt to bring one period before eye of in habit a lived speaking a spoke to allow eye to move a move see a see be merely triumph justification of whole method of prose fiction in general of historical novel in particular for historical novel be result of growth of historic sense acting upon demand for fiction so long a people made attempt to understand thing thought different from around within so long a like men of middle age blandly threw everything into own image like of renaissance to extent augustan period still more regarded other age at worst with contempt at best with indulgence a childish historical novel must not come into being did not only became possible when history began to be seriously studied a something more than chronicle of external event when have thus be made possible be perfectly legitimate experiment to carry process still further not merely to discus moralize to represent period a be without forfeiting privilege of regarding from point of view have not reached process of thackeray be really only unfolding carrying further into application of method of shakespeare partly date partly genius partly dramatic necessity obliged shakespeare to combine treatment to make godlike roman at once roman elizabethan men of time men of time at thackeray with convenience of novel demand of audience dichotomizes presentation while observing certain unity in fictitious person now of henry esmond now of william makepeace thackeray if anybody doe not like result there be nothing to be said there be who regard a one of furthest exploration that yet posse of human genius one of most extraordinary achievement of higher imagination coleridge liked to call esenoplastic that man must have faculty of reproducing contemporary general life be wonderful that must have faculty of reproducing past life be wonderful still more that must thus revive past preserve present command provide at once theatre company audience performance be highest wizardry of a seems to be what thackeray have attempted more what have done in history of henry esmond must not have done without pain to refers in saying quoted above pain a usual bore fruit more than once have be thought desirable to include in present volume two main after crop english humourist four george exactly how early thackeray attention be drawn to eighteenth century must in necessarily incomplete state of biographical information about be very difficult to say have pointed out that connexion be pretty well established a early a catherine be evidently founded upon peculiar congeniality freshened enlivened with proper dose of difference be most certain source purest maintainer of love in life literature at same time two set of lecture be differentiated from novel not so much by form for thackeray a lecturer have very little that smacked of platform a novelist have great deal that smacked of satiric conversation scene a by purport esmond though partly critical be mainly in far greater part creative lecture though partly creative resurrective at rate be professedly substantially critical now good deal have be said already of thackeray quality defect a critic have be pointed out that in consequence of peculiar impulsiveness strong like dislike satiric romantic temperament perhaps certain deficiency in round literary historical learning critical light be apt to be rather uncertain critical deduction by mean thing from there must be appeal english humourist be by far most important place for criticism in literary department four george with book of snob to extent supplementing be chief place for criticism of society personality like moreover have be be violently attacked by who like so that for more reason than one two work deserve faithful critical handling be always best to disperse maleger myrmidon before exploring beauty of house of alma so may take objection to humourist first be chiefly concerned with handling of swift in le degree of sterne now be quite certain that have here in first case at rate to confess though by mean to avoid be instance of excessive taking side with against character have be noticed will be noticed again again be reason of in least difficult to perceive be very doubtful whether thackeray own estimate of average humanity be much higher than swift be quite certain that affection swift professed from more than one instance seems to have really felt for dick tom harry in particular a opposed to mankind at large be very much le sincere than thackeray own for individual temperament of one deepened aggravated general understanding of mankind into furious misanthropy while temperament of other softened into general pardon in same way swift very love friendship be dangerous harsh faced while thackeray be sunny caressing there can be very little doubt that thackeray when shadow of vanity be heaviest on felt danger of actual misanthropy thus revolted from victim with kind of terror while nature must not help feeling similar revulsion from swift harsh way to revulsion give undue force of expression need not be denied then must be remembered that doe not allow to affect literary judgement believe that one now living have greater admiration for swift than have can say be that know estimate of genius anywhere more adequate than thackeray a for sterne intend to say much if will thrust personality into literature a sterne constantly doe must take chance of personality a well a of literature practically expose to judgement of public if anybody chooses to take up cudgel for sterne personality will hand over to take part on one side in bout to genius once more think thackeray at unjust fact be however that a be usual with person of genius even more than a usual defect quality be so intimately connected that can not have one without other must pay price of other for one can say be such live piece of english criticism of english literature a know anywhere what be alive be very seldom perfect to get perfection must go to epitaph once more though must pick plenty of small hole in detail of actual critical dictum know picture of division of literature here concerned from fairly intelligent person will derive better impression of fact than from addison may be little depressed steele little exalted be necessary to remember that by macaulay whose estimate then practically held field steele have be most unduly depressed addison rather unduly exalted may go about among critic on brightest day with largest lantern find nothing more brilliant than congreve article where spice of injustice will again deceive nobody fool vividness of addison steele presentation be miraculous redress johnson on prior a have redressed macaulay on steele be not unjust a might have feared that must be to pope hogarth smollett fielding be miracle of appreciation must like to ask objector to sentimentality by what other mean than intense sympathy from be impossible to exclude something may be called sentimental study a of goldsmith must have be produced now goldsmith be one of most difficult person in whole range of literature to treat from motley of merit weakness yet thackeray have achieved adventure here in short throughout book be invaluable a critic if not impeccable in criticism fault cause of be obvious separable negligible merit chief of a usual constant shower of happy illuminative phrase a rare in quality a be abundant in quantity lecture on english humourist must have be composed very much pari passu with esmond be being delivered while be being finished be published just a author be setting off to re deliver in america four george be not regularly taken in hand till year later when newcomes be finished finishing when fresh material be wanted for second american trip there exists very remarkable scenario of a may be almost called full decade older in shape of satura of verse prose contributed to punch on october have accordingly be kept back from original associate to be inserted here thing considered give line be followed in later lecture with remarkable precision be not at improbable that thackeray actually though not of necessity consciously took for head note book of have be so violently attacked at time of appearance since for a reader must have seen long ago present writer though proud to be called thackerayan stalwart be not thackerayan know nothing thackeray right wrong man be there expose more to attack from strictly literary side indeed have advantage of book of snob for be nowhere unequal exhibit author unmatched power of historical artistic imagination reconstruction in almost highest degree possible in other respect certainly doe show omission to erect sconce on drumsnab there be have already be hinted at in connexion with eastern journey curious innocence about thackeray may be that like hind feared danger for knew sin absence of fear with implied apparent ignoring of danger be danger in nobody who have even passed responsions in study of literary moral character will suspect for one moment of having pandered to american prejudice by prating to a tit bit primeur scandal about that king george be quite evident from first ought to have be evident to author long beforehand that enemy might think must say so in fact putting consideration of mere expediency aside think that have much better not have done a for justice of general verdict be doubt affected throughout by thackeray political incapacity side might have taken by quaint theoretical republicanism with good deal of pure toryism mixed attribute to of character doubt in kind of rather confused speculative way held certainly put george iii ability too low a certainly indulges in case of george iv in one of curious outburst hetze of unreasoning frantic stop thief mad dog persecution to be liable gorgius may not have be hero proper moral man be certainly most expensive herr by mean pattern husband recent by mean pharisaical exposition have exhibited wife a almost infinitely not better than must be allegation of treachery to private friend be on whole not proven if deserted whig be no more than of very whig very shortly afterwards did to country played difficult part of regent not very easy one of king by mean ill be by common even reluctant consent extremely pleasant host companion liked jane austen novel there have be good many prince good many demagogue too of whom a much good must not be said admitting excess in detail inconvenience in circumstance of original representation there remains a seems to more than sufficient balance to credit social historic sense accompanied with literary power of bodying forth result noticed a early a opening of catherine have in seventeen year interval fully marvellously matured picture be not mere mob of detail be orderly pageant of artistically composed material be possible be life like only question be rather minor one be be true minor say because artistic value must remain if historical be impaired think be will bow to authority of person better acquainted with eighteenth century than be if decade of familiarity with essayist novelist diarist letter writer may give one scanty locus standi will certainly give testimony in favour of thackeray extract true essence of life that exhibit in fiction from pamela joseph andrew down to pompey little spiritual quixote in essay from tatler to mirror in lord chesterfield lady mary horace walpole in pope young green churchill cowper in boswell wraxall in mr delany madame d'arblay seems to to deserve warrant of excise guarantee of analysis a lie in four little flaskets a have be done before let finish with almost silent indication of wonderful variety of volume also in one sense subject of constituent be same yet in be treated with widest most infinite difference one of three

consummate general in world before admirable commander on own side chose to neglect council to rush into combat with former must have ended in utter annihilation of army for great skill bravery of duke of vendosme who remedied a far a courage genius might disaster occasioned by squabble folly of kinsman legitimate prince of blood royal if duke of berwick have be in army fate of day must have be

commander in chief said knew how action be regarded by chief of french army that stand made before wynendael wood be passage by ally entered lille ah say holtz folk be very willing to listen to if king came by own how changed conduct of affair must be majesty very exile have advantage that be enabled to read england impartially to judge honestly of eminent men sister be always in hand of one greedy favourite through whose eye see to whose flattery dependant give away everything do suppose that majesty knowing england so well a doe must neglect such man a general webb ought to be in house of peer a lord lydiard enemy europe know merit be that very reputation certain great people who hate equality independence can never pardon be intended that conversation must be carried to mr webb be welcome to for great a service be man must value more than john richmond webb did difference between marlborough being notorious grace enemy in army at home began to court webb set up against grasping domineering chief soon after victory of oudenarde glorious opportunity fell into general webb way gallant warrior did not neglect gave mean of immensely increasing reputation at home after oudenarde against counsel of marlborough be said prince of savoy sat down before lille capital of french flanders commenced that siege most celebrated of time almost a famous a siege of troy for feat of valour performed in assault defence enmity of prince of savoy against french king be furious personal hate quite unlike calm hostility of great english general who be more moved by game of war than of billiards pushed forward squadron drove red battalion hither thither a calmly a must combine stroke make cannon with ball game over played so a to be pretty sure to win not least animosity against other party remained in breast of consummate tactician whereas between prince of savoy french be guerre mort beaten off in one quarter a have be at toulon in last year be back again on frontier of france assailing with indefatigable fury when prince came to army smouldering fire of war be lighted up burst out into flame phlegmatic dutch ally be made to advance at quick march calm duke forced into action prince be army in against french energy of hatred prodigious indefatigable infectious over hundred of thousand of men emperor general be repaying with vengeance slight french king have put upon fiery little abbe of savoy brilliant famous a leader beyond measure daring intrepid enabled to cope with almost best of famous men of war who commanded army of french king eugene have weapon equal of must not be found in france since cannon shot of sasbach laid low noble turenne must hurl marlborough at head of french host crush a with rock under gathered strength of strongest captain must go down english duke took little part in vast siege of lille imperial generalissimo pursued with force vigour further than to cover besieging line from duke of burgundy army between imperialist duke lay once when prince eugene be wounded duke took highness place in trench siege be with imperialist not with division under webb rantzau be detached into artois picardy upon most painful odious service mr esmond ever saw in course of military life wretched town of defenceless province whose young men have be drafted away into french army year after year insatiable war devoured be left at mercy order be to show none found place garrisoned by invalid child woman poor a be a cost of miserable war have made commission be to rob almost starving wretch to tear food out of granary strip of rag be expedition of rapine murder be sent on soldier did deed such a honest man must blush to remember brought back money provision in quantity to duke camp there have be no one to resist yet who dare to tell with what murder violence with what brutal cruelty outrage insult that ignoble booty have be ravished from innocent miserable victim of war meanwhile gallantly a operation before lille have be conducted ally have made little progress 't be said when returned to duke of marlborough camp that siege must never be brought to satisfactory end that prince of savoy must be forced to raise lord marlborough gave a opinion openly who mistrusted mr esmond owns to be of number hinted that duke have reason why lille must not be taken that be paid to end by french king if be so believe general webb have now remarkable opportunity of gratifying hatred of commander in chief of balking shameful avarice be one of basest most notorious quality of famous duke of showing own consummate skill a commander when consider circumstance preceding event will now be related that lord duke be actually offered certain million of crown provided that siege of lille must be raised that imperial army before be without provision ammunition must have decamped for supply that received that march of convoy destined to relieve siege be accurately known to french that force covering be shamefully inadequate to end by six time inferior to count de la mothe army be sent to intercept convoy when 't be certain that duke of berwick de la mothe chief be in constant correspondence with uncle english generalissimo believe on conscience that 't be lord marlborough intention to prevent supply of prince of savoy stood in absolute need from ever reaching highness that meant to sacrifice little army covered convoy to betray a have betrayed tollemache at brest a betrayed friend have to further own scheme of avarice ambition for miraculous victory esmond general won over army six seven time greater than own siege of lille must have be raised must be remembered that gallant little force be under command of general whom marlborough hated that be furious with conqueror tried by most open shameless injustice afterwards to rob of credit of victory chapter xv general webb win battle of wynendael by besieger besieged of lille of most brilliant feat of valour be performed that ever illustrated war on french side whose gallantry be prodigious skill bravery of marshal boufflers actually eclipsing of conqueror prince of savoy may be mentioned that daring action of monsieur de luxembourg tournefort who with body of horse dragoon carried powder into town of besieged be in extreme want soldier bringing bag with forty pound of powder behind with perilous provision engaged own horse faced fire of foot brought out to meet though half of men be blown up in dreadful errand rode on part of got into town with succour of garrison be so much in want french officer monsieur du bois performed act equally daring perfectly successful duke great army lying at helchin covering siege being necessary for monsieur de vendosme to get news of condition of place captain du bois performed famous exploit not only passing through line of siege swimming afterwards le than seven moat ditch coming back same way swimming with letter in mouth by letter monsieur de boufflers said that must undertake to hold place till october that if one of convoy of ally must be intercepted must raise siege altogether such convoy a hath be said be now prepared at ostend about to march for siege on th september french too have news that be on way be composed of waggon containing ammunition of sort be escorted out of ostend by infantry horse at same time monsieur de la mothe quitted bruges having with five thirty battalion upwards of sixty squadron forty gun in pursuit of convoy major general webb have meanwhile made up force of twenty battalion three squadron of dragoon at turout whence moved to cover convoy pursue la mothe with whose advanced guard ours came up upon great plain of turout before little wood castle of wynendael behind convoy be marching a soon a came in sight of enemy advanced troop be halted with wood behind rest of force brought up a quickly a possible little body of horse being brought forward to opening of plain a general said to amuse enemy when monsieur la mothe came up found posted in two line in front of wood formed own army in battle facing ours in eight line four of infantry in front dragoon cavalry behind french began action a usual with cannonade lasted three hour when made attack advancing in twelve line four of foot four of horse upon allied troop in wood where be posted infantry behaved ill be ordered to charge with bayonet instead began to fire almost at very first discharge from men broke fled cavalry behaved better with alone who be three four time a numerous a whole force monsieur de la mothe might have won victory only two of battalion be shaken in least speedily rallied must repeated attack of french horse cause troop to budge inch from position in wood in general have placed after attacking for two hour french retired at night fall entirely foiled with loss have inflicted upon enemy be still three time stronger than must not be supposed that general must pursue m de la mothe do much more than hold ground about wood from frenchman have in vain attempted to dislodge la mothe retired behind forty gun cavalry protecting better than have be enabled to annoy meanwhile convoy be of more importance than little force safe passage of must have dropped to last man to accomplish marched away in perfect safety during action joyfully reached besieging camp before lille major general cadogan lord duke quartermaster general between whom mr webb there be love lost accompanied convoy joined mr webb with couple of hundred horse just a battle be over enemy in full retreat offered readily enough to charge with horse upon french a fell back force be too weak to inflict damage upon mr webb commanding a cadogan senior thought enough be done in holding ground before enemy might still have overwhelmed have engaged in open territory in securing safe passage of convoy accordingly horse brought up by cadogan did not draw sword only prevented by good countenance showed disposition french might have have to renew attack on attack coming at general cadogan drew off with squadron being bound for head quarter two general at parting grimly saluting other will be at roncq time enough to lick lord duke trencher at supper say mr webb own men lay out in wood of wynendael night general have supper in little castle there if be cadogan must have peerage for day work general webb said harry thou shouldst have regiment thou hast be reported in

behind lieutenant general made very low bow retired finished glass gazette in mr cardonnel duke secretary gave account of victory of wynendael mentioned mr webb name gave sole praise conduct of action to duke favourite mr cadogan there be little talk excitement occasioned by strange behaviour of general webb who have almost drawn sword upon commander in chief general after first outbreak of anger mastered outwardly altogether by subsequent behaviour have satisfaction of even more angering commander in chief than must have done by public exhibition of resentment on returning to quarter consulting with chief adviser mr esmond who be now entirely in general confidence treated by a friend almost son mr webb writ letter to grace commander in chief in said grace must be aware that sudden perusal of london gazette in grace secretary mr cardonnel hath mentioned major general cadogan name a officer commanding in late action of wynendael must have caused feeling of anything pleasure to

one be not likely to get namely truth officer in staff of webb in immediate suite of general be ready to come to blow hence arose only affair in mr esmond ever engaged a principal be from revengeful wish to wipe off old injury lord mohun who have troop in lord macclesfield regiment of horse guard rode campaign with duke have sunk by time to very worst reputation have have fatal duel in spain have married forsaken wife be gambler profligate debauchee joined just before oudenarde a esmond feared a soon a frank castlewood heard of arrival frank be for seeking out killing wound lord got at

at until after several health when lord mohun got to be rather in liquor will go away lord mr esmond said to imploring to quit table by g say lord mohun will not go away for man be quite flushed with wine by time talk got round to affair of yesterday webb have offered to challenge commander in chief webb have be ill used webb be bravest handsomest vainest man in army lord mohun did not know that esmond be webb aide de camp began to tell story against general from t'other side of esmond young castlewood contradicted ca bear more of say lord mohun can lord say mr esmond starting up story lord

unjust treatment of general webb applauded vote of thanks house of common gave to general for victory at wynendael 't be certain that capture of lille be consequence of lucky achievement humiliation of old french king who be said to suffer more at loss of great city than from of former victory troop have won over think small part of mr webb exultation at victory arose from idea that marlborough have be disappointed of great bribe french king have promised must siege be raised very sum of money offered to be mentioned by duke enemy honest mr webb chuckled at notion not only of beating french of beating marlborough too intercepting convoy of three million of french crown be on way to generalissimo insatiable pocket when general lady went to queen drawing room tory woman crowded round with
