seemed to infer hayes be at once careful of money warm admirer of mr catherine of bugle charge be perfectly true hayes father be reported to be man of substance young john who be performing

be much more decided be poor weak creature not to compare with honest thomas bullock by at least nine inch so notoriously timid selfish stingy that there be kind of shame in receiving address openly what encouragement mr catherine gave must only be in secret mortal be wise at time fact be that hayes who cared for intensely have set heart upon winning catherine loved with desperate greedy eagerness desire of possession make passion for woman often so fierce unreasonable among very cold selfish men parent whose frugality have inherited have tried in vain to wean from passion have made many fruitless attempt to engage with woman who possessed money desired husband hayes be for wonder quite proof against attraction though quite ready to acknowledge absurdity of love for penniless alehouse servant girl nevertheless persisted in doggedly know be fool said what be more girl doe not care for marry must think will just die marry will for very much to credit of miss catherine

drink corporal proffered beer have better just read foregoing remark over again if doe not understand then why small praise to brain hayes must not bear that mr bullock must have chance of seeing perhaps making love to mr catherine in absence though young woman never diminished coquetry on contrary rather increased in presence be still kind of dismal satisfaction to be miserable in company on occasion disconsolate lover must be wretched to heart content for catherine have not word look for bestowed smile upon handsome stranger who owned black horse a for poor tummas bullock passion be never violent be content in present instance to sigh drink beer sighed drank sighed drank drank again until have swallowed so much of corporal liquor a to be induced to accept guinea from purse also
