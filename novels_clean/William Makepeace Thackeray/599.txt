management of own house have be narrated in former chapter how benevolent nobleman have given protegee money to pay off little debt to miss briggs who however still remained behind with friend whence lord came to painful conclusion that mr crawley have made other use of money confided to than for generous patron have given loan however lord steyne be not so rude a to impart suspicion upon head to mr becky whose feeling might be hurt by controversy on money question who might have thousand painful reason for disposing otherwise of lordship generous loan determined to satisfy of real state of case instituted necessary inquiry in most cautious delicate manner in first place took early opportunity of pumping miss briggs be not difficult operation very little encouragement must set that
