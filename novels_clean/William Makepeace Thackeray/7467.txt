much a shake of hand be yonder line drew with own pen barrier between hades a be across can see figure retreating only dimly glimmering before taking leave of mr arthur pendennis might not have told whether miss ethel married anybody finally be provoking that must retire to shade without answering that sentimental question though have disappeared a irrevocably a eurydice minor question may settle major one above mentioned how must pendennis have got information about ethels going on at baden with lord kew unless have told somebodyher husband for instance who having made pendennis early confidant in amour gave whole story clive pendennis writes expressly be travelling abroad with wife who be that wife by most monstrous blunder mr pendennis killed lord farintoshs mother at one page brought to life again at rosey who be so lately consigned to kensal green be not surely with clive be travelling for then mr mackenzie must probably be with to live certainty tour must be by mean pleasant how must pendennis have got private letter etc that colonel kept in teak box clive inherited made over to friend belief then be that in fable land somewhere ethel clive be living most comfortably together that be immensely fond of little boy great deal happier now than must have be have married at first when took liking to other a young people that picture of j j of mr clive
