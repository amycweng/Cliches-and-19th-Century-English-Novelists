with spirit courage of approved soldier on occasion electoral highness have better luck than king of england who be with cousin in enemy camp have to run with at ignominious end of day with most consummate general in world before admirable commander on own side chose to neglect council to rush into combat with former must have ended in utter annihilation of army for great skill bravery of duke of vendosme who remedied a far a courage genius might disaster occasioned by squabble folly of kinsman legitimate prince of blood royal if duke of berwick have be in army fate of day must have be very different be that poor mr von holtz must say must have seen that hero of almanza be fit to measure sword with conqueror of blenheim business relative to exchange of prisoner be always going on be

king came by own how changed conduct of affair must be majesty very exile have advantage that be enabled to read england impartially to judge honestly of eminent men sister be always in hand of one greedy favorite through whose eye see to whose flattery dependant give away everything do suppose that majesty knowing england so well a doe must neglect such man a general webb ought to be in house of peer a lord lydiard enemy europe know merit be that very reputation certain great people who hate equality independence can never pardon be intended that conversation must be carried to mr webb be welcome to for great a service be man must value more than john richmond webb did difference between marlborough being notorious grace enemy in army at home began to court webb set up against grasping domineering chief soon after victory of oudenarde glorious opportunity fell into general webb way gallant warrior did not neglect gave mean of immensely increasing reputation at home after oudenarde against counsel of marlborough be said prince of savoy sat down before lille capital of french flanders commenced that siege most celebrated of time almost a famous a siege of troy for feat of valor performed in assault defence enmity of prince of savoy against french king be furious personal hate quite unlike calm hostility of great english general who be more moved by game of war than of billiards pushed forward squadron drove red battalion hither thither a calmly a must combine stroke make cannon with ball game over played so a to be pretty sure to win not least animosity against other party remained in breast of consummate tactician whereas between prince of savoy french be guerre mort beaten off in one quarter a have be at toulon in last year be back again on frontier of france assailing with indefatigable fury when prince came to army smouldering fire of war be lighted up burst out into flame phlegmatic dutch ally be made to advance at quick march calm duke forced into action prince be army in against french energy of hatred prodigious indefatigable infectious over hundred of thousand of men emperor general be repaying with vengeance slight french king have put upon fiery little abbe of savoy brilliant famous a leader beyond measure daring intrepid enabled to cope with almost best of famous men of war who commanded army of french king eugene have weapon equal of must not be found in france since cannon shot of sasbach laid low noble turenne must hurl marlborough at head of french host crush a with rock under gathered strength of strongest captain must go down english duke took little part in vast siege of lille imperial generalissimo pursued with force vigor further than to cover besieging line from duke of burgundy army between imperialist duke lay once when prince eugene be wounded duke took highness place in trench siege be with imperialist not with division under webb rantzau be detached into artois picardy upon most painful odious service mr esmond ever saw in course of military life wretched town of defenceless province whose young men have be drafted away into french army year after year insatiable war devoured be left at

rag be expedition of rapine murder be sent on soldier did deed such a honest man must blush to remember brought back money provision in quantity to duke camp there have be no one to resist yet who dare to tell with what murder violence with what brutal cruelty outrage insult that ignoble booty have be ravished from innocent miserable victim of war meanwhile gallantly a operation before lille have be conducted ally have made little progress 't be said when returned to duke of marlborough camp that siege must never be brought to satisfactory end that prince of savoy must be forced to raise lord marlborough gave a opinion openly who mistrusted mr esmond owns to be of number hinted that duke have reason why lille must not be taken that be paid to end by french king if be so believe general webb have now remarkable opportunity of gratifying hatred of commander in chief of balking shameful avarice be one of basest most notorious quality of famous duke of showing own consummate skill a commander when consider circumstance preceding event will now be related that lord duke be actually offered certain million of crown provided that siege of lille must be raised that imperial army before be without provision ammunition must have decamped for supply that received that march of convoy destined to relieve siege be accurately known to french that force covering be shamefully inadequate to end by six time inferior to count de la mothe army be sent to intercept convoy when 't be certain that duke of berwick de la mothe chief be in constant correspondence with uncle english generalissimo believe on conscience that 't be lord marlborough intention to prevent supply of prince of savoy stood in absolute need from ever reaching highness that meant to sacrifice little army covered convoy to betray a have betrayed tollemache at brest a have betrayed friend have to further own scheme of avarice ambition for miraculous victory esmond general won over army six seven time greater than own siege of lille must have be raised must be remembered that gallant little force be under command of general whom marlborough hated that be furious with conqueror tried by most open shameless injustice afterwards to rob of credit of victory chapter xv general webb win battle of wynendael by besieger besieged of lille of most brilliant feat of valor be performed that ever illustrated war on french side whose gallantry be prodigious skill bravery of marshal boufflers actually eclipsing of conqueror prince of savoy may be mentioned that daring action of monsieur de luxembourg tournefort who with body of horse dragoon carried powder into town of besieged be in extreme want soldier bringing bag with forty pound of powder behind with perilous provision engaged own horse faced fire of foot brought out to meet though half of men be blown up in dreadful errand rode on part of got into town with succor of garrison be so much in want french officer monsieur du bois performed act equally daring perfectly successful duke great army lying at helchin covering siege being necessary for m de vendosme to get news of condition of place captain dubois performed famous exploit not only passing through line of siege swimming afterwards le than seven moat ditch coming back same way swimming with letter in mouth by letter monsieur de boufflers said that must undertake to hold place till october that if one of convoy of ally must be intercepted must raise siege altogether such convoy a hath be said be now prepared at ostend about to march for siege on th september french too have news that be on way be composed of wagon containing ammunition of sort be escorted out of ostend by infantry horse at same time m de la mothe quitted bruges having with five thirty battalion upwards of sixty squadron forty gun in pursuit of convoy major general webb have meanwhile made up force of twenty battalion three squadron of dragoon at turout whence moved to cover convoy pursue la mothe with whose advanced guard ours came up upon great plain of turout before little wood castle of wynendael behind convoy be marching a soon a came in sight of enemy advanced troop be halted with wood behind rest of force brought up a quickly a possible little body of horse being brought forward to opening of plain a general said to amuse enemy when m de la mothe came up found posted in two line in front of wood formed own army in battle facing ours in eight line four of infantry in front dragoon cavalry behind french began action a usual with cannonade lasted three hour when made attack advancing in eight line four of foot four of horse upon allied troop in wood where be posted infantry behaved ill be ordered to charge with bayonet instead began to fire almost at very first discharge from men broke fled cavalry behaved better with alone who be three four time a numerous a whole force monsieur de la mothe might have won victory only two of battalion be shaken in least speedily rallied must repeated attack of french horse cause troop to budge inch from position in wood in general have placed after attacking for two hour french retired at entirely foiled with loss have inflicted upon enemy be still three time stronger than must not be supposed that general must pursue m de la mothe do much more than hold ground about wood from frenchman have in vain attempted to dislodge la mothe retired behind forty gun cavalry protecting better than have be enabled to annoy meanwhile convoy be of more importance than little force safe passage of must have
