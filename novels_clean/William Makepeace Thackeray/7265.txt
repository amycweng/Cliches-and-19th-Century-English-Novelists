of feeling in arthur whilst be changing unfaithful so humiliating acknowledging weakness poor girl sought for strength refuge in manner in have be accustomed to look for have done no wrong there be folk who suffer for fault ever so trifling a much a others whose stout conscience can walk under crime of almost weight poor laura chose to fancy that have acted in delicate juncture of life a very great criminal determined that have done pen great injury by withdrawing that love privately in mother hearing have bestowed upon that have be ungrateful to dead benefactress by ever allowing to think of of violating promise that considering own enormous crime ought to be very gentle in judging of others whose temptation be much greater very likely whose motif must not understand year back laura must have be indignant at idea that arthur must marry blanche high spirit must have risen a thought that from worldly motif must stoop to one so unworthy now when news be brought to of such chance intelligence be given to by old lady rockminster whose speech be a direct rapid a slap on face humbled girl winced little at blow bore meekly with desperate acquiescence have right to marry know great
