like blue red web over so laid hold of little bent of weed twisted round dabbled wrist tried to pray to virgin although have often be told be vanity then suddenly wiping eye beheld thing entirely changed vast broad wall of brown water nearly a high a mill rushed down with crest of foam from mountain seemed to fill up valley to swallow up tree whole host of animal fled before bird like volley of bullet flew by lost not moment in running away climbing rock hiding be base ungrateful nasty thing to do did almost without thinking if have staid to cry out what good must have done only to be swept away now a far a can remember thing out of so much horror must have peeped over summit of rock when head of deluge struck mill whether saw whether knew by more summary process such a outruns eye sometimes be more than dare presume to say whichever way learned be thus solid mass of water much bigger than mill burst on dashed to atom leaped off with spun away great wheel anyhow like hoop of

gold fever still be highly undesirable thing for man who be known to have money about to ride forth alone from san francisco even sacramento town having mentioned foreman martin in justice to ought to say that although entire loss from disaster amounted only to worn out waistcoat of value of about twenty cent vehemence in grumbling must only be equaled by lofty persistence by great activity in

life than for uncle sam to be put out dare even to think ill of yet did show how willow be theory of other sex men be so pleased to indulge in scarcely thing must be more ridiculous from first to last when calmly truly considered than firm belief power of reason must for time root out of uncle sam dearest of mankind to very kindest be positively low enough to believe in sad opinion of female race

took long time to believe that so fair just man ever must set such interpretation upon when became too plain that did so truly know not whether grief anger be uppermost in troubled heart chapter xvii hard soft before very long be manifest enough that mr gundry looked down upon miss sylvester with large contempt while raised opinion of judgment almost deprived of great relief relief of supposing that wished grandson to marry pennsylvania for although father with pig cattle low sort of hostelry kept must settle good pile of dollar upon have kept her at learnedest lady college even in san

with believe a good person doe that father be wholly innocent do tell who must have done instead somebody must have done seems clear yes replied mr shovelin with look of calm consideration somebody did undoubtedly that make difficulty of whole affair 'cui bono ' a lawyer say two person only must have have motive so far a wealth fortune go first most prominent father who of course must come into

handsome face grew hard have taken for nice young lady never much above freezing point have found boil over in moment be sorry to have grieved if have heard betsy bowen story seen tell perhaps must have allowed for sat down again having risen in warmth tried to quiet command by thinking of sad point only of there be plenty to make picture of like of have kept awake night knew by time from finding so much more of pity than real sympathy that men think woman may well be tear have right to even shadow of frown be own prerogative so when mr shovelin returned with bundle of paper have also vexed to judge by way in threw down spoke very mildly said be very sorry for display of violence that if knew must pardon pardoned in moment be going to tell dear miss castlewood continued gently that sudden idea must be dismissed for reason think will content in first place present lord castlewood be always have be exemplary man of great piety true gentleness in next place be invalid who can not

now yes quite calmly because never think of thing else only tell what really believe will keep most strictly to be sure will do that answered smiling not only from power of will dear also because have nothing to say at first be strongly inclined to believe knowing from certainty of father that universal opinion must be wrong that old lord have done for always have be of headstrong violent nature be sure will never re appear in whole of evidence went against little a think of evidence especially at inquest father behavior confirmed what be sworn to father knew that father have not made away with in moment of passion otherwise be not man to break prison fly trial must have said boldly be guiltless there be many thing can not explain can not help will face out condemn if like will suffer from own remembrance of father nature be not that certainly course must have taken have not atom of doubt about flight persistent dread of trial puzzle beyond imagination of life be perfectly reckless except at least for sake know that be mr shovelin replied a boy be wonderfully fearless a man with sweet wife lot of child might have begun to be otherwise when be gone only poor little baby left yes suppose be that forgive be looking back at who must dream that must ever even live without kith kin to care for life be saved by good woman who took away to wale when be poor little relic father must scarcely have seen to have mite left must have be almost mockery of happiness that motive must not have be strong enough to prevent man of proud honor from doing what honor at once demanded father must have returned surrendered a soon a heard of dear wife death if in balance there have be only yes mr shovelin perhaps must be never very much a counter balance yet father loved must have told of pledge exchanged for sake yes for sake with love wedded honor set to fight cold desolate repute did not say word about loved afterward of course man who have have seven child be not enthusiastic about baby there must have be larger motive when be only one left alive surely became valuable then can not have be cipher yes for long time must have be replied saturnian banker wish to disparage attraction when be fortnight old may have begun already to be irresistible excuse have led into light vein when speaking of most sad matter must blame self assertion for wish to convey to be belief that something wholly unknown to dark mystery of have inkling lie at bottom of terrible affair strange motive there must have be strong enough even to overcome ordinary sense of honor englishman pride in submitting to law may be consequence consider that 'flight from justice a be called of course by one condemned case ruined repute even for that must not have cared so much a for own sense of right though be very lively fellow a first remember full of trick joke so on in busy age be out of date be certain that always have stern sense of right one never know how love affair weakness about child may alter almost man firm conviction be that dear old school fellow george castlewood even with wife lovely child hanging altogether upon life not only must not have broken jail must calmly have given up body to be hanged pardon dear for putting so coarsely if there have not be something paramount to override even apparent honor what can have be have idea presume have none none said at once in answer to inquiring gaze be quite taken by surprise never even thought of such thing have always seemed to so natural that dear father being shamefully condemned because appearance be against nobody must enter into must for sake of wife child even of one child like depart banish emigrate a might call run away knowing that never must have fair trial be only straightforward good affectionate thing for to do can not see thing a men see must not expect of mr shovelin answered with kind rather too superior smile reminded little of dear uncle sam when listened to what in opinion be only female

knew to begin with used to be told how much wiser be not to interfere with thing to let by gones be by gones consider own self only advice never came home to case always seemed unworthy thing even to be listening to now saw reason to be glad for thanking people who advised letting go on to advise for if have listened to major hockin even uncle sam for part where must have be now why simply knowing more than a child knew feeling miserable about have now at least something to go upon enough for long time to occupy mind difficulty be to know what to do first what to resolve to leave undone at least to put off for present one of special desire have be to discover man mr goad who have frightened so about two year back be said to be lost in snow drift nobody like have ever be found to sorrow

caught made give to a be only natural having now have be quite prepared to go present at mean address ask what wanted for in america what must like to do with now taking care to have major close at hand else policeman well recommended now determined to wait little while if betsy bowen opinion must be at same a mine be to ask mr shovelin what thought about before doing thing might arouse set of idea quite opposite to mine so cause trouble afterward being unable to think better for time than to wait be talked to got major hockin to take back again to right number in european square here found mr strouss born betsy bowen ready eager to hear great deal more than have heard that day on other hand have many question arising from thing said to to required clear answer never must do for to suppose that because have known come into world must govern whole of course therein cost many word great deal of demeanor to teach good faithful a be must not be always under yet promised to take advice whenever agreed with own opinion pleased promised to offer always knowing how well must be received told lodger that might ring ring for did not mean to answer of bell if wanted thing must go fetch being german who be most docile of men in england whatever may be at home made complaint retired to pipe in pleasant condition of surprise at london habit mr strouss being from earliest year of thrifty reputable turn of mind have managed in large yet honest way to put by many thing must prove useful in long run if kept long enough did hear most careful a be to pay attention to petty rumor that first thing moved heart of herr strouss called forth finest feeling be winding up chair came out to make leg with pocket for tobacco flat place for glass be certainly paltry thought to think of such low thing grieved now when looked at mr strouss having heard of none of thing yet felt that nurse might not have done best yet might have done worse when married for seemed to have taken liking toward interest in affair redounded to credit if must not be too inquisitive now gladly allowed to be present to rest in chair have captivated although last night must scarcely have borne to have heard in presence what have to hear to night there be nothing distressful to be said compared at least with last night tale whereas there be several question to be put in of while scouting altogether uncle sam low estimate two female might with advantage perhaps obtain opinion from stronger sex now a soon a have told two friend a well a must what have happened at bank with be pleased a have be question arose be believe chiefly to following purport setting aside main puzzle of why did father say on dreadful morning that if father be dead have killed murdered betsy believed when came to think that have even used worse word of two how must fatal shot have be discharged from pistol a clearly have be pistol moreover by own account a betsy now remembered have left in quarter near chichester what be horrible disease have carried off poor little brother sister frightened kind neighbor servant away betsy said be called differeria a differing so much from other complaint have never yet heard of discovered without asking further than of mr strouss that meant that urgent mandate for levy of small angel be called on earth diphtheria who have directed private inquirer vypan goad terryer to send to far west member of firm to get legal proof of dear father death to bring back if possible present lord castlewood never must have done so according to what mr shovelin said be far more likely that for weak health must have come forth to seek upon probable tidings at once religious chivalrous man must never employ mean agency while thinking of thought occurred what have induced that low man goad to give uncle date wrong altogether for crime began misery have put at ten now twelve year back dated in november whereas have happened in september month six year two month before date gave question be out of answer to also to mr strouss herr strouss being of legal turn believed that law be to blame for thought that proceeding might be bound to begin under extradition act within ten year of date of crime there might be other stipulation compelling mr goad to add one to falsehood not knowing thing about of thought very likely again what must have be that last pledge passed between father mother when said good by to one perhaps knew that be forever so far a bodily world be concerned be thing about poor little sleeping whimpering creature like myself who must not yet make difference to living being except mother be concerning far more important thing justice clear honor good will duty such a in crush of time come upward with high nature if so be not promise from mother knowing thing to say nothing even at quivering moment of lying beneath point of death be new idea for betsy who have concluded from very first that pledge must be on father part to wit that have vowed not to surrender hurt in way for sake of dear wife to suggestion must only say that never have seen in light landing be so narrow wall so soft that with duty staring in face best servant ever in apron must be held responsible to repeat very word husband said that be good very good so good a ever must be what be to show now from mouth of one after fifteen sixteen eighteen year after have other word

not two foot down yet chapter xxxvi simple question now account of what jacob rigg have seen heard threw into state of mind extremely unsatisfactory to be in eager search of unknown person who have injured inexpressibly without longing for revenge on part simply with view to justice be very different thing from feeling that unknown person be in quest of with horrible purpose of destroying to insure own wicked safety at first almost thought that be welcome to do life a mine if looked at from outer point of view be better to be died than lived out also that there be nobody left to get good out of must do even if ever must succeed truth must come out of tomb too late began to make cry have long given over doing with one to feel for heart of thing of kind must not long endure a soon a sun

pail how ungrateful must be to forget pleasant copse in wave of deep green leafage flowing down up channeled hill waving at wind to tint tone of new refreshment tempting idle folk to come hear hush see twinkled texture of pellucid gloom much however a loved to sit in place of kind alone for little time feared to do so after hearing sexton tale for jacob terror be so unfeigned though own life have not be threatened that knowing a did from betsy account a well a own appearance that be not at nervous man must not help sharing vague alarm seemed so terrible that one must come to graf of sweet mother six harmless child instead of showing pity a even monster might have tried to do must stand if not with threatening gesture yet with most hostile mien thirst for life of only survivor poor self terrible not truth be so betsy must shake mr rigg conclusion indeed became more more emphatic in reply to doubt mild suggestion perhaps that eye have deceived perhaps that taking nap in corner of buttress have dreamed at least part of betsy on score of ancient friendship kind remembrance of liking put to in gentle way whether knowledge of what sally mock have be calumny might have spoken of beer when herself in work house deprived of might not have induced to take little more than usual in going down so deep for answered be nothing of sort deep have gone to tiptoe of fling not from feeling of wish to keep down just because parish paid parish must have measurement when be on never brought down more than quart tin from public never have none down afterward otherwise ground be so ticklish that man working too free might stay down there no that idea be like one of sally own just have quart of persfield ale short measure of course with woman at bar if be enough to make man dream dream sooner dug own grave better for connected with saw that have gone too far in thinking of possibility if mr rigg have not be large minded a well a notoriously sober betsy might have lost benefit of evidence by london bred clumsiness with for take quite different handling different mode of outset to get on with london working class laboring kind of country at least seemed to so now knowledge of jacob rigg be owing a might be supposed to betsy strouss who have taken lead of in almost thing ever since brought down from london now be glad that in one point at least judgment have overruled mine to wit that name parentage be a yet not generally known in village indeed only betsy jacob faithful old washer woman with roof to mouth be aware of a miss castlewood not that have taken other name to must not stoop because public of own accord paying attention to betsy style of addressing followed lead with little improvement be pleased to entitle miss raumur question have be raised a to spelling aright till man of advanced intelligence proved to many eye even several pair of spectacle assembled in front of blacksmith shop that other way must be right except for there be in print a one able might see on side of instrument whose name quality be even more mysterious than in debate therefore became miss raumur protest must have gone for nothing unless printed also did not behoove to go to expense while suited very well to be considered pitied a harmless foreigner being who on english land may find cause to doubt whether even in own country prophet must be le thought of large pity for a outlandish person in very spot where be born endowed with privilege of proudest native for native of valley be declared to be of different stock from around not of common wessex strain of jutish danish origin how may be know at rate think well of doubt have cause to do so moreover be very kind to primitive way amused a soon a have settled that be foreigner equally beyond below inquiry

have need according to congress at silver edged holly for praise knowledge of like to make talk among high people elder shook head a heard from mr rigg who hugged knowledge proudly uttered dim saying of wisdom let forth at large usury did not mind telling that old men shook head for fear of being deal too young long sight too well favored a man might tell without spec on for to write book upon subject yet leave alone old ancient town like theirs however there might be harm in trying perhaps school master must cross out bad language thus for once fortune now be giving good help enabling to go about freely preventing so far a must see at least danger of discovery by unknown foe so here resolved to keep head quarter dispensing if must be so with betsy presence not even having mr price to succeed unless cousin must insist upon partly to dissuade from partly to hear opinion of sexton tale paid flying visit to lord castlewood while madam straw a betsy now be called throughout village remained behind at shoxford for long have desired to know thing have not ventured to ask cousin though did ask mr shovelin whether father have intrusted with key of own mysterious act scarcely knew whether be proper even now to put question to lord castlewood even without doing so might get at answer by watching closely while told tale not letter have reached since came to shoxford have written except one to uncle sam keeping to excellent rule arrived at castlewood without notice in doing took liberty because full permission have be given about indeed have be expected there a stixon told day before added that master be about a usual have shown uneasiness on account though butler be in dark about felt very hard after year particular when must hardly help thinking that mr price new hand

with kindly warmth kissed gently on forehead dear how very well look said native air have agreed with be getting in quiet way rather sedulous self reproachful about must have own way like young american seems that be right be quite right answered with hearty kiss for never must be cold natured be only one of near kin so far at least a knowledge went be quite right in going have done good at rate have found out something something may not be of kind of use still make hope thing with in a few word a ever must use told lord castlewood whole of jacob tale particularly looking at while spoke to settle in own mind whether idea of such thing be new to concerning that however must make out nothing cousin at time of life after so much travelling have much too large share of mind long skill of experience for to make thing out of face beyond own intention whether have suspicion not of thing at like what be describing body having to do with be more than ever might have known if have not gathered up courage put question outright to told that if be wrong in asking be not to answer right wrong ask must question be natural not at improper replied lord castlewood standing moment for change of pain be relief indeed expected to ask that before erema have also have to ask about whether have right to answer have decided not to do so unless will pledge to one thing will pledge to thing answered rashly care what be if only to get at bottom of mystery scarcely think will hold good to word when hear what have to promise condition upon tell what believe to be cause of be that let thing remain a be keep silence forever about oh can not be so cruel so atrocious cried in bitter disappointment what good must be for to know thing thus let vile wrong continue surely be not bound to lay on condition so impossible after much consideration strong wish to have otherwise have concluded that be so bound in duty to father family what forgive for asking doe seem so hard seems hard dear be hard a well answered very gently yet showing in eye lip chance of yielding remember know only guess secret if give pledge speak of merely follow in father step never replied with a firm face a may have be father duty doubt thought so can not be mine unless make so by laying on honor will not do that perhaps be right at rate remember have not tried to persuade wish to do what be for happiness

difficult to answer justice honor nearly always go together when do otherwise honor stand foremost with people of good birth at least then will be person of very bad birth if come into conflict in life a almost thing seems to do first thought will be of justice honor will come in a ornament afterward erema said cousin meaning be good at time of life can scarcely be expected to take dispassionate view of thing at first felt almost a if must hate dispassionate view of thing thing be made to arouse passion so long a meanness villainy prevail if old men knowing balance of world can contemplate dispassionately more clearly than thing else to mind prof beauty of being young be sure that never be hot violent quality especially dislike still must rather almost have than be too philosophical now while revered father cousin for gentleness wisdom long suffering almost longed to fly back to major prejudiced peppery red hot for justice at rate in thing concerned chapter xxxvii answer to hasty indignation did not drive to hot action quiet talk with mr price a soon a cousin bad hour arrived be quite enough to bring back to sense of own misgovernment moreover evening cloud be

that have to tell stixon did never see that fearful man again did never even hear of never miss never to nobody have ever told all a told now seems to be born to hear chapter xxxviii witch be true enough that stixon now have nothing more to tell what have told already seemed of very great importance confirming strongly a did description given by jacob rigg even butler concluding word seemed born to hear comforted like good omen cheered forward to make true not must in sad dangerous enterprise always be confident little spirit must have have resolve to be faithful according to power of very common mind admiring never claiming courage for never did feel in kind of way gift of inspiration even fitness of quick strong mind for working out deed of justice there be many good lady in america then now there be in england perceiving so clearly own superiority a to run about largely proclaiming how often longed to be little more like equal to men in achievement of body very far beyond in question of mind however be useless to regret lack foolish perhaps to think of to do very best with what little gift have be more to purpose more sensible taking in lonely perplexity now dim yet exciting view of thing resolved right wrong to abide at place where only chance be of pursuing search be pledged a perhaps have be said before to keep from one excepting faithful betsy above from lord castlewood unexpected little tale wrung out of mr stixon promise have be given without thought in eagerness to hear thing probably people must have thought of more trusty butler be so scared when asked to release from so penitent also at own indiscretion never must have overcome a said in morning only for thunder storm that instead of getting off be quite obliged to renew confirm assurance therefore in truth have chance left to go back to shoxford do best meeting dark peril with shield of right spread over great thing now in favor be to feel confidence again in guidance of kind wisdom

whether suspicion must help at to identify figure have frightened sexton butler that person be one same did not for moment call in question more than doubted that be man upon whose head rested blood of why must be allowed to go scot free while bore brand many others died for why most just righteous effort to discover must receive if not discouragement at rate most lukewarm aid several other question be a dark a ever must not return to shoxford cousin lord castlewood said to that day after plain though courteous refusal to enlighten even with mere surmise except upon condition before rejected can not allow to be there without strict supervision protection will not perhaps be aware of a perhaps have not be before careful watch will be kept on merely tell that may not make mistake confound friendly vigilance with spying of enemy erema will be looked after must not help being grateful for kindness really try a might to be fearless must be great comfort to have one to protect on

now will be said also knew that there be nothing a yet except most frail feeble evidence to connect nameless stranger with crime charged upon father indeed might be argued well that there be evidence at only inference suspicion that however be fault of mine felt a sure about a if have seen in very act conclusion be not mine alone for mr busk most clever woman one who kept post office entirely agreed with that there must be doubt on earth about when went on to ask what be intention to do next for moment must hing more than inquire what opinion be told that must have good night rest before advising thing for thought of having such heinous character in own delivery district be enough to unhinge from postal duty of might be useful to with significant glance left to own thought be sad enough too sad to be worth recording for mr busk have not art of rousing people cheering such a betsy strouss old nurse have perhaps from knowledge of nursery present landlady might be more sagacious sensible woman of two therefore better adviser for keeping one up to mark be not in way equal to betsy there be ingratitude in saying because admitted clever woman with well balanced mind know what can do wherein fails better than man of own proportion doe mr busk often lamented without much real mortification that have not be born sympathetic more perhaps for be born sagacious be le pleasing in bitter pinch more really useful quality before have time to think much of defect in crowd of more important thought in came again with letter in hand sparkle of triumph in small black eye after looking back along passage closing door saw that little bay window have old fashioned shutter fastened then in very low whisper said what want to know be here miss indeed answered in usual voice how can know that letter be sealed hush must have ruined for sake be at bottom of nepheton bag fell on floor be god will to place in power be not in power answered whispering in turn staring at in strong

private right deterrent honor lay undermost letter be directed to h w c post office newport sussex writing be in round hand clear so a not to demand scrutiny to seem like of lawyer clerk envelope be of thin repellent blue second impulse be to break letter open read without shrinking public duty must conquer private scruple nothing hand of providence must have placed deadly secret in power so amazingly away with squeamishness perhaps prevent more murder that perhaps gave sudden pause have caught up letter stood near candle to soften wax lift cover with small sharp paper knife when flashed on mind that cousin must condemn scorn what be doing unconsciously must have made now standard of human judgment what made think of at moment threw down letter then knew image of lord castlewood have crossed mind because initial be own of herbert william castlewood strange coincidence if be indeed accident once more set thinking might not letter be from agent of whom have spoken a protector here to whom a unseen scarcely ever gave thought might not young stixon who so often be at bruntsea be employed to call at newport for such letter return with to master be not very likely for cousin have strongest contempt of anonymous doings still be possible bare possibility doubled reluctance to break seal for one minute longer stood in doubt then honor candor truth prevailed if other life have be in peril own duty to might have overridden duty to one self if overpushed in such case must hold taint of cowardice so threw letter with sense of loathing on chair might contain must pas at least for inviolate now when mr busk came to see what have done rather left undone flew into towering passion until have time to go on with rattle of rickety old mail cart on way to winchester night be heard horn of driver a passed church give ' mercy young natural that be good woman cried a flung out of room to dash office stamp upon hateful missive to seal leathern bag seal indeed inviolate how many seal have got to make day of life heard great thump from corner of shop where business of mail be conducted told afterward be so put out that broken that seal must be one way accordingly smashed with office stamp be rather like woman act methought then having broken never looked inside perhaps be even more so when recovered leisure serenity came in to forgive be forgiven resolved to dismiss moral aspect of question a never must agree about although mr busk be not so certain a have be when found that initial be initial of lord then asked how came to fix upon letter among so many others to feel so sure that came from treacherous enemy in first place know letter from nepheton answered very sensibly there be only fourteen people that write letter in place twelve of fourteen buy paper in shop

hesitation promised that thing must do must be done if must only tell wanted perhaps must be better to have talk outside taking hint followed back to bench in open garden there explained what wished to have done longer concealed true reason good miller answered that with heart must do that much to oblige hundred time more than little thought care be needful with river so low a be now must easily stop back water receive whole of current in dam keep from flowing down wheel trough thus dry lower channel for perhaps hour must be ample for purpose engineering difficulty there be none two three other thing must be heeded miller sims mile so down river must be settled with to fill dam well begin to discharge when upper water failed so a not to dry moon down valley must have caused commotion miller sims being own brother in law to master withypool must be arranged easily enough after one day notice harder thing to manage must be to do business without rousing curiosity setting abroad rumor must be sure to reach enemy hardest thing of said master withypool smiling a thought of what have once be must be to keep blessed boy away who find out thing go where not boy of shoxford must be in river dancing upon empty bed screeching scolloping up into cap poor bewildered trout chased into puddle if be allowed to leak out however feebly that moon water be to stop running then how be to seek for thing be puzzle with counsel did solve quietly stopped moon without man boy being much wiser chapter xliii going to bottom be not needful to explain thing more than be for to tell miller about golden eagle how have managed to lose in moon trick of now be heartily ashamed in face of honest kindness so need not tell how master withypool managed to settle with men to keep boy unwitting of what be about to come to pas enough that got note from to tell that little river must be run out just when shoxford be intent upon dinner on second day after have seen must not say for certain thought pretty safe that nobody must come near if managed to be there at quarter before one when stream must begin to run dry must watch sent back line by pretty little girl sister of poor polly to say how much thanked how much hoped that must meet there if time allowed for have be too delicate to say word of felt that have good right to be there knowing now be not afraid nearly thing came about a well a must be wished almost master withypool took precaution early in morning to set great fierce bull at large who always stopped foot path bull knew well power of valley in conducting sound loved to stand a if at mouth of funnel roar down to bull mile below belonging to master brother in law when did there be scarcely boy much le man woman with desire to assert against public right of thoroughfare throughout forenoon then bull bellowed nobly still finding many very wicked fly about so that two mitching boy who meant to fish for minnow with pin be obliged to run away again however be in dark about a much afraid of a body when broke into sight of round corner without token of amity have seen great many great bull before including uncle sam good black one who might not have meant mischief at atoned for if did by being washed away so therefore courage soon returned when became quite clear that animal now have be fastened with rope must come nearer for little time then waited alone a near bridge a must bring to stand for mr busk landlady must not leave house yet on account of mid day letter moreover thought that have better stay away a object be to do thing a quietly a must be much a have watched bridge from distance from sheltering place have never be able to bring to make kind of sketch of even to insert in landscape although be very well suited expressive from crooked antique simplicity overhanging also of hawthorn tree not ruddy yet russety with coloring crop of coral shaggy freak of ivy above twisted trunk curve of meadow bold elbow of brook be such a artist must have pitched tent for tantalized poor london people with dream of cool repose a yet little river showed sign of doing what rustic surely must have be cockney be supposed to stand still wait for there be great rush of headlong water for be not manner of stream in very worst of weather there be usual style of coming on with lip step at side cord of running toward middle quite enough at rate to make trout jump without omen of impending drought to keep play sway of movement going on serenely began to be afraid that miller must have failed in stratagem against water god that a have read in pope homer liquid deity must beat hero when of sudden there be sign that man be master of little rustic broadsword of flag rapier of water grass have be quivering merrily began to hang down to dip in loop stone of brink showed dark green stripe on side a stood naked then fine little cake of conglomerated stuff only great man of nature must describe came floating about curdling into corner holding on to one in long tailed string might do what liked make very best of a fell away to nothing upon stone mud for now more important thing began to open like of never have be yielded up before plot of slimy gravel varied with long streak of yellow mud dotted with large double shell parted into little oozy run by wriggling water weed here be great commotion sad panic of fish large fellow splashing quite jumping out of water a favorite hovers shelf ran dry darting away with poor back in air to deepest hole must think of hundred must have come to flour lard butter if boy have be there to take advantage luckily thing have be done so well that boy be now in least injurious moment destroying nothing worse than own dinner very little way below old wooden bridge little river ran into deepish pool a generally happens at near corner especially where there be confluence sometimes seeing nothing a began to search intently stirring with long handled spud have brought concluded that even golden eagle have be carried into deep place however water water resolved to have out with dark pool a soon a rest of channel must be drained took tormenting time to do having thick boot on pinned up skirt jumping down into shoal began to paddle in fashion reminded of childish day passed pleasantly in blue river too busy thus to give thought to other thing did not even see miller until said good day miss lifting hat with nice kind smile very busy miss see right be to be so water will be upon again in le than hour now let clear away black weed for brought little shivel purpose if may make so bold miss what do ' e look to find here have not very smallest notion must only answer if there be thing must be in hole have searched willow part so closely that doubt whether even sixpence must escape unless be buried in mud pebble oh how can manage to search hole there must be yard of water there one thing ought to have told e for to do master withypool whispered a went on shoveling to do what boy do when lose farden to send after un if so be now afore water be run out have stood on that there bridge dropped bright coin into new half crown two shilling piece why chance must be that run of current must ' taken nigh to likeliest spot for holding other little matter a might ' dropped permiskous might say into same water have done so answered have done very thing though not at with object day before yesterday beautiful coin golden eagle of america fell from pocket on upper plank rolled into water must not lose for great deal because be given to by dearest friend greatest of miller have' found yet miss well be queer perhaps will find now with something to back of thought yon hole be too far below bridge there gold must be something else most likely plaise to wait little bit will have wet out of un never must ' thought of for gold guinea though with word master withypool pulled coat off rolled up shirt sleeve displaying arm fit to hold own even with uncle sam almost then fell to with shovel dug while ran with little spud to help plaise keep out of way miss be afeard of knocking not what work very brave indeed miss knowing what men be concerning female effort got out of strong man way although there be plenty of room for what wanted to do be plain enough to dig trench down empty bed of moon river deep enough to drain pit before stream came down again never thought to run race against own old dam said a stopped for moment to recover breath never know what may have to do old dam must be abeost busting now be sound enough till beginneth to run over did not say word because might have done mischief must not help looking rather anxiously up stream for fear of water coming down with rush a very soon must do master withypool have be working not a must have done from lip of dark pit downward from steep run twenty yard below where there be almost little cascade when river be full flowing from have made channel upward cutting deeper a came along till now at brink of obstinate pool trench be two foot deep almost have idea that man must work so with shovel seems clumsy tool compared with spade gentleman who know country people told that with native weapon moonites will do a much digging in hour a other folk get through in hour half with spade may be only perhaps because be working harder now said master withypool at last standing up with very red face desiring to keep unheeded now miss to belongeth to tap here little cornder if desirable plaise to excoose of going up of bank to tell ' e when wet cometh down again please to hing of sort answered knowing that offered to stand out of sight from delicate dread of intrusion please to tap pool stay here a witness of what find in a plaise miss a plaise not moment for to lose in arguing harken now water be atopping of dam will be here in five minute with three four rapid turn of shovel spun almost a fast a house maid spin mop fetched out plug of earth severing channel from deep reluctant hole then saw wisdom of way of working for if have dug downward from pool water must have followed way even drowned tool out of own stroke whereas now with swirl curl of ropy mud away rushed thick sluggish obstinate fluid in le than two minute hole be almost dry first thing saw be golden eagle lodged about way down slope on crust of black sludge from caught up presented to master withypool a small token record of kindness to day carry upon sunday watch chain always be lucky in finding thing exclaimed while watched up stream too whence babble of water be approaching a sure a

for purpose fixing blade of shovel below little blue line be peering at so that slip of soft yellow slush must bury down plunge over if have once happened good by to chance of ever beholding thing again for river be coming with fury foam to assert ancient right of way with short laugh miller jumped down into pit to be served so by own mill stream lor ' if pay out for righteous wrath failed to stop water from pouring into pit behind strong a be nearly lost footing having only mud to stand upon seemed to that be going to be drowned offered handle of spud to help stopped where be be not going to be hurried got un now said now mind coming out see if pay out for why always took for reasonable hanimal shook fist strongly at river have well up to middle by time then disdainfully waded out with wrath in countenance have great mind to stop there see what must do said to forgetting altogether what went for must if have have dinner scat of thing a can manage with thumb ah have made bad day of

handsome locket of blue enamel diamond with back of chased gold in front miniature of beautiful young woman done a never seem to do now work be so good fitting so close that drop of water have entered

sorrow miller said a much when showed to lord bless heart hope poor craitur ' hath lasted half so long a pictur ' hath chapter xliv hermetically sealed discovery have described above not so well a miller tell now created in young heart feeling of really strong curiosity to begin with how must valuable thing have got into moon stream lain there so long unsought for at best so unskillfully sought for what connection must have with tragic death of grandfather why be man so tardily come to search for if might do so without body near again what woman be whose beauty water mud must even manage to disguise last be most disturbing question to one bodily peace of mind then came yet more urgent what be in inside of tight case that there be something inside of seemed almost certainty mere value of trinket even fear that ever might turn up a evidence must scarcely have brought man so often to stir suspicion by seeking though after so long time well might hope that suspicion be dead buried being unable to open case after breaking three good nail over then point of penknife turned to master withypool who be stamping on grass to drain what sort of man be that asked who wanted to do what now have so kindly done for about month six week ago do please to tell a nearly a can if mr withypool have be there might have lost patience with for putting long question so selfishly to man who have done so much for whose clothes be now dripping in wind have arisen to test theory of drying must have lost large quantity of what scientific people call caloric never shiver gave in exchange well miss said be thinking abeost of speaking on very matter more particular since found that little thing with pretty lady inside of be borne in on mind that thissom be very thing be arter doubt of answered with far le patience though being comparatively dry what be like be like portrait picture of lady ca say that be so much face of big man hath with short black fringe to never showeth to idea likeliness of woman miss think not at that have got in blue thing though of picture be like men way dress up nowadays did not mean that be meant for what mean be do see sign of family likeness

do believe more look more diskivers image of good kind miller perception of likeness strengthened almost too fast a if wish be father to thought until saw clearly how selfish be in keeping in state so long for knew from what mr busk have told that in spite of large grand old english sentiment about clothes wife must make change ere ever gave bit of dinner must force then to take glass of something hot so gave thousand thanks though not thousandth part of what deserved saw well on homeward way before went back to consider thing a soon a landlady be at leisure to come in talk with a soon a have told how thing happened shown discovery of did very same thing said almost very same word act be with finger nail eye to rime into jot of word be be sure there be something inside if not must open sensibly in most senseless obstinate manner refused not only to open to disclose thing at about whether ever have be meant to open if so where by what mean whether without gift of opening might have hidden thing inside whether when opened by force skill might show something have business with must be far worse nothing at good mr busk tested tapped felt blew listened tried possible overture became at last quite put out with be of piece with villain owned postmistress exclaimed at last there be penetrating most likely have made away with beautiful lady on cover kill one kill fifty have heard say

must shoot very first hour of wearing mere thought of make tremble oh why be ever born to do man work because miss man must not have done so well when saw that villain digging man must have rushed out spoiled chance now what man must have ever found must master withypool ever have emptied moon river for man do think must man have be down among time in jealous place without business being long ago sifted out scattered over miss must not talk like with a well to help rogue will have reason to wish do believe that have only got man to deal with in argument there be point have occurred to before certainly be comfort to have one own idea in doubtful matter reproduced perhaps put better by mind to one may have lent perhaps with loan unacknowledged however trouble teach care doe so well that master lesson in usage of word be now same therefore showed sign of being suggested with own suggestion only asked quietly what be to do dear young lady mr busk replied after stopping time to think of own opinion be for part that ought to consult somebody be mr busk be now consulting then think miss that precious case must be taken at once to jeweler who can open without doing damage be more than
