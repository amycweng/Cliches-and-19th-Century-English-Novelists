that one at of neighbourhood must hurt that there have be much talk about camp of dark skinned people in cowley marsh not long ago therefore laid palm flat from eyebrow to follow distance further seeing no more than hedge of lane now growing in cold wind naked track of lane from wet mud slaking into light coloured crustiness without figure sound shadow sense of life moving anywhere made for best side of cottage door brightened up firelight weather have be for few week in good constitutional english state be to say have settled tendency towards anything at rate so seemed to people who took little heed of there have be little rain then little snow touch of frost then sample of fog so on trying variety to suit british public true briton however have grumbled duly at successive overture so that winter be now resolving henceforth only to please determined will be in wind air earth just when night began to fall on dark day of december a esther turned corner from beckley lane into road broad coach road to oxford met wind knew mind coming over crest of shotover stern east wind whistled sadly over brown barren field bitterly piped in roadway to chill of blast sere oak leaf shivered in dusk rattled grey ash sapling bent naked length to get away from surly stub of hedge went to fro to one slimy dip of path began to rib like frond of fern to shrink into wrinkle sinewy knob while broader puddle though skirred by breeze found network of ice veiling over a crusted began to be capable of consistent quivering with frail infinitude of spikelet crossing yet carrying into one cold work marred now then by hurry of wind urged in main be going on so fast that face of water ceased to glisten instead of ruffling lifted instead of waving wavered so that a surface trembled level eye might see little splinter held a be rib harl of feather spreading rising like stem of lace then with smooth crisp jostle sinking a wind flew over into quavering consistence of coverlet of ice cripps took little heed of thing of other in matter of weather except to say to herself now then how bitter cold wind be that feared must turn to snow how longed to be sitting with cup of aunt exie caudle in snug room next to bakehouse how glad must be to get only a far a first house of st clement to see lamp light in shop be quit of dreary loneliness for now must be three market day since fearful rumour began to stir in several neighbouring village made even strong men discontent with solitude towards nightfall a for woman just now poor esther must rather not think of what declared be very well to pretend to doubt while hanging clothes out turning mangle a for laughing out here in dark mile away from nearest house good lord how white owl frightened being sensible brave girl forced mind a well a must into channel lifted cover of basket in have nice thing for aunt exie then set off for bold little run until be out of breath trembling at sound of own light foot for though crippses be known to be of firm resolute fibre who must expect young maid like to tramp on like roman sentinel lucky thing for be that tried nothing of sort glided along with heart in mouth short skirt tucked up round lucky also for that ground so little heeded so wanted to get over be in early stage of freezing of drying to forestall frost in deadens sound a much a later stage enlivens otherwise be doubtful whether must have seen christmas dressing of shop in oxford for little further on came without so much a cow in road sheep in field for company to dark narrow place where way hung over verge of stony hollow ancient pit have once be worked a part of quarry of headington have long be of bad repute a haunted ill omened place even carrier strong resolute a be felt shame in whispering when passed by in moonlight name of place be gipsy grave therefore a esther cripps approached be half inclined to wait hide in bush gap until cart waggon must come down hill behind honest dairyman whistling softly to reassure shadow even woman braver than cart came near other kind of company only violence of wind keen increase of frost bite so that girl made up mind to put best foot foremost run through terror at pace that none of must lay hold of through yard of darkness skimmed ground in haste only to be rid of without looking forward over shoulder anywhere when must help now be ready to laugh at stupid fear a caught through tree glimpse of light of oxford down in low land scarcely more than mile half away from in joy of relief be ready to jump pant without fear of echo when suddenly something caught ear be not thing at first to be at afraid of only just enough to rouse little curiosity seemed to be nothing more le than steady stroke of pickaxe sound came from further corner of deserted quarry where crest of soft shingly rock overhung briary thicket person working there must be quite out of sight from road by reason of bend of hollow blow of tool came dull heavy on dark frosty wind esther almost made up mind to run on take heed of so must have done doubt if have not be cripps girl in family firm settled opinion have be handed down concerning right of property right overcome wrong outlive death brother leviticus of stow wood have sown piece of waste at corner of clevice with winter carrot for herd of swine land being none of thus far right so to treat be not established therefore likely to be attacked by rapacious encroacher esther felt such thing keenly resolved to find out what be going on to intent gathered in skirt of frock fulling of cloak fending twig from eye bonnet quietly slipped through gap in hedge for knew that steep track trodden by child in blackberry season led from gap to deep tangled bottom of quarry with care fear went softly down followed curve of hollow heavy sound of pickaxe ceased a came near nearer muttering of rough voice made shrink into nook listen tell 'ee did see zummat moving said man whom must dimly make

least then peeped forth to know what be about never have harmed mortal body why must be frightened so in catch of breath come when sudden courage make gulp at uncertainty lifted by stiff old root to know very worst of better almost to be killed be done with than bear heart pang of terrible fear there saw thing struck so aback with amazement timid sense be mute whether sky began to shed hovering light girl own eye spread bred power of vision from nervous dilation at rate saw in darkness what have not seen till now be body of young woman body a herself might be lying only with white thing round in black corner with gravel earth piece of rock rolling down on there be nothing to frighten sensible person now that worst be known perhaps everybody must be buried at time why must be

precludes idea of eating oh mr fermitage never say that have be brought up too delicately russel believe be too true world have conspired to spoil seem to be quite in sad position entirely for sake of others now look at russel just tell what think overshute always obeyed lady in little thing of kind looked at mr fermitage really be pleasant thing to do thought to that never have seen lady of time of life more comfortable nicely fat thoroughly well dressed fed opinion be proceeded with very pretty salaam smile that never looked better in life ma'be be very great deal to say well russel well

truth mr fermitage have best authority foreman be chimney sweep yes that made feel cold more must see on sunday russel be so respectable nail so white will not listen to word against valued custom on oath did 'what verdict doe missus desire ' asked made rest go accordingly nobody know what might have sworn without clever man to guide of course what can expect still have something new to tell well russel new old here be must bear in mind how felt what everybody be saying in first place then must remember that there be great deal said about pair of silk stocking now shrank particularly from having intimate matter of sort made subject of public gossip be becoming ladylike to drag little question of wardrobe into eye of nation so already be too much to know that pair of such article have be found bearing initial most decidedly refused be sure lady must do same to go into hard cold witness box under eye of score of male proclaim complicity with such thing if have seen duty must have endeavoured to conquer feeling of course took for granted that everything be too clear already dear brother thought of thought of one except must do more russel overshute indeed dear madam see how must have come forward if necessary did not see necessity much more than that there be much more than that there be duty to brother stronger than even to niece be getting elderly for to be printed a proving anything against daughter must surely have be too much for looked to so for consolation one to say kind word to that to find in evidence against might have be death blow consideration for own feeling have weight of rose leaf with in breach must have stood if have followed own wish duty be to curb be following russel carefully word for word a say madam so far a poor wit allow very well then have made quite clear be beauty of having to explain to clever people thank for compliment replied overshute with puzzled look have not earned for can not see that have told anything did not know week ago may be stupidity of course thought that something have occurred quite lately oh yes to be sure be only to day meant to have told that first of be grossly insulted be so forgiving that have forgotten quite forgotten until happened to speak of peculiarly insolent proceeding on part of poor mr sharp appears perhaps one for for everybody say that really now have mind of own did not write one single line although have written politely to sent message be sure of too bad to be repeated one must tell what be aggravates to last degree assure have not be so upset for year at rate not since poor grace be lost about unless be much mistaken very low selfish plotting person know great deal more than have ever dreamed must not surprise in least especially after what happened today to find mr sharp at bottom of of at rate have aroused suspicion by contemptible insolence be not person to drop thing why what have done asked overshute once more while in spite of impatience must scarcely help smiling at poor mr fermitage petty wrath frequent self contradiction what did be sent back not even packed in nice white paper not even sprinkled with eau de cologne not even washed what do think of rolled up anyhow in brown paper same a drayman must use for tap oh russel must ever believe certainly seems very unpolite what be sent back to not even article expected not even that ingredient of costume have lent poor gracie very nice pretty one old grey pair of silken hose disgraceful even to look at be true that bear initial have discarded long ago what strange thing cried overshute flushed with quick excitement how reckless be at inquest have made up mind without evidence on mere faith of coincidence have never taken trouble to look into point until now now perhaps quite by accident be told that have recognised stocking turn out that never even saw be strange almost wicked negligence have told motif can say more exclaimed mr fermitage with fine fresh colour heightened by shame anger of course felt sure who must fail to do so that stocking found with name on must be pair have lent niece seemed most absurd must have to see be more than nerve must bear coroner be not so unmanly a to force pray did go see everything sir mr fermitage be very last person who have right to reproach failed in duty far more than in yours in man of course be thousand time worse there be excuse for yielded to poor unmanly weakness wished to keep memory of poor dear a have seen last must have considered that poor frail body be not true identity quite so of course therefore be use of going to see behaved very well russel overshute so did if come to that nobody can be quite blameless of course be told in bible not to hope for if do duty according to inner light so on apostle can say great harm of in rudest moment to lady let settle that have done best said russel very sadly knowing how far from truth be seeing folly of arguing now will tell what made send for silk ingredient of costume so suddenly then show to with pleasure dear russel understand when one else have sympathy sent for at least for what fully expected to be one because impertinent young woman foolishly trusted with very good key gave notice to go last evening of course will fly before have chance of finding how much have stolen take very good care to do knowing what spirit of age be dress dress fal lals ribbon heel

that be not here for lawyer of course steal everything be not going to be beaten so sent a polite letter a after shameful rudeness lady must write to mr luke sharp poor woman who expected halfpenny of dear husband saving how far deserves have seen to day sooner must burn like sooty widow with good evaporating than ever leave sixpence for to clutch after such behaviour russel will remember be executor dear mr fermitage pray in way to be excited have not heard of story know that servant who be of faithful kind exaggerate slight to master be one of squire old servant who went own must perhaps have known better now may see thing mr sharp sent may may take if like rather must say that beg to take ought to be in custody will oblige by taking russel carefully inspecting for of course must have daylight take in paper just a came keep until ask for can be of importance because be not what lent to gracie except for name on be sure that never must have remembered be darned in day when be poor how often wish that still be poor then nobody wanted to plot against even to steal stocking oh russel do think have murdered darling because be to have money think nothing of kind believe that
