known ever since first came with other four professor of there be not one must leave off talking for sake of public of one even for own sake must breathe enough to let voice in measure of man mind be lung to countervail have be laid down by nature that men who have something to say say though professor in leisure time must play round edge of learning rather than plunge other people into be quite impossible for even careless light headed boy to be with without learning something firm belief be that although know very little at time of writing have learned of larger thing than little human creature be gained upon whale where great mind came to study great body chapter xiii whalebone dear mother always say allows contradiction about that whale being bone blubber have right to come ashore there to set against father trade declares that science be full of smell thousand time worse than make that fuss about drain be just that may get cleaned up for nothing people before in generation

upon government lucky must be to get head fin tail odds end if dozen rival claimant must let have so much that whale be mine said lady twentifold chose to land on property give to professor megalow not to government wo pay penny to professor to put in own garden whale belongs to said local receiver of droits of admiralty foreshore be vested in crown admiralty represents crown clearly there can

considerable share of blubber father not get pailful wrote to beginning with line of latin not so much to accredit learning a to make pay proper attention after said that here there be quantity of stuff such a must never get for love money unadulterated be to be have for asking rather for taking without asking told how shone in sun held together took different colour a looked at be sure that must make fortune because must get for nothing make mix up into everything be certain of stirring up getting five shilling by return of post when added everybody say that mr barlow of happystowe candle work will make thousand pound out of poor whale be being cut up by professor megalow mother be kind enough to answer without sort of reference to business father took more notice of letter than if have sent bark of grip instead of pill box filled with sample from own knife at place where blubber be more than fourteen inch thick go way to prove that mind be already on rise above smaller detail getting into larger view of lofty subject such a chemical research political oeconomy even government contract turned out afterwards a will see that be right in attending to wholesale size dear mother sent crown in stamp for fear of changing half sovereign related beautiful dream have enjoyed about professor megalow standing on whale with wing spread out knew from picture what whale be like hoped for sake of new overcoat kept out of way when spouted if must bring piece of genuine bone for sake of stay must be such comfort for everything now be adulterated want of spring ran into then added that did not think have better write line to polly windsor though sent message from polly to say ought to have done long ago because be not so well to go too far create expectation might come to

be understood that professor megalow must not do good stroke of work without according to very best of belief a be lodging at crowton naze be more than three mile from tower a must get to work moment that sunlight came over sea into wattle of whale there be help for must be up by crow of cock who lived under window for not serving man ruling woman at tower must take sixpence day to get up so soon

if have large small family to keep be told afterwards can well believe because be under government that must have be paid more than twice a much if have done le than work of gave thought to object be to walk off with whale so much of a be moveable before twelve lawyer who be hard at work must get order from court to stop luckily be season of year when law like python retires for three month to
