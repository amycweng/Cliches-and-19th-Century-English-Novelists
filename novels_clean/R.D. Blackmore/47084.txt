yet presented in keen emergency son came up in course of day to ask how sir cradock nowell be to say that father be quite laid up with violent bilious attack dr hutton worked very hard kept mind on

friend enemy learned name of guest expected met with laconic missive handed through closed gate at lodge in many case be to be feared indignation overcame sympathy upstart insolence be heard through clatter of carriage window very nearly a often a most sad occurrence however most of be consoled by prospect of learning everything at inquest on morrow what must be clearer than cradock must be hanged for claytons murder disgrace must kill old baronet then must be very painful wife must be bound sir for sake of poor child to prove direct descent from well known sir cradock nowell who shot man in new forest ah fear run in family wrath be most unphilosophical unworthy of moralist when found that rufus have cheated a to time of inquest in direction spread report that coroner must not

family who be interested in honour rather than in possession a none of baffled cousin must solace with outcry that matter have be hushed up discovered that kind feeling have made scene too sad for coroner sat in principal room at nowell arm jury have be to see body lying at hall now be to hear evidence six seven of county magistrate sat behind coroner clerk be with of course did not attend officially jurisdiction being entirely several from of present court there must be little doubt that action must depend in great measure upon what must now transpire jury be chosen carefully to preclude so far a might be charge of private influence be known for most part a men of independence probity two of a consistent enemy to influence of hall a for general spectator only few of village folk allowed curiosity to conquer good feeling perhaps must say discretion for be tenant under sir cradock though be known by time bull garnet be ill in bed prostrated by one of old attack everybody felt certain that must find out who dared to be present visit pretty smartly must be waste of time to recount evidence given for know nearly that dr hutton clergyman must depose medical man dr gall have also examined poor claytons remains healing profession who cure like bacon after have killed be remarkable for agreeing in public quarrelling sadly in private life so dr gall deposed exactly a mr hutton have done be very emphatic towards rufus in use of proper prefix who know skill displayed presuppose game certificate one part however of medical evidence ought to be repeated poor clayton have not died from ordinary small shot wound wound from ghastly hole through throat cut a if by bullet a dr gall who knew something of gun very concisely put hole be like hole in door when boy have fired a sometimes do tallow candle through yet be fluted at exit in fleshy part of neck a bullet must have marked be caused by shot diverging beginning to radiate perhaps from opposition encountered in two word said dr gall when have badgered in evidence deceased be killed either by balled cartridge by charge of loose shot fired within six foot of very good thought rufus hutton who heard dr gall said ill keep cartridge case to myself poor crad shant have that against hereupon lest mist goddess abound in vide homer passim descend upon eye mind of gentle follower of poor craddys fortune let endeavour to explain dr gall obscurity cartridge a used by sportsman with gun load at muzzle be package of shot compact rammed down in body of have spiral case of finest wire covered round with paper others used for shorter distance have only cylinder of paper to enclose shot interstice between shot be solidified with sawdust only use of thing isfor save little time in loadingto kill brother biped

escape unless bullet so aimed must have hit non expansion be called in good english balling of cartridge be used for longest distance for wild fowl shootinggreen cartridge a be called containing larger shotare especially apt to ball dr gall be aware of course that one beating for woodcock must think of putting green cartridge into gun at seemed very likely indeed that cradock might have used blue one for longer shot with left barrel blue one having wire round sometimes ball though not so often a verdant brother only remains to be said that when cartridge ball fly with force a well a in compass of bullet with three drachm of powder behind will cut hole at forty yard through two inch deal whether be balled cartridge charge of loose shot at six foot distance be momentous issue in former case there must be fair reason to set down a accident for place where cradock have first be seen be thirty yard from clayton might so have shot thence in dusk through thick of covert if poor boy have died from common charge of shot murder be only verdict true men must return on evidence set before for cradock must have fired wilfully at open throat of brother then flown to hedge acted

cradock entered drawing room well thought how hard hearted be can not matter now much though never believed must be so being allowed by kind entertainer to do exactly a pleased poor cradock have led life of hermit more than of guest among have taken what little food required in garret have begged for carried with into wood where most of time be spent of course be very distressing to hospitable heart of miss doxy brother john must have so for so have promised cradock must understand reluctance of one who feel under ban to meet fellow creature hourly know that be thinking of so came to pas miss eudoxia who now sat alone in drawing room be surprised a well a pleased at entrance of refugee a hesitated moment in doubt of reception ran up at once took hand kissed on forehead oh cradock dear boy be kind of most kind indeed to come tell at once of success need not aski know by face first bit of colour have seen in poor cheek many day thats because have be running miss rosedew miss rosedew indeed now cradock aunt eudoxia if please aunt doxy with heart now used to call so to tease in happy day gone by loved to be teased by pet idol dear aunt eudoxia tell truly do thinki can hardly ask think what cradock poor cradock oh dont be like not that didi dont mean thatbut that be possible for to have done on purpose done what on purpose cradock why of course that horrible horrible thing on purpose cradock poor innocent only let hear one dream of if dont come down upon undignified sentence that of aunt doxy a well a most absurd one how long have be in habit of hearing people dream one not only dream one actually belief that did so low wretchthe despicablewho own father will not repeat what miss rosedew said when recovered from gasp because language be stronger than becomes elderly lady sister of clergyman not to mention countess of driddledrum dromore who must have be wholly forgotten then dont think dear aunt eudoxia thatthat uncle john must believe what brother john surely know better than dear nornorperhaps not even cousin amy amy indeed do believe that child be perfectly mad cant make out at be so contradictory cry night be sure of doe not care for school though go there flower wont look at seeing that cradocks countenance fell more more at miss rosedew who have long suspected where heart be dwelling told thing to cheer up have declared must never tell darling amy be know very odd girl indeed sometimes when something happens very puzzling perplexing great visitation of providence amy becomes so dreadfully obstinate mean have such delightful faith that be obliged to listen to be quite sure to be right in end though at moment perhaps laugh at yet be so shy can never get at heart except by forgetting what be about well got at somehow afternoon must have heard what said beautiful great eye flashed upon like rock be struck gushed like before ended can dare to think cried that god be asleep like baalthat know not when have chastened child beyond what can bear know that who be now so trampled crushed of heaven be not tried thus for nothing will rise again more pure large fresh from hand of god do what lucky men rarely think ofthe will of creator when john looked at fell away cried terribly cradock be greatly astonished seemed so unlike young amy to be carried away in style comfort courage struck root in heart warm faith thawed despair still saw very little chance at present of doing anything starving how wonderfully good be to cant talk about though will think of a long a live be going away to night aunt doxy must first see uncle john of course miss rosedew be very angry proved to be quite impossible that cradock must leave so before very long good sense prevailed saw that be for best while stayed there must either persist to shut up in solitude wander about in desert place never look with comfort on face of man so went with to door of book room left with none brother john rosedew sat in little room with only one candle to light fire gone out a usual book lay around even best loved treasure heart be not among grief of old though not wild passionate a young man anguish be perhaps more pitiable because more slow hopeless young tree ring to keen pruning hook old tree groan to grating saw one will blossom bear again while other gape with canker none of people have heard rector quote greek latin for length of time unprecedented when sweet playful mind like have taken to mope be earnest effect be far more sad touching than stern man melancholy ironwork out of blast be dreary family hearth moss grown be woeful uncle john leaped up very lightly from brooding rather than reading shook cradock nowell by hand a if never must let go time looking into face by light of composite candle be only to know how have fared john read face too truly then a cradock turned away not wanting to make much of john came before with sadness love blue eye glistened softly boy boy be must say think for very long time then cradock told without tear sigh even comment with face a pale a must be breath coming heavily that father have said to that meant to do through so uncle john concluded rising to start immediately here go to seek fortune such a will must be good bye best only friend be ten time man be yesterday will be grander still to morrow tried to pop off like lively cork john rosedew must not have young man dont be in hurry strike that want pipe also strike that will smoke one with cradock be taken aback by novelty of situation have never dreamed that uncle john must under possible circumstance ask to smoke pipe knew well enough that rector smoked sacrificial pipe to morpheus in room of own up stair only one while chewing cud of have read that day mr rosedew have always discouraged a elderly smoker do young aspirant to mystic hierophancy be not vow to be taken rashly for vow be irrevocable except with men of principle now be to smoke therehe mere bubble blowing boy to smoke in middle of deepest book to fumigate manuscript containing lifeful of learning john must no more get on with andoh miss eudoxiato make hall smell drawing room oxymoron overcame took pipe john rosedew have filled judiciously quite a matter of course filled own in self same manner with digital skill worthy of ancient fox trying on foxglove time john be shyly wondering at own great force of character now said john rosedew still keeping up have drop of very old schiedamschnapps think somethingof want opinion crad boy want opinion before import more be judge of sort of thing be so long since be at oxford without more ado went somewhither after lighting cradocks yard of claywhich young man burnt finger about for wouldnt let old man do itand came back like bacchanal with square black jack beneath arm jenny after wondering whether have not prayed that morning enough against devil be good job miss amy be out of way old cat be bewitched that be certain a well a dear good master miss doxy be happy in knowing not that be called old cat in kitchen chapter xxviii now craddy dear dear boy said uncle john when thing have be done with lemon cold water wherein discussion so utterly beat description know too well to suppose wish to pas thing lightly know well enough that will look hard world full in face so must do in case wish be that must do not with spite bile narrowness broadly a christian be hard to talk about now said cradock inhaling charity puffing away acrimony uncle john hope may come to a better spirit return to hope indeed believe crad dont see how can be otherwise with young man of breadth of mind solid faith to help empty lad who snap up stuff because think fine garbles into garbage must become utter infidel under what have suffered with believe will be otherwise believe will be enlarged purified by sorrowthe night make guiding star so much clearer to john rosedew be drinking schiedamallow to explainthough pretending rare enjoyment of making cradock drink little because heart be down so after have talked pipeful longer not great weighty sentiment deal of kindly stuff young fellow got up quietly said now uncle john must go boy can trust anywhere after what have be telling of human nature know nothing exceptfor john thought did know somethingfrom own little experience find great thought in greek philosopher somehow be too general too little genial one thing know far more often mistrust than trust unwisely now can trust cradock in main will stand upright stop boy must have scrip be saving for birthday dont despise hope said cradock dont think coward for running away so after what have happened to day must go mad if stopped here not that must matter much only that if be so must be sure to do john rosedew have need to ask what meant by last two word for hollow voice told plainly for be likely enough that must have be done ere at rate in first horror hand alone have prevented parson trembled at idea thought best not to dwell upon reformidare mortem est animi pusillanimi reformidare vitam be ten time worse because impious therefore in case boy be utterly impossible a well a ignoble towards who love so remember that will break at least two
