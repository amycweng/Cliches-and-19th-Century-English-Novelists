three day start have fallen upon fruitful ground brother doctor about here be doing best to clench nail mr mockham like almost everybody else be apt to mix metaphor in talking by making lame excuse for instead of attempting to deny such fellow a jervis jackson suppose several of hate because be not humbug perhaps will get up testimonial to for fear there must be doubt of guilt be very thing talk of doing how well understand young friend now what have to show against general conclusion for of course can not mention what confessed to can just do can prove alibi forget that can show where have

thirty five to who be particular about good road be at father bed side minute before ten o'clock on saturday morning be not enough to show know in common sense that ride must have taken at least four

slightly out of sort when saw man waiting at cross road for to say be wanted at whetstone pit for man have tumbled down hole broken leg without asking name put spur to old rock set off at spanking pace for whetstone pit expecting to find foreman there to show where be be long roundabout way from village at least for one on horseback though not more than three mile perhaps in straight line because have to go round butt of hagdon hill one must think of riding over in dark must say must be five mile at least from cross road yard of distance say magistrate who be following doctor tale

across by pine trembling sparkling seeming to move thing tell upon man somehow seems to have right to disturb felt be not brought here for nothing began to get vexed at seeing nobody so set up shout with hand to mouth then shrill whistle between nail echo came back very punctually nothing else except little gliding of shale shivering of black branch then jumped off horse made fast to tree scrambled along rough bottom of hill there be eight pit on south side seven upon north besides three big one at west end of hill be pretty well worked out according to report mouth be pretty nearly at

brekkles if be what call however did not push down although made way up to top when have shouted in vain along bottom must not get up stuff knew better than to make trial circumvented at further end there found sort of terrace where cart must get along from one pit mouth to from mouth to mouth passed along rough stony gallery under furzy crest of hill without discovering sign of life while low moon across broad western plain seemed to look up rather than down at into black pit mouth broad narrow bratticed with timber arched with flint sent loud shout only reply be like dead murmuring of shell yet time felt somehow a if be watched by invisible eye a man upon cliff be observed from sea increased anger be rising at thought that one have made great fool of forgetting ludicrous side of

upon that made laugh grow rational again resolved to have one more try instead of giving in so climbed upon ridge where must see along chine through patch of white among blackness of furze in distance

devonshire in fact at western end of great blackdown range barren furzy flinty sort of place by by not many mile away from place where son have gone to live perlycross only bought manor to oblige friend who wanted little ready money to go there now then perhaps for little rough shooting for country be beautiful air very fine well manorial right included quarry pit excavation of sort where rough scythe stone be dug such a see lying on lawn land be actually part of manor from time beyond memory record seems a if stranger have be allowed to settle on hillside work ancient quarry sell produce on own account only paying small royalty to manor martinmas about time not so much for value of money though must perhaps be considerable under proper computation a acknowledgment of ownership of manor fear be tiring not at sir henry like story of sort law be so very very queer sometimes be well friend have not deceived said that whetstone money be very hard to get be so trifling that have let go sometimes when people objected to paying a did after bad season last martinmas matter slipped memory through domestic trouble year a day approached sent order to man rough sort of game keeper

look upon offer a great concession to in more enlightened part must allow for manner of neighbourhood in fact be such perfect trifle after what have be doing at perlycross if be magistrate about there at perlycross what do mean little matter about clergyman want to know about sir henry seems so strange that christie never mentioned sir henry perceived that have put foot in dr freeborn have warned that sacrilege in devon a somerset paper have begun to call must be kept most carefully from knowledge of patient from of lady also for there be saying how might take now mr fox must not fail to find out everything be ready to bite off tongue a lady put oh ah be thinking of something have better not be referred to perhaps not quite fit to be discussed when one have honour of being with lady about very extraordinary people have heard thing be highly interesting thing be certain must like to hear not so much a want to hear story about parish where son life daughter be staying will not come back for reason can not make out must insist sir henry upon hearing that know be not young woman know world pretty well by time will not offend by anything say will by anything hide sir henry haggerstone looked about saw that be in for elderly lady a might call looked at with pretty doubt lady so thoroughly understand how to show intend to be understood without expression gentleman glanced at have moustache to stroke for only cavalry officer cad of most pretentious upturn a yet wore ginger hackle relief still to come in downier age dear mr fox there be nothing improper from lady point of view mean in very sad occurrence at perlycross be question for local authority not one for to meddle with then why did speak of tell say that wo leave to find out lady have gentleman tory have temporizer on nail be nothing in hand murmured with perfect truth for when question come to pulling out of truth what chance have man against clever woman ten time a quick a be piercing glance be truly sorry that have come to mr fox did not sympathise with regret nodded a if to say cure now for for part be rather glad be simply through terror of distressing that best friend have combined a may say at least have thought wiser then made great mistake be not at thankful to of let sit down here now for frightful wonder be jemmy dead let have worst at once be sudden relief to sir henry enabling to offer immediate comfort to whisper how must imagine thing dear madam continued having now upper hand hers beneath have pleasure of assuring that noble son be in very best of health improving by admirable knowledge of medicine health of around be acknowledged that have advanced highest interest of profession that be sure to do sir henry have copy of dear grandmother recipe for pounded cherry stone elixir with resource of modern science added own trained insight in application worst of be that leading intellect a must have experienced long ago can never escape sad amount of narrow professional jealousy son must have fallen among heavy witted devonshire doctor like thunderbolt worse phenomenon come to heal patient gratis must drive to do anything to poison if have courage for one know how run up bill having brought lady thus to practical vein sir henry a gently a possible a be by quarter drachm administered sombre draught be now bound to exhibit jemmy dear mother took with closeness of attention critical appreciation seldom found in physical recipient in such case to administrator great surprise indignation be by mean vivid in direction anticipated be heartily glad that know at last ought to have be told of long ago said mr fox looking resolutely at sir henry haggerstone very great mistake want of judgment on part of dr freeborn what frightful risk to run supposing husband have be told suddenly of have be done for best dear madam great anxiety be to keep from who be proper one to see to must have thought wife constant nurse be thought impossible that must show discretion clever men always make one great mistake believe that woman can command tongue if have own only half a well controlled there must not be tenth part of mischief in world be quite right there be very great truth exceedingly well expressed replied sir henry not that be impressed with so deeply that wanted to appease lady however a regard dr freeborn idea really know very little doubt thought be for own good too not to be burdened at time with great anxiety have taken too much upon must have be great anxiety to son be quite capable of fighting own battle same order issued to son daughter at last can understand poor christie letter why have be so brief for fear of losing control like mother stupid stupid clever men why there be infinitely le chance now of mr fox ever knowing may tell sapient doctor that perhaps will astonish little will prove to that can control tongue by never mentioning subject to excuse mr fox if make one two remark may speak without reserve a old friend of family one who have have great deal to do with criminal at least mean to say with public proceeding in county to be sure sir henry will be much obliged by suggestion may make in first place then be quite impossible to leave son under imputation can quite understand how have be impeded in taking step for own vindication by sense of duty towards father in respect behaviour have be most admirable have absolutely done nothing not even protested publicly challenged evidence against be quite content to lie at mercy of wicked slanderer for there can be reason one public proceeding must increase stir make certain that whole must come to father knowledge to be sure sir henry there can be other reason old friend of family be surprised at tone in mr fox uttered opinion of course not so be more incumbent upon family to clear let tell must do if be father in sound health able to attend to business of course be too young to speak so have suddenly remembered christie that understand also admit that be not likely to offer advice unless asked for beg particularly to give be magistrate of large if not long experience know that be true friend that may rely upon mr fox know how much admire son for enthusiasm be rare gift now becoming rarer year in day of liberal sentiment if case be own must just do must make application at once to court of king bench to have matter sifted be use shilly willying with county authority special commission have be granted in case le important without pressing for that be possible to get whole question investigated by skilled officer from head quarter who bring charge must have done probably must have done if have faith in own case be playing deeper game according at least to view of matter have laid open to action son lie helpless must 'live down ' a people say glibly who have never have to do be thing mean to allow need scarcely ask that sir henry remember know nothing of particular have be kept so so amiably from knowledge yes know at least so far a can be gathered from devonshire journal be very careful what say in spite of enemy who want to keep going whole thing may be brought to point at once by applying for warrant in court of king bench with proper information sworn must grant at once son must appear be released of course on bail for case be only one of misdemeanour then proper officer must be sent down real criminal detected warrant against jemmy oh sir henry can never mean simply a matter of form mr fox ask solicitor be proper people must have be consulted long ago must have be for terrible disadvantage only suggest quickest way to bring matter to issue otherwise doubt will hang over son with friend conscience to support be among so many be not altogether counsel of perfection even of very lofty view unhappily have to contend with world neither perfect very lofty there be other hole to be found in plan even to be picked by ingenuity of lady who be worthy of name can not slip round corner gracefully be presented thank so deeply sir henry for very kind interest in strange matter said mr fox looking gratitude with smile shone through tear for perfectly invaluable advice see everything so distinctly experience be so precious to think of poor boy in position oh dear oh dear really have not courage to discus more kind heart like yours will make allowance for feeling of mother thus be sir henry neatly driven from hall of council to carpeted chamber of comfort knew a well a if lady have put into so many word that meant to accept none of advice reason however for so resolving be far beyond perception simple a be natural mr fox have known little of young doctor doings since have settled at perlycross having never even paid visit there for husband be sore upon subject so that be not acquainted with depth of jemmy regard for sir thomas have never dreamed of love for inez whereas be strongly bitterly impressed with lifelong ardour for medical research mother felt indignant

by mean need not specify even with can not enter upon question so professional know that irregular thing be done folly of law compels be quite out of course pursue however can make quite certain about within week meanwhile must look for more likely clue have lost invaluable time by concluding a of course stupid public must especially after burke hare affair that 'the doctor must be at bottom of ' most unlucky that be so unwell might have set enquiry on right track from first surely must have occurred to that medical men a general rule be sharpest fellow of neighbourhood except of course of course excepting parson be sharper than be said parson with smile perhaps be very thing that tell against faith in very likely still keep from utterly mad atrocity sir thomas waldron famous man grand

a ill a fallen nature can make think of fellow creature mr penniloe spoke with sharpness very seldom found in word of in fair truth be beyond blackest of black bitterness to doubt poor lady waldron simple perfect sincerity because of very magnificent eye sir harrison answered a if to to meet own too charitable interjection what have done to carry out wild revenge at outrage must feel more keenly perhaps than most sensitive of english woman have moved high low ransacked earth set neighbourhood on fire appealed with tear threat money be strongest of appeal to caesar enthroned in london if have done of thing fancy must have heard of for moment mr penniloe disliked friend a man may feel annoyance at own wife even when mind for trivial cause be moving on lower level than own a yet have not

from london down tell that in such case have failed more than that have entirely spoiled success of private enquiry look to very much a if private enquiry have great desire to succeed conclusion grows more more irresistible will tell what be dear fellow by mean do will attach very great importance to be simply sir harrison spoke le rapidly than usual mystery be solved in lady waldron know about how

to smuggler hiding place in desolate unfrequented spot probably in direction of coast be right in supposing partly so must be towards sea though certainly not shortest way best way probably of getting at coast if wished to avoid town village that admit then be plain poor sir thomas be to be exported probably to spain will not pretend to determine think most likely perhaps to be buried in catholic soil with catholic ceremonial must not do openly here because of own direction how simple very deepest mystery becomes when once have key to how strange that never occurred to must have thought gronow

what can urge against firm belief in honesty affection good faith of woman whew great physician forgot dignity in enjoyment of so fine joke gave long whistle then put thumb to nose extended finger a schoolboy of period did honesty of woman penniloe at age surely know better than that very frail argument indeed because of age be perhaps do know better must rather not discus subject have view have mine be pleased with sort of thing because reminds one so much of boyhood sir harrison stood by fire began to consult short gray lock let see how many year be since cherished such illusion well be

streaked with silver a even behind must see for whirl of north wind tossed now then upon left shoulder kept head low behind coachman broad figure appeared to speak to nobody smoked cigar incessantly lighting from stump of predecessor scattering much ash about to discomfort of neighbour eye although mr penniloe never smoked enjoyed fragrance of good cigar perhaps more than puffer doe especially if puff too vehemently be able to pronounce man tobacco very fine at length arrived at pumpington about six mile from perlycross here mr penniloe fully expected halt for supper have made up mind in case

penniloe answered smiling for moment though doubtful of right to do so how can ask for farthing after what have happened leaving that aside be now in position in must be unbecoming may have heard that be trustee for part of waldron estate to secure certain sum for daughter nicie then put out of question said rector know what trust plague be call tax upon good repute friendly balm break head never understood passage till in fool moment accepted trusteeship however go on with waldron affair be beginning to chaff about shamefully now that anger fright be gone by poor a be must give hundred pound for sake of parish to have cleared up longer go on darker get used to be famous for concise abstract do remember thucydides be old short used to put year of war on oyster shell beat by putting on thumbnail give in ten line theory of great perlycrucian mystery ready in moment will jot down what be greek for perlycross puzzle even think must number one two so on there must be dozen by time mr penniloe felt annoyance at too jocular view of subject bore in mind that rector be not so sadly bound up with a own life be so set down a offering shortest form name of who have be charged with crime by public voice by private whisper fox gronow gowler other medical man of part conjecture founded very often upon last half year account lady waldron relative of hers with without knowledge now think that exhaust curate continued will discus in order be general opinion still mean that of great majority outside parish throughout county none who knew jemmy must conceive who know nothing of will dismiss suppose when hear of long attachment to miss waldron no may also be dismissed being founded in case on personal dislike without scintilla of evidence to back a regard probability must take lead for gronow gowler be out of question former have given up practice hate except for benefit of friend a for gowler must have earthly motive understood case a well a if have seen whole time be occupied with vast london practice also be reduced to very verge of impossibility there be one at exeter who must dream of such thing country practitioner must dare even if spirit of research must move a for bath bristol have received letter from gowler disposing of possibility there who suggested seems strange idea what on earth must lady waldron do for gowler suggested tell in strictest confidence chevithorne of course will feel have told one else must not have told except want advice about have travelled in spain know much of spanish people reject theory altogether though gowler be most positive laugh at objection remember of course must think so said rector wonderfully clever fellow never much liked nobody must ever get on with two more totally different men however opinion of be worth something what motive must discover for religious feeling narrow if like for be a catholic a be very strong a one must well conceive if only suited character idea must be that wife unable to set aside husband wish openly unwilling to incur odium of be secretly resolved upon burial elsewhere with rite considered needful be most probable explanation wonder that never occurred to gowler have hit mark what clever fellow see how exculpates parish will go back with great weight off mind upon soul penniloe be astonished that have to go to london to find out b c if have be over here little more often must have hit upon long ago chevithorne think that very likely curate replied with mildness of who let others be rushed off leg by theory be plausible account for everything fit in with very last discovery prof parish even english nation guiltless nevertheless be utterly wrong according at least to view of human nature view of human nature be always too benevolent that be why everybody liked so dear fellow have lived long enough now to know that only doe for christmas day sermon have not lived long enough hope to do so never mr penniloe answered very quietly with manner other understood of larger sight looking over crown will tell chevithorne upon what point rely then will tell what think of why if come to argument what chance have against can put thing ca can sell horse can buy fine self sacrifice on side go strictly upon common sense have heard lot of lady waldron have have experience of spanish lady good bad doubt just a english lady be be perfectly obvious to mind that lady waldron have done to mind replied mr penniloe looking stedfastly at rector be equally obvious that have not upon what do go asked rector rather warmly for prided on knowledge of mankind though admitting very handsomely ignorance of book go upon faith in womankind curate spoke softly a if such thing be new truly be not at in fashion then woman loved husband grief be deep genuine wish be sacred to be quite incapable of double dealing indeed must say that if ever there be straightforward simple hearted woman if ever if ever replied mr chevithorne with fine indulgent smile upon whole think well of let have game of draught dear fellow where queen jump over poor men king call here answered mr penniloe chapter xxviii vagabond although mr penniloe anxiety about growth of church debt be thus relieved little of trouble be by mean lightened through visit of rector nasty suspicion suggested by gowler heartily confirmed by chevithorne be very great discomfort even torment inasmuch a have one to argue with reasoned with even if lady be schemer so heartless a to ruin young man who have done harm that might screen a well a actress so heaven gifted a to impose on one of qualification warmly denied yet there be motive so far a must see strong enough to lead into such crooked course to best of belief be far too indifferent upon religious question have never seen heard of priest at walderscourt although never came to church with others of family have allowed only daughter to be brought up a protestant certainly did not value great nation quite a much a value in fact be rather ardent spaniard though herself of mixed race seemed most unlikely that religion patriotism combined be strong enough to drive into action contrary to dead husband wish to own character so far a unprejudiced man must judge there remained last theory no a given above to curate seemed more probable one although surrounded with difficulty there might be spanish relative even one of other country resolute to save soul of sir thomas waldron without equal respect for body in case be just possible that whole thing might have be arranged done without lady waldron knowledge if be so what meant visit of foreigner who have tried to escape notice when left coach before mr penniloe must think out jemmy fox who might have helped by way of nicie upon last point be called away suddenly from perlycross mother be obliged in course of nature to look upon now a everybody prop comfort because husband must not be regarded in light longer two three thing be coming to pas of family

explanation of sad affair next to be recorded quarrel between two almost equally fine fellow dr jemmy fox to wit master frank gilham two have naturally good liking for other there be nothing very marvellous about of although respective mother perceived heavenful of quality might be regarded a fair specimen of englishman more wonderful perhaps than admirable in eye of other race if be needful for one to make choice between that choice must be governed more by point of liking than of merit be brave straightforward stubborn sensible self respecting fellow little hot headed sometimes perhaps never consciously unjust seemed great pity that pair must fall away from friendship when there be so many reason for goodwill amity not to mention gratitude that flower of humanity now extinct through number of cutting have damped off jemmy fox indeed have cherished small slip of when gilham stood by in first distress unhappily slightest change of human weather be inevitably fatal to very miffy plant young a be frank gilham have be to market already too many time to look for offal value in gratitude indeed be too generous to regard a due still feeling of friendship of admiration for superior power of other be little aggrieved when found kept at distance avoided for reason understood too well so when heard that young dr fox have returned from visit to father rode up to old barn to call upon place thing upon plainer footing jemmy received in friendly manner with mind made up to put stop to nonsense concerning sister christie if gilham must be fool enough to afford opening young yeoman did without delay for saw good reason why must be made too little of how did leave miss fox asked a took chair opposite great fireplace in bare room scientific with skull two artistic with few of christie water colour sketch have difficulty in leaving jemmy answered with very poor attempt at wit intended to be exasperating how be mean dare say got away without thinking much of anybody frank gilham be irritated a deserved to be thank well think upon whole jemmy fox drawled out word a if chin be too slack to keep going stroked in manner be always hateful yes think may say upon whole that be quite a well a can be expected hope can say same of dear mother frank gilham knew that be challenged to combat came forth a duty be habit of englishman be not first time have be rude to said wo pretend not to know reason think have be guilty of presumption in daring to lift eye to sister to tell truth replied fox getting up meeting steadfast gaze steadfastly have expressed opinion better than must myself have put be not sort of thing one can argue about said other also rising know very well that be too good for have right to look ever so much higher for have perfect right to set heart upon especially considering considering ca help if hing to annoy even to let know of presumption what right have to make grievance of have never made grievance of simply wish to understand approve of have perfect right to disapprove to let know that do so only must have be more to credit if have done in open manner in plain english instead of cutting at rate dropping acquaintance call straightforward man be jackass what rot talk look here fine fellow how must speak to about before acknowledged infatuation must come up to in street say 'hi there be in love with sister be if want to keep sound skin will haul off ' be that straightforward course must have taken well there may be something in way put must leave to anybody whether have acted fairly why must haul off must like to

upon honour must object to if liked have hundred thousand pound well know must mr gilham then dr fox must sell sister for hundred thousand pound if like to put lower price upon what right have to stop

torchlight vanished round bend of wall nothing must either be seen heard mr penniloe in anxiety leaned over breach in churchyard fence striving to see what be under foot while pike mustered courage to stand in archway be of roughly chiselled stone kept ready for instant flight a drew deep breath of excitement by by torch came quivering back throwing flit of light along white flint roof behind man shaking worse than shadow whiter than torchlit chalk great god cried staggering forth falling with hand on heart against steep side of pit a sure a there be god in heaven have found father what cried
