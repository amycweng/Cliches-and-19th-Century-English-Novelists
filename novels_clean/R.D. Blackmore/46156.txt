awning over tranquil sea first gauze of golden colour a western light came through then tissue shot with red now veil of silvery softness a summer moon grew bright then quiet wave began a plaited line rolled onward into frill of whiteness in very curl fall to glisten with flitting light presently a puny breaker overshone one in front not crest comb alone slope behind crossing flaw inshore gleamed

going on with so much heat hard work enjoyment draught of fish that poor body wit be gone with therefore doubt not must have be especial decree of providence that in turning round to run away saw big fish basket to carry over rock at run be entirely impossible although be still pretty good in leg to run away without be great deal more impossible for man who have caught fish beside fish in basket there must have be more than two hundredweight of bass must not go into three hundred half in be what set down at taking heed of prawn lobster with luck in selling must turn two guinea hence perhaps came to pas a much a from downright bravery of sometimes have little felt bound to creep back again under shade of cold wet rock just to know what that boat be up to finer floatage never saw line be purely elegant rode above water without so much a parting then in spite of fear must not help admiring struck hotly at heart oh if be real boat what craft for business with dropped fear for have not be able for many year to carry on fishing a skill knowledge warranted only because must not afford to buy genuine boat of own hitherto have never won chance without money a yet must see soul on board one be rowing be certain neither sign of sail to give steerage way however kept course so true that surely there must be hand invisible at tiller conclusion flurried again very undesirably set right foot in such manner a to be off in twinkling of anything unholy god have care of little soul nobody else take heed of so ordained that boat must heel then yaw across middle of pool for black rock alone must have be welcome at once heart came back to for saw at once a old sailor pretty well up in shipwreck that boat be more than derelict feeling that here be chance of chance worth perhaps ten time catch of fish set in earnest to catching of boat therefore took up pole again finding that brace of fish whom have be over scared to land have got away during slackness spread hook cast with slug

to find how fast must send little crank barky against current having being fine oarsman in day always stroke of captain gig a one who be well acquainted with great dearth of honesty not in own parish

since boat came in twelve year ago a nearly a need be in height of summer namely on d of june large ship called 'planter welvard ' bound from surinam to port of amsterdam have be lost swallowed up near very dangerous place three poor child of planter whose name be j s jackert on way home to be educated have floated ashore at least body be now in churchyard same must have be fate of bardie for accident of boat though be not dutchman child so far a one must guess from wonderful power of english sign of dutch build about might very well have be in dutch ship with father mother little brother susan in best cabin be well known among dutch vessel lay generally northward of true course from likeness of sounding often came up bristol instead of english channel that mistake set of stream must increase generally proved fatal to in absence of lighthouse that ship other have be lost be to mind out of dispute although weather have be so lovely why must have be dutch rather than english ship why need so very plainly have seen whole of a by time began to believe have done be almost more than can tell except hoped might be so a giving more thorough warrant in possession of prize boat moreover seemed to be of foreign build so far a must judge of by moonlight of hereafter wonder be must judge of anything at think after long hard day work for man not so young a used to be rock be

with sitting thus became aware of presence of sort over right shoulder at first thought be nothing more than smoke from own pipe for puffed rather hard in anxiety about little darling seeing surprise alarm perhaps in watkin face who sate opposite turned round there beheld three distinct several pillar of brownish yellow light standing over against doorway of western end at first be little scared more so because rest of hall be darkening with pulse of colour gradually vanishing for instant really thought that ghost of wrecked child father mother perhaps nurse be come to declare truth about

morning although rain have cooled down air be now become unwise thing to recommend what still remained to man of unchristian spirit possessing ear of magistrate now perhaps must not say thing many may think inclined to vaunt call old coxcomb if man must sell stinking fish in time of be writing then be ten time harder than now because woman looked after marketing that man verily believe be old davy llewellyn right have to be proud of what be left on hand that evening be beginning to get so strong that feared must go over bridgend bridge into river ogmore big coach with london letter came then almost twice week be just gone on after stopping three hour to rest horse feed people have done business with for london folk for most part have kind pleasing ignorance paid well served well with fish of fine high flavour now have must not offer to such kind hearted gentry hezekiah wanted fish saw by nostril knew for certain when pretended not to see standing went good bit round corner a if to deal with ironmonger for knew a well a if must hear wife beginning to rake fire fish for supper be business have brought across bridge therefore refused offer must have jumped at before seeing hezekiah of twopence pound for residue from old woman who sold pickle made up mind to keep up price knowing man to have ten in family blessed with good appetite what davy brother davy cried being compelled to begin because took care not to look at have be so ordered that behold good brother davy with fish upon monday object in be plain enough to beat down good by terror of information for sabbath labour lord have be merciful to answered patting best fish on shoulder not only in sending straight to net at nine o'clock morning also brother hezekiah in hunger people have for must that must have kept thee taste not soon wouldst thou forget sweeter fish finer fish never came out of newton bay said because newton bay be famous for high quality brother hezekiah thou art come too late began to pack up very hastily what cried hezekiah with keen hungrily grievous voice fish bespoken davy one of bespoken brother by man who know right down good bass better almost than do griffy 'cat snuffer now griffith who kept cat snuffer be very jovial man bitter enemy to hezekiah perkins knew that latter must gladly offer penny pound upon griffy back to spoil of supper to make offend customer stop brother davy cried hezekiah stretching out broad fat hand a began to pack fish with freshest smellers uppermost davy dear be not right like ancient friendship rogue like griffy to cheat so what have beaten down to davy beaten down said in hurry be likely must be beaten down with eye coming out of head like now dear brother dyo do have patience what be going to give pound fourpence pound ten pound of three fourpence for lot like ah time be bad indeed dear brother dyo fourpence halfpenny three nine down for lot a stand hezekiah for what do take cut farthing in four when get do look likely man to be rogue for fivepence davy be angry with say a much a tenpence four twopence ready money irish coinage brother hezekiah said bargain struck be bargain kept rob man of supper for tenpence oh dyo dyo never must think of man supper with wife longing for fish so such family a have weakness in hepzibah back five shilling for five davy there there take along cried at last with groan from chest be bound to be ruin of what can do with delicate lady brother surely have be little too hard upon will find to say to man who never beat down tell that worldly 'cat snuffer that fish be much too good why davy seem to smell little small use must be hezekiah for taste for nourishment unless have sea smell now brother money back fish to poor griffy if know not smell of salt water yet now be so hot old davy fish be good enough doubt may be from skewer wood have sort not to say smell manner of reminding one of savoury stuff feed on said thorough good use make of fish must eat so must little blame to of with bade good night went with alacrity towards supper scornfully sneering a passed door of cat snuffer though be fine thing for especial providence to finish off stock so well at time when must have taken gladly shilling for lot of yet felt that circumstance be against lingering even if hezekiah unable to enter into vein of fish must find too fat to hurry down steep hill after still there be many other people fit for supper fresh for from sudden coolness whom be duty now to preserve from mischief by leaving proper interval for consideration before might happen to be in front of dining room window day therefore with grateful sense of goodwill to customer thought better to be off there have be for several hour ready to prove anything never challenged by anybody spirit have grown accordingly never yet have found wise to overlie success win look at be off be quickest way to get more so scarcely even called so much a pint at cat snuffer to have laugh with griffy set off for

bound to do thought orion ought to be up must not see orion struck a unkindly thing although when thought of next day found that orion be quite right perhaps beer little strong have led to look out for anyhow threw back to think of hezekiah make worst of to myself for having have best of everybody may be sure that never must have gone out of way to describe traffic with man unless there be good reason nay wanted to show exactly cast colour of man be by setting forth low attempt to get fish for nothing there be man of course in native village very few in bridgend perhaps to whom must have sold fish unless be going to sell again hezekiah perkins member leading elder of nicodemus christian be so hard man to cheat except by stirring of gall so keen cheat so proud moreover of wit praying truly brotherly that to lead astray be very first thing desired by sound churchman by trade calling have be before received special call no more than common blacksmith now blacksmith be most useful

however might well have come from knocking about in sea so much must have given good half crown to have bitten off foolish tongue when one of juryman stood up began to address coroner spoke unluckily very good english honour be glad to pay heed to clerk put down nearly said word for word a might be meddlesome fellow being le than brother hezekiah self nodded to for leave to speak must not deny honour lost time to put mouth into rummer of punch a now provided for of to bow whenever mouth be empty to hezekiah for man have won reputation rather have made for by perpetual talking a if be skilled in history antiquity of neighbourhood of made so rare patchwork head tail prose verse proverb history story that a heard from man of real teaching learning who met once kept out of way ever after one trusting might sit down in chair of canute at king arthur table not that of neighbour must be worse for doing that only thought of frightened made unwilling to hearken much however if there be matter on hezekiah deserved to be heard doubt be upon be now delivering opinion to wit great inroad invasion of sand for mile along coast of there be very strange thing to tell of have made especial study having field at candleston with shed upon rick of hay disappeared in single night none be ever seen afterwards be only field have being left to by grandmother many people be

hezekiah said be true enough do believe having heard thing much to same purpose from own old grandfather coroner listened with more patience than have given credit for although told that brother perkins must have reserved learned speech for second inquiry be to be about death of five young men for to appeared that noble infant must lay blame of grievous loss not on sand upon sea hezekiah replied with great deference that cause in case be same for that movement of sand went on under sea even more than ashore hence fatal gulfing of ship andalusia loss of young lordship name have given ship surprised indeed felt sure that be quite wrong so said immediately without low consideration of what might be mine own interest coroner must not hearken to being much impressed now with learning wisdom of hezekiah perkins when hezekiah presented card beginning with horologist ending with king queen might have have verdict liked if have be upon trial therefore after calling in for sake of form two poor woman who found dead baby among sea weed have sevenpence apiece for doing so who cried while that talked in welsh having seen dear baby like not more than twenty year ago came in most unanimous manner under lordship guidance to following excellent verdict found drowned on pool tavan rock man child supposed to be two year old believed to be young nobleman from mark on pinafore high

justice people talk of thing perhaps idea doe good be that according to god will a always say when deprived of own at rate be bound to tell one little thing more about quest first about first one why be so vexed angry with foolish tongue when hezekiah began to speak only because knew full well that must lead to very thing be one desire to avoid if possible a may guess at once after what happened on stair be rude fetching exposing of dear little maid among so many common fellow to show baby corpse feared that must come to through own thoughtless blabbing about ickle bother in presence of hezekiah if ever man have hollow dry heart from over pumping of tongue have when hezekiah came in bearing in depth of fright wonder contempt of own delicate bardie have set back against door sworn that must not have crafty perkins have stolen out by door while humoured now pretty dear be awed hushed beyond cry even must not move foot a child do in kicking way trying to get a far a possible from

distance of silence took aback so much that have in witness of whom head man be there already for fear of being nervous so confusing testimony gave cordial after swearing everybody knew exactly what one of have to say must have be very hard might have done injury not to let say coroner having found need to charge except rummer left men for little while to deliberate verdict visitation of god of course must be stradling williams began to say visitation of almighty god of jury took pipe out of mouth nodded at while blew ring of smoke others nodded without trouble seemed going pleasantly when suddenly little fellow whose name be simon edward brother of primitive christian at least of minister being made pugnacious by ardent spirit rose holding arm of chair thus delivered sentiment speaking of course in native tongue head man brother of jury do altogether refuse deny goodness of judgment only judgment will certify be in lining of 'judgment of almighty god for rabbiting on sabbath day

slouching forward hand hung by side only deep eye shone without moving simon backed further further away without power to gaze elsewhere then evan thomas turned from without word so much a sigh looked at man have power to meet cold quietness of regard not having thought much about trouble have nothing at to say to after waiting for to begin finding one ready spake few word to in welsh tone of voice seemed different noble gentleman be proud that poor hospitality plea make most of time god give for six of have seen white horse with word bowed head left shuddering in midst of heat of cordial for be known that men when prostrate by crushing act of god have power to foresee death of other men feel pity for to see white horse on night of new moon even through closed eyelid without sense of vision be surest sign of sure sign of death within twelvemonth therefore jury sate glowering at one man ready to make oath that evan eye be not on now there be thing beyond knowledge right of explanation in have pure true faith for instance flying dutchman whom have twice beheld already whom man may three time see then survive twelvemonth in of course have true faith for what can be clearer than eyesight many thing too brave seaman have beheld can declare a for landsman superstition scarcely cared to laugh at however strange enough be black evan said came true simon edward first went off by falling into newton wayn after keeping up too late at chapel after other five within twelvemonth in bed abroad gone to last account heartily glad be for part a one after other dropped off thus not to have served on second jury heartily sorry be also that brother hezekiah have not taken luck to behold white horse plain enough will be now to one who know part that after what evan thomas said way in withdrew from only desire jury have be to gratify with verdict to hasten home ere dark must fall man to walk by on road accordingly without more tobacco though took glass for strength returned following verdict find that five young excellent men here came name with mister to be lost on way to place of worship by mean of violent storm of sea jury can not separate without offering heartfelt pity crowner clerk changed to beympathy ' to bereaved affectionate parent save king after went home took good leg to keep up with along priest lane in of darker place especially where white cow came looked over gate for milking time must not help laughing although not wholly free from uneasiness grieved that joint be not a nimble a of simon edward while frightened one like so many child

found that church clock must be seen to very first thing in morning chapter xvi truth lie sometimes in well following morning happened so that did not get up over early not assure from undue enjoyment of grand crowner quest partly because tide for fishing must not suit till afternoon partly because have worked hard long at jolly sailor in fulfilment of pledge from there be escaping when promised on night before to grease tune violin display true practice of hornpipe rash enough promise be on account of dear wife memory thing bad people must say of for sad uneasiness created by black evan prophecy need of lively company to prevent seeing white horse fear of parish might have prevailed with over fear of landlord hence began rather shyly when first tune have be received with hearty applause from room how must allow to be clapped on back then be lazy now bunny be tugging clamouring for bit of breakfast almost before be wide awake when latch of cottage door be lifted in walked hezekiah almost other man must have be more welcome for though have not spoken of on day before be sure to annoy sooner later about fish have forced to sell when matter be over done with surely man in common sense have right to reopen question time to find fault with fish in conscience be before have bought having once done that be now own to blame be to find fault with mercy gave money to buy foolish thing a well because be running down own property spoiling relish for conduct like be below contempt even more ungraceful ungracious than of man who spread abroad fault of own wife hezekiah however on occasion be not quite so bad a that errand according to light be of friendly nature for pried round little room with extremely sagacious leer then gazed at with dark cock of eye glanced askance at bunny managed to wink like commodore ship beginning to light poop lantern speak out like man said be wife confined with prophecy what be matter with hepzibah prophetess be well prophecy be abiding fulness of fulfilment must speak with on very secret important matter concerning also revealing then will send child away here bunny run ask mother jones will not do will not speak here wall be thin wall have ear come down to well with well be lump of wall answered child almost always near there be child have be down well be dry child know better place can be for speaking looking down across churchyard perceived that be right so left bunny to dwell on breakfast went with hezekiah among sandhills there be one for fright have fallen on everybody since sand began to walk a general folk now declared of nobody looked at sandhill now with other feeling than towards grave tombstone even heart be little heavy in spite of scientific point when straddled over stone led into sandy passage after came hezekiah groping with grimy hand calling out for to stop until must have hold of however left to follow darkness in wake of own idea better place for secret talk in parish full of echo scarcely must be found perhaps except old red house on shore so waited for perkins to unfold a soon a stood on bottom step with three four yard of quicksand dip for pitcher below child knew that well be dry of perhaps be gone to try to learn letter what then be disappointment a gradually came out that so far from telling secret hezekiah object be to deprive of own however if say happened nobody can grumble in first place manoeuvred much to get weather gage of by setting so that light slanted down grey slope must gather upon honest countenance for part a man unwarned how far might become duty to avoid excess of accuracy took liberty to prefer le conspicuous position not have lie to tell might be glad to hear therefore stuck to pleasant seat upon very nice sandy slab where light so shot wavered that badly inquisitive man might seek in vain for flush flickering of most delicate light of be cast by heart mind of man into face of man upon whole must scarcely be said at least a concerned hezekiah that truth be to be found just now at bottom of well dear brother dyo gently began with most brotherly voice manner have pleased lord who doe thing aright to send to for counsel now a well a for comfort beloved dyo have be at service answered very heartily looking for something about wife always enjoying thing of kind among righteous fellow heard that hepzibah have taken up under word of lord with shakersb brother david have wrestled hard in night season about have come to pas wife to be sure said wife who be certified seven time a vessel for spirit to be sure always be then gad about so brother understand not desire to think evil hepzibah since last confinement be vessel for spirit to square of what be seven time seven be forty nine requires certificate be carnal calculation took beyond depth answered rather crustily word ended with letter a learned from catechism belong to by baptism unholy david shun evil word pray without ceasing swear not at in vision of night hepzibah hath seen terrible thing of thee why never went home last night hezekiah how can tell what wife dreamed said not when came to pas how must speak of yesterday before loose assembly well well out with be wonderful vision hepzibah prophetess being in trance deeply inspired of lord beheld following vision long lonely sea be spread before shining in moonlight smoothly in place strewed with gold man be standing on low black rock casting line drawing great fish out almost time cast then there arose from out water dear little child dressed in white carrying with hand cradle just like little maiden martha like dirty martha indeed be at very point of saying snapped lip saved small damsel approached fisherman presented cradle to with very trustful smile then said 'be gold ' said 'no be only white lily upon shouted 'be off with ' child fell into desolate hole groped about vainly for cradle then light faded out of sea wave rock began moaning fisherman fell on knee sought in vain for cradle while be moaning came satan bearing cradle red hot crackling seized poor man by blue woollen smock laid in cradle rocked till shriek awoke hepzibah hepzibah be certain that be man to hear in sudden manner quite took breath away for minute so that fell back knocked head purely innocent a be presently began to hope that prophetess might be wrong time more so because vile trance of hers might have come from excessive enjoyment of good fish of mine grew upon more more more disliked prediction about that if have such inspiration scarcely must have sent hezekiah to buy supper from four legged table therefore spoke without much loss of courage brother hezekiah there be something wrong with hepzibah send pray to dr ap yollup before prophesies anything more blue woollen smock have worn summer canvas jacket only more often striped jersey be sandy macraw have seen in dream with devil roasting rocking glory be to lord for glory be to dyo whichever of two be hope that may have be sandy hepzibah be always accurate even among fisherman even fisherman answered being little touched with wrath know folk understood folk can not even fisherman have right especially when reduced to not to be blasphemed in way even by prophetess dyo be hot again what make go on so friend advice be such thing nearly always take unless find big obstacle dyo now be advised by depends on how like be best

especially bring forth brother accursed thing thou hast hid in thy tent wedge of gold shekel of silver babylonish garment thou hast stolen dissembled also put even among thine own stuff cast from thee deliver up lay before ark of lord hepzibah will fall down pray lest thou be consumed burnt with fire like son of carmi son of zabdi covered over with great heap of stone even such a be wrath at foul accusation daring attempt to frighten be kindled so that must not speak if have happened in open air must have be certain to knock down however began to think for perkins be litigious fellow however strict man conduct be doe not want affair exposed therefore kept knit knuckle at home justly felt strong indignation perkins thought have terrified for perhaps in bad light looked pale so began to triumph upon need a everybody know better man than hezekiah come come brother dyo said in voice quite different from chapel scriptural style have used see know about two dear child come ashore one dead other not dead contrive to receive with accustomed poaching skill for everybody say that be always to be found everywhere except in chapel on sabbath day now david what do good people having

worse than conceal truth even from ancient friend there must be great deal to be made from who must hold in trust from in whose way stood for family died out very likely in male inheritance think what might make of by acting under direction will have half of old davy by relieving mind behaving in sensible religious manner came home to sense of experience more than hepzibah divine prediction production at same time saw that hezekiah be abroad in dark groping right left after bodily truth what call have to cry share with because have more reputation higher conceit of of course crossed mind that nasty fellow being perhaps in front of in little trick of machinery might be useful afterwards in getting at real truth often kept awake at night only be quite resolved not to encourage roguery

have never set eye before felt that must be magistrate chapter xxi cross examination justice of peace although appointed by majesty have never be comfort to saving only colonel lougher never seem to understand to make out desire to take at word a much a take at desire have always be to live in painfully loyal manner to put up with petty insult from customer who know better leaving to self reflection if possible to repentance while go peaceful way let hear money jingle even spend in sight to be pleased trustful also with folk who trust in rather to abandon much give back twopence in shilling than cause purchaser self reproach for having sworn falsely before bench now if must not do to keep out of session book can man point out clearer proof of vicious administration of what call justice around part when trumpery case be got up on purpose to worry plague only chance left of fair play be to throw up day work wear out shoe in trudging to candleston court to implore good colonel

to look feeling be truly virtuous be lost upon sir philip will forgive good sir hope said to squire anthony unless be come with charge against mr llewellyn be hardly fair to reopen awkward question of

thoroughly typical character be not typical character answered over hastily for found out afterwards what meant never tipple when drink rule be to go through with squire stew laughed loud at mistake a if have be great scholar even sir philip smiled little in sweet lofty manner doubt be vexed for moment scenting though must not see error on own part now might defy ever to write book a for vanity have always be so foreign to nature that be sure to do best after think nothing of so long a people praise now in spite of rude speech if sir philip have only come without squire anthony not thing of happened must have retained from be hopeless for people to say that boat crippled speech on part tush must have pulled plug out on tail of tuskar rather than one moment stand against light for bardie squire stew asked sort of question having more substance in than blowing hole at end of egg bladder of skate fish of answered boldly finding foot outside shoe so came back again a do after trying foolish excursion to very point started with be to understand good fellow that ship at least allow to be wrecked may have be might have be something like foreigner therein lie point whereon worship

never must face sandhills road ever be ever can be to porthcawl so that two worthy gentleman need must exert noble leg for at least one half of distance knowing that squire stew sol be soft thought blessing for to improve only soft part about chapter xxii disappointment highly pleased with reflection what did do take pipe sit like lord at own doorway having sent poor bunny with smack to bed because have shown curiosity for leading vice of female race can not be too soon discouraged now began to fear almost that must be growing too dark very soon for to see what became of carriage returning with two worship moreover felt that have right to let go so easily without even knowing sir philip surname what might be especial craze have led to honour so sundry other consideration slowly prevailed over until must have gone sore with mind to be kept in dark concerning so when heavy dusk of autumn drove in over notch of sandhills from far away of sea green of grass be gone hardly

for tinder box did happen to come across man whose evil deed be always being saddled upon found respectable worthy scotchman whose name be alexander macraw who told more in about five minute than got out of in hour more have given stronger reason to hope that may be on right track at last to explain most painful mystery relieve sir philip from most cruel suspense anxiety at word of squire anthony tall grey gentleman with velvet coat bowed must fain have spoken feared perhaps that voice must tremble macraw think highly probable justice stew continued that ship though doubtless foreigner may have touched on opposite coast for supply after long ocean voyage though sir philip have seen boat considers quite stranger prof nothing way a boat of course must belong to ship one very simple speedy way there be of settling question thought proper to conceal fact that coroner have committed to charge a foreman of jury precious jury must have be so a to preserve near spot in case of inquiry dress

manner to feel that here be sorrow beyond depth covered sense of like gentleman by petty talk with made almost respect to find that dropped banter a out of season presently tall grey gentleman recovered from loss of hope with fine brave face regarded voice be firm very sweet be not right for to cause pain by anxiety fear that will condemn for dwelling upon overmuch mr stew already know friend have right to know after kind ready help that be not only piteous loss of two little innocent child very dear one of also loss of fair repute to honourable family cruel suspicion cast upon fine brave fellow who must scorn sir who must scorn for wealth of kingdom to hurt hair of baby head here sir philip voice be choked with indignation more than sorrow sat down quickly waved hand a much a to

ignominy be not pleased with time be at order took care to let know must have fought with pleasure if rule of service allowed enough of uncomfortable discontent soreness hardest point be for very great man to begin to set forth greatness must not at moment see why horatio nelson must thus sweep off with lead so after have once established what be what meant there be more jealousy to will come in proper place be only now picking up crumb a be chewing small job honourably against one thing must guard captain drake be never for moment jealous of captain nelson be one of thing annoyed most when looked down on boreas must gladly have have good turn with fellow who assumed such air to to find that beloved captain be a full of nelson a worst of boreas one of men who went on strongly took six dozen mistake acknowledged how well deserved be way to do thing make of one family be time for now to crowd sail for spithead a did at last seven round year two month be gone since have seen old

thence to secure passage be easy enough in summer time by one of stone boat to newton nottage felt that might have come home in grander style than be like to be yet be better than begging way scarcely man must hope to be landed twice in life at native village from man of war of course if master rodney bluett have still be with must have seen to return be proud of have be forced to leave having

precedence of hung back for other fellow to pretend to if dared saw exactly how stood being now a master mate superior officer to put at ease by showing that must not be too grand thus being in happy mood desirous to make best of thing must not help letting captain go to dwell upon own fortune not that failed of desire to help that own business pressed gunner heaviside led down to little cabin set up by on very brink of tawe high water mark a place of retirement when hard pressed unable to hold own in bosom of family may well be surprised for be more be downright astonished to find that be old ferry boat set up like dog begging on shore with poop channelled into sand side eked out with tarpaulin snugger berth never saw for quiet man to live in though heaviside scorned to tell disdained to ask that a guessed from first be true meaning of poor fellow have be seduced felt for temptation when came fresh from salt water rolling idea of woman into rapid matrimony with sharp nanette ought to have known much better ought to have given warning when have made up mind to settle thought be something solid gave name a may have said of good substantial farmer daughter owning at least good cow apiece from date of majority also having sheet blanket a told many time picked goosefeathers enough for two yet must go throw away upon nanette so when came to hear case for moment must not admit that

friend heaviside who have led from like experience into wholly different thing showed little of again before whale oil light began to splutter bubble too violently society quite renewed hope of getting away again especially when explained to that according to long acquaintance with law one must hold accountable for quantity of child frenchwoman might happen to have alien to wit foreigner worst of frenchwoman must not expect froggy confinement to hold good in england have committed foolish unloyal act in buckling to with alien enemy deserved to pay out for thought coxswain tom be of

gladly tell knew about of other people appeared to to be perfectly fair offer jerry tom took little offence on account of not knowing neighbourhood a superior officer of three insisted upon silence especially a from old time knew what villany might be around a soon a heaviside must descry quite clearly what tack stood upon distinctly gave pledge to be open a day therefore filled pipe again took fresh light for looked at one while old chap told story please to mind that have picked up prawn netful of little trifle such a never must stoop to scoop because won such chance through way woman

small thing took fancy be shaping course for narnton court where intended to sling own hammock jack a well if agreeable durst not offer to introduce dick joe for cause aforesaid moreover have not yet acquired manner of good society be little insisted upon in sir philip bampfylde kitchen therefore thought very clever when settlement of question suddenly occurred to be le than to settle under old ferry boat if still to be found a two year back shored up turned into residence ration might be sent down to what happier home must wish for with finest air in world around a well a beautiful scenery if must happen to leak little a seems only natural what blessed reflection for man of due sentiment towards lord that water be dropping from heaven upon instead of rushing up to swallow into outrageous sea accordingly so contrived affair mr jack wildman be introduced under skilful naval tactic into most accomplished circle on quarter deck of head cook looked so very gently wild blushed in clothes so beautifully that there be not maiden over place longed to glance unbeknown at so that seemed most lucky thing that polly be down with small pox at place called muddiford wherein have uncle meanwhile cannibal dick joe lived in boat a happily a if have be born in devoted time to slaying cooking of sir philip hare rabbit be in vain that gamekeeper did best to catch dick joe must catch hare a boasted to almost under watcher nose so noble be result of uniting civilised cunning with savage ingenuity can well believe that other man of rank age must have ventured on step now did resolve upon be le than to pay visit to poor little polly risk probability of being disfigured by small pox for several time have crossed mind that although be among relative be not like father mother to perhaps might be poorly tended even in need of money perhaps for very own aunt mr cockhanterbury must not go nigh almost shuddered when name be mentioned now seemed to be only fair honest to let sir philip know intention so that might if must see fit forbid to return to mansion bringing risk of infection general only shook head smiled at idea if be will of god will have of course said people run into more by being over timorous have often thought sinful to mistrust lord so however have better keep smoking pipe not stay more than five minute perhaps might just a well change clothes before come back sink others to air for week in river be grieved to see so entirely place faith in providence for kind of feeling when thus overdone end in what call fatalism such a very turk have so that be pleased when called back said take swim llewellyn hear that can swim five mile attempt that swim two if like swim back to from barnstaple bridge will have boat to meet with wholesome wardrobe thus be whole of arranged carried out most cleverly took poor polly bunch of grape from one of narnton vinery a well a number of nice little thing such a only sailor can think of truly went not day too soon for found in weak condition after fury of plague be past when bit of strengthening stuff can be thought of fancied by feeble one may turn scale one cheering glance one smiling word be a good a beam of morning then after long walk made swim change of clothes exactly a general have commanded in fortnight afterwards where be why under boat in burning madness without soul to come nigh except jack wildman sir philip two with most noble courage visited through sad attack of small pox a be told thereafter although at time knew one at distance around boat ring of brushwood be kept burning day night to clear air warn unwary from entering everybody gave up for living christian more coffin be ordered at handsome figure a death upon narnton premise ay made also like of greatest man that ever did meet with not only two nonconformist preacher found out a always do in weak period of life when dissatisfied with pension have be washed away by poor wife into scupper of dissent therefore prepared two sermon on judgment of lord called scapegoat while goodness know what care took never to lay hand on chapter lvii many weak moment nothing le than steadfast faith ancient british constitution can have enabled to survive highly dappled period be not in body only leg part think nothing of in brain that felt most when have sense to feel having brain have right to claim exemption from proper work because of being under average happened to take long time to recover from so many spot striking inwards empty headed man might have laughed at little drill into brain pan with a with good bee hive early in october there must not be prick of brad awl went into honey so brain be in buzz for at least twelvemonth afterwards therefore now must tell what happened rather a be told to than a remember only must not expect such truth a always give while competent after master of ship defence have proved so unable to defend general sir philip bampfylde with large quiet mind forbidding intrusion opened out little of goodness to jack wildman there be men of highest station of noble intellect who do can not help when meet fellow man with something in like there be vanity in even desire to conciliate only little touch of something understood between now being brought so together perhaps by common kindliness with door of death wide open a be before well born highly nurtured baronet lowly neglected ignorant savage found perhaps more clearly from contrast something harmonious in other at rate have good deal of talk by side of lonely river where even lighter kept aloof hugged to utmost opposite shore general finding much amusement in poor jack queer simplicity strange remark upon men thing must often relax without losing of accustomed dignity so while be speaking of death one day jack looked at sir philip with air of deep compassion feeling told with tearful eye how heartily be grieved at one thing being pressed a to what be answered that be sir philip wealth because said be sad when think that must go to hell sir go to hell sir philip exclaimed with good deal of rather unpleasant surprise why must do jack never thought that entertained so bad opinion of honour said jack having picked up of correct expression be not be god almighty be told afore ever learned to read ever heard of reading how be so be in bible now poor men go to heaven rich men go to hell must be so to be fair for general have too much sense to attempt to prove opposite must have thought no more about if jack have dropped subject to do at proper moment requires great civilisation while on other hand jack sought comfort needle to men of refinement honour must go there said with nod of head be meant to settle there be one of race family word of sort employed for scarce must have come to knowledge of thing hereditary who will go to heaven many be gone there already too many answered sir philip devoutly tell whom mean jack do mean son captain know better than that be plain where must go to captain disloyal fellow why ought to be lashed to triangle who be be thinking of know know said jack nodding head more must sir philip get out of whenever tried to begin again jack wildman be more than match for by feigning not to understand by other of many trick nature supply for self defence to savage against civilised if have be well must have shelled poor jack meaning out of whereas on other hand for illness might never have spoken so came to pas that be sent entirely at sir philip cost with handsome gratuity to rejoin captain in plymouth sound to carry back cannibal dick joe who have scoured away at great speed upon hearing of sudden misfortune now will tell very strange thing quite out of experience even after small pox enlarged filled with charity a well a what have scarcely room for increase of humility be that though captain bampfylde have little spare time at plymouth have such command of that never went near beloved isabel nothing must have so checked man of heartiness bravery except strongest power of honour long time of chastisement there be lovely young woman here fine though middle aged man husband loved one with heart soul never met through telescope may have be right may have be wrong must have thought wrong perhaps if case have be own pledged honour kept drake bampfylde like father have strength of trust in providence trust have landed security now that lord have found world so clever that need not interfere with gun ship defence be known to be fastest sailer in british navy not from build alone balance from careful trim of sail knowledge of how to handle hour hour spent aloft among lift brace clue garnet marking draw of sail righting useless bellying so must now have warranted first of navy to break line if rigged according to direction

master a might have be expected fell to leeward one knot in three even worse than befell for in second of two miserable action under hotham in year when even nelson must hing defence having now captain a well a stupid master actually backed mizzen topsail in rear of enemy when signal be to fill stand on however a even that famous ship agamemnon did nothing day through getting opportunity must forgive poor heaviside especially a be not captain one who ground teeth hardest must forgive nobody be honourable rodney bluett now first lieutenant of defence by time one must desire to know why captain bampfylde be not there a might have be might have made famous for usual ill fortune have carried to east indie before defence have finished refitting there with none of old hand near commanded line of battle ship under commodore rainier after hard work very fine fighting drove brave dutchman out of castle of trincomalee in august came to hear of afterwards thus be that everybody seemed to

by providence to humble individual who came from newton nottage for with history have patience at because always contradicts very thing have seen known be bound to believe man of such high principle deep reading a master roger berkrolles tell have helped to produce greatest of great victory be that one way other can tell word concerning how managed need not for one moment think capable of prejudice contrary assure there must not have be in british fleet man more determined to do justice to crappos than thoroughly ancient navigator now master of goliath knew exactly what to do captain master quarter master even powder monkey have proper work laid out for spirit of nelson ran through heart caught fire from heart from moment of first glimpse at frenchman spread out in tempting manner

that glamorganshire man born in favoured part of quiet village of n n enough unless add internal evidence will convince unprejudiced person that none ancient fisherman thorough going long shore man

running down holding up to ridicule out of pure contrariety just because one else overvalues there be better men in world than there be wiser there be braver will not be argued down about there be be sure a honest in way few almost a truthful however never yet did come across other man half so modest be forced to allude to now in departure from usual practice because quality nothing else have prevented from dwelling upon far more from following up shrewd thought have occurred to loosely own in random manner still have occurred to once twice have be dismissed why so simply because trusted other men judgment public impression instead of own superior instinct knowledge of weather tideway how bitterly repented now of ill founded diffidence when a lay in chop of channel about end of october with nasty head wind baffling captain rodney bluett came on board of from leader asked if doctor must report master a strong enough to support interview whereupon worthy bone joiner laughed showed into where sate at latter end of fine aitch bone of beef then captain rodney produced paper told whole of story be deeply moved by jack wildman death though edified much by manner of of last observation for naked heathen to turn so soon into trousered christian still more good fore top man be evidence of unusual grace even under such doctrine a mine be captain bluett spoke much of although religious conviction be not by mean so intense a mine while sinew be under treatment even with only one arm quarter seemed to be better fitted to handle event than young captain be ability be of common order a have proved by running frigate under very chain of thundering big frenchman so that must not be down on yet must not see bearing of jack wildman evidence have long talk with hot rum water for evening already be chilly natural candour carried almost into too much of honourable rodney gazed with flush of colour at when gave opinion like raking broadside may be right said be always so wonderful at long shot llewellyn really doe seem impossible captain answered how many thing seem so yet come to pas continually can not gainsay llewellyn after experience of world must give life to find true how be to establish leave alone for captain bluett if can be done will be done idea be entirely own remember have never occurred to have certainly not replied with usual downright honesty reason for coming to with poor fellow dying testimony be chiefly to cheer up with proof of old captain innocence to show turn of luck for young harry who have long be so shamefully treated now have thing to tell about be if have not heard have heard nothing at did not even know what have become of until read jack confession with nelson on board vanguard be doing said honourable rodney

mutual esteem parted only stipulated for good talk with about measure when must have determined at latest on reaching port boldest counsel be often best naturally recommends to man of warlike

magistrate dare to deny then hale off to prison if law permitted hang that be too good for one who have read word must acknowledge best thing moreover must befall for body be good though soul be bad might have hope to redeem latter at expense of former if have not through life looked forward to hanging a latter end salvation be quite impossible to account for licence allowed however on second thought perceived that really weighty concern before what be bound to think first of be to restore such fine old family to health happiness to reinstate before died that noble most kind hearted man full of religious feeling also of confidence that lord having made good man must look after be very spirit of king david when self respect return in word to replace in world esteem what matter far more in true family love fine pure old gentleman much troubled sir philip bampfylde say be very first duty of fellow nursed by general baronet through small pox while be also feat well worthy of

afterwards how do do captain rodney bluett madam hope that see well lady bluett be amazed at coolness of in heart disappointed although be trying to argue down to say to herself how wise of knew how colonel loved young maid yet never must bear to think of nephew taking to wife mere waif of sea lady have faith in herself that might in end overcome prejudice of course if young one have ceased to

lieutenant accustomed to examine evidence seems very likely said colonel lougher a waited for opinion that david llewellyn be most shrewd fellow ought to have said more about boat there be one thing however to be done at once to collect confirmative evidence there be thing to be done at once cried rodney bluett warmly to pull chowne nose despite cloth will do roundly young friend said lord lieutenant prove first then think there be people who must pardon chapter lxiii polly at home lest one must be surprised that sir philip bampfylde must have paid two visit to delightful neighbourhood without calling on leading gentleman own fellow officer colonel lougher in case question concerning delushy must have be sifted long ago have better say at once what be that stopped when general thought just worth while though hope be faint about to inquire into twisted story of wreck on coast a given by celebrated felix farley first authority applied to be coroner bowles who have held inquest coroner bowles told knew half of be wrong of course by mean of hezekiah gave letter to anthony stew a most active penetrating magistrate of neighbourhood nothing must have be more unlucky not only did stew baffle desire to be more candid than day by official brow beating antipathy between not only did stew like over sharp fellow trust one of biggest rogue unhung in unregenerate dissenting day before gave six dozen certainly proved salvation be sorry to say such thing of present good neighbour 'kiah here be now subscribes to hezekiah perkins whose view of shipwreck learned disquisition on sand misled poor coroner of jury except so blindly that drowned five young men smothered baby not only did stew say get thus far in bewilderment of subject utterly ruined chance of clearing by keeping sir philip from candleston court if ask how can only say in common fairness to anthony stew who be lately gone poor fellow to be cross examined by somebody sharper even than one to whom must never afford material for unpleasant question by speaking amiss of man in power especially when so needle in word to treat stew a hope to be treated by survivor admit that may not have wished to keep sir philip away from colonel former having once accepted stew keen hospitality tried to eat fish might have bettered have known of being there felt with usual delicacy that ought not to visit man at feud with host whose salt very little else be then enjoying for mr stew be more bitter of course than even husband against colonel lougher roundly abused very first evening of sir philip stay with so

with bunny however now cried very severely in great measure meant leaving newton nottage sker even bridgend to consider matter with pleasing divergence of fact conclusion find duty however repugnant to speak once more of humble self in adversity native dignity true grandeur of cambria have always united against own feeling to make almost confident at rate able to maintain position knock under to nobody in prosperity drop extreme affability native longing to give pleasure mark deportment towards world almost never commit assault in fine desirable frame of mind arrived at narnton court once more sooner perhaps than captain bluett having so much further to go burst in on friend at candleston although have given story precedence not only on account of higher rank because of hurry be in on

settled between captain bluett that fortnight be to be allowed for hunting up evidence before must cross channel unless took on to fetch polly opened blue eye to such size at told that became quite uneasy lest must open mouth in proportion for if discovery once took wind before entire completion there must be at least fifty jealous fellow thrusting oar into own rowlock robbing of own private

a cork to men be apt to judge too much by experience on subject when ought to know experience never doe apply to woman more than reason doe nevertheless polly saw way in out of lot of thing to be difficult especially a to manner of handling cousin mr shapland very good woman in way ticklish one to deal with credit for truth get out of mr shapland belongs not to more than go down in lump to poor polly to pas lightly a now behoves just let tell what susan shapland said when worked out of man can get truth out of woman if know way mean of course so far a have be able to receive to expect

nothing le than royal clothes manifest high rank in navy must have induced fine old pilot to make sail for opposite coast in month of november when violent gale be so common with showed two alternative three golden guinea on one hand impressment on other for press gang be in neighbourhood now told be captain that laughed at certificate not being sure that man son might not combine to throw overboard steal money run back to port took care to let perceive entry of name own a well in register of coast guard however proved very honest fellow anchored under porthcawl point soon after dark that evening having proved to pilot that be quite safe here unless must come on to blow from south east of there be symptom leaving under care of sandy who at expense stood treat to made off for candleston not even stopping for chat with roger berkrolles colonel of course a well a sister lady bluett rodney wore delighted with what have to tell while maid herself listened with face concealed to tale of own misfortune once twice whispered to herself oh poor poor father when have ended rose from sofa where lady bluett arm be around went to colonel said how soon will take to father darling bertha said colonel embracing a if have be daughter will start to morrow if llewellyn think weather quite settled boat quite safe know so much about boat see must take week to go round by land wo start at if cry dear did not altogether like tone of colonel allusion to still le be pleased when interrupted lady bluett congratulation thanks fervent praise of skill perseverance trustiness in discovering villany humph said colonel be not quite sure that villany must have succeeded so long unless certain small boat have proved so adapted for fishing purpose why henry cried sister how very unlike what unworthy insinuation after mr llewellyn have done be positively ungrateful spoke of boat in very room a can perfectly well remember not oh not be sure more than very few year ago dear exactly said colonel too few year ago if have spoken of at time a distinctly a did afterwards when heat of inquiry be over when sir philip have abandoned see how confusion between loss of foreign ship casting away of british boat must have arisen at rate must have failed to be cleared away llewellyn know that judge hastily sir condemn conduct oh colonel how dreadful of mr llewellyn go look at weather while prove to colonel great mistake did speak of boat at very inquest in most noble positive manner nobody must believe a very self told what more must man do be none of safe if do very best have turned against conscience time be beating so that must hear be gift very good men have have made point of never failing to cultivate in trying moment with even man so kind blameless suddenly possessed doubt by evil spirit against stanch a rock conscience stood to support rose creditably for of colonel lougher answer be will regret attack on honour of british officer one moreover whose great grandfather harped in honour family captain bluett understands build of boat a well a do will look at boat to morrow morning if declares to be english built may set down with stripe medal for rogue sir if confirms surety of being foreigner nothing difference of rank will excuse colonel lougher from being responsible to spirit be up a may see honour of british navy forced to speak strongly although affection for man be such that sooner than offend must have other arm shot away llewellyn said colonel with fine old smile spreading very pleasantly upon noble countenance be of peppery order old welsh blood produce think more of word for present if nephew agrees with in pronouncing boat foreigner will give full satisfaction by asking pardon llewellyn be enough to mislead man not to dwell upon mistake committed by so good man got abroad somehow though old friend crumpy be sure must never have be listening at door be enough in hurry to say that on next morning be enabled to certify weather smartish breeze from north north west with sea rather dancing than running took poor bardie to native coast from hot tide have borne before set sail have be to sker in colonel lougher two wheeled gig obtained from good moxy child jemmyset from old oak chest be stored in now did thing must for ever acquit of blame so wrongfully cast upon be to say fetched out old boat sandy macraw have got covered up releasing in most generous manner from year year of backrent what did do hitch on to stern of pilot yawl for to tow not only managed that rodney must sail on board a skipper for crew must have somebody who have crossed channel before in same poor worthless boat sixteen year agone do declare did carry on bit now then when sprit sail hid from view for day be bright sea be colonel be on board of yawl enjoying perfect harmony for captain rodney of course have confirmed opinion a to build of boat uncle desired to beg pardon largeness of nature quite refused to hear of if man admits that have wronged satisfied be at once even point out always that never must have done like to colonel lougher have often be at sea in time of active service seemed to enjoy trip across channel knew name of sail spar falling in a did with le than three four small craft on voyage asked how delushy boat must possibly have be adrift for whole night day on channel without ship even sighting told that be a simple a must be during state of weather burning haze steam from land lay time on water lower part thereof be white while upper spread be yellow also sea be white from long continued calmness so that white boat scarcely must show at mile of distance even if did what sailor be likely to keep smart look out in such roasting weather men talk of heat ashore sometimes know that for downright smiting blinding overwhelming sun power there be nothing ashore to compare with ship also told colonel now that faith in be re established gliding over water thus be enabled to make plain to thing if have be ashore might have lain perhaps little beyond understanding showed set of tide by tossing cork from bottle overboard begging to take glass of perspective to watch took such interest in evinced so much sagacity that in order to carry on reasoning with perspicacity cork after cork be forced to draw to establish veracity because must argue out that boat unmanned even unmasted never must have crossed channel a bardie boat must need have done answered that might have thought so also have done so for year year till there came fact to contrary of be pretty well satisfied now when boat be produced sworn to who must not be satisfied also begged to remind how strongly tide ran in channel even in common weather ebb of spring out of barnstaple river might safely be put at four knot hour till hartland point be doubled here about two in morning flood must catch little wanderer run up channel ten twelve mile with night wind on starboard beam driving also northward when be exhausted ebb must take into swansea bay almost being so light boat a be with southern breeze prevailing then next flood might well bring to sker exactly thing have come to pas moreover thought a told colonel although of course with diffidence from long acquaintance with tropical water power of sun upon thought by mean unlikely that intense heat of weather then for more than six week prevailing might have have strong effect on set speed of current however more of argument what good can do when thing be there reasoning can alter even parson chowne might argue doubt must with although too proud with other people that did be right a good man a need be ran across channel in six hour having nice breeze abaft beam about middle of afternoon landed at ilfracombe cleverly be little place lying in hole with great rock around fair enough to look at more easy to fall down than to get up even barnstaple road be so steep that first hill take nearly two hour of climbing therefore in spite of eager spirit found forced to stay there night for one must horse onwards so late at november season perhaps however be worth while to lose few hour for sake of seeing delushy joy in native land like newly opened spring arose must not contain a soon a foot touched shore began to look forward to bout of for understand young woman now very well though middle aged be beyond latter hope to be up to if ever live to age of fourscore year a constitution promise if lord must be pleased to promote to ripe honest century a be done to great grandfather then will understand old woman also though perhaps without teeth to express however be pretty thing touched very softly none who have roamed a have understand heart ache for native land have ever continually in roar of battle be borne up by discharging so must enter into poor bardie going about with tear in eye for must not allow to rest at inn a be fain to do in society of ancient fisherman to leave gentlefolk to own manner of getting through evening come out cried old davy be only one know way about lovely place of course have choice to obey sir philip own granddaughter although must not help grumbling thus began to explore lane a crooked a corkscrew with fern like palm tree feathering in among little trickling rill of water tinkled be hushed sometimes by moss looked a if frost must enter through leafy screen above what country to be born in what country to belong to exclaimed maid continually sipping from crystal runnel stroking fern with reverence uncle henry think now that be enough to make one happy to belong to land well dear said uncle henry a have be ordered to call colonel think must still more conduce to happiness for of land to belong to ah llewellyn see be of opinion so be still more so next day when having surmounted that terrible hill travelled down rich dairy valley on road to barnstaple here halted for refreshment to let delushy rest beautify although must see need of now began to get so frightened that be quite vexed with first duty be to do credit how must manage if eye be red colonel also began to provoke for when wanted to give maid stiff glass of grog to steady have more sense than to countermand order glass of cold water a soon a came to narnton court found very smart coach in yard that quite put to shame hired chaise although good colonel have taken four horse so a to land in moderate style of course be proper that who alone must claim sir philip acquaintance a well a merit of whole affair must have pleasure of introducing new grandchild to so that begged rest to withdraw only name that sent in be captain llewellyn miss delushy therefore be wrong doubt in feeling first little grievance then large minded impatience finally strong desire ay not desire alone to swear before got out of speak of captain bluett two good honest sailor accustomed to declare meaning since war enabled colonel lougher who might be said from want of active service to belong to past generation a well a delushy who be scarcely come into generation yet two really set example good though hard to follow chapter lxvi maid at last be dentified however a too often happens blamed good man without cause good man rarely deserves much blame whereas bad man can not have too much whether have earned otherwise to restrain from deserving more reason why sir philip bampfylde kept so long waiting proved to be sound valid one namely that be engaged in earnest important converse with daughter in law lady bampfylde now wife if will please to remember to commodore sir drake bampfylde although by birth entitled honourable isabel carey one have be so good to when be ferryman of superior order certainly still more than ferryman since rise in world began have found out one satisfactory thing that man get on by merit how long did despair of smoke pipe think over seeing many of friend advancing by what call roguery for war prof heart rein of men a ancestor say might still have be high dry being too honest for fish trade however true merit will tell in end if man contrives to live long enough so when beautiful lady came out through room where sate waiting a touched venerable forelock to a humbly a if for sixpenny piece brave man honest pride wrought weakness in eye a gazed at loved husband loved thought of bitter luck between have kept separate partly of course glory of england duty of proud man birth partly also bad luck of course style of giving in to ten time more than trick lower fellow creature noble stately lady did not at first sight recognise when have told in very few word who be what have done how long have sailed with husband how highly respected eye brightened into old sweet smile although bore trace of weeping name be not 'lady carey said for be calling thus on purpose not knowing how be taking wedlock being of opinion that honourable miss ought always to be called lady name be 'lady bampfylde like if please although remember mr llewellyn what view be of matrimony used to declare only too plainly whenever crossed ferry for purpose a used to think of driving poor nanette to despair of lucky thing for ladyship to have acted so consistently honour commodore of course hold opposite opinion be hard to guess opinion of commodore always on service sir drake a daresay have heard can scarcely bear to come home now saw that be vexed by something also vexed with perhaps for having even hinted for turned beautiful face away without word must have left with usual quickness of step ran into lobby place back in moment with delushy clinging like woodbine to post at such moment never speak until woman begin with question save so much time to let begin because be sure to insist on meanwhile delushy be making prettiest curtsy presence of mind permitted lovely dear why who be cried lady bampfylde with start made dread hysteric know madam answered delushy with whole of mind so well in hand by reason of year of suffering many people believe to be bertha bampfylde be lost nearly twenty year agone what baby baby at least one of baby husband david llewellyn be very cruel of be thanks got while what must have done otherwise in five minute more must have be off in grand coach with six horse after offending sir philip so much that must not have borne to look after although of course be now coming out like gentleman to visitor seeing such pay night coming large confusion begged colonel lougher captain bluett to keep for little while out of nothing must more truly prove how thoroughly be gentleman than that withdrew to niche of under butler pantry wherein must hear word of be now place to stand forward bravely to put thing clearly without further loss of reason even without considering how delicate lady might contrive to take meaning nicely to spare good lady from emotion be one of main thing of life although show want of gratitude when have done utmost a for frightening sir philip of course have scruple about because of confidence in lord therefore abandoning lady bampfylde to care of maid who be running up from servant hall to look after fixed hook screwed on for purpose firmly into delushy sleeve that might not faint run away do anything else unreasonable led up long hall to meet sir philip a came down step at upper end thereof old general looked rather haggard feeble a if power of life be lowered by perpetual patience something have happened to vex doubt in interview with lady bampfylde so that walked with more than usual stateliness dignity have never beheld a one armed man yet in present uniform for took particular care to avoid during day two spent at house before went to burrington so for moment did not know gazed with surprise at lovely figure be sustaining so clumsily sir philip bampfylde allow said stretching forth right hand to to repay for of countless benefit have heaped upon by presenting with long lost granddaughter grandson to come afterwards can not be can not be be must say although for so many year have shown faith that must be fine old countenance turned a white a silver hair crowned then a red a must have be in hopeful blush of boyhood pure perfect delicacy of high birth quickened with sorrow prevented from examining delushy a longed to do speak up child speak up said giving haul with hook a when first landed ca tell dear grandfather how glad be to see will with heart maiden answered bashfully yet lifting eye to old man face with pride a well a reverence a soon a perceive that sir wish to hear say will not think rude be scarcely strong enough for have come on so suddenly must be quite a bad for lead young lady to chair llewellyn stay beg pardon will perhaps be better to call kind worthy housekeeper sir philip perceived thing have escaped though brought to notice beforehand by good colonel lougher be to say how hard must be upon feeling of young girl to have identity a crowner bowles entitled discussed in own presence therefore be led away by regular busybody housekeeper mr cockhanterbury while begged leave to introduce colonel lougher captain bluett to sir philip bampfylde then when have made bow due salutation be called upon to show document explain evidence so carefully gathered by be a much above power a beyond purpose to tell how ancient noble gentleman after so much worry from long neglect of providence took a if have never deserved goodness of lord to of course in class of life can not be always dwelling on child whose nature be provoking always in nothing more so than that will come when not wanted yet be not forthcoming with folk who can afford nevertheless think that if lord have allowed thief of fellow much more one of own minister to steal two grandchild of mine make savage of one baby of other castaway whole of piety must have be very hard pushed to produce gratitude sir philip however did appear most truly desirous to thank god for great mercy vouchsafed to even before have thoroughly gone through in out of evidence for begged to excuse while must go to see to comfort two fine bottle of wine white red appeared began to disappear under hatch mainly before noble host came back to set good example when came have quite forgotten to dust knee of fine kerseymere shin of black silk stocking deep sense of religion be quite in place when man have have one arm shot off still more so if arm be gone after leg indispensable nevertheless must not be intruded upon one not even by chaplain till doctor shake head knowing also that colonel lougher have tendency towards enough to stop decanter if must get upon subject with argument stick fast in be delighted to see delushy slipping into room a if have known place for century general clearly have managed to visit during time of absence from passed between

delicate waist hand took in a faced be struck with likeness between blooming youth worn yet majestic age gentleman said rather must call kind good friend have brought not only grandchild very one must have chosen if whole world gave choice by by will see stand by picture of dear long lamented wife that think will convince that want further evidence for thumb nail be enough bertha show thumb nail laughed usual merry laugh although have be cry so while spread dainty hand exactly a used to spread when be only two year old with alone to look at here be sir cried general overlooking in rush of sentiment towards colonel here be true bampfylde mark even basset have not traceys st albyns will oblige by observing that two thumb nail have most undoubted right left to bertha do try to keep still for moment well declare said colonel calmly taking out eye glass yes declare be right good sir here be most evident right left andalusia do stand still not only in half moon at base in vein what may call radiants of pinkness can not express meaning darling come kiss delushy did at once a for year used to do not being certain even now whether ought to forsake colonel for general though proved to be very fine newly turned up none of have thought of many shift of female wind coming to pas perhaps inside little brain heart so wherefore poor david who desire always to be last by force of nature be compelled for ever to take lead be who got off to bed that might talk of chapter lxvii dog eats dog to man whose time of life begin to be subject of consideration to when few year still in hope can be counted on hand may not need finger with tide of world ebbing to inevitable sea to there be scarcely sweet gentle pastime more delightful than to sit on bank of ancient moss beside tidal river watch decreasing water prove own eternity by casting pebble into hence be that sir philip bampfylde on very morning after gave back grandchild sate gazing into ebb of tawe fifty yard below spot whence jack wildman father carried off so wickedly that helpless pair of child here be privilege to come up to sir philip spread before humble reason for having preferred kitchen last night to dining room drawing room be consistent with nature though wishing otherwise agreed not to be offended then asked how young lady whose health one of have honoured all over kitchen table have contrived to pas night whether have seen father yet said have slept pretty well considering that a concerned father have not thought wise to let see until doctor came there be telling how might act upon squire philip constitution after so many year of misery cobweb desolation for providence have not gifted with mind so strong a father be sudden break in on death of mind have be known in such case to lead to bodily decease few thing vexed general more than wretched lie of chowne slander upon loyal family while in service of crown what captain drake have landed from boat be not arm chest chest of plate linen belonging to brother must no longer borrow while squire so cruelly dealt with then asked sir philip whether ancient builder over at appledore have be sent for to depose to boat for have brought that little craft on top of coach from ilfracombe general said that might see even now examining if must only take trouble to look round corner be so well convinced without further testimony that did not even care to hear what old man have to say of more than cared for jemmyset however be not manner of regarding question not from private fountain of conviction so on out of mouth of many witness will thing be established therefore hastened round corner to sift ancient boatwright a surly fellow a ever lived from repugnance to uniform one who have made more money doubt by smuggler keg than shipwright adze entering into nature at sight took upper hand of a rank insisted on hark ye now master ship carpenter where be little craft put together according to opinion either fellow be deaf a post else meant to insult for took more notice of than did of pig be snuffling at beech nut down by side of landing place be not right man to put up with insolence therefore screwed hammer head into
