view what position what aspect house have be there long enough to get used to be host reply be not built a be where live of substance of hat large old fashioned house look a if have be much larger stand just beneath crest of long backed hill in deep embrasure although stand so high see much le of sun than polestar be not quite so weather beaten a stranger must suppose have little protection definite outline for ground because be built on old extensive settlement of chalk thing unheeded in early time now very popular attractive under name of landslip of there be good many still to be traced on side of sussex hill caused a learned say by shifting of green sand silt generally underlies more stable chalk few however of be so strongly marked bold a one be known a coombe lorraine be mere depression irregular subsidence sheer vertical drop show a if broad slice have be cut out from chine to base of highland here in time of william rufus roland de lorraine having grant from from conqueror trusting soil to slide more ignorant that have ever slidden built dwelling place to keep look out on property abode doubt be fitted for warlike domesticity being founded in fine old time when gentleman be bound to build castle may have be that little jealousy of friend de braose who have taken larger grant of land although be of newer race have killed fewer men than sir roland led enterprising founder to set up tower so high at rate settled penates so commandingly that if bramber castle have be in sight might have looked down chimney a freely a into villein sheepcote bramber castle however happened to be round corner good knight end according to tradition of family be not so thoroughly peaceful a life of war must earn one gentle autumnal evening sir roland friend neighbour william de braose be riding home to quiet supper in excellent temper spirit pleasant contempt of country harvest moon be rising over breadth of corn in grant to sheep cattle tended by villein once owner congratulated other upon tranquil seizin goodwill of neighbourhood when suddenly way be stopped by score of heavy englishman in clumsy manner sued favour even justice only to be trodden down with fairness show of reason ye will be trodden alike de braose shouted fiercely having learned good deal of english from place lived in clod be made to be trodden down out of road draw sword men turned from to sir roland who be known to be kind of heart ye do wrong thing to meet thus answered in utmost english thing be to say hearken not with violence speaking thus spurred horse

strongly sped that pierced back harness passed through rein of roland de lorraine thus died descendant like to tell story be not true although maintained by descendant of de braose that be man be shot knight who ran away sir roland pious duty rendered by five brave monk from fcamp be for soul of sir roland a surely a arrow be for body of de braose after eight hundred year almost let benefit go between way may have chanced in age of unsettled principle sure be that good knight died then afterwards also that man be hanged at spot still shown in behalf that felt outrage on sense of justice after missing proper shot that even now be often seen when harvest moon be lonely straining long bow at something most careful not to shoot however be mere legend wherewith have nought to do must have be a well to leave in quiet slumber if must have be shown without how house be built up there also one may fairly fancy that sweet gallant knight may have found own vague pleasure in fine ample view regarding matter be perhaps little too hard on ancestor presuming that never owned such eye a ours for scenery because knew large impossibility of describing chapter iii lineage lineament whether father felt failed to see beauty beneath eye owner of house land at time have to speak of deserved have true respect of who dwelled below be often said that direct descendant bred from sire to son still exists at rate can show that have right to exist from knight even cook known to have come with conqueror question be one of delicacy therefore of deep feeling must be owned in candour upon almost side that there be people here there able to show something present sir roland lorraine must show a much in behalf a other man in england here be name here place here that more fugitive being man still belonging to of whether must be shown not strict red line of lineage sir roland lorraine be very last man likely to assert have own opinion on that important subject own little touch of feeling when matter came into bearing pride be of so large nature that seldom must be proud have pleasant vein of humour about almost everything wholly free from scoffing most sensitive of limit also although laid claim to extensive learning especially accurate scholarship reading have be various knowledge of classic have not be allowed to fade away into misty memory inasmuch a added to resource further recommendation of fine appearance gentle manner good position fair estate may be supposed that sir roland be in strong demand among neighbour for social purpose however through petty feeling small exclusiveness from own taste liking kept more more at home in quietude a grew older so that ere turned sixty year owner of coombe lorraine have ceased to appear at county gathering even at hospitable meeting of neighbourhood dinner party consisted only of daughter alice wife have be dead for many year mother lady valeria be still alive very active having just numbered fourscore year

son be now at temple eating way to bar feeding for other mischief alice only daughter living be baronet favourite companion darling now whether from purity of descent special mode of selection from living so long on hill with northern consequence from other cause to be extracted by philosopher from bestial analogy anyhow one thing be certain lorraine be not have not for long time be at like rest of world around be not pride of race made unambitious well content difficult to get at be other ill affection to mankind liked good man when saw naturally so much more a became harder to find also be very kind to poor people around kept well in with church did whatever else be comely long before sir rolands time sussex knew be content to know that a general rule lorraine went nowhere neighbour who be conscious of what must now begin to call co operative origin felt that though must claim justice of peace high sheriff knight of shire among kin yet must not quite leap over romantic bar of age be so deterrent perhaps because be so shadowy did greatly care to press company upon people so different from so unlikely to admire if one asked where lay root of difference so long have marked old family on hill perhaps one least of of lorraine must have given proper answer plenty of other folk there be who held aloof from public life simplicity kindness chivalry might be found by man with active horse in other place also even feeling a nearly akin a nature admits to contempt of money at time went on somewhere how then differed lorraine from other people of equal rank like habit with men who differ from fellow seem by law of nature to resent disclaim difference who be proud glory in variance from common type seldom vary much from so that in year of grace mighty comet that scared world spreading tail over good bad overhung house le conscious of anything under roof peculiar than house of coombe lorraine with lorraine there have be tradition ripened a tradition ripen into small religion that certain sequence of christian name must be observed whenever allowed by providence in heritage name in right order be roland hilary roger family have long believed so have tenant that certain sequence of character event depend upon character might be expected to coincide with succession of name rolands be always kindly proud fond of home of own people lover of quiet life rather deep than hot of heart hilary next of race be prone to opposite extreme though still of same root fibre sir hilary be always showy affable romantic eager to do something great pleased to give pleasure to everybody leaving child to count cost after there ought to arise roger saviour of race beginning to count penny in cradle growing yard in common sense for inch of stature frowning at idea be not either of land money weighing bride most of principle by troy weight chapter iv father favourite upon very important day a proved to be in little world th of june sir roland lorraine have enjoyed dinner with daughter alice in day men be not content to feed in fashion of owl wild duck who have lain abed day in winter summer at coombe lorraine dinner bell rang at past four for people to dress again at five for to be down in drawing room be sure to be prompt enough for air of southdown hill be hungry nature knew what demand must be before supplied best mutton there when worthy old butler be gone at last long dark room lay silent alice ran up to father side to wish over sip of wine good old wish sits so lightly on lip of child darling papa wish many happy happy return of day good health to enjoy sir roland be sixty year old that day being of cheerful even pleasant though shy temperament saw reason why must not have bliss invoked on one great element in happiness now be looking at undeniably present determined to remain so quick glance told that felt be not wont to show what felt now have particular reason to feel more than usual nevertheless did so feel without knowing reason turned eye away from hers while tried to answer lightly must not do for daughter alice be now in blush of time when everything be observed by maiden everything be not hinted at at least used to be so then still be so in good place therefore alice thought little before began to talk again only trouble to knowledge father have to deal with be unstable romantic character of young hilary never discussed with even alluded to for must have be breach of law in duly entailed conservatism that heir of house even though fool must have folly kept sacred from smile of inferior member now hilary be not at fool only young man of large mind knowing that father have not bad news of hilary from whom have received very affectionate letter morning alice be sorely puzzled scarcely ventured to ask question for in savage island then respect be shown reverence felt by child towards parent although petted child be full of fine sentiment also now in seventeenth year knew that have outgrown playful freedom of babyhood be not yet established in dignity of maiden much le glory of womanhood so that sunny smile be fading into shadow of sigh when instead of laying pretty head on father shoulder brought low chair favourite cushion of younger time thence looked up at hoping fondly once more to be folded back into love of childhood sir rolands trouble be did not engross thought so much a to make neglect favourite answered wistful gaze with smile knew to be quite genuine then patted curly hair in old fashioned way kissed forehead lallie look so profoundly wise will put into cap after in spite of sigh tear sob head so mature in wisdom must conform to wisdom of age papa be such hideous thing hate a much a do only other day said that even married people have right to make such fright of married people have right to please one only narrow view perhaps of justice however be different alice never will attend when try to teach anything sir roland broke off lamely thus because child be attending more than to what be talking of like other men be sometimes given to exceed meaning with daughter be always very careful of word because have lost mother none must ever make up difference papa cried alice with appealing stress upon paternity only pet child can throw be not at like to day dear most people differ from with great advantage will never think that of now let know opinion a to matter darling father softened off ending suddenly thus because saw young girl eye begin to glisten a if for tear at strange new way what matter papa cap oh way be now behaving very well then be quite sure can bear to hear have done amiss dear be not at sure will try to endure most heartrending exaggeration then dear papa will have only tell when to stop in first place did did not refuse to have hilary home for birthday much a knew that wanted confess that did only reason be something said about trinity term sadly incomprehensible in next place when wanted to have little change to day uncle struan for dinner sir remnant one two others dear how must eat think of uncle struans size papa be only trying now to provoke because can not answer know what mean a well a do perhaps little better what mean be one two of very oldest friend relation to do what be nice help to get on with birthday said with unusual ferocity darling will have none upon word believe did how wonderfully woman

love everything about have heard so many thing doubt have dear perhaps of somewhat fabulous order mind manner appearance at rate something seems to have left lasting impression upon simple folk

home in proper way to go prince agasicles growing older felt trouble more more a general rule man growing older have more extensive knowledge that must be robbed of course yet scarcely ever seems to reconcile with maturing wisdom to process so happened to good prince not that cared so very much about little trifle might attract eye of taste hand of skill that must not even with aid of star find anything too valuable to be stolen hence a daughter artemise grew to fulness of young beauty thought wise to raise most substantial barrier must build betwixt outer world there happened to be in neighbourhood then active supply of villain of by mean singular fact prince might well assure by casting eye down from star to narrow bosom of mother earth whether thus otherwise forewarned of local

hilarys bright face lost radiance a conscience pricked be about mabel of course must be what dickens be to say must not say false thing be far below nature must own that did love mabel far worse than have done utmost to drag that young innocent mabel into love with if be asked about father a of course must be on word of true man must confess that father must be sadly bitter if married below rank in life also that though be only son there be very peculiar provision in settlement of lorraine estate might throw entirely upon own wit if father turned against also that though father be one of very best men in world kindest loftiest must find still there be about something of cold determined substance worst of if whole truth be to be shelled out a must unshell knew in heart that father loved sister little finger more than member put together of own too lively frame chapter xvii very shy thing mr lovejoy sat far away from worry flurry fun of picking packing covering up have never entirely given to glory of fruit growing never must be much convinced that glory be in belonged to higher rank of life than of such son of cain father have be navy captain cousin be attorney general office have always be confounded in provincial mind with rank in le pugnacious profession even mr lovejoy thought when land be so full of militiaman that cousin be general of devil own of period therefore believed to know more than usual about law a well a army of course navy high position in legal army of so near relation helped doubt to foster hope of elevation of gregory beg pardon mr lorraine began a hilary entered bower to have just retired for calling away from scene enjoy perhaps from novelty where make be sure so exceedingly active useful feared a must unluckily so very soon return to london might have other chance of asking what candid opinion be upon matter have very near at heart deuce thought hilary within being even more vexed than relieved by turn of incidence be much cleverer than thought instead of hauling over coal be going to give sack at once didnt mean to go for week at least mr lovejoy enjoyed surprise a stammered that opinion must form be entirely at service be sure that know what be about must have guessed at once of course when be rude enough to send for what subject be nearest to mother heart wish to ask what think of son gregory in london lorraine for moment be little upset presence of mind have be worked so hard that be beginning to flutter shift much a liked fellow pupil have not begun to consider yet a subject of public excitement think really think said while waiting for time to think more about that be going on a well a ever must be expected maam if have wanted to vex hostess to kind nature must have be one of last thing wanted scarcely must have hit on phrase more fitted for purpose why mr lorraine be exactly what monthly nurse say hope can say something little better than of gregory assure mr lovejoy nothing can be finer than way be going on attention punctuality steadiness everything else leave nothing to be desired a wine merchant always say mr malahide hold up a pattern to be avoided because work so hard think that really ought to have country air at time of year in such weather for week at very shortest poor boy why must overwork then think that three day change be scarcely enough to set up again want at least fortnight maam have sort of hacking cough doe best to keep under doctor say that smell of ink out of pewter inkstand inhaling of blotting paper such a inhale day be almost certain in hot weather to root tussis at rate pituita inwards mr lovejoy be much impressed tenfold so when tried to think what malady might be dear said be dreadful to think of know too well what sad complaint be dear grandfather died of do think now mr lorraine that mr malahide must be persuaded to spare for rest of week scarcely think that must mr lovejoy be right hand left son of course dexter hand poor weaker member still if be to write to nicely a of course must be sure to write might make effort to get on with of inferior pupil will be done before van go by very next mail mean if can spare do think that must put up with very poor quarter for few day longer mr lorraine never be in such quarter before never felt so comfortable answered with gush of truth to expiate much small hypocrisy thereby settled for ever in very best grace if mr lovejoy have pride always told have none that pride lay in best feather bed smile quite worthy of larger husband of pleasant homestead spread over thoughtful face hilary for first time saw that daughter after be born of what can be sweeter than smile won from sensible woman like then give hope that may endeavour to keep few day more sir endeavour will be on part answered with most elegant bow a temptation fall on do hope that mr malahide will do best to spare though to lose right hand left hand must be very melancholy to lawyer mr lovejoy be nothing think nothing of such trifle be ready to fight when have hand even leg to stand upon yes to be sure live by fighting a poor sailor soldier do general of attorney now be first cousin once removed now can tell what opinion have formed of gregory of course there must be number of people trying to keep poor boy back pressing down a always do with narrow jealousy mother cousin might be trusted to give fair play now dont think one never can tell answered faster young fellow go up tree harder monkey pelt if only have quarter of son ability must defy at once from lord chief justice downward oh now mr lorraine really must be bad advice have not be called to bar a yet must remember that there be people many year in front of let gregory wait for proper time in proper course steadily rise to top of tree with patience mr lorraine know with patience thing come to pas must go to house at once write to mr malahide do think that must be offended if asked to accept basket of choicest cherry strawberry scarcely think that must regard a mortal injury especially if be to put a tribute from grateful pupil hilary lorraine how kind of to let use name have such influence with gregory be always telling doubt will accept so however when came to consider matter mr lovejoy with shameful treachery sent a little offering from grateful pupil own son while laid upon hilary burden of lengthened mitching time a in main perhaps be just moreover took good care that shorne must have chance of appearing in chamber a be only too eager to do for shrewd sense told that sharp wit there must find joy for ever enduring joke against gregory be scarcely needful to say perhaps throughout rest of week lorraine did utmost to bring about snug little interview with mabel having made up mind to keep henceforth at distance felt bound by resolution to afford glimpse two once in way for really have great deal to do must have be cruel to deny even right to talk of hilary carried basket so much better than anybody else touch be so light stepped here there so obediently so cleverly always looked away so nicely if briery trouble befell a now then of course must be that mabel began day to think how dreadfully must miss then a if be not

straight backed chair offered one little hand smiled at from manner of smile knew that be not by mean pleased thought a well to conciliate roland know that never pay heed began with voice shook just little to rumour that reach through servant even allow to think of telling dear mother of course never do thing must be far beneath well well might wait till have spoken before begin to judge if listen to nothing must be quite unlike other woman in world so be how well express at last begin to perceive dear mother what perpetually urge in vain own superiority what man mother can be expected to endure mild irony even so well a wife must roland manner of speech know not what to call have heard of among foreign people year ago whatever be beg not to catch from that boy hilary poetical justice sir roland exclaimed for temper be always in good control by virtue of varied humour be self same whip wherewith scourged little alice quite lately only feel be far more just roland be always just may not be always wise of course justice have inherited from dear father from be reason why wish to know what be meaning of strange report almost one except must have be sure to go into must have be told of long ago thorough truthfulness know have chance to mislead now will imitate though perhaps can not equal candour dear mother by assuring that greatly prefer to keep own counsel in matter roland be that answer admit that there be something important refuse to let own mother know excuse remember saying anything about importance be not superstitious enough to suppose that thing can have importance then why must make such fuss about really roland be sometimes very hard to understand be not aware that have made fuss sir roland answered gravely if have will make more now dear mother what did think of extraordinary bill of bottler bottler pigman be rogue said ladyship peremptorily father be rogue before thing run in family surely can not suppose that be proper way to treat subject to mind most improper way to condemn man bill on ground that father transmitted right to overcharge now dear son said lady valeria who never called son at unless be put out with dear son only when be at extremity of endurance dear son be sad attempt to disguise real truth from truth be entitled to know truth be resolved to know think that might have paid compliment of coming for advice before finding in state of mind being unable to deny justice of claim sir roland be fain at last to make virtue of necessity while marvelled a so many have done at craft of people in spying thing espying always wrongly be that said lady valeria after listening carefully thought there must have be something little better than to justify in making such mystery nothing dusty old document strange looking package case like cone however blame dear roland for making so small discovery old astrologer appears to to have grown little childish now a keep to old fashioned hour will ask to ring bell for tea while be being prepared can fetch case document to examine to be sure dear mother if will only promise to obey command of document roland have lived too long ever to promise anything will read order then can judge will make fuss about trifle answered with pleasant smile of course will do what be honourable surely men although deny so ferociously impeachment be open at time to at least little side eddy of curiosity sir roland doubt be desirous to know what be content of old case alice have taken for dirty cushion a lay at back of cupboard in wall while honour must not allow comfortably to disobey testator wish at same time felt now then to treat such matter in serious light be proof of superstition even childishness on part now if mother must so regard be not at sure that ought to take unpleasant course of opposing chapter xxii malignant case sir roland smiled at mother position air of stern attention a came back from book room with small heavy oaken box placed on chair without mystery unlocked sooner have flung back lid shown case above described than be quite astonished at expression of lady valerias face something more than fear sudden terror a if at sight of something fatal have taken pale tint out of cheek made fine forehead quiver dear mother how foolish be said to worry with trifle wish have kept to own opinion be trifle must have be wrong to treat a trifle have lived long life seen many strange thing take more than trifle to frighten for minute two lay back be not fit to speak be spoken to only managed to stop son from ringing for maid housekeeper have never beheld so scared before must scarcely make out sign to that needed attendance like most men who be at good just sir roland be prone to think softly calmly instead of acting rapidly now mother so advanced in year showed le hesitation than did recovering ere long from sudden shock managed to smile at at anxiety about now roland will not meddle with formidable clumsy thing seems to be closed most jealously have kept for two century may keep for two more so far a be concerned if will not be too troublesome to must like to hear what be said about in old document madam do see how strangely have be folded whoever did that knew great deal more than now know about folding writing to seems more strange than folding what cramped hand in what language be written in greek old greek character doric dialect seems to have be proud of classic descent perhaps dorian lineage placed great deal too much faith in attainment of descendant poor sedley must have read straight off daresay contraction even of character puzzled dreadfully have kept up a know dear mother little greek be taught perhaps have added to old hedericus be needed great many time assure before got through queer document even now be not quite certain of meaning of one two passage see at head number of what took at first to be hieroglyphic of kind other find that be astral sidereal sign for be none wiser though perhaps astronomer must be for instance appears to mean conjunction of two planet never mind roland read what have made out of writing very well mother if be at fault must have patience with for be not

yes yes of course what mean be honour rank of family be favourite hilary dear brave handsome hilary who be likely to bring care on head rather upon head roland time of course will be over then unless be very quick about will not be so quick a hope sir roland answered with little confusion of proper sentiment although in hotbed of mischief london nobody know when may begin however be not in london at present according to friend lady de lampnor think said have heard so from to be sure mr malahide told dear boy have overworked so that have gone to healthy quiet place to recruit exhausted energy dear said sir roland must never believe unless knew from experience what very little work be enough to upset to write letter to father for instance be so severe exertion that requires holiday next day now roland dont be so hard upon must apprentice to vile law be quite unfit for gentleman be not surprised at being overcome by such odious labour must not take advice remember put into only profession fit for one of birth army happens fault be own be clear however that can not get into much mischief where be just now rural quiet part of kent say show innocence of heart to go there very likely if

lucretian sentiment to gaze in safety at anothers labour a navvy more tersely put when asked of summum bonum to look on at tother beggar meanwhile however many little thing be beginning to go crosswise for instance hilary walked down headlong being exceedingly short of cash to comfort mabel to get good quarter perhaps to go on about everything luckily uncle struan met in street of sevenoaks whither have ridden for little change amazed with very strong language begged not to make confounded fool of so took into public house young man of course be astonished to see uncle carrying

nephew beautifully sent back with better heart in breast to meet future hilary of course be much aggrieved inclined to be outrageous at having walked four twenty mile with eager proceeding at step then being balked of sight of love however saw that be for best five guinea feel a will be something good uncle paid fare back by stage saw go off kissed hand to feeling greatly relieved a soon a ever be round corner for must have spoiled everything at farm therefore excellent uncle returned to snug little sanded parlour to smoke fresh pipe to think in influence how to get on with new affair here be heap of trouble rising a peak of volcano come out of sea who be to know how to manage thing so a to make subside again hilary might seem easy to deal with so long a have money even be apt to take strange whim into head although might feel that must not pay for then there be grower obstinate factor in calculation then grower wife who might appeal perhaps to attorney general also sir roland with dry unaccountable manner of regarding thing last not least rector own superior part of household if must not manage anybody at first sight must say that fault must be altogether own that man who can not lay down law to own wife daughter really be man deserves to be treated accordingly yet depends upon special gift rector must carry on very well when understood subject even with wife daughter till came to cry still in end a knew in heart always got worst of now what must all lady say if incumbent of parish rector of rectory very husband father of of a case might be be to depart from sense of right principle have laid down to to extent a to cherish hilary in black rebellion against own father suasion must be lost among be thing may be tried under favourable circumstance a against one lady when quite alone with four lady taking different view of matter in question yet ready in moment to combine against form of reason bachelor must be quixotic husband father idiotic if relies upon other motive power than of leg rector be not man to run away even from own family so on whole resolved to let thing follow own course until something new must begin to rise except at least upon two little point one hilary must be kept from visiting farm just now other that grower must be told of love affair mr hale a owner of daughter felt that be father due to know what favourite child be about in such important matter thought surest way to set bitterly against moderation if be left to find out by surprise what be going on at own hearth happened however that grower have shrewd suspicion of whole of be laughing in sleeve winking in own determined way at good wife manuvres will stop when please said to night at bed time let have little game make up mind to astonish for like almost man who have attained age of sixty looked back upon love a brief excrescence of about a much importance a wart ay ay need to tell answered when mr lovejoy under parson advice at mabels entreaty broke matter to dont go about with eye shut wife man know pear that grows can tell colour on maiden cheek have settled to send away to morrow to uncle catherow old mare will be ready at ten oclock meant to leave to guess reason be so clever of have have thought old grower be a blind a bat now didnt well at rate replied mr lovejoy giving pillow angry thump think might have consulted martin with clothes in wash tub frayed ribbon on sunday hat men be so hot inconsiderate to be done in moment of course least must have done be sure must have be to tell beforehand martin not to pack off like to be sure just a told good wife plan for packing off for life now just go to sleep dont beat about so when say thing do chapter xxx lad steenie when flaunting flouting of summer prime be over when leaf of tree bush even of unconsidered weed hang on stalk instead of standing upright a used to do very often convex surface by care of life be worn into small concavity gradual change to like effect may be expected in human mind man remembers that own autumn be once more coming over that light be surely waning darkness gathering in more of plan be shed scattered a sun draw water among cloud a gossamer float idly over sere seeded grass therefore be high time to work to strengthen thread of wavering plan to tighten mesh of woven web to cast about here there for completion if design will be ever complete so now a summer passed certain gentleman of more repute perhaps than reputation began to be anxious about plan sir remnant chapman owned large estate adjoining dwindled still fair acreage of lorraine in weald of sussex much a differed from sir roland in taste habit character announced wherever went a most intimate friend ally certainly be received more freely than other neighbour at coombe lorraine knew doings way of family be even consulted now then warm friendship however can scarcely thrive without mutual respect though sir remnant must never escape from certain unwilling respect for sir roland latter never must contrive to reciprocate feeling because knew that sir remnant be gentleman of type already even then departing although to be found at present day in certain part of england man of fixed opinion even what might be accounted principle at rate by concerning honour birth betting patriotism other matter included in very small et cetera be hard to despise man who have so many point settled in system be harder to respect when see thing with one little eye that eye vicious one sir remnant chapman have belief in goodness of woman truth of man in beautiful balance of nature even fatherly kindness comfort therefore nobody must love very few people paid much attention to dull hatred of mankind contempt always called have not power to make that have depth of root to throw up eminence bitter weed many people called yet be not altogether that for liked to act against nature perhaps from own perversity often did kind thing to spite own spitefulness by doing a for sense of right wrong have none outside of own wish always expected rest of world to move on same low system how must such man get on even for hour with one so different more than so opposite to a good sir roland mr hale who be not a know at tight laced man may perhaps have be little jealous of sir remnant put question to a well a to wife family echo only answered how however soever there be fact how many fact can call to mind ever so much stranger sir remnant only son stephen chapman be now over thirty year of age everybody said that be time for to change mode of life even father admitted that have made unreasonably long job of sowing wild oat now must take to better culture nothing seemed more likely to lead to desirable result than speedy engagement to accomplished sensible attractive girl therefore after long review discussion of young lady round have be settled that heir of chapman must lay close siege to young alice lorraine captain chapman a stephen be called by courtesy in neighbourhood having held commission in fashionable regiment until be ordered to war man be better than father in way much worse in others be better from weakness not having strength to work out work of iniquity also from having touch of kindness whereof father be intact be worse because have sense of honour rudiment of principle not even dubious preference for truth at first sight against lie captain chapman however must do one manly thing only one must drive having cultivated art in time when meant something horse be broken then not trained a nowadays must be skill nerve be needed for management of four in hand captain chapman be first in part to drive like ericthonius took very long time to get father to sit behind for road be still very bad perilous better suited for postilion than for stephen chapman team durst not drive up coombe lorraine at rate feared descent a yet though meant day to venture now that be come upon wooing left gaudy equipage at foot of hill to be sent back to steyning come for at appointed time then father with mutual grumbling took to steep ascent on foot sir roland have asked few day ago to drive over dine with on thursday other day might suit came on thursday with mind made up to be satisfied with anything certainly be not very well pleased to find that fair mistress alice have managed to give slip entirely be always ready to meet sir remnant discharge duty of hostess to from deep instinctive aversion must not even bear to sit at table with captain knew not at what character be neither did sir roland know tenth part of ill repute

of major clump be admirably connected being nephew of lord de lampnor husband of lady valerias friend so that by mean be brought round that hilarys doings must be reported lady valeria have received letter in grandson exploit at storming of ciudad rodrigo be so recounted that alice wept ancient lady smiled with pride even sir roland said well after boy can do something following afternoon master of coombe lorraine be sent for to have long talk with mother about matter of business now sir roland particularly hated business income be enough for want ambition if ever have be vague vaporous element left to lawyer matter of law even management of land for mother strong opposition must gladly have left to steward agent although extent of property scarcely justified such appointment so entered mother room that day with languid step reluctant air lady paid very little heed to perhaps even enjoyed little holding man be bound to attend to own affair have little patience sympathy with such philosophic indifference on other hand sir roland must not deny little quiet smile when saw mother great preparation to bring to book deed lady valeria lorraine be sitting a upright a have sat throughout life must sit until lay down for ever on table before be several thick portentously dirty document arranged docketed by own sagacious hand beyond opened at page for reference lay certain

cuff flemish lace even delicate pointed finger shrunken a be with age have knack of flitting over grime without attracting daresay be surprised said with usual soft courteous smile at seeing employed like turning lawyer in old age sir roland said something complimentary knowing that be expected of ancient lady have always taught however erroneous doctrine that man who be at loss for proper compliment to lady deserves to be thought gentleman always have treated son a gentleman dearer to than other gentleman still to be regarded in light mainly perhaps by inheritance have be led to behave to own son thus line of behaviour warmly resented by impetuous hilary now beg to attend must try to attend continued lady valeria rouse up if please dear roland be not question of astrologer queer thing of sort common sense matter might say difficult point of law perhaps that being so sir roland answered with smile of bright relief course becomes very simple have nothing that need trouble to be puzzled with uncomfortably messrs crookson hack clinker know how to keep in arrear to charge be own fault dear roland if overcharge everybody will do so when know that mean to put up with dear father be under guidance much more than have ever be never let people overcharge more than must help mean quite perceive distinction mother have put very clearly how doe that bear upon matter have now to speak of in great many way account of hilarys desperate behaviour a must call upon sound reflection lead to consider great probability of something happening to there be many battle yet to be fought of may be worse than remember what mr malahide said when dear father must insist upon resettlement of entire property in year sir roland knew quite well that be not dear father at mother who have insisted upon very stringent ill advised proceeding in have joined reluctantly only by dint of persistence however did not remind her of to be sure replied remember clearly have very word somewhere declined to draw in accordance with instruction of solicitor until own opinion upon have be laid before family most unusual course said for counsel in chamber to adopt having knowledge of party concerned hoped must pardon interference then word be to effect operation of such settlement may be most injurious party will be tying own hand most completely without a far a can perceive adequate reason for doing so supposing for instance there must be occasion for raising money upon estate during joint life of grandson granddaughter before granddaughter be of age there will be mean of doing limitation to be most unusual one in such case will preclude possibility of representing fee simple young lady be now just five year old if extraordinary settlement be made marketable title can be deduced for next sixteen year except of course in case of decease many other objection made of however be overruled after protest prepared settlement matter be hurried through father state of health for at very time be on deathbed harm have come of show that be right mr malahide quite wrong have be looking to see what must happen in case poor hilary ah be own fault that restriction be introduced although be scarcely twelve year old have shown so thoroughly volatile so very easy to lead away a used to be called by vulgar people so happy go lucky that dear father wished while have power to disable from lessening further lessened estate for settlement where might be know dear mother never liked that exceedingly complicated most mistrustful settlement if have not be so sick of business after loss of dear wife even power of persuasion must have failed to make execute at rate have have one good effect have robbed poor hilary to great extent of charm that must have possessed for jew how can discover such thing with firm of trusty most respectable lawyer to be quite wonderful how many thing be wondrous nothing more wondrous than man except of course jew do find out never let find out how managed do let ask dear mother what particular turn of thought have compelled to be so learned mean book well let think quite forget what be that wanted be useless to flatter roland now memory be not a be sight other gift however ought to be very thankful often try to be so take little time to think sir roland said in most gentle tone then if doe not occur to can talk of other time oh now remember told something about poor boy being smitten with girl of inferior station of course even must have little more sense than ever to dream of marrying young men although mean nothing be apt to say thing cost money above others hilary may have given ground for damage be so inconsiderate now if must be so give large verdict a low born jury always doe against well born gentleman several delicate point arise in first place have legal right to fall in love under settlement if not how can judgment take effect on interest again if must fall in battle must stay proceeding if point must be settled against have power to raise money for know that have money roland except what receive from land a under advice farthing of accumulation have be laid out in buying back field by field portion of lost property yes dear mother worse than field so purchased have be declared assured call to follow trust of settlement so that verily believe if wanted for urgent family purpose must raise if at upon mere personal security surely dear mother can not find fault with very efficient manner in own desire have be carried out well son have acted for best according to dear father plan when married father old lady continued with soft quiet pride be quite own be believed in very best quarter that duchess dowager of chalcorhin of whom perhaps may have heard speak truly yes mother other day dear son have right to do so of own godmother great aunt sneering spirit of present day can not rob of advantage however father a be right natural on part felt conviction a low methodist be always saying of that there must be hundred thousand pound to help in what be thinking of grace be vexed at marriage so a know dear roland brought lorraine nothing yes dear mother brought clear mind clever management will always think that of roland dear happens when be gone will always believe that did best sir roland be surprised at mother very unusual state of mind saw how delicate face be softened from calm composure like emotion moved for be man of strong feeling though deigned so rarely to let out froze so often with fatalism dearest mother answered bowing silver hair over snowy lock surely know well enough to make such question needle more active devoted mind never worked for one especial purpose welfare of for whose sake have abandoned show grandeur ay mother with a much success a hereditary fault allowed since labour began must have picked up fifty acre be that know of roland asked lady valeria with short sigh effort will be thrown away greatly fear when be gone one hundred fifty six acre half have be brought back into lorraine rent roll without even counting hedge row now there be two thing to be done to carry on great work well that interloper sir remnant chapman man of comparatively modern race hold more than two thousand acre of best oldest lorraine land wish young alice to marry son proposes very handsome settlement why roland told about though not quite a soon a must have done perceive that neglected duty if did so surprise must have knocked out of time a good struan express mr hale mr hale clergyman can not imagine what must mean must have be something low of course badger baiting prize fighting though people of really good position have right to like such thing now must let that poor stupid sir remnant who can not even turn compliment have own way about silly alice for sake of more important thing dear mother sometimes try what can be more important than alice to what overpowering influence be to be sacrificed be useless to talk like sir roland must do best like everybody else who be not of ignoble family girl have plenty of pride will be first to perceive necessity twill not be so much for sake of settlement for of course will go with must make stipulation have set down under hand seal that sir remnant after time son will sell to at valuation piece of own land may be able to repurchase now roland never must have thought of that be most admirable plan be not be worthy of ingenuity mother will sir remnant agree to be fond of acre like landowner one acre be a good a to man of modern lineage of land passed from at time of great confiscation be sold by reckless man last sir hilary one chapman have held very little of for even so much a two century how then can be attached to must make condition roland first most essential point a for settlement be nothing though of course will also insist upon for girl of alices birth appearance must easily get larger settlement much higher position by sending to london for one season under lady de lampnor how must help towards getting back land look so learned said sir roland smiling with book seem to have mastered that surely may employ to draw deed for signature by sir remnant have little doubt must do replied ancient lady who took everything a in earnest be not so strong a be therefore wish to push thing forward have given up a know proper attention to many little matter go on very badly without simply that small ability might be devoted to great purpose hope to have still few year left two thing must see accomplished before can leave world in peace alice must marry captain chapman upon condition have expressed hilary must marry fortune with special clause enabling to invest in land upon proper trust boy be handsome enough for anything fame for courage martial bearing above regimentals will make irresistible must not stay at war too long be too great risk to run well dear mother must confess that scheme be very fine one supposing mean that object be worth of be by mean sure have not made purpose of life to recover lorraine estate have not toiled schemed for end although added with dry irony quite escaped mother sense be of course far le exertion to sell one child with view there be several hitch in little plan for instance alice hate captain chapman hilary love girl without penny though grower must have have good market lately according to price of vegetable clever a sir roland be made mistake of outer world there be such thing a good market alice be mere child replied grandmother smiling placidly can not have smallest idea yet a to what like dislike captain be quite a well bred a father can drive four in hand wonder that have shown such presumption a to like dislike be fault roland perpetual indulgence set child up to such dreadful thing of must be broken painfully having be encouraged so dear mother sir roland answered keeping own opinion to clearly know how to manage young girl great deal better than do will talk to alice in own convincing most eloquent manner if send up to with greatest pleasure said lady valeria having long expected may safely leave to believe chit of girl must be taught place mean to be very quiet with let

ruined man captain even honour more honour must keep spirit up maynt be so bad a honour think answered very kindly well knowing that be ruined man saluting more for chapter li empty locker may perhaps be said without painful exaggeration throughout whole course of grand war struggle of great captain heroic business everywhere few thing made deeper sadder more sinister impression than sudden disappearance of fifty thousand guinea on other hand must not be supposed that disappearance of guinea be rare far otherwise a many people still alive can testify of perhaps with gratitude for reappearance in right quarter particular fifty thousand be looked out for in so many place have so long be subject of hope a really solid instalment of shilling in pound for hero that most philosophical of latter be inclined to use short strong word of distinctive nationality poor hilary felt that for bad verb own name must be receptive case vainly looked about for remedy rescue stiff a

history sweeping onward in victory closing with conquest of frenchman in own france nothing left to stop advance on paris be luck be skill historian asks in wonder answer perhaps may be found in proverb luck have mother love for skill be that a may be quite certain that hilary though have shown no skill have little luck in present case for commander in chief be great deal too busy have officer too hard at work to order without fatal loss of time general court martial now moreover have own reason for keeping matter a quiet a possible for at least fortnight soldier by time must be in march unable to turn back on brown be whereas now there be who might lawfully cast away knapsack if knew that bounty be again no better than cloudy hope again there be ugly pot hook of english question to be dealt with thing passed through rapid mind of general a reined horse listened calmly to poor lorraine over true report then fixed keen grey eye upon hilary said shortly what be doing upon bridge be question replied lorraine while marvelling at own audacity be pledged by honour a gentleman not to answer by duty a officer in place of special trust be bound to answer general can not lord a rather must call now wish must answer can not have suspicion who be that stole money with so much care have suspicion nothing more make feel treacherous to suspect never mind that have rogue to deal with what be suspicion lord be sorry to say that again can not in honour answer captain lorraine have time to spare lord wellington have be more than once interrupted by despatch once for do mean to give explanation of conduct in losing general life honour of family depend upon what do now then go seek advice lorraine general answered kindly for heart be kind have taken liking for young fellow knew little of family have one to go to for advice lord what be advice to with word hilary looked so wretched yet so proud from well bred face beautifully shaped blue eye that general stopped from hurry to pity then looked gently at poor young fellow be most irregular state of thing have ever have to deal with have lost month pay of army enough to last year seem to think that have done great thing refuse explanation be there chance of recovering money there might be lord if be not likely to advance too rapidly there might be if threw away campaign have two course before at least if choose to offer will take advice if offer choice be only too glad to have choice anything chosen for by then be just how stand lorraine if allow alternative may demand court martial may resign commission on other hand a know court martial must at once be held upon what answer be prepared to make when asked why left convoy must be more stubborn to than even lordship have let be to then captain lorraine resign commission with approval can be done resign commission lorraine exclaimed reeling a if have received shot catching at mane of general horse without knowing what be doing oh never must do very well have given advice prefer own decision have other thing to attend to captain money will receive sword be under arrest till can form court lord must break father heart if be to hear of such thing suppose have better resign commission if may put in writing send to will forward to horse guard with memorandum from be sorry to lose captain lorraine might have done well if have only proved a

major mrustie must have be misled doubt be done on purpose have information on very best authority may ask upon what authority be pledged in honour to conceal even that may tell do believe said hilary after one moment thought with old bright simple smile have lord from two young lady daughter of count of zamora aha cried lord wellington being almost a fond of young lady a of touched perhaps for moment by magic of sweet young smile begin to understand bridge affair fear that young lady can hardly be cited a authority on geography otherwise might make out case against spanish authority for sending escort to wrong place spanish escort a say took other for proper place certainly lord did so did count everybody be there hope now may be acquitted at moment notice from hope that must like to come back to lodging hilary opened eye so wide heart so wide other place that hope be generally partial to that great commander who trusted a little a possible of work to hope must not help smiling quick dry smile felt pain a word by word demolished hope in hilary point of thing be money lorraine that never must recover from spaniard even if be lost through for very good reason that have not got even supposing mistake to be theirs escort to have be sent astray be party to mistake more than that be bound to see that treasure did not cross river until men be there did do so oh if only have done must not be so miserable exactly so neglected duty take more care of own money than have taken of public cash lorraine do a told now good bye general who have long be chafing at so much discourse just now offered hand to lorraine a one who be now mere civilian be there hope asked hilary dropping tear into mane of restive horse can never be restored lord never unless money be made good before go into quarter again heavy price for captain commission if be made good lord will restore from deep disgrace question will be for royal highness think that in such extraordinary case may rely at rate may rely upon good word lorraine thank lord money will be paid not for sake of commission for honour of family chapter liii farewell spanish lady british army now set forth on grand career of victory with entirely new set of breech interception of convoy other adverse circumstance have kept hero from having money although have new pocket british government with keen insight into nature have insisted upon in last contract that pocket must be four inch wide with soldier be delighted for very bravest men be boy put knuckle into pocket felt what lot of money must hold though money did not come there be delightful readiness for might come day for knew what fool must have looked if pocket must not hold in short men laid on leg to march with empty pocket march did a history show better for not having sixpence though hilary be so heartily liked in own regiment by staff time have failed for trial also failed for pity of issue general have desired that a little a possible must be said even if one have wished to argue hurry bustle must have stopped mouth lorraine old comrade be far in advance staff like shuttle be darting about hill valley be clapping hand to happy accompaniment of drum casting by outward sign that ever have be soldier hilary lorraine set forth on sad retreat from fine advance afoot bearing on shoulder canvas bag on truncheon of olive must not accept knapsack pouch soldier usage of kind have lost all right to that being now shattered young gentleman on way home however in one way showed good sense by losing heap of public money have learned to look little better after own so drew farthing that must get of father cash grandmother scorned to accept arrears of pay because must not get to man of old of middle age have become ought to become matter of very small account that have thrown away life have seen so many who have done like through indolence pride bad temper reserve timidity fool confidence into most timid men generally rush that know now to be fine example instead of standing forth a very unpleasant exception to rule now if take altogether find many fellow who have done much worse seem better for have missed appointment cut down salary did bang back door on rising man well man since rose have forgotten host have married shrew look after kitchen remembering reflecting thus almost good man must refuse to be called without something to show for bigger fool than neighbour young man be not yet late enough to know what human life be be sure that see by foresight thing a pas leave so little time for insight of only true view be calm pleasant retrospect then like high stepping colt brought suddenly on knee to sense of long worn granite flounder about in amazement so that if fatal damage be not done to doe lorraine be not one of who cry a poet of present age do let world stand still until get on nevertheless be greatly downcast to find own little world so early brought to sudden stand still seems to be sadly true that more of versatile quickness man have in le there remains to expect of in way of pith substance hilary now be in condition to go into philosophy made up mind to walk down to sea take ship at good seaport having be pleased at malaga by kind quiet way of people knowing port to be unobserved by french american cruiser thought that might a well try luck once more in direction swift of foot a be lightsome when heart be toward did not get along very fast on penitential journey so that be ninth day tenth from being turned out of army when came once more to bridge of echo henceforth bridge of sigh for ever here stopped ate supper for appetite be good again then looked up down zujar said to what fool be for lo where claudia have clung to trembling over fearful abyss of torrent a seemed by moonlight there now be more than nine inch of water gliding along very pleasantly spanish water be out of knowledge a much a spanish lady be though spring might have be much higher fortnight ago than be now hilary must not help thinking that claudia instead of fainting on verge might have jumped over at moment without spraining very neat ankle then remembered that be same beautiful romantic girl who have proved to satisfaction of spanish colonel that be only zujar ford for river merged name where joined longer larger guadalmez upon question there long have arisen hopeful dilemma in hilarys mind stated in form if be true zujar ford then surely spaniard native of country be bound to apprise general hill thereof if be not zujar ford then spaniard be liable for treasure beyond place a far a true one latter be of course stronger horn of dilemma unluckily there arose against mighty monster of fact quite strong enough to take even minotaur by horn suppose brave spaniard to owe money be impossible to suppose that must pay reflection gave hilary such pain in side that straightway dropped beholding vivid summer sky beginning to darken into deeper blue jut of mountainous place preparing to throw light shadow length wise simmering of sun heat sinking into white mist of vale made up mind to put best foot foremost sleep at monte argento for felt quite sure of goodwill sympathy of pure hidalgo noble count of zamora from young donna might learn something about misadventure must not bring to believe that claudia have be privy to dastardly outrage upon nature be too frank open to foster such mean idea young lady be best sweetest kindest largest hearted of created being so be so be rule have exception hilary a walked up hill down have ridden so gallantly scarcely more than fortnight since

to control pray donna camilla to look at little matter sensibly now understand whole of sister be of very warm strong patriotic sentiment felt that money must do more good a property of partidas than a pay of british troop so exerted to get good spaniard must have thought same exerted to disgrace to disgrace family money be not among partidas in bag of cousin alcides whom have married without dispensation with father sanction forged can make best of senhor hilary certainly must not make anything very good out of cheerful though nature be tolerably magnanimous must not be expected to enjoy treatment have met with to be knocked down robbed be bad enough to be disgraced be great deal worse to be cut out by rival betrayed into power made to pay for wedding with trust money belonging to poor soldier be enough to embitter even sweet kind nature of young lorraine therefore face be unlike a turned away from young spanish lady being much taken up with own trouble not yet ready to make light of will not speak to senhor be not in way guilty of must have surrendered whole of life pray to pardon hilary answered be not accustomed to sort of thing where be now can follow even spaniard

alice said can scarcely see why must so disturb there be many thing always to be thought of more than one have time for to be sure papa know hate to see worried think that might try to tell whether be

christmas day at least be so in south of england though probably two three day earlier in northern country great frost always advance slowly creeping from higher latitude if cold begin in london sooner than doe in edinburgh very seldom last out week if come on with violent wind time be generally shorter doe seem strange be quite true that many people even well informed attribute to severity of cold destruction of great french army during retreat from moscow ruin of napoleon know date of ghastly carnage of beresina elsewhere happened more than year ere seem to forget that winter belongs

to save honour of race pure self from defilement woeburn be running a well a ever quite untouched by frost stretched at length like great black leech who put out head for suction gliding through great pile of snow looked sable a cocytus with long curl of white vapour hovering where cold air lay on star be beginning to sparkle now young moon gazing over chancton ring avouched calm depth of heaven then alice came forward commending soul to god in good christian manner without fear tear sigh committed body to death bourne chapter lxix bottler beat element seems to be almost settled point in

so bottler greater hero than even nestor must call to mind to snub inferior pig sticker bottler aroused valour scotched slew that python woeburn be not enough to speak of such doings in casual sort of way bottler deed be now passing into era of romance always precedes age of history out of romance emerge with tail of attestation if anybody lay hold of clearly see what to do with story becomes history great historian lo here be data for historian of duly combative enthusiasm to work out what bottler did let bonny work a hero permit great deal harder than worked calmly looked on smoked pipe
