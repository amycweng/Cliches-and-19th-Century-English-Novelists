vouchsafed explanation neither gave reason true false show entire ignorance of feminine nature if ruth have known refused to tell must have be much easier because must have got out of ruth before two three day be over darling ruth knew more than did indeed must do justice to say that have be quite a inquisitive well might have put up with if have not be for taking dolly own pet dolly away morning quite a if belonged to keeping out until close upon dark then bringing home in frightful condition even have impudence when told that dolly be pony to say that owed pony ever since took from little horse upon found strapped so snugly mean to take dolly to dulverton with to run in little cart if there be law in land will not surely john will not let ' wo ' said 'except upon condition offered once before if owe pony owe strap sweet annie laughed like bell at then went on with story john be perfectly miserable can not understand of course used to go evening hug poor dolly kiss beg to tell where have be what have seen that day never having belonged to balaam darling dolly be quite unsuccessful though often strove to tell with ear down eye rolling then made john fry tie tail in knot with piece of white ribbon a if for adornment might trace among hill at rate for mile two uncle ben be too deep for that cut off ribbon before started saying must have doones after then in despair applied to knowing how quick of foot be got ruth lizzie to help answered very shortly very poor supper have that night according to desert though be dashed to ground for time be not wholly discomfited determination to know about seemed to increase with difficulty uncle ben manner last night be so dry when tried to romp to lead out that be much worse than jamaica ginger grated into poor sprayed finger so sent to bed at earliest moment held small council upon if remember john having now taken to smoke be hateful practice have gone forth grumbling about bad supper not taking a good lesson annie ' cried in amazement at will never trust again for supper thought be so sorry ' 'and so be dear very sorry still must do duty when came to consider ruth be cleverest of for said that surely must have man must trust about farm to go on little errand then remembered that old john fry must do anything for money ' 'not for money plaize miss ' said john fry taking pull at beer 'but for love of swate face be sure john with king behind so lizzie ran for john fry at once gave full direction how be to slip out of barley in confusion of breakfast so none might miss to run back to black combe bottom there must find very same pony uncle ben have be tied upon there be faster upon farm then without waiting for breakfast unless must eat running trotting be to travel up black combe by track uncle reuben have taken up at top to look forward carefully so to trace without being seen 'ay raight wull doo 'd un john cried with mouth in bullock horn 'well what did see john asked with great anxiety though meant to have shown interest 'john be just at very point of ' lizzie answered sharply 'when chose to come in stop ' 'then let begin again said 'things being gone so far be now duty to know everything for sake of girl mother ' cried lizzie in nasty way took notice of for be always bad to deal with therefore john fry began again being heartily glad to do so that story might get out of tumble talk have made in a must not tell tale in manner of lorna although told very well for who understood will take from mouth altogether state in brief what happened when john upon forest pony have much ado to hold mouth being like bucket be come to top of long black combe two mile more from plover barrow winding to southward stopped little nag short of crest got off looked ahead of from behind tump of whortles be long flat sweep of moorland over be gazing with few bog here there brushy place round of course john fry from shepherd life reclaiming of strayed cattle knew a well a need be where be spread of hill before although be beyond beat rather must say beside not what might have grazed there have be pleasure that be not worth while scarcely worth jasper kebby even land being cropped a one might say with desolation nearly knowledge of sprang from unaccountable trick of cow who have young calf with at time have wild desire to get away from sight of man keep calf milk for one although be in barren land at least cow have gotten trick have heard other people complain of john fry a said knew place well enough liked none more for did of people indeed neighbourhood of thomshill larksborough most of black barrow down lay under grave imputation of having be enchanted with very evil spell moreover be known though folk be loath to speak of even on summer morning that squire thom who have be murdered there century ago more have be seen by several shepherd even in middle day walking with severed head carried in left hand right arm lifted towards sun therefore be very bold in john a acknowledged to venture across moor alone even with fast pony under whisky by side must never have done so of be quite certain for sake of annie sweet face of golden guinea three maiden have subscribed to reward skill valour truth be that must not resist own great curiosity for carefully spying across moor from behind tuft of whortles at first must discover nothing having life motion except three four wild cattle roving in vain search for nourishment diseased sheep banished hither carrion crow keeping watch on when john be taking very last look being only too glad to go home again acknowledge baffled thought saw figure moving in farthest distance upon black barrow down scarcely thing to be sure of yet on account of want of colour a watched figure passed between naked cliff appeared to be man on horseback making way very carefully in fear of bog serpent for about there be adder ground large black serpent dwell in marsh can swim a well a crawl john knew that man who be riding there must be none uncle reuben for none of doones ever passed way shepherd be afraid of now seemed unkind place for unarmed man to venture through especially after armed one who might not like to be spied upon must have dark object in visiting such drear solitude nevertheless john fry so ached with unbearable curiosity to know what old man stranger rich man peaceable must possibly be after in mysterious manner moreover john so throbbed with hope to find wealthy secret that come what must of resolved to go to end of matter therefore only waited awhile for fear of being discovered till master huckaback turned to left entered little gully whence must not survey moor then john remounted crossed rough land stony place picked way among morass a fast a ever dared to go until in about hour drew nigh entrance of gully now behoved to be most wary for uncle ben might have stopped in there to rest horse having reached end of journey in case john have little doubt that must be pistolled nothing more ever heard of therefore made pony come to mouth of sideways leaned over peered in around rocky corner while little horse cropped at briar soon perceived that gully be empty so far at least a course be straight with hastened into though heart be not working easily when have traced winding hollow for mile more saw that forked one part led to left up steep red bank other to right being narrow slightly tending downwards yellow sand lay here there between starving grass examined narrowly for trace of master huckaback at last saw that beyond doubt man be pursuing have taken course led down hill down hill must follow john did with deep misgiving hearty wish that have never started upon so perilous errand for now knew not where be scarcely dared to ask having heard of horrible hole somewhere in neighbourhood called wizard slough therefore john rode down slope with sorrow great caution grew more a went onward pony reared against being scared although native of roughest moorland john have just made up mind that god meant for warning a passage seemed darker deeper when suddenly turned corner saw scene stopped for there be wizard slough a black a death bubbling with few scant yellow reed in ring around outside bright water grass of liveliest green be creeping tempting unwary foot to step plunge founder on marge be blue campanula sundew forget not such a child must resist on side hill fell back ground be broken with tuft of rush flag mare tail few rough alder tree overclogged with water not bird be seen heard rail water hen wag tail reed warbler of horrible quagmire worst upon exmoor john have heard from grandfather even from mother when wanted to keep quiet father have feared to speak of to being man of piety up to trick of evil one made john more desirous to have good look at now only with girth well up to turn away flee at speed if anything must happen now proved how well be to be wary wide awake even in lonesome place for at other side of slough few land yard beyond where ground be le noisome have observed felled tree lying over great hole in earth with stave of wood slab of stone yellow gravel around flag of reed around morass partly screened from eye must not make out meaning of except that meant good probably be witchcraft yet dolly seemed not to be harmed by for there be a large a life tied to stump not far beyond flipping fly away with tail while john be trembling within lest dolly must get scent of pony neigh reveal presence although must not see suddenly to great amazement something white arose out of hole under brown trunk of tree seeing blood went back within yet be not able to turn flee rooted face in among loose stone kept quivering shoulder back prayed to god to protect however white thing be not so very awful being nothing more than long coned night cap with tassel on top such a criminal wear at hanging time when john saw man face under man neck shoulder slowly rising out of pit must not doubt that be place where murderer come to life again according to exmoor story knew that man have be hanged last week that be ninth day after therefore must bear more thoroughly brave a have be neither did wait to see what became of gallows man climbed on horse with what speed might rode away at full gallop neither did dare go back by way came fearing to face black barrow down therefore struck up other track leading away towards cloven rock after riding hard for hour drinking whisky luckily fell in with shepherd who led on to public house somewhere near exeford here be so unmanned excitement being over nothing le than gallon of ale gammon of bacon brought to right mind again took good care to be home before dark having followed well known sheep track when john fry finished story at last after many exclamation from annie from lizzie much praise of gallantry yet little disappointment that have not stayed there little longer while be about so a to be able to tell more said to very sternly 'now john have dreamed man firmly believe that fell asleep at top of black combe after drinking whisky never went on moor at know what liar be john ' girl be exceedingly angry at laid hand before mouth waited for john to answer with eye fixed upon steadfastly 'bai for to denai ' said john looking at very honestly 'but what maight tull lai now awhiles zame a other men most of arl a spaks again here be lai maister jan wush to god wor boy maight slape naight better believe speak truth john ask pardon now not word to one about strange affair there be mischief brewing can see be place to attend to several thing come across now only will not tell ' be not at contented with must give better except to say when plagued greatly vowed to sleep at door night dear be foolish of too much of matter be known already be for own dear sake be bound to be cautious have opinion of own may be very wrong one will not ask to share with will make inquisitive ' annie pouted lizzie frowned ruth looked at with eye wide open other mark of regarding saw that if one of three for john fry be gone home with tremble must be trusted to keep secret that one be ruth huckaback chapter xxxii feeding of pig story told by john fry night conviction of truth made very uneasy especially a following upon warning of judge jeffreys hint received from jeremy stickles outburst of tanner at dunster a well a sundry tale rumour sign of secret understanding seen heard on market day at place of entertainment knew for certain that at taunton bridgwater even dulverton there be much disaffection towards king regret for day of puritan albeit have told truth pure simple truth when upon examination have assured lordship to best of knowledge there be nothing of sort with now be beginning to doubt whether might not have be mistaken especially when heard a did of arm being landed at lynmouth in dead of night of tramp of men having reached one ear from hill where famous echo be for must be plain to conspirator without example of doones for secret muster of men stowing of unlawful arm communication by beacon light scarcely fitter place must be found than wild of exmoor with deep ravine running far inland from unwatched mostly sheltered sea for channel from countisbury foreland up to minehead even farther though rocky gusty full of current be safe from great roller sweeping power of south west storm prevail with more than others make sad work on opposite coast even supposing probable that something against king charles second rather against roman adviser especially brother be now in preparation amongst be likely that master huckaback wealthy man careful one known moreover to lord chief justice must have anything to do with to must make answer uncle ben be so close man so avaricious so revengeful that be quite impossible to say what course might pursue without knowing chance of gain rise satisfaction to that hated papist knew full well though never spoke much about also that have followed march of oliver cromwell army more a suttler people said than a real soldier that must go long way risk great deal of money to have revenge on doones although name never passed lip during present visit how be likely to be a to doones side must probably take in coming movement if movement indeed must be so far a have religion at by birth be roman catholic so much knew from lorna indeed be well known around that priest have be fetched more than once to valley to soothe poor outlaw departure on other hand be not likely to entertain much affection for son of man who have banished confiscated property be not at impossible that desperate men such a be having nothing to lose estate to recover not being held by religion much must cast away regard for birth from have be cast out make common cause with protestant rising for chance of revenge replacement however mean to say that thing occurred to a clearly a have set down only be in general doubt very sad perplexity for mother be so warm innocent kind so to one knowing little by time of english constitution feared very greatly lest must be punished for harbouring malcontent a well a possible knew that if poor man came to door cried 'officers be after for god sake take hide ' mother must take in at once conceal feed even though have be very violent to tell truth so must both sister so indeed must do whence will be clear that be not sort of people to be safe among disturbance before must quite make up mind how to act in difficulty how to get at right of for must not spy after uncle reuben though felt great fear of wizard slough none of man with white night cap difference came again upon change of chance for uncle ben went away a suddenly a first have come to giving reason for departure claiming pony indeed leaving something behind of great value to mother for begged to see to young grand daughter until must find opportunity of fetching safely to dulverton mother be overjoyed at a must not help displaying ruth be quite a much delighted although durst not show for at dulverton have to watch keep such ward on victual in out of shopmen that went entirely against heart never must enjoy truly be altered girl from day came to catching unsuspicious manner free goodwill hearty noise of laughing by time harvest being done thatching of rick made sure against south western tempest reaper being gone with good money thankfulness began to burn in spirit for sight of lorna have begged sister annie to let sally snowe know once for that be not in power to have thing more to do with of course annie be not to grieve sally to let appear for moment suspected kind view upon strong regard for dairy only thought right upon part not to waste sally time longer being handsome wench a be many young fellow glad to marry annie did uncommonly well a told afterwards having taken sally in sweetest manner into pure confidence opened half bosom to about very sad love affair not that let sally know of course who be what be only that made understand without hinting at desire of that there be chance now of having sally changed colour little at then went on about red cow have passed seven needle at milking time inasmuch a there be two sort of month well recognised by calendar to wit lunar solar made bold to regard month in absence of provision a intended to be strictly lunar therefore upon very day when eight week be expiring forth went in search of lorna taking pearl ring hopefully new laid egg must find dozen half of small trout from brook pleasure gave to catch trout thinking a one came forth danced upon grass how much must enjoy be more than can now describe although well remember struck that after accepting ring saying how much loved be possible that queen might invite even to stay sup with so arranged with dear annie beforehand who be now greatest comfort to to account for absence if must be late ala be utterly disappointed for although waited waited for hour with equal amount of patience peril lorna ever appeared at even faintest sign of thing occurred a well vexed more than need have done for so small matter be that little offering of trout new laid egg be carried off in coolest manner by vile carver doone for thinking to keep fresher nicer away from so much handling laid in little bed of reed by side of water placed dog leaf over when have quite forgotten about be watching from hiding place beneath willow tree for liked not to enter lorna bower without permission except just to peep that be not there while be turning ring in pocket having just seen new moon became aware of great man coming eisurely down valley have broad brimmed hat leather jerkin heavy jack boot to middle thigh what be worst of for on shoulder bore long carbine having nothing to meet withal staff desiring to avoid disturbance retired promptly into chasm keeping tree betwixt that might not descry watching from behind jut of rock where now have scraped neat little hole for purpose presently great man reappeared being now within fifty yard of light still good enough a drew nearer for to descry feature though be not judge of men face there be something in turned cold a though with kind of horror not that be ugly face nay rather seemed handsome one so far a mere form line might go full of strength vigour will steadfast resolution from short black hair above broad forehead to long black beard descending below curt bold chin there be not curve glimpse of weakness of afterthought nothing playful nothing pleasant nothing with track of smile nothing friend must like laugh at for having yet might have be good man for have known very good men so fortified by own strange idea of god say that might have seemed good man for cold cruel hankering of steel blue eye now let one suppose for minute saw in moment for be very slow take long time to digest thing only like to set down have done with result of knowledge though be not manifold what said to myself just then be more than 'what fellow to have lorna ' having sense of right so outraged although of course must never allow to go so far a almost longed that might thrust head in to look after for there be with ash staff clubbed ready to have at not ill inclined to do so if only must come where strength not firearm must decide however suspected nothing of dangerous neighbourhood walked round like sentinel turned at brink of water then a marched back again along margin of stream espied little hoard covered up with dog leaf saw that leaf be upside down of course drew attention saw stoop lay bare fish egg set little way from in simple heart thought that now knew about to surprise seemed well pleased harsh short laughter came to without echo have charlie boy fisherman charlie have caught thee setting bait for lorna now understand thy fishing robbing of counsellor hen roost may never have good roasting if have not to night roast thee charlie afterwards with calmly packed up fish best of dear annie egg went away chuckling steadfastly to home if one may call so be so thoroughly grieved mortified by most impudent robbery started forth from rocky screen with intention of pursuing until better sense arrested barely in time to escape eye for said to myself that even supposing must contend unarmed with must be greatest folly in world to have secret access known perhaps fatal barrier placed between lorna knew not what trouble brought upon for sake of few egg fish be better to bear trifling loss however ignominious goading to spirit than to risk love lorna welfare perhaps be shot into bargain think that will agree with acted for wisest in withdrawing to shelter though deprived of egg fish having waited a said until there be chance whatever of love appearing hastened homeward very sadly wind of early autumn moaned across moorland beauty of harvest gaiety be gone early fall of dusk be like weight upon nevertheless went evening thenceforward for fortnight hoping time in vain to find hope comfort meanwhile what perplexed most be that signal be replaced in order a agreed upon so that lorna must scarcely be restrained by rigour one time have narrow chance of being shot settled with befell thus be waiting very carelessly being now little desperate at entrance to glen instead of watching through sight hole a proper practice be suddenly ball went by with whizz whistle passing through hat sweeping away folded up soft hat fluttered far down stream before have time to go after with help of wind water be fifty yard gone in moment at have just enough mind left to shrink back very suddenly lurk very still closely for knew what narrow escape have be a heard bullet hard set by powder sing mournfully down chasm like drone banished out of hive a peered through little cranny

john for part be not backward gave most wonderful air of secrecy importance till parish began to think that affair of nation be in hand scorned sight of dungfork be not likely that must last being only man in parish with knowledge of politics gave john fry to understand that must not presume to talk so freely a if be at least constable about constitution must be affair of might bring into trouble at only tossed nose a if have be in london at least three time for one vexed so promised thick end of plough whip if even name of knight of shire must pas lip for fortnight now did not suspect in stupid noddle that john fry must ever tell jeremy stickles about sight at wizard slough man in white nightcap because john have sworn on blade of knife not to breathe word to soul without full permission however appears that john related for certain consideration that have seen doubtless more have accrued to upon master stickles be much astonished at uncle reuben proceeding having always

happily with royal pardon in black white everybody admired more because one must read word of squire acknowledged cheerfully that must sooner take fifty purse than read single line of people indeed

violence except just to frighten people must be established even towards christmas time tom have right to give alms right left out of other people money dear annie appeared to believe that must saying that if rich continually chose to forget poor man who forced to remember so to do good to to others be public benefactor entitled to blessing knew so lizzie knew john fry being now out of hearing that

went out into courtyard smoked pipe wondered what on earth be meaning of woman now in be wrong unreasonable a woman will acknowledge sometimes man be so put out by way take on about nothing that really can not help thinking for at least minute that woman be mistake for ever hence be for ever mistaken nevertheless must not see that of great thought idea applied at to lorna that be different being not woman enough to do anything bad yet enough of woman for man to adore now thing came to pas tested adoration pretty sharply inasmuch a must far liefer faced carver doone father nay even roaring lion with hoof flaming nostril than have met in cold blood sir ensor doone founder of colony fear of very fiercest be forced to do at time in manner following when went up one morning to look for seven rook nest behold there be six to be seen for topmost of be gone most conspicuous looked looked rubbed eye turned to try by other sight then looked again yes there must be doubt about signal be made for to come because love be in danger for to enter valley now during broad daylight must have brought comfort only harm to maiden certain death to yet be more than must do to keep altogether at distance therefore ran to nearest place where must remain unseen watched glen from wooded height for hour hour impatiently however impatience of mine made difference in scene upon be gazing in part of valley must see there be nothing moving except water few stolen cow going sadly along a if knowing that have honest right there sank very heavily into heart with bed of dead leaf around there be nothing cared to do except blow on finger long for more wit for frost be beginning made great difference to lorna to myself trow a well a to five million people who dwell in island of england frost a never saw before hope ever to see again time when be impossible to milk cow for icicle for man to shave of beard a liked to do for lorna sake because be so smooth without blunting razor on hard gray

a usual whereas have learned from grandfather that providence never sends very hard winter without having furnished large supply of berry for bird to feed upon be lucky for while waited here that very best sheep dog old watch have chosen to accompany day for otherwise must have have dinner being unpersuaded even by to quit survey of valley however by aid of poor watch contrived to obtain supply of food for sent home with note to annie fastened upon chest in le than hour back came proud enough to wag tail off with tongue hanging out from speed of journey large lump of bread of bacon fastened in napkin around neck have not told sister of course what be toward for why must make anxious when grew towards dark be just beginning to prepare for circuit around hill suddenly watch gave long low growl kept close a possible ordered dog to be silent presently saw short figure approaching from thickly wooded hollow on left side of hiding place be same figure have seen once before in moonlight at plover barrow proved to great delight to be little maid gwenny carfax started moment at seeing more with surprise than fear then laid hand upon mine a if have known for twenty year man ' said must come with be gwain ' way to fetch thee old man be dying ca die at least wo without first considering thee ' 'considering ' cried 'what can sir ensor doone want with considering have mistress lorna told ' 'all concerning thee thy doings when knowed old man be so near end that vexed be about thy low blood thought must come to life again on purpose for to bate 'ee after there ca be scarcely such bad luck a now if strook thee thou must take there be denaying of un fire have seen afore hot red raging never seen cold fire afore maketh burn shiver ' in truth made burn shiver to know must either go straight to presence of sir ensor doone give up lorna once for rightly be despised by for first time of life thought that have not acted fairly why not leave old man in peace without vexing about affair presently saw again that in matter be right that must not receive old man blessing supposing that have one to give even worse man might suppose while deceived about life have undertaken therefore with great misgiving of ill thought of darling sent watch home followed gwenny who led along very rapidly with short broad form gliding down hollow from have first appeared here at bottom entered thicket of gray ash stub black holly with rock around gnarled with root hung with mask of ivy here in dark lonely corner with pixie ring before came to narrow door very brown solid looking like trunk of wood at little distance opened without key by stooping down pressing where threshold met jamb then ran in very nimbly be forced to be bent in two even so without comfort passage be close difficult a dark a black pitch be not long be a might in there be comfort came out soon at other end be at top of doone valley in chilly dusk air looked most untempting especially during state of mind under be labouring a crossed towards captain house met couple of great doones lounging by waterside gwenny said something to although stared very hard at let pas without hindrance be not too much to say that when little maid opened sir ensor door heart thumped quite a much with terror a with hope of lorna presence in moment fear be gone for lorna be trembling in arm courage rose to comfort darling feared beyond thing else lest must be offended with for what have said to grandfather for dragging into presence told almost falsehood first last that ever did tell to wit cared not that much showed tip of thumb a said for old sir ensor wrath so long a have granddaughter love now tried to think a said so a to save from being lie somehow other did not answer be vexed with way lorna took by hand a bravely a must led into little passage where must hear river moaning branch rustling here passed a long minute a fear ever cheated time of saying to myself continually that there be nothing to be frightened at yet growing more more afraid by reason of so reasoning at last lorna came back very pale a saw by candle carried whispered 'now be patient dearest never mind what say to attempt to answer look at gently steadfastly if can with show of reverence above thing compassion drive almost mad now come walk very quietly ' led into cold dark room rough very gloomy although with two candle burning took little heed of thing in though marked that window be open that heeded be old man very stern comely with death upon countenance yet not lying in bed set upright in chair with loose red cloak thrown over upon white hair fell pallid finger lay in ghastly fashion without sign of life movement of power kept up rigid calm relentless only in great black eye fixed upon solemnly power of body dwelt life of soul be burning must not look at very nicely being afeared of death in face most afeared to show to tell truth poor blue eye fell away from blackness of a if have be coffin plate therefore made low obeisance tried not to shiver only groaned that lorna thought good manner to leave two together ' said old man voice seemed to come from cavern of skeleton that great john ridd ' ridd be name honour ' be must answer 'and hope worship be better ' have sense enough to know what have be doing ' 'yes knew right well ' answered 'that have set mine eye far above rank ' 'be ignorant that lorna doone be born of oldest family remaining in north europe ' ' be ignorant of worship yet knew of high descent from doones of bagworthy ' old man eye like fire probed whether be jesting then perceiving how grave be thinking must not laugh a many people suppose of took on to make good deficiency with very bitter smile know of own low descent from ridds of oare ' answered being a yet unaccustomed to style of speech ridds of oare have be honest men twice a long a doones have be rogue ' must not answer for john ' sir ensor replied very quietly when expected fury 'if be so thy family be very oldest in europe now hearken to boy clown honest fool thou art hearken to old man word who have not many hour to live there be nothing in world to fear nothing to revere trust nothing even to hope for least of be there aught to love ' hope worship be not quite right ' answered with great misgiving be sad mistake for anybody to live sir ' continued a if have never spoken 'though may seem hard for week two like loss of other toy deprive of nothing add to comfort if there be such thing to happiness when forbid ever to see that foolish child again marriage be wretched farce even when man

there have reasoned enough with be not in habit of reasoning though have little confidence in man honour have reliance in woman pride will pledge word in lorna presence never to see to seek again never even to think of more now call for be weary kept great eye fixed upon with icy fire a if scorned life death on haughty lip slight amusement at trouble then raised one hand a if be poor dumb creature pointed to door although heart rebelled kindled at proud disdain must not disobey freely made low salute went straightway in search of lorna found love not love according a now must behave for be very desperate being put upon so sadly lorna doone be cry softly at little window listening to river grief laid heavy arm around not with air of claiming of forcing thought to only just to comfort ask what be thinking of to arm made answer neither to seeking eye to heart once for spoke with own upon not word sound between not even kiss be interchanged man maid who have ever loved hath learned understanding therefore came to pas that saw fit to enter sir ensor room in following manner lorna with right hand swallowed entirely by palm of mine waist retired from view by mean of left arm one side of hair came down in way to be remembered upon left fairest part of favourite otter skin waistcoat head a well must have lain there doubtless for danger of walking so for part be too far gone to lag behind in matter carried love bravely fearing death hell while abode beside old sir ensor looked much astonished for forty year have be obeyed feared by around knew that have feared vastly before got hold of lorna indeed be still afraid of only for loving lorna so having to protect then made bow to very best of have learned at tiverton in london after waited for to begin a became age rank in life 'ye two fool said at last with depth of contempt word may express 'ye two fool beay please worship ' answered softly beaybe be not such fool a look though be be well content so long a may be two fool together john ' said old man with spark a of smiling in eye art not altogether clumsy yokel clod took thee for ' 'oh grandfather oh dear grandfather ' cried lorna with such zeal flashing that hand went forward 'nobody know what john ridd be because be so modest mean nobody except dear ' here turned to again rose upon tiptoe kissed ' have seen little o ' world ' said old man while be half ashamed although so proud of lorna be beyond have seen nearly have heard of be more fit for southern climate than for fog of exmoor 'it be fit for world worship with honour good leave will ' answered in humility being still ashamed of 'when happens so to people there be nothing can stop sir ' now sir ensor doone be leaning back upon brown chair rail be built like triangle a in old farmhouse from one of have come no doubt free from expense gratitude a spoke coughed little sighed good deal more perhaps dying heart desired to open time again with lift of warmth hope a descried in eye arm must not understand then more than baby playing with grandfather spectacle nevertheless wondered whether at time of life rather on brink of death be thinking of youth pride 'fools be be fool for ever ' said sir ensor doone at last while feared to break thought let other know own with little way of pressure 'it be best thing can wish boy girl be boy girl until have grandchild ' partly in bitterness spoke partly in pure weariness then turned so a not to see white hair fell like shroud around chapter xli cold comfort thing being full of flaw thing being full of hole strength of thing be in shortness if sir ensor doone have dwelled for hour upon hour perhaps upon lorna must have wearied of required change of air now longed to see know great deal more about hoped that might not go to heaven for at least week more however be too good for world a say of people who leave verily believe heart be not bad one after evil have done no doubt a evil have be done to yet how many have done evil while receiving only good be that a may not vexing question settled for ever without vote let own that be at least brave courteous gentleman loss aroused great lamentation not among doones alone woman have carried off also of general public many even of magistrate for several mile round exmoor not only from fear lest one more wicked might succeed a appeared indeed too probable from true admiration of strong will sympathy with misfortune will not deceive one by saying that sir ensor doone gave in so many word consent to resolve about lorna never did except by speech last written down from a mentioned grandchild lawyer perhaps might have argued not what may have meant to bestow on blessing only that died next day without taking trouble to do called indeed for box of snuff be very high thing to take never took without being in very good humour at least for though must not go up nostril through failure of breath be pleased to have there not to think of dying 'will honour have wiped ' asked very softly for brown appearance of spoiled to idea white mostacchio seemed to shake head thought kept spirit up have never before seen one do what of have to do day greatly kept spirit down although did not so very much frighten for take man little while instinct being of death perhaps at least a much a of life account for slaying fellow men so other creature doe not take man very

of woman said that from face believed knew that liked to have at one side of bed lorna upon other hour two ere old man died when only two be with looked at very dimly softly a if wished to do something for have left now too late lorna hoped that wanted to bless only frowned at let hand drop downward crooked one knotted finger 'he want something out of bed dear lorna whispered to beee what

be good sound be sure can not tell seemed to that ought to have let jericho traveller alone inasmuch a rather fell among tom fagus than resembled however reasoning be too much for mother to hold out against tom be replaced more than being regarded now a injured man how mother contrived to know that because have be too hard upon tom must be right about necklace be point never must clearly perceive though doubt must explain to prove right in conclusion went to fetch lorna that trinket might be examined before day grew dark darling came in with very quick glance smile at cigarro for be having third by time to keep thing in amity waved towards a much a to say 'you see can do ' then mother led up to light for tom to examine necklace on shapely curve of neck hung like dewdrop upon white hyacinth be vexed that tom must have chance to see there even if have read thought outrun with own lorna turned away softly took jewel from place so much adorned a turned away sparkled through rich dark wave of hair then laid glittering circlet in mother hand tom faggus took eagerly bore to window go out of sight ' said 'you can not resist such thing a if be what think ' 'jack will have to

found out lorna be fond of money then sighed rather heavily for of fault seems to one of worst in woman even before sigh be finished have cause to condemn for lorna took necklace very quietly from hand of squire faggus who have not half done with admiring went up to mother with sweetest smile ever saw 'dear kind mother be so glad ' said in whisper coaxing out of sight of 'now will have wo dear

fear noblest mother knew not what to say of course must never dream of taking such gift a yet saw how sadly lorna must be disappointed therefore mother did from habit what almost always did called to help knowing that eye be full for anything noble move so quite a rashly a thing pitiful pretended not to hear mother to see wild cat in dairy therefore can not tell what mother said in reply to lorna for when came back quite eager to let love know how worshipped how deeply be ashamed of for meanly wronging in heart behold tom faggus have gotten again necklace have such charm for be delivering around especially to annie who be wondering at learning dissertation on precious stone sentiment about in hand said that work be very ancient undoubtedly very good cutting of line be true angle be in

dulled instead of answering a must to possibility of gaze overpowering eye intent on deeper mystery laughed at squire dissertation for how must know thing being nothing better indeed much worse than mere northmolton blacksmith took laughter with much good nature having annie to squeeze hand convey grief at ignorance said that of one thing be quite certain therein believed to wit that trinket of kind never must have belonged to ignoble family to one of very highest most wealthy in england looking at lorna felt that must have come from higher source than very best of diamond tom faggus said that necklace be made must answer for in amsterdam two three hundred year ago long before london jeweller have begun to meddle with diamond on gold clasp found letter done in inverted way meaning of be beyond also bearing of kind believed be mountain cat thereupon declared that now have earned glass of schnapps must mistress lorna mix for be amazed at impudence annie who thought business did not look best pleased hoped that lorna must tell at once to go do for instead of rose to do with soft humility went direct to heart of tom leaped up with curse at took hot water from must not allow to do anything except to put sugar in then bowed to grandly knew what lorna be thinking of be thinking time that necklace have be taken by doones with violence upon great robbery that squire faggus knew though must not show knowledge that be perhaps reason why mother have refused so said more about necklace for long time afterwards neither did darling wear now that knew value did not know history

poor fellow to right master have finished dinner be in more pleasant humour having even offered to kiss annie out of pure gratitude a said annie answered with spirit gratitude must not be shown by increasing obligation jeremy made reply to that only way to be grateful then be to tell story so did at greater length than can here repeat for doe not bear particularly upon lorna fortune appears that a be riding towards from town of southmolton in devonshire found road very soft heavy flood out in direction met with other difficulty until came to landacre bridge have only single trooper with man not of militia of king army whom jeremy have brought from exeter a two descended towards bridge observed that kensford water river barle be pouring down in mighty flood from melting of snow so great indeed be torrent after united that only parapet of bridge must be seen above water road across bank being covered very deep on hither side trooper did not like look of proposed to ride back again round by way of simonsbath where stream be smaller stickles must not have so dashing into river swam horse for bridge gained with little trouble there found water not more than up to horse knee perhaps on crown of bridge turned horse to watch trooper passage to help with direction when suddenly saw fall headlong into torrent heard report of gun from behind felt shock to own body such a lifted out of saddle turning round beheld three men risen up from behind hedge on one side of onward road two of ready to load again one with gun unfired waiting to get good aim at then jeremy did gallant thing for doubt whether must have have presence of mind in danger saw that to swim horse back again must be almost certain death a affording target where even wound must be fatal therefore struck spur into nag rode through water straight at man who be pointing long gun at if horse have be carried off leg there must have be end of jeremy for other men be getting ready to have shot at luckily horse galloped right on without need for swimming being excited doubt by have seen heard of jeremy lay almost flat on neck so a to give little space for good aim with mane tossing wildly in front of now if young fellow with gun have brain a ready a flint be must have shot horse at once then have stickles at mercy instead of that let fly at man missed altogether being scared perhaps by pistol jeremy showed mouth of galloping by at full speed master stickles tried to leave mark behind for changed aim of pistol to biggest man who be loading gun cursing like ten cannon pistol missed fire doubt from flood have gurgled in over holster jeremy seeing three horse tethered at gate just up hill knew that have not yet escaped have more of danger behind tried other great pistol at one of horse tethered there so a to lessen if possible number of pursuer powder again failed durst not stop to cut bridle bearing men coming up hill so even made most of start thanking god that weight be light compared at least to what theirs be thing have noticed gave hope of escaping to wit that horse of doones although very handsome animal be suffering still from bitter effect of late long frost scarcity of fodder 'if catch up shoot in course of first two mile may see home again be what said to a turned to mark what be about from brow of steep hill saw flooded valley shining with breadth of water trooper horse on other side shaking drenched flank neighing half way down hill saw three doones mounting hastily then knew that only chance lay in stoutness of steed horse be in pretty good condition rider knew thoroughly how to make most of though have travelled mile day through very heavy ground bath in river have washed mud off be refreshment therefore stickles encouraged nag put into good hard gallop heading away towards withycombe at first have thought of turning to right making off for withypool mile so down valley good sense told that one there must dare to protect against doones so resolved to go on way yet faster than have intended three villain came after with speed must muster making sure from badness of road that must stick fast ere long so be at mercy be jeremy chiefest fear for ground being soft thoroughly rotten after so much frost snow poor horse have terrible work of with time to pick way even more good luck than skill be needed to keep from foundering how jeremy prayed for exmoor fog such a have often sworn at might turn aside while pursuer went past fog came even storm to damp priming of gun be wood coppice nigh place to hide in only hill moor valley with flying shadow over great bank of snow in corner at one time poor stickles be quite in despair for after leaping little brook cross track at newland be stuck fast in 'dancing bog ' a call upon exmoor horse have broken through crust of moss sedge marishweed must hing wallow sink with black water spirting over jeremy struggling with might saw three villain now topping crest le than furlong behind heard shout in savage delight with calmness of despair yet resolved to have one more try for scrambling over horse head gained firm land tugged at bridle poor nag replied with power to call upon courage reared forefoot out of slough with straining eyeball gazed at 'now ' said jeremy fine fellow ' lifting with bridle brave beast gathered roll of loin sprang from quagmired haunch one more spring be on earth again instead of being under jeremy leaped on back stooped for knew that must fire two bullet whistled over a horse mad with fright dashed forward in five minute more have come

by a passed towards lucott hill struck upon fount of lynn horse of three pursuer began to tire under then jeremy stickles knew that if must only escape slough be safe for present so stood up in

aside in course of evening told about saying that knew a well a did that be not woman business took a be meant for gentle caution that lorna whom have not seen a yet must not be informed of of doings herein quite agreed with not only for furtherance because always think that woman of mind be best when least meddle with thing appertain to men master stickles complained that weather have be against bitterly closing road around even a have done with have taken eight day said to get from exeter to plymouth whither found that most of troop have be drafted off from exeter when be told there be battalion of one of king horse regiment two company of foot soldier commander have order later than date of jeremy commission on account to quit southern coast march inland therefore although must gladly have come for brush with celebrated doones be more than durst attempt in face of instruction however spared single trooper a companion of road to prove to justice of county lord lieutenant that have approval to authority master stickles now be forced to address although must rather have have one trooper than score from very best trained band for trained band have afforded very good soldier in time of civil war for year afterwards now discipline be gone younger generation have seen no real fighting must have own opinion must want to argue if be not allowed went about duty in such temper a to prove that own way be best neither be worst of for jeremy made doubt what if must only get militia to turn out in force might manage with help of own men to force stronghold of enemy truth be that officer knowing how hard must be to collect men at time of year in state of weather began with one accord to make possible excuse especially pressed point that bagworthy be not in county devonshire people affirming vehemently that lay in shire of somerset somersetshire folk averring even with imprecation that lay in devonshire now believe truth to be that boundary of two county a well a of oare brendon parish be defined by bagworthy river so that disputant on side be right wrong upon master stickles suggested a thought very sensibly that two county must unite equally contribute to extirpation of pest shamed injured alike hence arose difficulty for men of devon said must march when somerset have taken field son of somerset replied that indeed be quite ready what be cousin of devonshire doing so came to pas that king commissioner returned without army with promise of two hundred men when road must be more passable meanwhile what be to do abandoned a be to mercy of doones with only own hand to help herein grieved at own folly in having let tom faggus go whose wit courage must have be worth at least dozen men to upon matter held long council with good friend stickles telling about lorna presence what knew of history agreed with that must not hope to escape attack from outlaw more especially now that knew to be returned to also praised for forethought in having threshed out corn hidden produce in such manner that be not likely to find furthermore recommended that entrance to house must at once be strengthened watch must be maintained at night thought wiser

towards picking up anything wanted stabbing inhabitant by first creating blaze in rick yard though rick be now of mere straw except indeed two of prime clover hay although on top be so wet that firebrand might hurt be unwilling to have burned fearful that might kindle if well roused up with fire upon windward side by bye doones have got worst of pleasant trick one time for happening to fire

not likely that outlaw must attack out premise until time after moon be risen because must be too dangerous to cross flooded valley in darkness of night for consideration must have striven harder against stealthy approach of slumber even so be very foolish to abandon watch especially in such a who sleep like dormouse moreover have chosen very worst place in world for such employment with goodly chance of awakening in bed of solid fire so might have be nay must have be for lorna vigilance light hand upon arm awoke not too readily leaping up seized club prepared to knock down somebody

morning for be vexed at own neglect that lorna must have to right before have be long on duty making round of rick stable hailing gwenny now then from bottom of tree short wide figure stole towards in out shadow saw that be other than little maid herself that bore tidings 'ten on crossed watter down yonner ' said gwenny putting hand to mouth seeming to regard a good news rather than otherwise 'be

must satisfy however pulled very best a horse always do culverin went up hill without smack of whip swearing have be arranged very justly doubt quite in keeping with spirit of constitution a proved not too wisely that body of men must act in own county only so when reached top of hill son of devon marched on across track leading into doone gate so a to fetch round western side attack with culverin from cliff whence sentry have challenged on night of passing entrance meanwhile yellow lad be to stay upon eastern highland whence uncle reuben have reconnoitred so long ago whence have leaped into valley at time of great snow drift here be not to show keep culverin in wood until cousin of devon appeared on opposite parapet of glen third culverin be entrusted to fifteen trooper who with ten picked soldier from trained hand making in five thirty men be to assault doone gate while outlaw be placed between two fire from eastern cliff western with force went jeremy stickles with

colonel stickles a everybody now called for great ability mastery of art of war admitted that deserved high praise said that be not by mean equally certain of success so large proportion of force being only raw militia brave enough doubt for anything when saw way to knowing little of gunnery wholly unused to be shot at whereas doones be practised marksman being compelled when lad like balearic

much a almost anything upon that said that must do for when man got over first blush of diffidence soon began to look upon a puff of destiny wish must only tell what happened in battle of day especially a nearly people round part who never saw gun fire in have gotten tale so much amiss of will even stand in front of own hearth contradict to teeth although at time be not born father put

plenty of spectator to mind horse for a soon a must charge inasmuch a friend neighbour who have so keenly prepared for battle now resolved to take part look on praise winner at last heard loud bang bang proved that devon somerset be pouring indignation hot into den of malefactor at least so supposed therefore at double quick march advanced round bend of cliff have hidden hoping to find gate undefended to blow down barrier with fire of cannon indeed seemed likely at first to be so for wild mountainous gorge of rock appeared to be in pure loneliness except where coloured coat of soldier metal trapping shone with sun behind therefore shouted loud hurrah a for easy victory while sound of cheer rang back among crag above shrill clear whistle cleft air for single moment then dozen carbine bellowed among flew murderous lead several of men rolled over rest rushed on like briton jeremy in front while heard horse plunging at loaded gun behind 'now lad cried jeremy 'one dash be

heavy oak door fell to with bang behind so utterly be sens gone naught strength remaining caught up cannon with hand dashed breech first at doorway solid oak burst with blow gun stuck fast like builder putlog here looked round in vain for one to come follow up success scanty light showed figure moving through length of tunnel behind only heavy groan two went to heart chilled so hurried back to seek jeremy fearing that must be smitten down so indeed found a well a three other poor fellow struck by charge of culverin have passed so close beside two of four be a dead a stone growing cold already jeremy other must manage to groan just now then so turned attention to thought more of fighting having so many wounded men so many dead among loitered at cavern mouth looked at one wishing only for somebody to come take command of one came be griefed so much about poor jeremy besides being wholly unused to violence of bloodshed must only keep head up try to stop from bleeding looked up

devonshire somerset being embarked in same cause must be fighting with one finding nothing more to be done in way of carrying on war laid poor master stickles two more of wounded upon carriage of bark hurdle whereon gun have lain rolled gun into river harnessed horse yet alive put others out of pain sadly wended homewards feeling to be thoroughly beaten yet ready to maintain that be fault of ours in opinion woman joined being only too glad thankful to see home alive again now enterprise having failed so prefer not to dwell too long upon only just to show mischief lay at root of failure mischief be vile jealousy betwixt red yellow uniform now try to speak impartially belonging more to somerset than do to devonshire living upon border born of county tale be told by one side first then quite to different tune by other then by together with very hot word of reviling desire to fight out again putting with truth appears to be a follows men of devon who bore red facing have long way to go round hill before must get into due position on western side of doone glen knowing that cousin in yellow must claim whole of glory if allowed to be first with firing worthy fellow waited not to take good aim with cannon seeing others about to shoot fettled anyhow on slope pointing in general direction trusting in god for aimworthiness laid rope to breech fired now a providence ordained shot

wounding two now what did men of somerset do instead of waiting for friend to send round beg pardon train gun full mouth upon with vicious meaning shoot not only loudly cheered when saw four five red coat lie low for savage feeling not even remark of devonshire men concerning coat must entirely excuse now need not tell rest of for tale make man discontented enough side waxed hotter hotter with fire of destruction that gorge of cliff lay between very few must have lived to tell of for western blood becomes stiff firm when churned with sense of wrong in at last doones who must have laughed at thunder passing overhead recalling men from gallery issued out of gwenny gate have be wholly overlooked fell on rear of somerset men slew four beside cannon then while survivor ran away outlaw took hot culverin rolled down into valley thus of three gun set forth that morning only one ever came home again be gun of devonshire men who dragged home with view of making boast about be melancholy end of brave setting out everybody blamed one else several of wanted to have whole thing over again a then must have righted upon one point agreed by reason not clear to that root of evil be to be found in way parson bowden went up hill with hat on cassock chapter lv getting into chancery two of devonshire officer captain pyke dallan now took command of men who be left ordered to go home again commending much bravery have be displayed on side loyalty to king english constitution last word always seems to to settle everything when said because nobody understands yet can puzzle neighbour so devonshire men having bean to sow ought to have done on good friday went home somerset friend only stayed for two day more to backbite to whole thing be purely grievous not from sense of defeat though be bad enough from pain anguish caused by death wound mourning beurely have woe enough ' used to think of evening when poor fellow must not sleep rest let others rest around beurely smell of wound be not incense men must pay to god who made death when come be done with may be bliss to one doubt of life death when man lie a be like trunk upon sawpit grisly head look up at groan of pain be cleaving

engaging in deportment delicate address a by holding out bright hope that plunder of doone glen might become divisible among adjoining manor now have never discovered thing lord of manor at least in part of world believe to belong to if only must get right did seem natural enough that if doones be ousted nice collection of prey remained must be parted among people having ancient right of plunder nevertheless master jeremy knew that soldier must have first of king what must not carry perhaps be punished justly for language so misleading by general indignation of people around not at failure at for must in wise prevent steward of manor rode up to house on purpose to reproach be greatly vexed with of because be too ill to see to myself though by right last to be thought of among so much pain

without money know not care not one thing know right well man who 'cuts man except for vice meanness must be quartered without quarter proud thought rose within a lovely form of lorna went inside be more seen then felt how coarse be how apt to think strong thought so on without brain to bear out even a hen egg laid without enough of lime looking only poor jelly nevertheless waited on a usual manner be for to be beaten while running away be ten time worse than to face out take have done with so at least have always found because of reproach of conscience thing clever people carried on inside at large made long for parson bowden that might know how to act while stored up in memory enough to keep parson going through six pipe on saturday night to have a right a must be next day lean

therefore to river thames with speed hurried keeping best clothes on indued for sake of lorna into quiet stream leaped swam a far a london bridge ate nobler dinner afterwards chapter lxvii lorna still be lorna although man may be a simple a flower of field knowing when scarcely why close to bitter wind feeling why scarcely when open to genial sun yet without questing much into capsule of to do be misery may have general notion how happens to be getting on felt to be getting on better than at time since last wheat harvest a took lane to kensington upon monday evening for although time be given in lorna letter be not inclined to wait more than decency required though went watched house decency must not allow to knock on sunday evening especially when found at corner that lordship be at home

exmoor dialect caused little amazement in mind of who met when came to earl brandir house natural modesty forbade to appear at door for guest therefore went to entrance for servant retainer here to great surprise who must come let in little gwenny carfax whose very existence have almost escaped recollection mistress doubt have seen coming sent to save trouble when offered to kiss gwenny in joy comfort to see farm house face again looked ashamed turned away must hardly speak to followed to little room furnished very daintily there ordered to wait in most ungracious manner 'well thought 'if

that said nothing more than 'oh john how glad be lorna lorna ' for about five minute then darling drew back proudly with blushing cheek tear bright eye began to cross examine beaster john ridd will tell truth whole truth nothing truth have be in chancery sir can detect story now why have never for more than twelvemonth taken smallest notice of old friend mistress lorna doone ' although spoke in lightsome manner a if made difference saw that quick heart be moving flash of eye controlled beimply for cause answered old friend true love took not smallest heed of knew where to find ' 'what ' cried lorna nothing more being overcome with wondering much inclined to fall away for assistance told over over again that not single syllable of message from tidings of welfare have reached one of since letter left behind except by soldier gossip 'oh poor dear john ' said lorna sighing at thought of misery wonderfully good of thinking of a must have done not to marry little plain thing perhaps must say that lovely creature for have never seen mistress ruth forget name something like towel huckaback be worthy maid answered with dignity alone of world except indeed poor annie have kept confidence in told not to dread rank trust heart lady lorna ' ruth be best friend ' answered be worthy of dear john now remember one thing dear if god must part a may be by nothing short of death try to marry little ruth when cease to remember now for head traitor have often suspected look in face wish fearful thing can not repeat ' with word moved implement such a have not seen before made ringing noise at serious distance before have ceased wondering for if such thing go on might ring church bell while sitting in back kitchen little gwenny carfax came with grave sullen face 'gwenny began lorna in tone of high rank dignity 'go fetch letter gave at various time for despatch to mistress ridd ' can fetch when be gone be use for to tell lie 'now gwenny can look at ' asked very sternly for matter be joke to after year unhappiness ' want to look at must look at young man for although did offer to kiss ' saw spite impudence of last remark so did although must not quite refrain

deceived be why love john setting other thing aside because never told falsehood never must know ' 'well be not so sure of think must tell lie to have darling own 'yes perhaps might be right to other people besides two must not do to john never must do to know ' before quite perceived way to bottom of distinction although beyond doubt valid one gwenny came back with leathern bag tossed upon table

that lorna meant not thought that girl deserved frightening a indeed did mistook courage of child of cornwall stepped upon little round thing in nature of stool such a never have seen before thus delivered sentiment 'and may take if please before great lord jeffreys have done more than duty though did crookedly told heap of lie for sake pretty gratitude get beuch gratitude have shown ' replied

'although one of hated believe little maid doe in bottom of heart ' one can possibly hate john ' answered very softly be better pleased with than if have called most noble glorious man in kingdom

far a can diffidence in telling good earl brandir be man of noblest charity true charity begin at home so did be afraid of losing way if went abroad so good nobleman kept money in handsome pewter box with coat of arm upon double lid lock moreover there be heavy chain fixed to staple in wall so that none might carry off pewter with gold inside of lorna told box be full for have seen go to often thought that must be nice for to begin world with told that must not allow mind to dwell upon thing of sort being wholly against last commandment set up in church at oare now one evening towards september when day be drawing in looking back at house to see whether lorna be looking after espied by little glimpse a be pair of villainous fellow about whom there must be mistake watching from thicket corner hundred yard so behind good earl dwelling 'there be mischief afoot ' thought to myself being thoroughly conversant with theft from knowledge of doones will be moon to night when may
