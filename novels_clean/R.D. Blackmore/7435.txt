showed how to take beach partly to confirm own suspicion there be other landing on south coast side of hayling island fit to be compared with for use of flat bottomed craft such a most of boney be

do so in proper place for present purpose be enough to say that modesty of language be scarcely surpassed by brilliancy of exploit if anything be needed to commend writer to deepest good will of reader be found in fact that enterprise sprang from warm zeal for commerce of springhaven leda have be ordered on friday last to protect peaceful little fishing fleet from crafty design for capture have done with good effect having justice on side fortune particular of combat be not so clear after captain three finger be gone if one made proper allowance for there be not very much to complain of

to ground when hear that ship have broken out will command invasion will be for england to find man to set against england will have difficulty sire in doing carne answered with grim smile for shared contempt of english general then prevalent if continent can not do how can poor england once let majesty land be over what be majesty order for where do propose to make landing never ask more than one question at time napoleon answered with usual curtness order to be to return at once prepare supply for moment notice through private influence of fair lady have command of despatch of officer at

sucker for shelter be stool of hazel thrown up to repair loss of stem perceived that emperor have moved horse little when carne rejoined reassured prevented scudamore from being half so certain a must have liked to be about further particular of fine arrangement be next thing heard napoleon say whose power of saying have made yes invincible be not to be done like will await instruction not move until receive from own hand make attempt to surprise anybody anything until have ten thousand men ashore ten thousand will in six hour attain to fifty thousand if shore prof to be a describe so great

clearly to best of majesty humble servant power napoleon offered beautiful white hand carne raised to lip then emperor be gone carne returned slowly to boat with triumph written prematurely on dark stern face while scudamore brisk ruddy feature be drawn out to wholly unwonted length a quietly made way out of covert chapter liv in sad plight how will get out of parole will break instead of getting out will think of first honour country safety of million pride of one old roman must have settled very simply christian can not do thing so thank god there be hurry for few day yet must send

broken parole for country sake then fallen on sword for own sake although such behaviour must be much admired be nicer to read of such thing than to do captain scuddy be of large steady nature nothing came to with jerk jump perhaps because be such jumper wore hat well on back of head because have fear of losing for that found in sad quandary now to begin with parole be not ordinary leave afforded by captor to save trouble special grace issuing from friendship therefore requiring to be treated in friendly vein liberality of term have enabled to dwell a friend among friend to overhear that have heard in balance of perplexity weighed heavily against first impulse to cast away except paramount duty to country in next place knew that private feeling urged a hotly a public duty to cast away thought of honour make off for what have heard about fair secretary be rankling bitterly in deep heart recalled at moment admirable precept of ancient sage in conflict of duty doubter must incline to course least agreeable to inasmuch a reason against be sure to be urged most feebly in self council upon whole question be nice one for casuist if there have not be day to spare duty to country must have overridden private faith however a there be time to spare resolved to reconcile private honour with sense of public duty returning to room wrote careful letter of kept copy to friend desportes now on board commanding flagship of one division of flotilla simply said without giving reason that parole must expire in eight day after date allowing one day for delivery of letter then told m jalais what have done much sorrow be felt in household when time have expired without answer from captain desportes who meant to come see be unable to do so scudamore packed up few thing needful expecting to be placed in custody resolved to escape from at risk of life then walked to etaples few mile down river surrendered to commandant there be rough man a desportes have said with more work to do than must manage with very little ceremony placed english prisoner in charge of veteran corporal with order to take to lock up in barrack there await further instruction then commandant in hurry
