large heavily furnished room be feebly lit by four wax candle glow of west reflected a gleam into eastern window lawyer be pleased to have so to speak with dimly lighted face lady looked beautiful that be that mr jellicorse must say when cross examined by wife next day concerning lace velvet whether wore lace net be almost more than must say for did not heed such trifle velvet be within knowledge though not color shape because thought hot for summer until remembered what climate be really must say nothing more except that looked beautiful when mr jellicorse jerked head said that only meant of course considering time of life lady saw admiration felt that be natural mr carnaby came forward kindly offered nice warm hand while elder sister be content to bow thank for coming hope that be well a yet have not become proper for gentleman visiting lady to yawn throw into nearest chair cross leg dance one foot ask how much toy terrier cost mr jellicorse made fine series of bow not without scrape two showed goodly calf after that waited for gracious invitation to sit down if understood letter clearly mistress yordas began when little rite be duly accomplished have something important to tell concerning poor property here small property mr jellicorse compared with of duke of lunedale perhaps little longer in one family duke be new fangled interloper replied hypocritical jellicorse though other duke be husband of duchess of whom indited daily property of sort come go only tradesman notice estate have be longer in seisin of one family madam than other in riding perhaps in yorkshire never seized cried mr carnaby being sensitive a to ancestral theft through tale about cattle lifting must be aware that came to by grant from crown even before there be crown to grant beg pardon for using technical word without explaining seisin be legal word simply mean possession rather bodily holding of thing be used especially of corporeal hereditament lady have seisin of house land although never seized last thing must think of doing answered mr carnaby who be more impulsive than sister also le straightforward how often have wished that poor lost brother have not be deprived of father will be sacred told be helpless struggled a know must hing be question brought here lawyer said very quietly at same time producing small roll of parchment sealed in cartridge paper last week discovered document be forced to submit to judgment will read to tell purport briefly whatever may be can not in way alter conclusion conclusion have never varied however deeply may have grieved be bound to do justice to dear father certainly madam did also a know did a kindly a possible toward other relative only met with perversity have honor of preparing respected father will model of clearness precision considering considering time afforded other disturbing influence know for fact that copy be laid before finest draftsman in london by by who be displeased with word be 'beautiful beautiful word of hold water ' now that madam can not be said of many indeed of not one in pardon for interrupting have always understood to speak highly of in such case what can be matter matter of matter madam be that testator must have disposing power must dispose of own property a be disposed mean misapprehend mr jellicorse now be in element for loved to lecture absurdity just coming into vogue indulge one moment take silver dish for instance be in hand have use of can give to of lady not very well because belongs to already misapprehend can not give because be not mine to give mr carnaby looked puzzled eliza allow said mistress yordas in stiffer manner now for first time interfering mr jellicorse assures that language be model of clearness precision perhaps will prove by telling now in plain word what meaning be what mean madam be that respected father must devise part only of property because rest be not to devise only have life interest in will therefore fails a to part of property how much what part if please larger better part of estate including house ground home farm mr carnaby started began to speak sister moved only to stop showed sign of dismay anger for fear of putting too many question at once said with slight bow smile let beg to explain a shortly a possible very surprising matter mr jellicorse watched with suspicion because called so surprising yet showed so little surprise for moment thought that must have heard of document now in hand very soon saw that must not be so be only ancient yordas pride perversity stiffneckedness even mr carnaby strengthened by strength of sister managed to look a if nothing more than tale of tenant be pending ten time availed not to deceive mr jellicorse gentleman having seen much of world whispered to that be high jinks felt placed on stool of authority even ventured upon pinch of snuff be unwise cost dear for lady must not have be true to birth if have not stored against however with friendly mind tap now then upon document to give emphasis to story recounted whole of set forth how much be come of already how much might lead to to scargate hall better part of property always enjoyed therewith philippa yordas eliza carnaby have claim except on score of possession until must be shown that brother duncan be dead without heir assignment might have come to pas through son adult even so widow might come forward give trouble concerning that there be time enough to think something must be done at once to cancel bargain with sir walter carnaby without letting man of law get scent of fatal defect in title now that lady knew what did say in answer to lady be inclined to put whole blame upon for not having managed matter better when have shown that whole of be done before have thing to do with be firmly convinced that ought to have known found proper remedy in finished manner of well born lady gave to know without strong expression that atrocity be black stain on legal son of satan living dead still to issue from gerizim can not affect title now assure madam that can not unfortunate lawyer exclaimed at last a for damage poor old duncombe have left

heart there might have be very grand long suit upon grandson to be born next month might have be enabled to settle for life bring up legal family justice however be justice more noble than even such

have jerked with might something other must have given way stir must not from one fatuous position kept head gear on strain must not snap mary even struck with heavy bag of stone to make do something only looked reproachful be there ever stupid poor girl cried with water rising almost to waist inner wave beginning to dash over while outer billow threatened to rush in crush will not abuse more poor
