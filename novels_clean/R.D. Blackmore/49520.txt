than be already while at same time seemed to fill with interest in matter only woman have much to do with went long way to confirm uncle word be other than tabitha tapscott widow from west of england who did cleaning cooking for coming into house at six oclock in summer seven in winter time strange little creature appeared to so different from in way making mountain of thing that never noticed not at given to silence once twice uncle corny after glass of hot rum water usually have on saturday night to restore after paying wage have spoken in strange mysterious style of having have time a sometimes put itpaid footing be not easy to make out drift hint at bottom of if one tried to follow home sometimes must fly off into rudeness if in better vein convey that held tongue for good of younger people such word used to stir sadly because must get more of however began to feel more more a youth perhaps be sure to do when listens to dark experience a if must like almost to go through of on own behalf not expecting at to leave a lesson for who come after simply desiring to enter into knowledge of thing forbidden for knew not a yet that there be pleasure rich enough to satisfy interest of pain be on first sunday of september in year that first left peaceful way fell into joy misery strangely enough a may think be in quiet evening service that sudden change befell that summer have be wettest ever known at rate for four forty year a old men said who recalled time when loaf served out to father mother stuck fast like clay upon churchyard wall now river be up to mark of road meadow on other side be lake even young man be well pleased to feel flint under foot a walked for road be washed with torrent hedge reeking solid trunk of ancient elm seemed to be channelled with perpetual drip sun began to shine out of cloud at very last opportunity weak watery though looked with bank of haze beneath soft relief of hope comfort filled flooded valley into old western porch pleasant light came quivering showed who neighbour be made smile at one a happened now mind be full of certain bed of onion have grown so rank sappy that have not dared to harvest instead of right thought upon entering church be saying to myselfwe will have dry week do believe will pull to morrow chance will show that what now befell came without fault of mine for just a last bell struck stroke ringer swang down on heel of murmur went floating among tree drew back little to let woman pas having sense of feeling about dress be to be respected by man in day wore lovely flounce like bee hive trimmed with venetian blind have learned fine manner of twitching up whenever came to step stair while be at always looked round to make sure of disarrangement respect for made gaze over head a if without knowledge of being there at yet whispered freely to one desiring to know if riband be right for worship of almighty now a gazed in general style being timid about looking especially there came into eye without sense of moment stealing unawares a in vision fairest purest sweetest picture ever went yet from eye to heart to who have never known like be hopeless to try to explain even to myself can not render by word by thought mere jot of many must say that to let thing so happen wit for time must be out of duty may have be only glance turn of head toss of love lockwhatever be for world be different place thereafter be lovely gentle face making light in gloom of tower arch touched with thought of own appearance a other pretty face be have never dreamed that maiden must have said so much to a now came to without word wondering only about feeling abashed at own footstep followed softly up church scarcely knew button of own pew door for uncle corny owned pew insisted upon having must allow one to sit there without own grace written order never found needful to go to church on own account being most upright man if ever heard of other christian being shown into pew put on best clothes next sunday morning repaired to sacred building with black thorn staff have knob of obsidian such thing must now be considered out of date church be church in more established time here sat down in usual manner to best of power because knew how neighbour must be watching saying prayer into bottom of hat resolved to remember where be nothing else be much easier said than done for first face met upon looking round be that of sam henderson racer owner of paddock at halliford young man who thought great deal of tried to bring others to like opinion be not altogether favourite of mine although knew nothing against for loved showy colour indulged in large fancy young woman be in love with now gave nod although clergyman be speaking following turn of eye be vexed yet more with behaviour be gazing a though with lofty approval sort of fear in bright black eye at face have made feel just now so lowly so worthless in manor pew have be empty nearly summerfor weather have driven lady abroadthere sat made feel a if hope be almost gone from for must not help knowing that mr sheppard who arranged worshipper according to rank must never have shown young lady in there unless have be of high standing almost before be out of thought wit being quicker than usual became quite clear to who wasor at rate who be with from corner of pew there came stood before a if to take general attention off highly esteemed very well dressed lady mr jenny marker be lady housekeeper a everybody be bound to call who hoped to get order at coldpepper hall very well bred most kind hearted woman to who considered dignity having always done felt sure of good word hoping much too hastily that young lady be niece made feel perhaps le presumptuous on part to try to steal glance at whenever luck afforded herein found tumultuous bliss until heart fell heavily be heeding very scantily reading of minister voice of clerk faithful of congregation when suddenly there came wordsthe dignity of prince then knew without thinking twice that young lady must never have won dignity of manor pew unless have be great deal more than niece of jenny marker in moment too sens came to back up perception began to revile for thinking thought of not that mr marker be of low condition for wore two ring gold watch chain be highly respected by one cheapened good bought even down to old red herring have be known to make people take garden stuff in exchange for good else forego custom memory of thing grieved with own imagination be very loth to goa will see be naturalwithout so much a one good look at sweet face have blessed everything seemed to turn against light grew worse worse moreover sam henderson stared so boldly having none of diffidence that mr marker came forward sharply jerked ring of red baize curtain so that must see only that at turned red pulled up collar felt within glow of good will for punching of head perhaps have ground for warm feeling toward for reason that being more to left must still get glimpse round corner of curtain acted a total drop of scenery for when sermon be finished in natural course sky be getting very dark outside young men woman be on best behaviour to take advantage of gloom in going out for a yet have great gas work such a impair in present generation romance enlargement of evening service so that when came forth be in frame of mind for thinking best of one chapter iii timber bridge by time have become clear to that thought be longingssuch a who be free from call romanticthere be nothing proper for to do except to turn in at own little gate be satisfied with own duty inside be truly at point of doing although with very little satisfaction when glancing of twilight down road convinced of different duty to westward there happened just here to be long stretch of lane without much turn in only guided overhung partly with tree tuft of wild hop be barren year throughout long course be wavering with gloom watery gleam from west set in partly perhaps from flooded river partly from last glance of sunset hand be just laid upon wicket latch mind made up for thinking when figure of one in distance like call back signal stopped have not returned must understand by shortest possible way from church must have taken to uncle cornys door opposite river being little disturbed perhaps desiring to walk off quietly have turned up to right towards halliford lane to escape gossip come back through garden where stood now there be view by daylight of nearly mile of lane timber bridge across brook lane be not quite straight still bent in such obliging manner first to left then back to right that anything happening upon course must be likely to come into view from gate saw a plainly a must be although beyond shouting distance man with arm spread forth a if to stop catch anybody going further nearer to form of woman desirous to go on frightened be not true stopped to think for one moment who woman be feeling that must be in right

upper part at rate did not find duty to fall beneath ordering a if to make stand to own thought sweetest most pitiful glance have ever come to meet came straight to heart from shadowy nook where beautiful maid be shrinking sam henderson none of rubbish shouted for roar of water must have drowned soft word be coward job to frighten woman man must see first what danger be before must come up to strike a first intention seemed to be ran across timber be bowing trembling with strain upon upright post a well a wash upon nether side saw that risk be increasing with moment for dam at bottom of tim osborne meadow not more than gunshot above be beginning to yield flood checked by be trembling like trodden hay rick upon ran back said now lady if cross must must do at once kit be fool there be danger sam henderson shouted wrathfully who be coward frightens lady now if must poke in oar without leave go first with mother marker will come after with young lady maiden shrank back from hand saw

will go alone behave like gentleman be cry in great distress a came up sam henderson have hold of hand enraged so that forgot good manner for must not have done what did before lady struck sam heavily between eye if have not caught by collar nothing must have saved from falling through bush into deep eddy under plank a soon a have done be angry with for sam be not bad fellow at when in best condition now there be time to dwell upon for flood be arising rolling in loop like back of cat who have descried dog now never miss cried dam have given in minute bridge will be swept clean away showed such bright sense a never saw before never can hope to see in anybody else however may laugh through want of without word even glance at railed up dress into wondrous little circle gave hand have not strength to think of for fear of forgetting world outside taking gently in coarse hard palm said come came like angel a led across gaze be upon be good thing for of for scream from mr marker dreadful shout from samwho came staggering up to brink caught handrail just a be shaking upon middle dipthese great roar coming down meadow must probably have taken wit away if have be within a at ordinary time heeding only that be holding went in leisurely steady manner often make best of danger set maiden safe upon high stone at end turned round to see what be coming before have time to do be upon whirling back with blow of heavy timber washing with best clothes on into hedge behind lane then rush of brown water like drove of wild cattle leaping on one anothers back went by bridge be gone with like straw hat in wind stone upon young lady stood be unmoved although surrounded made sign to herfor to speak be uselessto lay hold of branch hung over head a did so smiled at even in terror felt must go through thousandfold peril for chance of being so rewarded suddenly a suddenly a have mounted bulk of roaring flood fell again wreck of handrail lighter spar of bridge hung dangling by chain soon a peril be passed be hard to believe that there have be much of one listening to mr marker a came down hill when be over must have believed have done something very gallant almost heroic

stopped reasoning with glance of reproach maiden gathered loosened cloak more tightly then gave hand sprang managed so that slid down into arm be not what intended there be help for ground being very slippery after such flood seemed lighter than feather more buoyant than cork though of conclusion perhaps be due to impression be that way must never have believed that anything so lovely must be ever in hold power of drove away presence of mind so badly that be very near forgetting proper time for letting go be wonder when come to think about only wonder be must show such self command for breath of lip be almost on mine blush so near seemed to feel glow deep rich blue of eye so close that be like opening into heaven entire gift of word be gone knew not what did thought suddenly shoutor speech if one must take soof vulgar insolence jealousy most contemptible broke on lofty condition sam henderson have be left in black dudgeon on other side of water bridge being swept away must not get at have forgotten about however have managed to run away when great billow came from bursting of sluice now showed manner thankfulness to god by coming to bank shouting while grinned clapped hand in

even to few who be present there then mr jenny marker account of what have happened be already very grand that sunday eve a soon a have slept dreamed upon great command of word proved unequal to call made at same moment by mind heart everybody listened for practice be to pay little bill upon monday morning almost everybody be convinced that be right miraculous be only word can think of said to mr cutthumb who sold tin tack cabbage not miracle only of sandy desert of place where tree water grow jordan perhaps mean mr marker maam did please to have in mind red sea be in mind come uppermost at same moment mr cutthumb best authority inform now that must not look for more than can understand yet can not understand how kit orchardson contrived after pulling out to pull out miss kitty look here come why be everywhere almost seems to swing along so uncle ought to work harder not that be impudent one can say that of too bashful for man in opinion seems to have taken liking to must be senior by

to say be very young miss in year though not in worship to be run away with from school be thing may occur to girl when bootiful concerning of miss kittybless innocent young facewhat be pleased to say maam be most surprising mr cutthumb very far from when come to consider what human nature be never must do such thing never must sleep easy in bed if thought that ever must be imputed to when look at thing be duty to remember that world be made up of different people from what be what experience have have maam yet keeping complexion so ah if poor cutthumb must have kept away from imperial said be duty of briton done sally get away into back yard with dolly beg pardon maam for interrupting of word so well one thing make point of be mr marker continued with gentle frown never to enter into domestic affair though without bias of sort out of door have enough a know mr cutthumb sometimes more than can manage to regulate own history miss coldpepper be remarkable lady so very so highly superior niece miss kitty doe not seem a yet to take after in particular scarcely to be wondered at when remember that be not niece at of right be not question to interest much one outside of what might call coldpepper domesticity what superior word always do have a be in muff mr marker if please to mean missbeing still so young slip into naturallythe coldpepper manor why be born upon so be parent before that make natural a might say proper for to have word to say about remember coldpeppers since be that high will never go further there be nothing to conceal must never fancy that of

world knew in father day can make bell ring in john o groat house can blow up cliff at land end from london know wrinkle at bottom of sea can make ghost stand at eight corner of room can save own soul maam greengrocer asked in solemn voice being strict wesleyan vanity falsely called science nowadays be depth of snare of evil one learned man know bottom of sea leaf own child to be drowned in brook without be for young kit orchardson can save own soul mr marker maam well if be to go by guesswork must say that have not got very much of to call own know what miss monica be although have be time away from sunbury took first husband in spite of father second without word to anybody have son two daughter by honourable tom bulwrag within year after carried off poor captain who be now called professor fairthorn there be told though never set eye on being made up of telegraph battery magnesia thing call hiderography be hardly ever at home for week together know more about ocean bed than about own lucky thing for for wouldnt be nagger if ever must get opportunity seems to be most unnatural against will of almighty mr cutthumb replied after serious thought that lady must wish to reprove husband yet find ear to put into with invention for doing away distance ought to be able to manage must make difference if did must expect to pay for mind be so taken up when be at home that might a well go on at bedpost if be to open up wire must be at discretion to receive make rather harsh a can understand with one have help for poor miss kitty being always in way rival a be to own child oh doe know what pepper be hot cold colour poor lamb do look so innocent sweet so deserving of real mother father to look after by own account maam step mother doing according to liking why dont run away such booty a be be too sweet tempered well principled for think world of father more doubt because can not attend to time be too precious for to mind daughter not that be money makingfar other way great discoverer a have heard say be last to discover hole in pocket money mr cutthumb have be too long discovered for to take heed of that make source of trouble in household to think of sending big carriage two footman to find young lady in third class at feltham took care to keep from miss coldpepper oh must have be shocking cried widow with hand up why third class aint good enough for dead pig to drain in way on south western line well maam how did miss coldpepper take of thing never speak out of house be liable to err very best of believe know from own feeling last twenty box of star match have from mr cutthumb be star mistake shooting star must be labelled go off like cannon have have to pay for three new apron be mercy didnt set house afire oh hussiesthey never know how to strike miss coldpepper doe change so often never so much a month maam without of giving warning be concern of yours mr cutthumb if speak in low style of coldpepper manor will have to withdraw custom maam from youryour little establishment mr jenny marker a spoke thus gathered in jacket be plaited with blue velvetbecause be proud of figure at least so people said who must not well get at pocketsand although meant more by than to assert own dignity mr cutthumb with fine feeling of widow be naturally hurt showed strange enough to say though seems such trifle what ensued made very great difference to be truly grieved madam said with curtsey little house be best can afford little shop be set up for by very kind neighbour a owned manor when pleased almighty to afflict lo deprive of good man who must always pay sent never must allow to be put upon model husband doubt mr cutthumb except a fancy observed just now for devotion to imperial pintor perhaps must say gallon may never
