thing be compelled to do to return little matter in hope for assistance be trifling exchange of mixed land with sir cradock nowell ah to be sure said chope feeling slightly disappointed for have idea that question must be more lucrative if will give particular will have best attention think have heard said georgie knowing thoroughly about that there be mode of proceeding under act of parliament lightens perhaps to extent legal difficultiesand oh yes expense mr corklemore knew how mr chope have drawn very long billupon imagination oh of course replied mr chope smitten yet more deeply with legal knowledge full of future lord chancellor there be rough ready way of dealing with almost anything what call statutory proceeding shockingly careless haphazard most ungermainely thrust into enclosure act never permit client of ours to imperil interest so for sake perhaps of sovereign there be such deal of quackery in dabblesome interference with ancient institution for security for comfort of mind for scientific investigation there be nothing like exhaustive process of good common law conveyance look at proper abstract of title charming thing to contemplate still more charming if possible requisition upon when prepared by eminent counsel tendency of present age be to slur cut short everything melancholy most melancholy especially for legal gentleman suppose mr chope yes doe hurt feeling so to see grand safeguard invented by men of consummate ability swept away like old rubbish even heard of case last week where piece of land sold for l actually cost purchaser only l for conveyance oh how disgraceful cried georgie so nicely that chope detected irony now presume if proceed in ordinary way must deliver receive what call abstract of title quite so quite so whichever way proceed be most indispensable step will be duty privilege to deduce mr corklemores title mr brockwoods presume to show sir cradock nowells may be completed in six month time if side act with energy if will favour with description of parcel will write at once to mr brockwood indeed will see to night will be at mason dinner for moment mr corklemore be taken quite aback be needle to say that interchange of land have ever be dreamed of except by a possible method of learning how land lay indeed there be intermixed land at a mr chope strongly suspected neither be for matter of likely to meet mr brockwood when becomes professional question man can mostly out lie woman because have more experience be guided by if please said georgie smiling enough to misguide one must not be premature lest seem too anxious about bargain be sure have done very best to be perfectly fair with sir cradock only trust of course to be sure that have reposing composingoh how stupid be mean disposing power that there be awkward entail here looked so preternaturally simple must never have done for previous flutter simon chope in moment knew exactly what game be nevertheless answered nicely in tantalizing way often make woman flash forth will see doubt ere long of course sir cradock must not propose unless have full power be quite certain that poor clayton nowell left legitimate offspring oh what horrible suggestion thing must quite upset scheme georgie have never thought of yet might even be so there be something in tone of mr chopes whisper convinced that have heard something only think young men be so little looked after at oxford that can get married very easily without anything being heard of at least so thought mr corklemore then oh if poor clayton have left child how grandfather must idolize sir cradock must slip from hand altogether scarcely hope must remain of diverting succession even if child be daughter probably must inherit must not yet have committed felony oh what fearful blow must be passed through rapid mind in about second during time however thinker must not help looking nonplussed mr chope of course perceived found more more wide awake well what strange idea exclaimed with unfeigned surprise there have not be slightest suggestion of anything of kind indeed have lately heard what surprised very much that have formed anan improper attachment in quarter very near home indeed do know to whom be mr chope who be trying now to appear indifferent yes be told doe not become to repeat such story not only becomes in case be absolute duty andand true interest why quite frighten mr chope manner be so strange must grieve deeply indeed to alarm madame la comtesse answered lawyer trying in vain to resume airiness can not do justice to one who doe not fully confide in in case like especially such interest be concerned title be soso complicated purely a matter of business must be advised about everything well see reason why must not tell can not be of importance poor clayton nowell have fallen in love with girl very far beneath himthe daughter think be of mr garnet oh think have heard report of sorthe have never heard suspected itit can of course signify nothing if matter went further nevertheless thank for gratifying confidence apologize if alarmed there be nothing alarming at in be thinking of something very different be utterly false diverted from subject oh yes see of something mean might have caused disagreement between unfortunate brother now tell opinionin strictest confidence of courseas to awful occurrence do thinkoh hope not be far away at time can form conclusion know that partner mr cole coroner be too sadly convincedoh beg pardon forgot for moment madame la comtesse pray forget relationship rather consider a reason oh must rather know sad sad truth be suspense oh cruel suspense what be mr cole conclusion that if cradock nowell be put on trial must not find jury in england must convict oh how inexpressibly shocking excuse may ask for glass of water oh thank thank wine if please must hurry away quite rudely fresh air will revive can not conclude instruction to day how must think of such little matter please to hing until hear from yes hear carriage told giles to allow ten minute only unless mr corklemore came see how thoroughly well know value of time feel so acutely must not presume further if please having thus appraised mr chope apprised of distance from social point of view georgie gave smile disarmed at least for moment be not lawyer man to concede last word lawyer never presume more
