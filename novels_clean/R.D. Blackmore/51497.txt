keep down upon slouch be out of sort truly be case just now with soul of captain purvis deborah pring did very best be in out of room minute very often seemed to to run down when deserved not on purpose might be started to run up nothing of sort told at according to intention kept very much to myself feeling that nature be too kind asking at little question of behaviour what sort of return dear father have obtained for supposing other people a good a moreover seemed impossible thing that brave warrior rich man too for father sir geoffrey be in full possession now of great property belonged by right to that officer who must have be in command of fine expedition if have due must be worse better of wound according to glimpse of simple maid like be useless for deborah pring even dr cutcliffe lane to go on a did about love at first sight rising of heart when rib be broken quantity of other stuff too foolish to repeat be plaster poultice replied to myself for must not be too cross to beyond little peep at afternoon kept out of sight of captain purvis thing made very hard for to be quite sure how to conduct without father mother to help with mistress pring who have always be such landmark becoming more than vane for wind to blow upon a listed perhaps a listed to go with remembering how used to speak of people who have ousted told must not make out thing be in condition captain purvis a seemed to quite fit to go make war again upon of majesty subject when thing altogether out of reason even of civilisation happened people who live in lawful part will accuse of caring too little for truth even before came about something unreasonable still unexpected befell to wit received through mistress pring offer of marriage immediate pressing from captain anthony purvis must have be sadly confused by blow on heart to think mine so tender that be way to deal with though later explanation proved that deborah if have be just must have taken whole reproach upon captain must scarcely have seen believe more than dozen time to speak of generally have shut eye gentle a be beautiful not only to make feel le afraid to fill with pity for weakness having knowledge of mankind a yet be touched to brink of tear at first until when tray came out of room soon after one of pitiful moment be plain to youngest comprehension that sick man have left very little upon shoulder of exmoor mutton nothing in bowl of thick onion sauce for must be last to blame being hostess be glad to find so deborah played most double minded part leading to believe that now be father mother in one to while to went on a if be most headstrong certain to go against anything said though for part never said anything nevertheless made great mistake a men always do about way having sense of what be right said let hear more of captain purvis forced to leave might have done for aught must see to contrary full week before departed behaved very well when said good bye for must not deny occasion perhaps if have not assured so much of everlasting gratitude must have felt surer of deserving perhaps be little disappointed also that expressed anxiety at leaving cottage so much at mercy of turbulent triumphant outlaw be not for to speak of when knew reason of silence redounded tenfold to credit nothing however vexed so much a what deborah pring said afterward that must not help feeling in sadness of heart have behaved in manner to just because father be in possession of rightful home property be not so small a if truly did suppose there must have be fault on part for nature be good to everybody perhaps better for not descending through too many high generation there be nothing more strange than way thing work in mind of woman when left alone to doubt about own behaviour with men can scarcely be so cruel because can always convince that did best if fail can throw fault upon providence bad luck something outside own power seem always to be denied happy style of thinking can not put aside what come into heart more quickly have le stir of outward thing to lead away to brighten so that fell into sad low spirit glory of year began to wane forest grew more more lonesome chapter

district where water ran deeper a have be told trout be le worried by quarryman because be such savage place deserted by except evil spirit even aber aydyr slater must not enjoy fishing there promised gladly to come only keeping old understanding between that must attend to own pursuit own opportunity mainly so that george might stir most when trout rose well when shadow fell properly thus set forth about nine oclock of bright cheerful morning while sun like courtly perruquier of reign of george ii be lifting shifting setting in order vapoury curl of mountain trudged along thus at merry swing for freshness of autumnal dew be sparkling in valley until came to rocky pas where walking turned to clambering after hour of sharpish work among slaty shelf threatening crag got into one of troughlike hollow hung on side with precipice look a if earth have sunk for sake of letting water through on left hand cliff towered over cliff to grand height of pen y cader steepest most formidable aspect of mountain rock piled on rock shingle cast in naked waste disdainfully slippery channel scooped by torrent of tempestuous water forbade one to desire at to have anything more to do with except of course to get painted at proper distance so that might hang at last in dining room of london to give people appetite with sense of hungry breeze to make comfortable with sight of danger be very grand indeed said george a turned to watch for worst part of business be to have to give opinion always upon point of scenery be glad be not cross even crisp with day be magnificent answered see piece

thing in place there bad man come steal be very likely then wished good night again be gone for seemed to be in dreadful hurry before have sense to ask what meant about thing a footfall died away sudden fear came over thing meant must be george bowrings said to myself dropped own set off with blood tingling for place toward have jerked staff how long took to force way among rugged rock stub of oak can not tell for moment be hour to streak of sunset glanced along lonesome gorge cast shadow further than voice must go by saw something long slender against scar of rock standing far in front of

basket half pint mug nearly full of beer crust of brown sweet bread of hill young white onion half cut through clasp knife open screw of salt slice of cheese just dashed with goat milk george be so fond of disliked there may have be hard boiled egg at sight of thing blood rushed to head in such manner that power to think be gone sat down on rock where george must have sat while beginning frugal luncheon put heel into mark of without knowing why began to sob like child who have lost mother what train of reasoning went through brain if passed in obscurity let metaphysicians psychologist a call pretend to know only know kept on whispering george be dead unless have be killed never must have left beer so must have sat making fool of considerable time in way thinking of george poor wife child wondering what must become of instead of setting to work at once to know what be become of took up piece of cheese rind showing perfect impression of fine front teeth put in pocketbook a last thing
