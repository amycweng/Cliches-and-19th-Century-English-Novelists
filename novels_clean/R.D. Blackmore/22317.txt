shunned by sensible people who liked nice fire right side of window so that when shouldered stave with knapsack flapping heavily wiser sort looked on a marching off to bedlam in morning a be starting set watch by old school dial a have cause to remember well staked crown in sporting manner on own watch to be truer by sun upon way back again thus left ancient wall glancing of river stoutly took welshpool road dreading nought except starvation although in day be not by mean cripple george be far stronger of arm leg having always be famous though made fuss about such thing then for running jumping lifting weight using boxing glove foil fine brave fellow a ever lived with short straight nose resolute chin touched measuring bar quite fairly at seventy four inch turned scale at fourteen stone quarter so a chattel weighed more than by mean of rough old easel material for rude sketch did good turn now then by changing pack for mile two thus came in four day march to aber aydyr village lying under cader idris chapter iii if place ever lay out of world be proud of for doing so little village of aber aydyr must have be very near village be built a people expressed of thirty cottage

rod tackle many time have wanted to stop set up rod begin to cast said must not be cheated so have promised mountain must put off with river here however have delight river for mountain for a for fishing that might have must grudge none of if fairly divided whatever caught must not expect to follow always watch dainty manoeuvring be to carry eat own dinner whenever made day of so that might keep to fly water while worked away with brush at mountain thus spent most pleasant week though knew very little of welsh slater spoke little english much a be maligned because will not have stranger to work with found thoroughly civil obliging rather intelligent set of men most of also of respectable religious turn of mind scarcely ever poach except on saturday monday on september a sat at breakfast in little sanded parlour of cross pipe public house bedroom being overhead dear friend complained to that be tired of fishing so long up down one valley asked to come with further up into wilder rockier district where water ran deeper a have be told trout be le worried by quarryman because be such savage place deserted by except evil spirit even aber aydyr slater must not enjoy fishing there promised gladly to come only keeping old understanding between that must attend to own pursuit own opportunity mainly so that george might stir most when trout rose well when shadow fell properly thus set forth about nine o'clock of bright cheerful morning while sun like courtly perruquier of reign of george ii be lifting shifting setting in order vapoury curl of mountain trudged along thus at merry swing for freshness of autumnal dew be sparkling in valley until came to rocky pas where walking turned to clambering after hour of sharpish work among slaty shelf threatening crag got into one of troughlike hollow hung on side with precipice look a if earth have sunk for sake of letting water through on left hand cliff towered over cliff to grand height of pen y cader steepest most formidable aspect of mountain rock piled on rock shingle cast in naked waste disdainfully slippery channel scooped by torrent of tempestuous water forbade one to desire at to have anything more to do with except of course to get painted at proper distance so that might hang at last in dining room of london to give people appetite with sense of hungry breeze to make comfortable with sight of danger be very grand indeed said george a turned to watch for worst part of business be to have to give opinion always upon point of scenery be glad be not cross even crisp with day be magnificent answered see piece of soft sward there where can set up rod old fellow while get stick in trim let fill pipe watch shadow fall quite to suit yet how thing make one think cried bowring a sat on stone smoked of miserable littleness of men like bob speak for sir said laughing at unaccustomed by mean novel reflection be quite contented with size although be smaller than george dissatisfied mortal nature want increase of must have have in world will be much larger said with eye on top of hill last night dreamed that wife child be running to meet in heaven bob tush go catch fish replied for tear be in large soft eye hated sentimental must ever let little turk a bob bistre into heaven do think godson must shout angel deaf outdrum cherub poor little chap be very noisy be not bad sort said george if only come like godfather will wish better luck for be kind word shook hand to let know felt then a if be ashamed of having talked rather weakly took with strong leg dangerous leap of ten twelve foot downward landed on narrow ledge overhung river here put rod together heard click of reel a drew loop at end of line through ring so on heard cry chut a took fly from scotch cap found tangle saw glistening of rod a sunshine pierced valley then tall straight figure pas corner of crag stood a upright a tombstone after more of live bright george bowring chapter iv swift be flight of time whenever man must fain lay hold of created being from behemoth to butterfly dread fly a best may that universal man a nothing be more carefully killed by upper sort of mankind than time how can help making off for life when anybody want to catch of course be not of upper sort make pretence to be so time perhaps may be excused for thinking having have such very short turn at clothes belonged to aristocracy at rate while drew rubbed dubbed made hieroglyphic time be uneasily shifting shuffling line of hill a fever patient jerk work bed clothes worse than that be scurrying westward frightened doubt by equinox at pace be scared by huddling together of shadow awaking from long long dream through have be working hard laying foundation of thousand pound hereafter felt invisible damp of evening settling in valley sun from over sea have still hand on cader idris inferior head height be gray in sweep of mantle threw hair back for artist really must be picturesque having other beauty must be firm to long hair while last then shouted george until stratum of mountain dip jag like vein of oak began sluggishly prolonged slow zig zag of echo counter echo came to ring of sonorous voice made crag precipice mountain vocal with sound of bob must have gone back what fool must be never to remember seeing saw be full of rubbish must not disturb be gone back to cross pipe doubt yet doe not seem like to look for pin in bundle of hay must be job of sense wisdom rather than to seek thing so very small a very big man among depth height breadth of river shingle stone rock crag precipice mountain so doubled up thing while very noise made in doubling flurried alarmed thought be not like george to leave to find way back alone among deep bog whirlpool trackless tract of crag when have got fardel ready be about to shoulder sound of brisk short step set sharply upon doubtful footing struck ear through roar of bank stone shook with waterfall before have time to ask who go there a in solitude one might do slight short man whom knew by sight a workman of aber aydyr named evan peter be close to be swinging slate hammer in one hand bore in other five foot staff seemed to be amazed at sight of touched hat with staff said good night gentleman in welsh for native of part be very polite good night evan answered in own language of have picked up little looked well pleased said in english for why sir did leave thing in place there bad man come steal be very likely then wished good night again be gone for seemed to be in dreadful hurry before have sense to ask what meant about thing a footfall died away sudden fear came over thing meant must be george bowring said to myself dropped own set off with blood tingling for place toward have jerked staff how long took to force way among rugged rock stub of oak can not tell for moment be hour to streak of sunset glanced along lonesome gorge cast shadow further than voice must go by saw something long slender against scar of rock standing far in front of toward ran a fast a ever trembling leg must carry for knew too well that must be fishing rod of george bowring be stuck in ground not carelessly even in hurry a sportsman make snug when for time leaf off casting for instance end fly be fixed in lowest ring of butt slack of line reeled up so that collar lay close to rod moreover in such rocky place bed to receive spike must not have be found without searching for moment be reassured most likely george be near perhaps in quest of blueberry abound at foot of shingle be very delicious fruit of rare fern to send wife who be one of first in england to take much notice of show what confidence have in friend activity strength never feared likely chance of falling from precipice just a began with impatience for be to have dined at cross pipe about sundown five good very bad mile away brace of duck be order just a began to shout george have got to leaping on little rock saw thing stopped at further side of rock below foot be fishing basket half pint mug nearly full of beer crust of brown sweet bread of hill young white onion half cut through clasp knife open screw of salt slice of cheese just dashed with goat milk george be so fond of disliked there may have be hard boiled egg at sight of thing blood rushed to head in such manner that power to think be gone sat down on rock where george must have sat while beginning frugal luncheon put heel into mark of without knowing why began to sob like child who have lost mother what train of reasoning went through brain if passed in obscurity let metaphysicians psychologist a call pretend to know only know kept on whispering george be dead unless have be killed never must have left beer so must have sat making fool of considerable time in way thinking of george poor wife child wondering what must become of instead of setting to work at once to know what be become of took up piece of cheese rind showing perfect impression of fine front teeth put in pocketbook a last thing have touched then examined place around knelt to look for footmark though light be sadly waning for moment discovered nothing of footstep other trace to frighten to comfort little narrow channel of rock stone slaty stuff sloped to river brink be not more than five yard distant in channel saw mark except of smaller stone appeared to have be turned over then looked into river saw force of water sliding smoothly into rocky pool if have fallen in there said must have leaped out again in two second even if force of water have carried down into deep pool can swim like duck of course can what river must ever drown george then remembered how at salop used to swim flooded severn when most of feared to approach bank knew that must not be drowned unless something first have stunned after looked around heart be full of terror be murder cried aloud though voice among rock might well have brought like fate upon a sure a stand here god be looking down upon be black murder in what way got back that night to aber aydyr know not remember be that people must not come out of house to according to superstition be not explained till morning being unable to go to bed took blanket lay down beneath dry arch of bridge aydyr a swiftly a spectre gliding hushed with melancholy song chapter v now a sure a ever lay beneath third arch of aber aydyr bridge in blanket of welsh serge flannel with double border so surely did see not dream what be going to tell river ran from east to west moon being now harvest moon be not very high large full just gliding over crest of hill overhang quarry pit so that if can put plainly moon be across river from striking turbulent water athwart so that face glimmer thereof must have be lying upon river if smooth place have be left for of there be chance because whole of river be in rush according to habit covered with bubble furrow even where did not splash spout leap a loved to do in depth of night when even roar of water seemed drowsy indolent calm tree stooped with heavy limb over changing darkness languidly only few ray of moon like fluttering of silver bird moved in out mesh work leaned upon elbow saw dead george bowring came from pit of river toward quietly without stride step gliding over water like mist vapour of calm white frost stopped at ripple where shore began looked at very peacefully felt fear doubt of more than do of pen in hand george said have be uneasy day about can not sleep have have comfort what have made treat so seemed to be anxious to explain having always be so straightforward unknown hand power of death held so that must only smile then appeared to a if pointed to water first then to sky with import understood a plainly a if have pronounced that body lay under one soul be soaring on high through other being forbidden to speak spread hand a if entrusting with have belonged to then smiled once more faded into whiteness of froth foam then knew that have be holding converse face to face with death icy fear shook strove in vain to hide eye from everything when awoke in morning there be gray trunk of alder tree just george bowring height size on other side of water so must have doubt that have be there after search of about three hour found body of dear friend in deep black pool of aydyr not first hole below place in sat down to luncheon nearly hundred yard farther down where bold cliff jutted out bent water scornfully quarryman must not search pool until sunlight fell on because be place of dread with legend hovering over giant tombstone be name of crag that overhung story be that giant idris when grew worn out with age chose rock out of many others near top of mountain laid under arm came down here to drink of aydyr drank aydyr dry because be feverish flushed with age set down crag in hole have scooped with palm of hand for more water then lay down on back death who never must reach to knee when stood took advantage of posture to drive home javelin thus lay dead with crag for headstone weight of corpse sank grave for in channel of river toe of boot be still to be seen after le than mile of valley under headstone of idris lay body of george bowring fair comely with clothes perfect even light cap still on head a laid upon grass reverently carefully face although must smile more still appeared to wear smile a if new world be home death mere trouble left far behind even eye be open expression be not of fright pain pleasant bright with look of interest such a man pay to food stand back of said sternly none will examine now of note what find here searched pocket one after tear came to eye again a counted not le than eleven of for thought of fuss used to make with shrewsbury tailor about there be something in pocket nothing of importance at present except purse letter from wife for have walked to dolgelly back on last entire day of life be hopeless mystery exclaimed aloud a welshman gazed with superstitious awe doubt be

behind having much to think about in condition took little heed of distance of ground being even astonished when at last stopped a if be bound to go on forever chapter vi have stopped at gate of old farmhouse built with massive boulder stone laid dry flushed in with mortar a dreary place a be ever seen at head of narrow mountain gorge with mountain towering over there be sign of life about except that gaunt hog trotted forth grunted at showed tusk must perhaps have charged if have not be so many house looked just like low church tower might have be taken for one at distance if there have be battlement seemed to be four five hundred year old perhaps belonged to petty chief in day of owen glendower knock again thomas edward stop let knock said one of party impatiently there waddow waddow

right gallantly now need not go into further sad detail of most sad time except to say that dr jones who came next day from dolgelly made brief examination by order of coroner of course have too much sense to suppose that case be one of cholera to surprise pronounced that death be result of asphyxia caused by too long immersion in water knowing nothing of george bowring activity vigour cultivated power in water perhaps be not to be blamed for dreaming that little mountain stream must drown on other hand felt a sure that dear friend be foully murdered a did must meet in heaven if lived well for
