only for be inclined to vent on miserable spite fiendish malignity mean be not deficient might keep without food for day together day provender be renewed might even kill outright yet must not violently injure hair of head to morrow evening will visit again in meantime endeavour to subdue feeling so that may then speak to without irritation with word black abruptly thrust door open quitted dungeon at instant csar who have be pacing up down with wilton in immediate vicinity of particular cell be so close to entrance that light of lamp carried in hand streamed full upon countenance of master a latter sprang forth from deep darkness of old death prison house glare for moment showed interior of dungeon black mechanically turning eye towards place where presumed benjamin bone to be caught rapid glimpse of hideous old man seated rather crouched on bed hand clasped round knee form so arched that knee chin almost appeared to meet in instant dungeon door be closed violently by blackamoor who a locked barred said in low somewhat reproachful tone to csar must not have be so incautious a to throw light upon just a be leaving cell old death have time even in single moment during glare flashed upon countenance to observe distinctly be truly sorry sir must have be go imprudent answered csar in tone of vexation at fault be impossible that must recognise believe so observed black therefore will say no more upon subject old man remains obdurate hardened continued still speaking in low whisper yet have hope of a well a of others wilton supplied benjamin bone with provision through trap in dungeon door party then quitted subterranean by mode of egress communicating with house in red lion street clerkenwell for reader now perceives a indeed may long ago have conjectured that black dwelling be established in quarter lately tenanted by old death chapter cxi conversation pas over month eight week having now elapsed since six prisoner be first consigned to dungeon four week from date of visit description of have occupied two proceeding chapter be between nine ten oclock in evening blackamoor be seated in apartment looking over letter when csar ushered in dr lascelles good evening dear sir said blackamoor shaking worthy physician cordially by hand be seated csar will bring bottle of claret so much admire be delighted that have at length found time to give hour two in order may enter into full complete explanation of certain matter understand understand interrupted doctor good humouredly theory have proved to more practical than expected will not say more about until have given detail of progress before begin must observe that case took out of town six week ago have kept at brighton time have ended most satisfactorily have effected complete cure be delighted to hear tidings so glorious from doctor said black case have baffled physician who have previously be concerned in be now conducted to successful issue by will wondrously deservedly increase reputation great a fame already be dear friend replied physician without for moment seeking to recall thing unpleasant connected with past must inform that galvanism be secret of grand cure have effected let pas on to subject exclaimed doctor hastily a if considerately turning discourse from disagreeable topic have be absent for six week quite strange thing for who be so wedded to london be one of very first of friend on whom call day long have be paying hurried visit to patient now come to sit couple of hour with suppose have plenty of news for none of consequence beyond sphere of own affair in place answered black be of course aware that earl have made esther offer of hand to be sure dear friend interrupted lascelles that engagement be contracted remember two three week before left london when summoned to brighton presume that earl be still ignorant of proceeding exclaimed black finishing sentence for physician yes remains completely in dark respecting thing time may however soon come when will be made acquainted with then think will blame far from cried lascelles emphatically doubtless owes happiness if not life for there be telling what that miscreant old death might not have done to gratify frightful craving for vengeance monster exclaimed physician indignantly must even have inflicted most terrible outrage wrong upon amiable esther generous souled lady hatfield in order to wound heart of earl yet despair of reforming man bad a be observed black reform devil cried doctor will not anticipate by hasty opinion of mine explanation be going to give by bye have have intelligence relative to mr torrens yes answered black esther received letter from daughter rosamond few day ago poor girl father be on way to switzerland where intended to settle in secluded spot old gentleman be worn down spirit broken rosamond state that be afraid be oppressed with secret care beyond with be acquainted man jeffreys said lascelles interrogatively next time visit hackney doctor must professional avocation take to suburb replied blackamoor forget not to look out for most decent grocer shop in mare street over door will see name of john jeffreys entered establishment only few day ago believe be reformed man tried fidelity a well a steadiness in many way during last two month have reason to entertain best hope relative to at event have chance of earning honest good living for have purchased old established business wilton previously ascertained to be profitable concern have heard seen anything lately of friend sir christopher blunt enquired physician laughing a spoke have not seen since memorable night when fulfilled duty of magistrate in room answered black smiling have occasionally heard of be so puffed up with pride in consequence of importance derived from adventure here that look upon a perfect demigod by bye saw advertisement in day paper announcing speedy publication of life time of sir christopher blunt by jeremiah lykspittal esq with numerous portrait containing mass of interesting correspondence between subject of biography most eminent deceased men of present century so ran advertisement at of course laughed heartily exclaimed doctor here be csar with wine long enough have be in fetching up too lad made excuse placed decanter glass on table then withdrew now for promised explanation friend cried physician a helped to purple juice of bordeaux first began blackamoor will speak to of six prisoner generally rather of system a applied to belief originally be that bad men must become to certain extent reformer of through medium of own thought be not sufficient reasoned within that criminal must be merely placed night in situation to think reflect then enjoy light of glorious day again night meditation may be poignant provocative of remorse of salutary kind when day dawn mind becomes hardened again disagreeable redaction fly away most guilty wretch fear not spectre in day time ti in darkness silence of night phantom haunt in word then natural night be not long enough to make impression so deep that ensuing day can not easily obliterate good exclaimed physician follow attentively consideration resumed black led to conclusion that wicked man thought must only be rendered available a mean to induce sincere repentance excite permanent remorse by extending train to long long period if night of few short hour duration must produce very partial limited effect upon mind of criminal reasoned why not make night of many week hope for proportionately grand striking result accordingly resolved to subject six prisoner to test will now give detailed account of consequence proceed said physician be becoming deeply interested six prisoner be placed in separate cell not allowed light in first instance continued blackamoor dungeon be plainly comfortably furnished evening be supplied with sufficiency of food for four twenty hour be ordered to perform ablution regularly under pain of having meat stopped may be sure that did not fail to obey command twice week men be shaved by one of people twice week also be supplied with clean linen woman be of course provided with additional change a health be more likely to suffer than of men allowed to walk up down long subterranean for two hour day watched by wilton so that might not communicate with of prisoner be now about to enter on detail connected with individual physician drew chair little closer to black tidmarsh be first who showed sign of contrition resumed latter must not endure that one long endless night into have plunged night interrupted only by short regular visit of people be ever alone with own thought interval of long day broke in upon impression created by thought be ever in mind continuous night kept that impression there by degree began to see error of way when thought be on one occasion intolerable imagination be filled with frightful image have recourse to prayer next time visited assured that prayer have relieved that must not sufficiently settle mind to pray so often a desired that be moment to give man light did so at same time offered choice between bible tale book chose former with unaffected readiness have selected latter must have seen that craved for amusement only must have have lamp book until have gone through farther ordeal of lonely thought in utter darkness well tidmarsh by aid of light be enabled to study bible settle soul to prayer continual unvaried perusal of bible be calculated to render mind morbid convert sinner into grossly superstitious fanatic accordingly when saw that tidmarsh began to grow gloomy be in very few day gave book of travel voyage soul be refreshed by change improvement in man be far more rapid than must have possibly anticipated during visit to tested sincerity in variety of way by mean of question so artfully contrived a to admit of two kind of answer namely one kind hypocritical other sincere at same time implying sort of promise of release if hypocritical reply be given found straight forward truly conscientious in answer in due time allowed such novel a vicar of wakefield paul virginia elizabeth exile of siberia to read found that preferred travel voyage biography of good great men indeed scarcely six week have elapsed from date of man incarceration in dungeon when felt convinced that be so far reformed character a to be anxious to earn honest livelihood if be only afforded chance then removed from dungeon lodged in room up stair be still in reality prisoner because attempt to escape on part must have be immediately detected so narrowly yet secretly be watched to however must have seemed that be free never evinced least inclination to avail of apparent liberty enjoyed circumstance spoke in man favour night before last be sent off in company with one of dependant to portsmouth whence embarked together for little island of alderney where tidmarsh be to settle in small way of business to establish mean will be found retainer will remain for few week perhaps month so a thoroughly to watch conduct if during period in place where there be evil temptation manifest uniform steadiness of conduct think may safely calculate that there be fear of relapse have be effected in two short month exclaimed physician with tone manner indicative of mingled surprise admiration must scarcely have believed possible listen to next case doctor said black will see that system be most salutary will speak of two bunce collectively man bunce always looked upon rather a soft pated hen pecked fool than radically wicked fellow accordingly moment began to exhibit very serious alarm horror at being alone in dark gave lamp bible length of night made endure be not more than two third of week in respect to wife first demonstration of repentance showed be in desire to speak to husband if only for few minute through trap door of cell of course issued order that request must be complied with be evident that woman derived comfort from indulgence next day be permitted to converse with at trap door for nearly hour then be overheard begging pardon for ill treatment have so often endured at hand for many many successive day short intercourse be allowed on one occasion toby bunce read few verse from bible being in cell with lamp standing outside door in dark subterranean passage manner in received passage thus read to induced to order that also must be provided with light testament for night endured must scarcely be said to have be even interrupted by daily walk in dark passage be just three week gave pain doctor oh gave pain can assure to punish woman so severely mind be very obdurate heart very hardened darkness be long before produced on effect desired at length few day after have be allowed lamp little more than one month ago yielded to earnest entreaty that might be lodged with husband then what change have taken place in be tamed completely tamed no longer vixenish shrew questioning husband mildly in conciliating tone relative to passage of bible travel other instructive book have read to good feeling appeared to establish rapidly between couple have put to several test on one occasion wilton persuaded toby bunce that be not looking very well little luxury be added to evening supply of food being intimated that extra dish be expressly for wilton remained near cell listened to what passed within bunce insisted upon sharing delicacy with wife must not hear of such proposal urged offer be positive in point once again showed resolution of own not in manner to give husband offence very next day be week ago have pair removed to chamber over head giving same apparent chance of escape a in case of tidmarsh did not however seek to avail of yesterday evening be separated again only for short time in fact bunce be last night sent off to southampton in company with one of people thence doubtless embarked for island of sark morning mr bunce will leave presently guarded by faithful dependant harding wife who will not only take to rejoin husband in little islet opposite guernsey will also stay with there for period of six month bunce will follow trade a tailor harding finding market for clothes make in st peter port be capital of guernsey a be well aware so far so good exclaimed physician highly delighted with explanation must system produce result permanently beneficial may become great benefactor to human race for be assuredly far better to reform wicked by course of few week training by playing upon feeling in manner than to subject to contamination of felon gaol inflict year of exile under circumstance be utterly repugnant to hope of reformation pray answer one question must either of bunce tidmarsh choose to resist control authority of dependant who have charge of at present must one of quasi prisoner demand unconditional freedom how can men exercise power sway over quasi prisoner a term answered black have not a matter of course least idea who really be mind somewhat attenuated by incarceration mysterious circumstance of captivity be to certain extent over awed know that have be still believe to be in power of one who wields authority can not comprehend fear alone if better motive therefore render tractable ensures obedience silence at least for present eventually when again become accustomed to freedom will find placed in position to earn honest very comfortable livelihood care being taken to keep alive in mind conviction that business produce bread enables to live respectably only remains own so long a prove worthy of enjoying advantage now calculation belief be people who have entered upon course of crime continue in because be very difficult often impossible to leave for honest pursuit when once have experienced dreadful effect of crime be placed in way to act labour honestly very few indeed must by choice relapse into evil course therefore conclude hope that bunce on one hand tidmarsh on other will if from mere motif of policy convenience alone steadily continue in honest path in be now placed advantage of will soon experience good again said that doctor if calculation only applied to six criminal out of ten must be effecting immense good by mean of system hope indeed be inclined to believe that proportion in favour be even larger be certain that be answered blackamoor well now come to timothy splint man who a may remember be actual assassin of sir henry courtenay if succeed in redeeming that fellow exclaimed physician will say that system can have exception stay though cried thought striking have forgotten old death ah dear friend may a well endeavour to tame boa constrictor a to reform dreadful man will hear of in turn said black tone assuming slight degree of mournfulness a if be le satisfied in respect to application of system to old death than in of other case for present observed must have patience enough to listen to certain detail relative to timothy splint go on dear friend cried dr lascelles be attention patience too for matter narrative be too interesting to be tedious timothy splint continued blackamoor appeared to suffer more horribly from darkness than others spectre of murdered baronet be constantly by side even prevented from committing destruction for whole month did night continue during period must have endured most frightful mental torture be better such state of mind naturally drove man to pray prayer relieved remember how touchingly although in rude style assured one evening when prayed spectre grew le le now notwithstanding be well pleased to find in frame of mind did not choose to encourage superstitious notion therefore explained to that only apparition existed be be conjured up by guilty conscience at expiration of think exactly thirty one day allowed man light bible then pursued same treatment with a in respect to tidmarsh bunce mean gave book of travel voyage moral tale seemed very grateful not only seemed really be hard heart be melted by kind treatment few day ago gave outline of early life found that circumstance have driven into way of crime reformation be therefore easier because have youth of innocence to look back upon regret moreover assured that even with late companion in crime josh pedler have frequently spoken in mournful mood of unhappiness often mark hour of men of lawless character circumstance tended to give strength consistency to declaration that longed deeply longed to have opportunity of earning honest livelihood for future what to do with scarcely knew whenever reflected on subject remembered that be murderer stained with blood of fellow creature case be therefore widely different from of bunce tidmarsh at length struck that emigration to far distant land be only fitting course to adopt proposed to be rejoiced at idea for instantly saw how by changing name commencing world anew in sphere must be removed from old haunt where unpleasant reminiscence must be awakened temptation present moreover beheld necessity of repairing to part of earth where stood chance of being recognised by friend foe consent to proposed arrangement being thus obtained best hope feeling being warmly enlisted in plan have then to ascertain whether one of dependant must consent to accompany man on long voyage to far off clime fortunately enquiry amongst retainer be followed by success at very early hour morning timothy splint guardian rather companion set off for liverpool thence to embark for united state there in backwoods of far west let hope that man murderer whom savage law must have hanged blackamoor shuddered a pronounced word let hope say that timothy splint will day rise into substantial farmer that may yet live to bless period when went through ordeal of subterranean dungeon black paused drank glass of cooling claret for mouth have grown parched by simple fact of giving utterance to one word on have shudderingly laid so great emphasis physician who appeared to guess full well what be passing in mind made remark in few moment other continued explanation in ensuing manner illustration now come to joshua pedler disposition be naturally savage brutal long night of darkness produced on effect varied at different period thought be dreadful to sometimes when visited must at first speak ferociously kind word on part immediately reduced to meekness have not be many day in dungeon when doubtless encouraged by manner towards told that be not only unhappy on own account also on of young woman whom have married according to right of vile class with have so long herded immediately undertook to provide for girl pedler really demonstrated sincere gratitude need scarcely be told that kept promise wilton sought out be found in state of starvation despair comfortable lodging be taken for when be somewhat restored to health needle work be supplied be done without allowing to believe that other circumstance beyond mere accidental discovery of wretched condition have thus rendered object of wilton charity assurance gave pedler that matilda be provided for have most salutary effect upon mind although frequently afterwards showed sign of savage impatience tenour of thought be chiefly regret that have be so foolish a to pursue evil career reproached for folly of wickedness rather than for wickedness disliked solitude darkness be not so much influenced by fear a late companion splint during first month remained in darkness never once spoke to of prayer two three time alluded to bible did not express wish to read at last admitted to conviction that thought oppressed be beneficial to though most unpleasant fancied to be favourable opportunity to test worthiness to receive indulgence accordingly asked if must like to be able to write to matilda calculation be just have touched in vulnerable point be that night allowed lamp writing material moreover on very occasion shed tear longer despaired of taming last remnant of ferocity lingered in nature few day afterwards gave letter to send to matilda of course opened read for be to obtain precise insight into real state of mind have suggested correspondence with mistress content of document confirmed hope already entertained of saw that affection for young woman might be made most humanizing mean in respect to accordingly have brought into house lodged in one of attic

indicating emotion of horror be suddenly excited within when recall to mind detail of history of poor jacob neglected infancy corrupted youth when reflect that own father be individual who coolly deliberately initiated in way of crime just heaven begin to think with that reformation of such monster be impossibility subdue excitement dear friend said doctor let converse calmly reasonably upon matter first then explain to nature of interview with mr bunce observed black will listen with earnest attention went up stair to room in be located said lascelles rose from chair moment entered started back in evident disappointment mingled with surprise when saw be not sir almost immediately observed that wanted to see know that master of house be of dark complexion for have caught glimpse of when have visited dungeon below explained to be friend of yours that have deputed to receive confession have to make appeared to hesitate for moment then burst into tear have be wicked very wicked

marriage with bunce informed that jacob be well provided for happy seemed deeply grateful for assurance then recommended not to reveal secret to husband when must be united again inasmuch a having entered on new phase of existence together must be useless wrong to acquaint with fact calculated only to disturb that harmony promised to follow advice appeared much eased in mind by having unbosomed secret to gave most excellent counsel doctor said black then after few moment reflection added jacob ought not to be informed of secret of hideous parentage at least not for present by mean exclaimed physician mind be tranquil feel certain confidence in friendship be greatest delight let not that salutary equanimity be disturbed must be wrong useless said black musing remember that in course of long narrative gave of life mentioned occasional scintillation of kindness marked conduct of mr bunce towards also recollect that observed to how there be moment when thought great deal of gentle word ever uttered to kind treatment ever showed nature dear friend nature exclaimed good physician even in woman so bad a be at time of spoke there be certain natural yearning must not altogether subdue while on part there existed filial inclination tendency must not understand how much that villain benjamin bone have to answer for ala ala fear that be beyond redemption cried black bitterly added immediately afterwards in changed more decided tone must not despair be now anxiously waiting to hear report concerning observed lascelles be still in darkness night still continues be answer month have elapsed since visited for first time in dungeon during other four week have subsequently passed have have several interview with in same manner interview have taken place in utter obscurity of cell have be constrained though with pain difficulty to assume feigned tone on of occasion at first visit declared in terror amazement that recognised in voice something reminded of of thomas rainford then seemed to be impressed with conviction be earl of ellingham rage against earl be deep terrible saw too plainly that if relapsed into milder tone be to deceive a to real state of mind induce to grant indulgence if not freedom visited again on following night spoke le savagely more meekly mistrusted yes mistrusted fear with good ground can not give very satisfactory description of subsequent meeting at one moment have appeared touched by language have even expressed penitence contrition for past at next moment have exhibited natural ferocity of disposition sometimes have assumed coaxing manner have endeavoured to move to grant light have hitherto refused one thing must not forget to mention be that never since first visit paid have once alluded to impression made upon by sound of voice never have again addressed a lord ellingham in moment of excitement rage have demanded in wild almost frantic tone who be seldom waiting for reply have relapsed either into humour of stubborn taciturnity of meekness knew to be assumed indeed there be many point in character conduct since have be inmate of dungeon can not comprehend be however certain that darkness have not produced on same rapid important effect a upon other five something more severe in shape of punishment something better calculated to touch heart appeal to feeling be requisite at same time believe to be already moved shaken in obduracy to certain degree reformation in respect to must be work of time on whole have hope said physician interrogatively yes when call to memory particular of conduct language from first occasion of visit until last took place yesterday can recognise change answered black indeed be almost convinced that if be possible for to speak to at very great length to argue with on folly wickedness of past life to reason with unrestrainedly must be able to move deeply necessity of maintaining assumed tone impossibility of taking light with so a to watch chanting working of countenance follow up appeal argument appear to have most effect with in word disguise be compelled to sustain precaution be forced to adopt militate considerably against system in respect to must be imprudent for to visit on behalf observed physician on memorable night when lord ellingham have tidmarsh mr bunce in power in adjacent room wrested from secret of damnable plot scheme on occasion know be present old death must therefore cherish only rancorous feeling with regard to true said black musing then suddenly starting from deep reverie of few minute exclaimed doctor have thought of plan hope trust for honour of human nature may prove efficacious in respect to obdurate sinner hesitate yes hesitate to put into execution explain dear friend replied lascelles will give advice candidly frankly in word then doctor continued blackamoor have such faith in soft persuasion of woman be half inclined to conjure esther de medina to assist in good work must consent to visit great sinner rather to address through sliding panel of dungeon door be certain that eloquence aided by musical tone of voice deep feeling must characterise language be certain say that must succeed in touching chord in heart word appeal of mine can reach physician heard with attention began to reflect profoundly for part continued blackamoor believe that eloquence of woman when rightly used properly directed be endowed with influence power almost irresistible woman mission be to tame humanize ferocity of man disposition more antagonistic be character of two being of opposite sex thus to be brought in contact with other better for purpose now decidedly two living creature can be more dissimilar in respect than benjamin bone esther de medina former so savage unrelenting latter so mild forgiving one possessing soul blackened by possible crime other endowed with virtue approximates nature of woman to of angel like project see not least objection to dear friend said dr lascelles after long pause during pondered deeply on plan suggested do think that miss de medina must consent to aid in matter have doubt of returned black perceive that dilemma be somewhat serious not slightly embarrassing can not allow benjamin bone to go forth again into world to recommence vile intrigue besides to give liberty thus must be to defeat primary object have in view in breaking up gang to release at present be therefore impossible scarcely feel justified in keeping locked up much longer in dark dungeon must be unsafe to remove into one of apartment of house that in turnmill street for such crafty fox can alone be kept secure by massive stone wall iron bolt what then be to do with how be to dispose of esther will assist in difficulty god send through agency salutary impression may be made upon old death mind bear in memory exclaimed physician idea suddenly striking that one of man horrible scheme be to avenge on lord ellingham by torturing esther de medina when hears sweet voice revealing to knowledge of atrocious design sincerely promising pardon when discovers how much virtue goodness there be in woman continued black in impassioned tone will be moved will be led to contemplate blackness of own heart will find placed in such frightful contrast with forgiving angel yes yes cried physician emphatically must be done have devised only mean to produce real effectual impression on bad man heart if prove inaccessible to persuasiveness of esther tongue case may be looked upon a hopeless deep toned bell of clerkenwell church now struck hour of eleven scarcely have sound died away in silence of night when post chaise drove up to door of house mr bunce be now about to take departure said black everything be prepared in respect harding wife have already received full instruction necessary fund sooner that woman be safe out of mighty city of temptation better sound of several footstep be now heard descending stair minute afterwards post chaise drove rapidly away from house of prisoner old death alone remains to be disposed of observed black a soon a din of wheel be no longer audible be to be hoped that will not be source of difficulty embarrassment to for many week more said physician rising to take departure chapter cxiii esther de medina old death be on third day after explanation given to dr lascelles between five six oclock in evening that esther de medina be conducted by blackamoor into subterranean passage latter holding lamp in hand will remain near esther enquired in whisper be not necessary answered be not afraid of being in place gloomy a appears since be merely to address miserable man through trap door of dungeon harm can reach thus speaking turned received light from companion manner being calm even resolute though countenance be very pale god bless esther said black emphatically willingness to aid in important matter be not least admirable trait in character be duty though painful one responded beautiful jewess now leave must rather proceed alone to prisoner cell remember said blackamoor be last on right hand side of long subterranean passage then retraced way up stone staircase communicating with house in red lion street while esther advanced along gloomy cavern in lamp shone with feeble lustre in le than minute reached door of old death dungeon there paused for nearly minute sensation of loathing horror preventing from immediately announcing presence to terrible inmate of cell for black in order to prepare a fully completely a possible for philanthropic mission have be compelled to reveal to detail of dreadful design benjamin bone have cherished against lady hatfield have be made known through medium of john jeffreys be therefore natural that esther de medina must shrink from bare idea of holding slightest communication with miscreant of so ferocious character short very short interval of reflection be soon sufficient to arm with courage necessary to support ordeal drawing back sliding panel covered small aperture in upper part of massive door said in soft musical voice prisoner will grant attention for few minute who be demanded old death starting a if from lethargic state movement be indicated by sudden rustling of garment creaking of bed whereon be placed be esther de medina be answer beautiful jewess allowed lamp to cast light upon countenance be so close to aperture old death caught momentary perfect view of feature then placed lamp upon ground thus again leaving interior of cell in complete darkness yes be miss esther de medina exclaimed benjamin bone in voice endeavoured to render a mild conciliatory a possible dear young lady open door let out of horrible place be sure posse good heart heart good enough to forgive for dreadful atrocity contemplated against upwards of two month ago interrupted esther scarcely able to subdue shuddering sensation came over yes know thing continued must have entrapped into power must have deprived of blessing of sight yet never never injured say that forgive cried old death impatiently open door then sweet young lady will find mean to reward well listen exclaimed approaching trap speaking in confidential kind of hollow murmuring whisper dont be offended at what be going to say know that be fond of jewellery be natural for such beautiful creature a be silence sir interrupted esther indignantly be well aware to what allude be time to undeceive on head added in proud tone indeed there be longer necessity for concealment in respect in turn desire to listen listen attentively entertain belief so prejudicial to character can not allow even one a to cherish minute know then have sister so like in outward appearance by satan must be so ejaculated old death light breaking in upon mind a in single moment took rapid survey of circumstance have originally led to suppose that be thief of mr gordons diamond mistress of tom rain yes yes understand now added in tone appeared to imply vexation at former blindness in respect to matter with pain sorrow be thus compelled to allude to sister who be so dear so very dear to resumed esther explanation be necessary not only for own sake likewise to convince of folly wickedness of endeavouring to induce by promise of reward bribe to draw back bolt of prison door visit to be inspired by earnest desire to move soul to contemplation of dreadful deed have marked life then will not set free exclaimed old death in tone of subdued rage latent ferocity not now not now repeated esther listen to attentively go on growled inmate of dungeon a retreated from door threw upon bed again if entertain slightest hope that will ever be allowed opportunity to re enter on course of wickedness crime be sadly mistaken continued esther speaking in conciliatory yet energetic tone even be liberated moment measure must be adopted to render completely powerless for future in respect to perpetration of fresh enormity reflect then whether will not be better for to devote remainder of day in ordinary course of nature must necessarily be few to important duty of making peace with heaven despair of pardon oh despair see that who be mortal being can forgive for wrong meditated against surely mercy of heaven be greater than of human creature yes repent ere be too late god will not cast off eternally mercy be infinite pardon be never asked in vain by penitent sinner continue to speak to thus cried old death in tone strangely subdued wondrously meek considering ferocious excitement so lately animated oh sincerely hope that will recognise error of way ere be indeed too late exclaimed esther in tone of enthusiasm deeply felt by generous soul consider advanced age think how soon hand of death may be laid upon then how wretched how awful must feeling be how must shudder at idea of being about to stand in presence of almighty power whose law mandate have so often violated for after what have gained by long long career of wickedness treasure be annihilated in one hour yes yes interrupted old death in voice half suffocated with emotion jewess fondly believed to be of remorse hoarding of many year produce of innumerable misdeed be thus swept away continued impressively providence at length decreed that must become prisoner in very place where have so long ruled a master doe not heaven then afford solemn significant warning that career of crime be more to be pursued with success warning move heart to repentance remorse neglect not such warning a conjure word do good young lady exclaimed old death be glad that have come thus to speak to will ponder upon what have said demanded yes will not leave yet will come again said in voice indicative of suspense anxiety relative to answer be to be given will return to morrow observed esther thank exclaimed old death tone now denoting profound emotion esther did not immediately leave vicinity of cell on present occasion believing that have succeeded in making salutary impression upon be desirous of following up promising commencement of mission accordingly continued to reason with for nearly hour longer in course of observation argument addressed to ancient sinner displayed sound judgment deep enlightened religious feeling there be nothing bigoted nothing fanatical in language indulged in quotation from old testament book formed basis of own nation creed expatiated on goodness of creator hope exists for penitent sinner terror of death bed without previous repentance folly a well a wickedness of course already pursued by prisoner old death interrupted seldom when did interject observation be in tone of nature calculated to inspire charming jewess with hope that mission have not be undertaken in vain at length quitted vicinity of cell having reiterated promise to return on following day pledge be faithfully kept again do find hebrew maiden persevering in humane noble task of awakening proper feeling in breast of terrible sinner to question whether have meditated upon spiritual condition old death replied earnestly eagerly in affirmative throughout second visit not only sought to retain young lady near rather at door a long a possible likewise seemed sincere in endeavour to inspire with belief that reasoning representation have not be thrown away upon on third day fancied that there be even still more striking change in language when responded to question remark not once during hour that remained standing outside dungeon addressing in style of fervid eloquence came from very heart not once say did give least sign of ferocity savage impatience characterised behaviour on first occasion of visit for fortnight did hebrew maiden continue visit regularly without however venturing to enter dungeon on fifteenth day found prisoner anxiously expecting arrival a usual almost immediately after have drawn aside panel announced presence said oh dear young lady be so glad be come have be thinking so much so very much over have lately told have felt comforted by repeating to myself argument advance urging to repentance ah miss have be dreadful sinner dreadful sinner see be righteously punished though be penitent have confidence in yet that give pain yon be afraid to trust with do think must harm hope not replied esther will not much longer have to accuse of want of confidence in be pleased to observe that at length feel how shocking be to become object of mistrust suspicion be angel young lady exclaimed benjamin bone approaching door on outer side of stood hebrew maiden one on earth save must have made impression upon mind in so short time will promise one thing name request said that will not send man to converse with answered old death be of gentle sex be why sweet voice have have such power influence with have that gentleman whoever be continued to visit must have done good suspect own sex think that men can be so sincere so conscientious gentleman to whom allude will not visit again without consent interrupted esther have undertaken mission will fulfil to utmost of ability have now something important to communicate important indeed must imagine to one who have be so long in darkness in word intend to give lamp oh excellent young lady cried benjamin bone in voice expressive of most unfeigned joy make haste open door give light nay must not manifest too much confidence in at once see what be to have be so long votary of crime wickedness inspire mistrust can not be dissipated in moment what can do to convince of penitence gratitude demanded old death in earnest anxious tone leave to judge for relative to state of mind said esther perceive that already begin to entertain hope concerning proof be that now give lamp book also if have sincere inclination to examine page a uttered word esther unfastened grating covered aperture passed lamp through to old death then volume to have alluded light flashed upon countenance a received lamp struck that there be something hideous even in expression of joy now animated repulsive feature knew that look have grown sinister become stamped with ferocious menace during lapse of many many year must not be changed improved in moment however great be moral reformation have taken place within thanks dear young lady thousand thanks exclaimed old death a placed lamp upon table then after few minute pause during looked into book said in tone of surprise have brought bible containing new a well a old testament yet only believe in latter respect religion of christian although have be taught to put faith in answered de medina in modest subdued tone must

reformation of wretched man below to speak candidly observed esther foresee considerable difficulty relative to future visit to unhappy prisoner feared to mention embarrassment in respect fancied that might suppose to be wearied of task have undertaken know too well to entertain such injurious suspicion interrupted black hastily emphatically be natural now that arthur be so shortly to be united

many grave important interest depend upon success of endeavour to humanize reform wretched prisoner disarm for future still must not stoop to falsehood subterfuge to account to earl of ellingham for daily absence from home for several hour be true that father be in secret of proceeding that even approved of course suggested have adopted stay idea strike suddenly ejaculated black told ere now that benjamin bone implored to continue visit to not allow to take place from circumstance have drawn favourable augury relative to ultimate complete repentance already look upon a guardian angel mean of salvation must be perhaps productive of evil result might even lead to moral reaction on part be to believe that have deserted have so well prepared way in grand work of reformation with regard to man that might now undertake duty benjamin bone must still continue to believe that be same esther de medina who visit understand said hebrew maiden evidently rejoiced at suggestion relieved mind from fear of serious difficulty must be satisfied with such arrangement see alternative replied black arthur will call daily at finchley manor frequent absence must to say least of appear strange oh

pain that learned gentleman took to get frank curtis remanded to prison for six month so much perspiration such frantic gesticulation such impassioned declamation be well worth money if did mr

disagreeable to for moment too have be satisfied with assurance of legitimacy have received from lip of father when found alone in own bed chamber surrounded by stillness of night must no longer check natural current of reflection deep silence in mansion be enveloped secluded position of apartment slightly romantic turn of mind united to give impulse to thought be so intimately associated with subject of mysterious strange import then many circumstance remembered in connexion with early boyhood until now never before pondered upon with serious attention recollection hitherto vague disjointed gradually assumed more intelligible aspect to mental contemplation memory exerted with energy to fill up blank bring vividly forward reminiscence until moment have be like dim misty vapour floating before mind eye fixed gaze intently on past until feeblest glimmering assumed bolder more comprehensible light by degree confusion of idea relative to early being yielded to something like order so that became enabled to fit incident into proper place even make accurate calculation with regard to date of particular occurrence illustration in word light have streamed in upon soul illuminating many of hitherto unexplored cell of memory giving significancy to recollection on have never before paused to ponder investing with importance various reminiscence have not until period engaged serious attention naturally of happy cheerful disposition intent on soaring aspiration relative to future rather than on speculation wandering connected with past have never until now be

that must no more help yielding to current of reflection than child must avoid being carried whirlingly along rapid of canadian stream have engulphed now let see into what connected form meditation recollection of charles hatfield have settled seating at table on leant elbow supporting head on hand in buried face pondered in ensuing manner earliest remembrance carry back to period when must have be about five year old then be accustomed to call good woman whose name be watt mother died forget precisely under what circumstance then when be nearly six be taken care of by gentleman named rainford yes have beautiful wife named tamar tamar be sister of countess of ellingham mr rainford tamar be very kind to remember well be not with long now there be so much confusion in thought so much bewilderment in reminiscence touching that particular period in life that scarcely know how to render idea continuously accurate fully recollect however that whom grew accustomed to call by endearing name of father although knew that be not father mean mr rainford recollect say that be absent for week pined after then tamar must reassure with promise of return remember that used to weep very much oh very much one day put on black clothes be going to dress in mourning also cried bitterly threw dark garment away next recollect being taken to house of mr de medina where saw esther for first time that esther who be now countess of ellingham happiness experienced that day dwells in mind for recollect a well a if be yesterday that tamars sorrow have suddenly disappeared that gave most earnest promise must soon see mr rainford again did behold again soon be at town in france whither be taken by mr de medina two daughter then travelled in post chaise four repaired to paris where remember that earl of ellingham jacob smith joined next went to havre de grace remember be that town because have seen since there mr de medina earl of ellingham left mr rainford tamar jacob smith going on board of ship be not very long at sea next incident remember be travelling alone with tamar to london where took up abode at country seat of mr de medina be at finchley never went out remember kept close to own room esther mr de medina frequently visiting how long lived in manner can not recollect now mind settle with horror on never to be forgotten lamentation child a be struck horror to soul a echoed through dwelling for mr de medina have suddenly learnt that tamar good kind tamar who have be absent considerable time day be foully brutally murdered oh how cried how bitterly wept if asked question must naturally suppose did be not answered be answered vaguely yes particular be carefully kept from be doubtless nothing more than mere matter of prudence for be child of between six seven mr rainford now came back to live at finchley how unhappy be remember well one evening very few day only after dreadful death of whom be wont to call mamma that mr rainford after long conversation in whisper with lord ellingham suddenly turned towards caught up in arm covered with kiss yes incident have ever remained indelibly impressed upon memory be followed very soon by tamars funeral almost immediately afterwards be sent to school at great distance for remember mr de medina esther took there that travelled day in post chaise ah now recollect too yes flash to mind that before left charged never to mention name of rainford at school for own name be at time charles watt for three year did remain there mr de medina esther frequently visiting even after have become countess of ellingham six month went home to finchley for holiday found mr rainford always staying at mr de medina house always ready to receive with kindness then mr de medina died went into mourning for returned to school for year when between ten eleven be suddenly sent for home be to manor house at finchley mr rainford have continued to occupy after mr de medina death instead of meeting mr rainford a have expected be taken into presence of gentleman lady neither of whom have ever beheld before be mr hatfield lady georgiana here young man paused in meditation a if to fix power of thought with a much intensity a possible upon era of life whence dated at be new existence idea came rushing in upon soul with such overwhelming force a literally to hurry along obedient to current of continuous self linking reflection thus proceeded in silent history be repeating to what be first impression on entering into presence of mr hatfield lady georgiana scarcely know now for remember that lady snatched to bosom folded in fond embrace covered with kiss even wept over be first time have ever seen to recollection mr hatfield then embraced in turn with a much fervour a if have be mr rainford whom have expected to meet to behold be then a just now reckoned between ten eleven when happened struck recollect well that there be considerable likeness between mr rainford mr hatfield then mr rainford have light hair mr hatfield black mr rainford have reddish whisker of mr hatfield be dark a jet yes be idea at time suppose that be offspring of delusion nevertheless when call to mind feature of mr rainford who be so good to in infancy even seems now that can recollect resemblance between countenance of own father such a now be still be most probably mere fancy wish to arrive at truth not indulge in idle speculation well then to go back to interview that first interview between who have since turned out to be parent can call to mind look bestowed upon word uttered told that be uncle aunt that be rich intended to have to live with altogether thenceforth be recognised a heir that mr rainford have gone upon long long voyage to settle in far off land whence perhaps must never return that must supply place of parent whom have lost in infancy of generous friend who have thus quitted native shore for ever there be so much in voice manner language of mr hatfield reminded of mr rainford that circumstance materially consoled for deprivation of long loved protector be moreover just at age when kindness handsome clothes indulgence change of scene immediately followed be fully calculated to attach to who gave so many enjoyment thus be afraid that be ungrateful to memory of mr rainford by loving mr hatfield too soon too well for must not then suspect that be father did ever until truth burst so suddenly on day ah be nature prompted that feeling remember well how joyous happy be when told on occasion of first interview that thenceforth must bear name of hatfield here paused again a if in doubt whether have omitted detail reminiscence incident must constitute link in narrative that be endeavouring in progressive thought to render a complete a possible solemnly profoundly interesting must have be for human observer unobserved to have contemplated that fine handsome young man thus devoting hour when others slept to task of tracing by memorial effort career from day of infancy to present moment eye beheld save of who beholdeth thing who sleepeth never scarcely have thus be taken into care of mr lady georgiana hatfield be thus proceeded in continuous meditation when repaired to continent having travelled through france crossed alp entered delicious land of italy sardinian state be traversed by in leisurely manner allowed to view thing worthy of inspection for week stayed at florence capital of beauteous grand duchy of tuscany thence journeyed to rome for several month did sojourn in eternal city health of young man who be with whose name be jacob smith required change of climate mr hatfield be deeply attached to youth who on side treated father with utmost deference devotedness roman physician recommended genial air of montoni accordingly removed to sovereign city of castelcicala jacob smith appeared to have secret sorrow preying upon pined away before very eye yes have secret source of grief for remember well now that one night uttered dreadful scream ejaculation in sleep awoke alarmed for slept in next room to recollect rushed in fearful lest chamber have caught on fire that before must arouse shrieked forth in thrilling tone old death benjamin bone father poor fellow died soon afterwards wept much for be always kind good to ejaculation of old death benjamin bone even then seemed to touch chord within soul a if awaking long dormant vague reminiscence now again that name of benjamin bone frightful appellation of old death oh seem so unfamiliar to a if have never heard mentioned once by lip of jacob smith be not name in fact in way associated with recollection of much earlier date did never hear name pronounced in earliest boyhood appears to that did yet vainly oh how vainly endeavour to plunge eager glance through mist dense dark mist envelope that idea reducing thought to suspicion so dim vague dare not adopt a link in history of mine yet why doe name of old death produce kind of shuddering within a if influence of very early recollection still partially remained wherefore doe appellation of benjamin bone seem more familiar to than can possibly conceive reason for there be moment when appear to obtain least glimmering least scintillation of light at remote profundity of mystery light for instant seems to promise elucidation of wish to know in respect then becomes suddenly extinguished leaving in deeper darker uncertainty than before charles hatfield pressed hand violently to forehead a if to awaken recollection slumbered too soundly to be otherwise aroused must not conjure up evoke single idea be calculated to throw light on obscurity enveloped thing in mind respecting two name utterance whereof thrilled to very soul what mean that horrible phrase old death asked hundred time be in way connected with name of benjamin bone be phrase name likewise if so be old death benjamin bone one same person why must name produce upon disagreeable effect a if suddenly came in contact with loathsome snake know not yet be so more ponder upon night when poor jacob smith shrieked out in sleep more vivid do recollection become concerning horror convulsed piercing tense anguish marked tone oh then there must have be something dreadful appalling terrible in association name of old death benjamin bone conjured up in young man mind at time benjamin bone must have be bad very bad person wherefore do say must have be may not be alive now in word what do know of nothing nothing yet yet something seems to tell that did know more of once than do now perhaps when be child heard evil thing said of thing have long since fled from mind leaving only general very faint impression behind impression unfavourable to object of let not then dwell longer on point of narrative that narrative seek to compile from myriad of idea until night have be scattered in brain never concentrated reduced to order until now yes from chaos of memory have succeeded in rescuing reminiscence thought sufficient to form somewhat continuous connected history heaven must guide if will so be sooner later to clear up be still obscure gratify craving ardent curiosity unto fullest extent wherefore be devoured with burning desire to know that there may be to know relative to myself ala ti in nature incident of day just past have suddenly aroused that curiosity within for feel have

again paused now arose from seat paced room for several minute agitated by fear that be militating against wish perhaps even interest of kind parent by venturing to give full rein to impetuous curiosity have seized upon yet a ere now observed must not restrain ardour of sentiment more powerful than engulphed in onward eddying influence resuming seat resuming likewise meditative attitude with countenance again buried in hand young man took up chain of thought from point where have suddenly broken off to reflect on secret mysterious influence word old death benjamin bone produced upon reached in mental narrative that epoch when poor jacob smith died be then about thirteen little more than thirteen mourned sincerely for frequently did visit grave in beautiful cemetery where be buried often often a wandered on bank of clear broad ferretti down to whose chrystal margin cemetery stretched often did marvel who that departed youth be what secret tie might have linked to mr hatfield year passed rapidly away year unmarked by incident on mind need pause to ponder grew up happy gay seldom thinking of past bright shining future decked with glorious golden hue sanguine imagination must devise be ever topic of thought oh well do recollect that when between eighteen nineteen year of age began to comprehend affair of great world to study well political condition of nation to observe that state of castelcicala languished under tyranny of grand duke angelo then longed to become hero to have army at command to achieve independence not only of castelcicala of italy

angelo called mighty austrian army into state to besiege overawe capital providence suddenly sent champion to rescue fine country noble people from power of invader castelcicalan native italian patriot watched career of richard markham with so much anxiety such burning hope such deep suspense a when heard person who be best wishers in heart shake head declare that constitutional cause must

in omnibus a far a cambridge heath gate in suburban quarter great man resided in six roomed house including kitchen chapter cxxvi elucidation at conclusion of hundred twenty fourth chapter asked whether charles hatfield must succeed in crushing sentiment of curiosity have be awakened within ala be impossible better feeling aroused by startling remembrance of assurance have respectively given father mother have for few hour triumphed over insatiable longing to penetrate into mystery of past when again found alone in chamber in silence of night must not subdue thought forced upon be connected with mystery thus be that again find pacing chamber while others slept pacing up down in agitated excited manner maintaining desperate struggle within own soul for irresistible temptation beset be to ponder once more deeply on incident of early day to endeavour to retrieve from abyss of memory other recollection might be slumbering there for sake of pledge given to mother for sake of assurance made to father strove yes sincerely ardently strove to vanquish temptation yet must not human nature possessed not so grand power might have ruled action by will thought defied controul yielding therefore at length to current be whirled along by same eddying tide of reflection have swept through so considerable portion of preceding night now effort of memory by one of superhuman straining while seem a if must break very fibre of brain also appear to evoke sudden flash from depth of profound cerebral cell powerful painful effort in moment a be established connexion between name of benjamin bone murder of tamar yes charles hatfield suddenly became aware that name incident be in way associated necessarily supposed that in childhood have heard fact mentioned have created that impression at time nature of must not now for life of recall to memory impression be probably vague even at period when be engendered because charles recollected full well that utmost caution be adopted by around not to discourse upon particular of foul murder in presence even to respond otherwise than evasively to question put being mere child at time a young gentleman paced up down mind labouring with new reminiscence have arisen within suddenly struck that there be mean of informing of detail of murder whereof at present entertained only vague general impression of atrocity long absence on continent have prevented from ever even accidentally falling in with english book of criminal annals file of english newspaper to might have referred have thought struck so to do now what be to restrain from making search must throw light on occurrence of such fearful interest scarcely be idea conceived when mean of instantaneously carrying into execution suggested for charles hatfield remembered that in well stored library of mansion have observed complete set of annual register from very origin of useful work until most recent date of publication now trembled from head to foot literally gasped for breath at thought of being enabled to tear away veil of mystery from at least one incident be so materially connected with childhood for tamar have be a mother to during few month that be in care there be in soul deep yet undefined presentiment that stood on threshold of strange discovery important revelation be about to be made to without being superstitious bent to influence of solemn dim forecasting awe inspiring vague prescience taking lamp in hand stole gently from chamber descended wide handsome staircase traversed long corridor in niche of stood beautiful specimen of sculpture entered spacious library on side of door be marble statue a large a life young man started only for moment a white motionless effigy stood out suddenly a if be from deep darkness lamp illumined be not that have forgotten such statue be there that be positively frightened at appearance soul be influenced by one of presentiment be of superstition in character moreover be on point of seeking information relative to detail of foul horrible murder instantly recovering blushing at fear advanced into library closing door carefully behind then approaching particular range of shelf reached down annual register for year in le than minute be seated at table with book opened at proper place before greedily oh how greedily plunged a be into content great heaven why start thus what discovery have made what revelation have be afforded learns with frightful sinking of heart that rainford be highwayman that have be executed at horsemonger lane gaol that have be resuscitated by mean with writer be unacquainted that have reappeared in london in disguise of blackamoor that have received royal pardon for crime detail be incidentally given in course of narrative of foul murder of tamar who be represented to have be rainfords wife now also charles hatfield discovered how terrific be connexion between name of benjamin bone assassination of ill fated daughter of israel yes perceived too that benjamin bone old death be one same individual shuddered from head to foot a perused nay almost rushed through detail of crime have be committed nineteen year previously in subterranean cell belonging to house in red lion street clerkenwell charles hatfield be not satisfied with what have already devoured for can scarcely use word read curiosity to know more have become insatiable guided by hint observation occurring in narrative of murder refers to earlier page in volume in order to obtain full complete insight into trial condemnation of rainford that rainford whom have loved so well whole particular be given in detail with accuracy robbery of sir christopher blunt capture of rainford by dyke myrmidon in lock field trial condemnation execution charles read read on with horrified feeling often threatened to get better of there be one point in evidence rivetted attention dyke officer in explaining mode in highwayman have be taken into custody used word when people gained admittance into house in brandon street prisoner be in bed with mistress jewess then thought charles hatfield immediately tamar be not wife ah be clear enough although narrative of murder must imply otherwise only inference can be drawn from discrepancy be that reporter of assassination be delicately judiciously sparing of feeling of medina family whereas in former case be absolutely necessary to record evidence just a be given poor tamar wonder that thy name be never mentioned now by who once knew thee wonder that even thy very sister countess of ellingham seems to have forgotten thee thus charles hatfield suddenly adopted belief that tamar be not rainfords wife indeed be at time when rainford be arrested by mr dyke never struck young man that matrimonial ceremony might have be performed between period of rainfords resuscitation murder of jewish lady for when nuptial blessing be performed in paris charles being then mere boy be not present at proceeding took place a privately a possible in british ambassador chapel a for suspicion that countess of ellingham be ashamed to breathe name of tamar oh reader may judge how erroneous be belief in heart of heart did generous esther treasure image of dearly beloved sister if noble husband ever breathed name be through kind feeling towards mr hatfield motif of delicacy in respect to georgiana charles being a yet ignorant that father rainford be one same person must not possibly suspect necessity for exercise of such kind feeling on one hand such delicacy on other thus murmured charles to a closed book have made such marvellous horrifying revelation thus thomas rainford be highwayman good kind hearted generous man who loved be felon criminal passed through hand of public executioner oh god what dreadful thing have night learnt exclaimed aloud pressing hand to forehead how came thomas rainford to have care of how be that parent must have left so long in hand at disposal oh wonder wonder that mr de medina esther must have charged when first left at school never to mention name of rainford now how many gap in earliest portion of reminiscence be filled up absence of mr rainford for several week during period pined after constant weeping of tamar then removal to mr de medina house sudden revival of joy tamar experienced there highwayman felon criminal oh what awful mystery envelop matter still for earl of ellingham be intimate with rainford be said remember at mr de medina death left to same rainford large fortune fortune to whom to seducer of daughter to one who have passed through hand of public executioner lord ellingham be intimate with man who seduced sister of intended wife esther be friendly likewise with who ruined that sister gracious god be most unaccountable so unaccountable that be lost bewildered most mysterious ten thousand time most mysterious of incident be that one grand fact to can not recur how must parent have left in care of highwayman ti true that received royal pardon that pardon ah register say that be procured through interest of lady hatfield dyke officer of justice be present at time when lady announced just heaven light break in upon soul oh yet resemblance may god have mercy upon young man groaning bitterly bitterly in anguish of spirit fell back in chair covering face with hand yes light have indeed broken in upon elucidating terrible mystery in terrible manner lady georgiana hatfield have procured royal pardon lady georgiana hatfield must therefore have have strong reason thus to exert in behalf of convicted felon who have passed through hand of hangman have be recalled to life restored to world in wondrous manner of what nature be potent reason naturally did strike charles hatfield that love must have be cause when recollected resemblance existed between own father that thomas rainford who have once be friend protector flashed to mind that in whom lady hatfield have shown such tender interest even to compromising of fair fame in eye of world for whom have so far stepped aside from precise course of female delicacy a to implore royal pardon must be who be husband yes yes be now a clear a sun at noon day mr hatfield thomas rainford be one same individual charles hatfield be son of highwayman who have be tried convicted ushered through ignominious ordeal of scaffold for several minute young man sat motionless crushed stupefied astounded by appalling truth have elicited from fatal investigation into past for several minute must have be mere balancing of chance whether must awake from dreadful reverie to light of reason once more suddenly start up howling hopeless maniac latter condition be not to be frightful doom by degree by very slow degree recovered so much of self possession composure a to be enabled to look misfortune in face even fall into additional reflection on subject yes thomas rainford mr hatfield be same individual be father be little more than nineteen year ago when trial ordeal of gallows took place be twenty five be mother be lady hatfield father wife at time in other word be legitimate a god be judge said father yesterday have never be guilty of weakness frailty then what be to believe that father mother be married privately in honourable manner be offspring of lawful union then that father deserted mother became enamoured of tamar whom took a mistress lastly that after tamars death parent be reunited must be truth therefore father deceived not when so emphatically proclaimed mother virtue legitimacy oh god well might have said that weightiest reason have alone induced mother to practise deception towards world in respect to degree of relationship in really stood with regard to yes for world perhaps date marriage of parent only from time when be reunited few year after tamars death hence necessity of calling nephew understand now oh yes understand too well be legitimate be son of highwayman god how bitterly bitterly be curiosity punished night now young man sobbed a if heart must break whither have flown dream of ambition where now be hope of emulating career of royal highness prince of montoni son of highwayman be word fell ten time in minute from tongue be idea now sate dominant absorbing like leaden weight upon soul did loathe father did curse author of being thousand time deep profound immeasurable be pity entertained for sire if loathed thing be own existence if cursed aught be own being for oh terrible indeed be for fine young man of lofty principle generous nature soaring aspiration terrible be for to receive blow so sudden shock so rude rebuff so awful better better far have be for to remain in ignorance of parentage still to have looked on mr hatfield a uncle on lady georgiana a aunt rather than have learnt secret only prompted to fathom collateral mystery clear up associated doubt for result of research be elucidation have flashed on with almost lightning effect blasting searing scorching accursed book suddenly exclaimed hurling annual register across apartment a if volume be living thing endowed with human feeling so a to be susceptible of venting influence of rage in next moment reflected that trace of untimely mysterious visit to library must remain that none must suspect prying research for not for world not for world must have father mother know that have made discovery characterised memorable night accordingly rose from seat raised volume from floor turned to book case to replace act so simple in be destined to lead to circumstance thenceforth influencing entire destiny of charles hatfield for a thrust volume back into place on shelf whence have taken heard sharp abrupt sound like click of lock be in humour when incident however trivial be calculated to assume importance in imagination standing on chair proceeded to examine wainscotting at back of shelf for purpose removed several of book to surprise observed small aperture formed by opening of sliding panel revealed recess in wall of about foot square violence with in excitement have book on shelf having acted on secret spring whereby panel be fastened under ordinary circumstance charles hatfield must have immediately closed recess in beheld small leathern case packet of letter in same way a must have abstained from reading manuscript lying on desk evidently left about through inadvertence on present occasion be not own master honourable feeling be triumphed over by emotion of most painful nature be impossible in state of mind that must avoid catching at circumstance savouring of mystery such circumstance apparently linking with own concern thus obedient to impulse must not controul seized leathern case document a if be glorious prize returning to seat proceeded to examine leathern case contained roll of letter other document tied round with piece of riband so faded that be impossible to determine what colour might have originally be writing in paper be however still completely legible leathern case total absence of damp in little recess having preserved for period of century wrapped round roll of paper in case be letter addressed to earl of ellingham instantaneously struck charles that be in handwriting of father mr hatfield by comparative darkness of ink be of far more recent period than document accompanied precise time when be written did not immediately appear date being attached to without pausing to reflect upon impropriety of violating sanctity of correspondence concealed with so much precaution in secret recess carried away by influence of feeling have above attempted to describe charles hatfield devoured content of letter though be already familiar to reader yet for purpose of narrative quote again have sent paper dear brother for so will make bold to call still to convince did not forge idle tale when met last whatever motive for abandoning in last hour may be entertain ill feeling towards on contrary hope that god may prosper give long life to enjoy title fortune in so short time will be beyond possibility of dispute have promised to leave behind written narrative of chequered eventful history for perusal need explain wherefore have not fulfilled promise t r brother dear brother gasped charles hatfield a letter dropped from hand eye remained intently fixed upon brother repeated god then be nephew of earl of ellingham be cousin of lady france whom already love so well gracious heaven ejaculated a still more thrilling idea flashed to mind if mr hatfield be indeed brother of earl of ellingham a assuredly be then be elder brother if elder brother must be bearer of title must be viscount ah perhaps father be illegitimate offspring of late earl that be reason wherefore family honour estate have devolved upon younger brother yet what mean word give long life to enjoy title fortune in so short time will be beyond possibility of dispute oh here again be dreadful mystery just heaven what fated doomed family be ours doubt uncertainty secrecy characterise history at least experience of last two day must lead so to believe at moment young man eye fell upon roll of paper have taken from leathern case with feverish impatience yet still with care inasmuch a document be a fragile with old age a tinder proceeded to examine oh how deep how intense suddenly became interest with now perused diary letter of unfortunate octavia manner excitement be stilled impatience be subdued deadly pallor succeeded hectic flush upon cheek still motionless sate eye devouring content of important paper frightful treachery of old death towards half sister beautiful ill fated octavia be revealed step by step there be likewise elucidation touched chord thrilled to inmost recess of young hatfields heart be fact that octavia be wedded by late earl of ellingham previous to birth of child yes there be marriage certificate there too be certificate of child baptism that child be therefore at very birth heir to proud title entailed estate of mighty earldom here let pause for few moment to afford explanation now becomes necessary if reader will refer to forty seventh chapter of narrative will find recorded so much of history of poor octavia manner a arthur be acquainted with in relating history to lady georgiana hatfield arthur have stated that octavia fled away from vile half brother house very day after disgrace be consummated for several month trace be discovered of be feared have committed suicide during interval first countess of ellingham died at length earl arthur father accidentally discovered that octavia be living that be in way to become mother hastened to miserable garret occupied found in most abject state of poverty endeavouring to earn subsistence with needle affection for revived

gleam of hope however faint to goal will make wife be not for demand boon at hand for boon becomes when violater espouses violated boon in estimation of world though only act of justice in eye of god be not for ti for child think not that sister of marine store dealer will ever assume name adopt rank of countess of ellingham let union be secret only let take place at once so that child may be legitimate thus spoke octavia manner on occasion earl of ellingham violater consented to that asked be married with so much privacy that even miranda faithful gipsy girl who have formed so strong attachment to octavia remained ignorant of important occurrence very next day octavia fled affection have for noble who have ruined who have be cause of severance from object of first only love have only asked to marry for sake of honour of child parentage ceremony being performed withdrew into strictest solitude obscurity to brood over woe suffering in secret such be substance of portion of octavias own diary revealed to charles hatfield fact that injured girl be indeed countess of ellingham when child be born that child career must be traced yes satisfactorily traced step by step by mean of paper young man have taken from leathern case packet of letter that have likewise found in recess be evident beyond least possibility of doubt that individual whom world have known a thomas rainford whom now knew a mr hatfield be clear even beyond remotest ground of suspicion to contrary that individual be rightful earl of ellingham recollect too reader that charles hatfield have become firmly impressed with belief that be legitimate offspring of parent now therefore conceive wild enthusiasm of delight when came to conclusion that be in reality viscount by present rank have earldom in perspective forgotten be fact have ere now stunned stupefied fact that father be notorious highwayman thomas rainford thought of that more in delirium of rapture at idea of having noble title within reach have not on previous day assured lady france ellingham that envied only greatness have made not that be obtained by accident of birth yes at time conscientiously believed that spoke own thought correctly now however that temptation appeared to be within reach possessed charm attraction of irresistible power recalling to mind sounding title of object of admiration heroic worship began to fancy that right honourable earl of ellingham be not comparatively so very insignificant even when uttered after swelling appellation of royal highness field marshal prince of montoni captain general of castelcicalan army apparent to grand ducal throne suddenly a be behold young man whose sentiment be so noble generous while deemed to be mere civilian having exertion to make in order to rise to eminence suddenly behold seized with insatiable ambition now that coronet appeared to be actually within reach did contemplate immediate adoption of measure to force father to wrest title estate of earldom from arthur know not passed through mind of charles hatfield on fatal night can however aver that having fully perused valuable document have made to such important revelation did not restore to secret recess where have found secured about own person previously to quitting library closed sliding panel replaced annual register in such manner that shelf did not appear to have be

bethought of promise to send amount of saving to beauteous perdita hastening home sought chamber reached unperceived by one save domestic who gave admission that be thus unobserved be source of satisfaction inasmuch a felt that cheek be flushed feared lest appearance might seem singular opening desk took from secret drawer bank note constituted saving enveloping in sheet of paper issued forth again to leave parcel at house in suffolk street being done charles returned to park where roamed about until hour arrived when be necessary for to return home in order to dress for dinner reader must not forget that splendid banquet be to take place that evening at mansion of earl of ellingham banquet given in honour of prince of montoni at royal highness be to be present a hour approached charles hatfield felt heart beat admiration of illustrious hero revived so that mind be labouring under inconsiderable degree of excitement a thought of perdita on one hand prince on other also of lady france ellingham chapter cxxxiii throne surrounded by republican institution entertainment be of most splendid description worthy of hospitality taste of noble host hostess prince of montoni be dressed in plain clothes on breast gleamed star denoting rank on left leg wore english garter royal highness having be admitted on previous day member of illustrious order be seated on right of countess of ellingham lady france being next to charles hatfield occupying place immediately following in addition to personage earl of ellingham mr hatfield lady georgiana there be sir john lascelles clarence villiers adelais select few who have be invited to banquet on occasion prince be naturally of modest unassuming disposition though endowed with ample dignity to maintain lofty rank honourably fill high position yet bearing so condescendingly affably that one felt completely at ease in presence even sir john lascelles who have grown somewhat morose difficult to please in old age be quite delighted with youthful hero whose conversation be characterised by so much sound sense total absence of obtrusiveness charles hatfield be delighted at thought of being once more in company with object of worship seemed to hang upon word fell from lip of prince of montoni a if be listening to demigod illustration when lady have retired conversation turned upon political matter earl of ellingham questioned prince relative to condition of castelcicalans whom report newspaper book represented to be in highest possible state of civilisation prosperity happiness sovereign highness revered father in law said prince have exerted in possible way to render people contented flourishing task may seem to be difficult for monarch to undertake really be not so honourable upright liberal minded minister be to be found in country if sovereign have discrimination to select indeed chamber of deputy rightly constituted will be sure to indicate most efficient trust worthy men to whom responsibility of government may be safely confided man in castelcicala having habitation in may be said to be settled matter whether be house of own mere lodging have right of suffrage election take place by ballot thus considering that save absolute mendicant have power of voting seeing likewise immense number of voter that there be bribery be almost impossible to ensure a much a mortal mean can purity of election attempt at bribery intimidation be counted misdemeanor be punished by fine imprisonment loss of civil right for period of seven year under circumstance election take place in orderly quiet honest manner people conduct with propriety because recognise generous confidence reposed in by sovereign endeavour to render worthy of when royal highness liberated castelcicala opened way for grand duke alberto to throne said sir john lascelles who have listened attentively to prince observation castelcicalans be in state of abject slavery be boon of consummate freedom conferred upon in moment if so be people prepared in way to receive nation in slavery sir john answered prince be like body in condition of deep disease now must restore that body to perfect health in moment if have power must only effect restoration by slow almost imperceptible degree a conscientious honest man must of course adopt mode of instantaneous cure replied physician then sir john question whether castelcicalans be prepared to receive consummation of freedom in moment be answered said prince smiling believe statesman who talk of necessity of gradual reform be weak timid else in heart opposed to interest of people freedom be nation right right can not be recognised too suddenly too frankly be fortune in grasp of rapacious monarch must be contented by receiving in small instalment according to caprice good pleasure certainly not must demand expect to receive whole at once must consider victim of monstrous tyranny be claim refused ridiculed set at naught yes sir john castelcicalans obtained in moment a be emancipation from tyranny oppression immediately after sovereign highness ascended throne of powerful state promulgated decree not merely conceding universal suffrage a boon at once proclaiming a recognised right of people did not say give to said for instant attempt to withhold people saw that be not treated a child a free enlightened nation generously proffered gratitude testified admiration respect for monarch chamber assembled in due time senator deputy being elected principle of hereditary peerage being totally eschewed not even be president of senate appointed by grand duke be chosen by compeer a be president of chamber of deputy grand duke pledged to retain in power to nominate only minister whom parliamentary majority pointed out accordingly cabinet have honour to appoint during period when exercised function of regent immediately after battle of montoni have remained in office ever since time because be supported by majority there be opposition in chamber opposition consisting of aristocracy of old school high churchman few very wealthy landowner indeed opposition be necessary to good government because be measure passed by universal acclamation there must be sifting of detail to very bottom progressist ministry in castelcicala be therefore rather thankful to opposition than otherwise popular voice be entirely in favour of ministerial party grand duke be therefore almost cypher in castelcicala observed sir john lascelles not so returned prince mildly firmly there must be chief magistrate executive in state be that chief magistrate do suppose that task of discriminating rewarding merit in patronising art science in raising humble deserving individual in performing various service to country supreme ruler must ever have opportunity of doing do not suppose sir john lascelles that be duty render good prince thing cypher be true that castelcicala have throne be surrounded by republican institution matter very little whether alberto be called president grand duke emperor king there be nothing in name of office that merit attention be extent of privilege of office sovereignty of castelcicala be hereditary said sir john lascelles yet royal highness be opponent to hereditary peerage if principle be objectionable in one case pardon for interrupting sir exclaimed prince be arguing on false premise hereditary principle be abolished even in respect to sovereignty alberto voluntarily abdicated dynastic privilege one of first act be to place diadem at disposal of chamber told that be willing to obey sovereign will of people chamber confirmed in high office of own accord honoured by naming heir apparent to throne hereditary principle be virtually annihilated because one generation can not bind successor law thus appointed a heir apparent may be repealed by new chamber be monstrous to suppose that hereditary principle can be tolerated by nation knowing own power appreciating own interest for principle may give good sovereign to day tyrant idiot degraded sensualist to morrow admit force of royal highness argument said lascelles if object be rather to seek information on subject than to question excellence of system of government introduced into castelcicala must now deferentially seek to learn how far system have benefitted people of highness adopted country in first place sir john returned prince people have election entirely in own hand return to parliament representative who buy seat who be chosen on account of merit at least observation applies to great majority of senator deputy election take place two year so that ample opportunity be allowed constituent of getting rid of person who may chance to deceive prove incapable while sufficient space of time be afforded for giving representative fair trial result of arrangement be that majority of representative legislate for interest of mass not of few good measure be consequence happiness of people be promoted while civilisation progress rapidly prosperity of country increase daily lord continued prince turning towards earl of ellingham history have recorded memorable speech lordship delivered nineteen year ago in house of lord speech that first introduced lordship to world a generous defender vindicator champion of people rejoices unfeignedly to be enabled to inform noble friend for so will permit to call that speech allude to subsequent oration on same subject have be studied weighed debated upon in council of sovereign of castelcicala earl acknowledged compliment in befitting term prince of montoni continued in following manner to prove to lordship that be idle flattery of indeed be incapable that be now addressing to will at once inform that suggestion lordship first grandest oration contained have be carried out with complete success in castelcicala anticipating pleasure of being enabled evening to give lordship account of condition of castelcicalans have furnished with copy of memorable speech to have already several time alluded will now explain in detail result of lordship view a exemplified in application to grand duchy prince produced manuscript spreading before royal highness continued in ensuing term addressing to most attentive delighted audience lordship stated that be too frequently alleged that industrious class be thoughtless improvident ungrateful intellectually dull assertion emphatically denied proceeded to reason thus despair produced by unhappy condition naturally led to dissipation in many instance be working man placed in position so that livelihood must be rendered le precarious than now be be labour adequately remunerated be more fairly paid by representative of property be scale of wage established having fixed minimum fixed maximum increased comfort thus ensured to must naturally remove from mind care drove to public house well lord gentleman continued prince suggestion have be adopted in castelcicala fixed minimum for wage have be established lowest amount of payment ensuring sum sufficient to enable working man to maintain family in respectability result may almost be said to have be instantaneous crime diminished rapidly statistical return soon proved that intemperance experienced remarkable decrease such be falling off in consumption of spirituous liquor beer tobacco that government found necessary to grant compensation to licensed victualler publican tobacconist who suffered by change in habit of people even employer speedily began to recognise advantage of new state of thing in improved condition of employed increase excellence of labour obtained superiority of agriculture manufacture maximum of wage have be fixed in castelcicala when left country month ago wage be higher than ever be known to be before demand for labour have greatly increased though territory be densely populated employment may be found for if man be now pauper mendicant in castelcicala must be through physical infirmity through unwillingness to work of latter however have comparatively few example emulation patriotism acting powerfully in country where so much happiness such prosperity prevail now with slight alteration in lordship speech one of most remarkable passage in speech read thus when applied to castelcicala there be fixed maximum of wage because wage be always to be increased in proportion to value of productive labour to employer there be minimum established to obviate cruel disastrous effect of period when labour exceeds demand in market be not considered unfair towards employer because when market be brisk trade be flourishing employer reap greatest benefit from activity enrich in very short time therefore when market be dull trade be stagnant be still compelled to pay such wage a enable employed to live comfortably profit gained during prosperous season not only enable employer to enjoy handsome income also to accumulate considerable saving a best wage scarcely enable employed to make thing like adequate provision for period of distress be not deemed fair that representative of property must use labour of working class just when suit discard only use on miserable recompense when doe not so well suit for labour of employed not only make annual income for employer also permanent fortune value of labour be not calculated a lasting only just a long a be available for purpose of producing large profit labour be recognised in castelcicala positively stated to be working man capital bear constant interest a well a money placed in fund that interest of course increasing in proportion to briskness of market never depreciating below standard value much le being discarded a valueless altogether in time of depression thousand pound always obtains three per cent interest under circumstance at particular period be worth six seven per cent labour be considered by castelcicalans in same light stagnant market diminish profit of employer ruin if obtain profit enough to live upon have accumulation of good season to fall back upon how different used to be case with employed to stagnation of business be ruin starvation death breaking up of little home sudden check of childrens education cause of demoralisation degradation necessity of applying to parish terrible evil have be completely annihilated by system introduced into castelcicala supply demand of labour be necessarily unequal at many time in many district government have therefore adopted measure to prevent frightful fluctuation in wage carry desolation into home of thousand of hard working industrious deserving family in fact law have be passed to ensure working man against casualty of being employed at price below remuneration thus lord perceive so far view have be most successfully carried out be no longer theory have seen reduced to positive practice pledge most solemnly sacredly to admirable working of enlightened reformatory system must must see own fellow countryman rendered thus happy raised thus high in social sphere thus tenderly cared for by ruler exclaimed lord ellingham in impassioned tone of most earnest heart felt sincerity day must come observed prince of montoni when english people will recognise grand truth enunciated nineteen year ago from place in house of lord if in england have failed to convince aristocracy landowner of wickedness of course be pursuing be not labour in degree rewarded by knowledge that lordship plan have be carried out to very letter in grand duchy of castelcicala yes carried out too with such unequivocal success information royal highness now imparts give most unfeigned pleasure said earl have indeed read heard of recent grand improvement have taken place in italian state where there be throne surrounded by republican institution be not aware indeed loftiest flight of vanity never must have suggested to that view theory have in way contributed to prosperity of model state a liberal in england now denominate castelcicala to convince lord how far idea have be applied to elevation of castelcicala to present proud eminence said prince will again refer to passage in lordship ever memorable speech point few contrast in england poor be not allowed to have stake in country have shown that very reverse be case in grand duchy in england there be small property land be in possession of few individual comparatively thus landed interest constitutes tremendous monopoly most unjust oppressive to industrious class in castelcicala law of primogeniture be annihilated there man can leave estate solely to eldest son must be divided amongst male child equally charge being fixed upon for support of daughter thus territory be rapidly undergoing process of sub division admits thousand to enjoyment of real stake in country break down tremendous monopoly of landed interest in castelcicala moreover property be compelled to maintain labour a long a labour seek for employment occupation what now then be condition of castelcicalan people being well treated rendered free having possible avenue opened to for attainment of real property working class be not driven by care trouble to excessive use of alcoholic liquor become demoralized by being compelled to migrate from place to place in search of employment be not forced to go upon tramp sleeping in hideous den of vice where number be forced to herd together without reference to age sex be not unsettled in little arrangement to bring up child creditably with due reference to instruction be not made discontented anxious for change matter what vindictive towards society render outcast sullen reckless in general conduct on contrary feel settled in condition know that cottage constitutes home be not held upon precarious tenure never feel sickening conviction that if have bread meat to day may have only bread to morrow food at day after industrious class in castelcicala be no longer mere slave tool of wealthy class be no longer retained in bondage no longer kept in absolute serfdom by oligarchy now pas to subject said prince here again refer to speech of earl of ellingham applying to castelcicala observation used in reference to england castelcicalan industrious class then be ground down by indirect tax in shape actually contributed more to revenue in proportion to mean than rich only luxury poor enjoyed have become a be necessary namely tea sugar tobacco beer spirit be most productive source of revenue if aristocrat reproached poor for dirty habit a well knew that be custom to do must ask why soap be made article subject to so heavy tax be contemptible fallacy to suppose that because poor contributed little nothing in shape of direct taxation to revenue be positively untaxed real fact be that poor paid more in direct tax than rich did in direct in indirect way when relative mean of two party be taken into consideration such be state of industrious class of castelcicala until voice be heard in legislative assembly tax upon necessary of life be speedily removed luxury alone be left to bear weight of taxation duty upon carriage livery servant armorial bearing hunter racer hound foreign wine being doubled prince of montoni paused earl of ellingham exchanged rapid significant glance with mr hatfield for remembered time when nineteen year previously when latter lay on bed in old death house have conversed upon best mean of ameliorating condition of suffering million royal highness finding that auditor be most anxious that must continue explanation perceiving that sir john lascelles have become especially interested therein resumed subject in following manner inequality of law incongruity severity injustice towards poor long constituted cry evil in castelcicala advantage be given to rich in way of procuring bail in case where security for personal appearance be required poor man must possibly give such security must go to prison there herd with felon of blackest dye perhaps on trial innocence must transpire then what recompense have for long incarceration home broken up during absence ruined family be possible nay often happened that man must lie thus in prison for four five month previously to trial during period must be strange indeed if escaped gaol contamination in order to remedy evil vast facility be afforded in respect to bail respectability not monied qualification of surety being considered thus working man may be bailed by two of associate who can obtain good character from employer of course applies to charge of lighter kind heavier

having visited chamber hurried away again be afraid to encounter parent remember charles if felt that conduct of morning have be undutiful improper nay will even say cruel towards yet single word expressive of contrition must have made open arm to receive denounce behaviour a cruel towards exclaimed charles did not first provoke father did not call harsh name if in return complained of what considered to be unnatural conduct of parent toward wherefore thus pertinaciously endeavour to penetrate into secret for good salutary reason parent keep concealed from demanded mr hatfield for presume that allude to fact of still desiring that must pas a nephew have assured that be legitimate that there be stigma upon birth cried charles then wherefore not acknowledge a son claim from duty of son yet deny title again must remind father that to accident alone be indebted for knowledge of birth must ask charles said mr hatfield in serious impressive tone what have to do with proposal of marriage that made to lady france ellingham for be on point that dispute commenced yesterday morning be to suppose that son being unwilling to contract alliance so honourable to seek other ground whereon to base design of flying in face of parent be to conclude that being resolved to thwart in dearest hope seize upon ignoble pretext to justify rebellion against ten thousand time exclaimed

connexion of be ashamed ah cried charles starting violently have father acted spy upon listen said mr hatfield to whose countenance indignant blood rushed a son thus insolently addressed chose to controul feeling succeeded listen charles then decide whether ought to judge so harshly conduct of yesterday morning towards mother be of such extraordinary unaccountable distressing nature that can not blame if resolved to discover motif have actuated in determination be fixed by protracted absence throughout day stealthy return in evening short visit to own chamber avoidance of inmate of house

disinheritance then in evening enacted spy upon action watched followed be duty most painful one can assure interrupted mr hatfield alarmed by strange ominous coldness characterised son tone manner duty ejaculated charles now speaking with indignation that burst forth in frightful contrast with unnatural tranquillity on so abruptly broke wherefore have not performed duty in thing duty indeed know father that there be other duty to fulfil than merely playing part of spy on son action there be such duty a giving proper name allowing to assume just right placing in social position ought to

sentimentalist who through maudlin mawkish feeling of false delicacy will consent to have nearest dearest interest trampled upon privilege altogether withheld right cruelly denied have played mysterious too long have enacted cruel unnatural until endurance have become impossible now must assume part of absolute dictator expecting to find still pliant docile grovelling slave without spirit without courage without even common feeling of man be mistaken father if have thus be driven to tell mind have only to reproach for so distressing so painful scene thus speaking before father have so

not a in fact must not for single moment enter mr hatfields head that charles have discovered occurrence of former year that have thence drawn false fatal inference that same infatuated young man be heir to proud title vast estate of earldom of ellingham therefore saw in son conduct only rebellious spirit of individual who having formed connexion of be most likely ashamed knew to be improper endeavoured to meet parent reproach with recrimination seize upon least shadow of excuse pretext for resisting paternal authority when reflection thus diminished wonderment mr hatfield experienced at behaviour of young man pain sorrow succeeded that first feeling indeed unhappy father be cruelly embarrassed knew not how to act charles be of age when even did circumstance permit mr hatfield to acknowledge that really be son legal authority must be exercised constraint practised felt assured that farther attempt to interfere with in connexion have formed must only aggravate irritability of

appeared to have plenty of money from very day entered dwelling learned counsel then proceeded to address magistrate on behalf of mr fitzhardinge began by remarking on meagre nature of evidence against mere fact that young lady who be with who be daughter be last person seen in company of murdered man complained bitterly that client must have be arrested ignominiously brought back to london forced through ordeal of public examination on willow pretence circumstance adduced that morning feature of evidence tended only to exculpate prisoner at bar in first place be clear from testimony

found in presence of daughter suspicion curiosity be excited by two three mysterious though trivial incident occurred have not be many minute in lauras company before acquired certainty that young woman intended to conceal fact of marriage with charles hatfield mr mortimer at first fancied that desire arose from shame on part of laura whose pride might naturally revolt from idea of avowing that

positive minute mr mortimer perceived that laura be not influenced by wounded pride shame only in concealing fact of marriage that a contemplated matrimonial alliance a soon a opportunity for eligible match must present be unwilling to allow mother to attain knowledge of secret must place so completely in mother power mr mortimer have accurately read thought motif be uppermost in lauras mind for

language a be must not hope to succeed by alone in intrigue required so much delicacy of management must not rely solely on lady maid assistance of mother be therefore necessary for reflected that

seclusion that agnes be indeed pure innocent artless creature appeared to be old crone be sure too well acquainted with world be mr mortimer not to perceive that ingenuous navet of young girl be real

foot yes there indeed be charles hatfield proceeding at short distance in advance of carriage in same direction critical moment be now almost at hand though lauras countenance still maintained

be fixed steadily even intently in one direction yes have two friend with said to herself be three in plain clothes rather in mourning doubtless for father in law of illustrious master scarcely have thought flashed through lauras brain when charles two companion stopped turned round gazed up down avenue for few moment then interchanged observation pursued way charles have not noticed laura have caught more than partial glimpse of face during quarter of minute that eye be fixed upon have a be devoured with earnest gaze be not love be not hate be specie of ravenous longing to decypher thought through medium of countenance saw that be pale pensive also strikingly handsome indeed at moment laura fancied manly beauty have never before seemed so perfect in eye be with difficulty that repressed

gradually diminishing almost immediately carriage must overtake companion again turned three gentleman looked up down time laura rapidly scanned hatfields two friend be also young men of fine figure attractive look native of castelcicala have dark italian complexion fine italian eye a wore moustache appearance be more military than of charles be not so handsome a at least laura thought so be doubtless right critical moment be now at hand carriage overtook hatfield italian companion be just passing when laura perceived that be suddenly recognised by husband started stopped short kept eye fixed upon a if doubting evidence while two friend excited by strange manner looked also in same direction at same object gaze be likewise rivetted immediately upon beauteous woman whose transcendent charm naturally supposed to have produced effect on companion with glance keen rapid a lightning laura perceived that be idol of attention on part of husband two italian friend though latter dreamt not that be even known by name to charles hatfield while eye of three be thus intently fixed upon parasol suddenly escaped from hand fell within few pace of young men unobserved by footman standing behind carriage of two castelcicalan officer one be taller more classically handsome than other be that now darted forward to snatch up parasol restore to charming owner so admirably have laura managed dropping of parasol that have appearance of accident to one who observed circumstance save charles hatfield quickly a powder explodes after match have be applied to did conviction flash to brain that occurrence be intentional on part of laura al same instant struck that never never before have appeared so marvellously beautiful never so transcendently lovely a now be with flush of gentle excitement upon cheek hair dressed in style that most admired pearly teeth partly revealed between rose of lip toilette so elegant chaste setting off splendid form to greatest advantage attitude so classically graceful a leant forward to receive parasol that handsome castelcicalan now restored to after having carefully brushed off dust with white cambric handkerchief thousand thousand conflicting thought passed through brain of charles hatfield during few second have elapsed from escape of parasol from hand until restoration by italian saw wife more beautiful than ever have conceived to be even when be accustomed to worship image remembered witchery of way melting music of voice joy have experienced in arm on marriage night rushed to mind a eye dwelt perforce upon rich contour of bust recollected that head have be pillowed hand have wandered voluptuously there at moment laura dropped parasol carriage stopped affected to perceive charles hatfield for first time for single instant appeared struck by surprise uncertain how to act then immediately afterwards averted eye from bent on handsome castelcicalan who have sprung forward to recover parasol purposely composed countenance modelled behaviour so that husband must be left in state of utter uncertainty bewilderment a to what be passing in mind at least in regard to when italian approached carriage took off hat with low bow presented parasol have so gallantly dusted with cambric handkerchief laura bestowed so sweet smile so tender look on handsome foreigner that direst rage jealousy can know be excited in moment in breast of charles hatfield rapid glance unseen even by husband made laura aware of effect produced upon by deportment towards castelcicalan joy of proud triumph filled heart thank sir said in french to italian gentleman for have already learnt more than enough of language to be enabled to give utterance to common phrase a spoke again smiled sweetly though not in manner might be construed into indelicate encouragement husband caught word be addressed to handsome foreigner also marked smile accompanied a music of voice flowed upon ear witchery of smile met gaze countenance became absolutely livid with emotion rent soul beautiful lady said castelcicalan enchanted by condescending manner of lovely woman who be agreeably surprised much delighted to hear address with utmost

deed might deserve approval win gratitude added italian sinking voice to low tone know not signor replied laura satisfying with rapid glance that charles hatfield be still gazing with jealous fury upon scene know not signor said with witchery of tone manner that must summon to aid how can sufficiently thank for courteous behaviour demonstrate towards at same time need scarcely be astonished at such chivalrous gallantry on part for if mistake not belong to fine italian clime shortly intend to visit young castelcicalan gazed with enthusiasm of adoration up into enchanting countenance be

must do well to remain in france signor rather than lead nation into crime said laura laughing gaily rapid glance darted towards husband convinced that be enduring torment of damned torment be increasing in proportion a seemed to grow on more friendly term with young italian officer must be wretched indeed beauteous lady said in reply to last observation did think that inconsiderate remark from lip must deter from carrying into effect purpose already settled in mind added with sigh be vain enough to suppose to be of sufficient importance to sway in one way be vain enough to take in

obtain appeared that baronet have be absent for eight day that communication have be received from have given previous intimation of intended departure brother have be informed of unaccountable absence seemed that attorney have taken no step to solve mystery be only fact lord william succeeded in gleaning in addition to meagre knowledge already possessed relative to matter returned homeward with heavy heart experiencing strange misgiving in respect to friend be near midnight when re entered room where have left lady moment appeared on threshold of door rose from seat hastened forward to meet look revealing intensity of anxiety acuteness of suspense experienced when saw by countenance even before word fell from lip that have good news to impart ghastly pallor overspread face must have fallen have not supported led back to chair grieve to say madam at length observed have learnt nothing more than what already know unless indeed be fact that communication respecting sir gilbert

emphatically believe when assure that if there must transpire least cause of suspicion if there must appear aught to warrant belief that james heathcote must have possibly practised instigated foul play in respect to brother believe madam repeat will pursue investigation will leave stone unturned will prosecute inquiry until will have brought home deep guilt to door not for instant not for

wildly together be terrible terrible even for moment to entertain idea that whom love so devotedly may be more compose madam tranquillise feeling implore cried lord william trevelyan must not give way to despair must not harbour dreadful thought sir gilbert heathcote have met with foul play that cease to exist let hope oh lord how can hope in face of such strange such mysterious such suspicious circumstance demanded lady with mingled grief bitterness even if did not choose to acquaint friend with intended absence motif must not be equally reserved towards no must have seen ere departure must at least have written for must now learn lord that have loved other for upwards of twenty year continued in low plaintive tone for twenty year more have heart beat in unison never never be love so devoted a ours ala mine have be strange romantic life influence have swayed incident be that passion worldly minded treat so lightly for father be worldly minded man though knew how fondly loved how ardently be beloved though knelt before conjured by held most sacred by spirit of mother who died in childhood not to sacrifice to object of choice tear away from object of mine nevertheless ridiculed prayer made naught of beseechings be immolated upon altar of parent sordid interest lordship have perhaps already understood that one whom adored be gilbert heathcote never never be love tale told with more enchanting sweetness than by lip never never did woman cherish more devotedly than avowal of sincere passion at time personal beauty be sufficient to ensnare heart of maiden though far le susceptible than mine loved loved madly wealthy noble have seen father beheld with joy impression have be so unfortunate a to make upon patrician fancy moreover at period sire be suffering cruel pecuniary embarrassment brilliant marriage hoped to accomplish for daughter appeared only mean of extricating from difficulty thus suit of nobleman be encouraged by father be induced by menace prayer specious reasoning employed by turn to move be induced say to tolerate visit of peer although heaven know never must encourage not that personal appearance be disagreeable paused to reflect that age be more than double own for be handsome very handsome though year be twice mine yet be in prime of life wherefore then did receive address with loathing wherefore did implore father to save from alliance be so desirable so brilliant in worldly point of view oh be because heart be irrevocably given to because gilbert heathcote possessed love lady paused wiped away tear so many varied reminiscence have wrung from eye while profound sob convulsed bosom lord william trevelyan felt embarrassment awkwardness of position for be now past midnight began to reflect that servant might look suspiciously upon fact of protracted visit on part of lady who be still young enough certainly handsome enough to afford food for scandalous tongue not that lord william be rigid saint stern anchorite in respect to female sex although unmarried behaved with utmost circumspection must never have outraged decency so far a to make own abode place of intrigue gallant rendezvous moreover love entertained for agnes vernon have exercised purifying chastening influence upon soul that shrank from idea of compromising by real impropriety of becoming compromised by mean of indiscretion scandal might think fit to attribute to lady be however too much absorbed in own thought emotion to mark how rapidly time be slipping away to reflect upon imprudence of prolonging visit feeling be painfully excited not only by fear entertained on account of absence of sir gilbert heathcote likewise by reminiscence have be stirred up in soul outpouring of to sympathetic ear seemed necessary vent for bosom so full of sorrow yes lord resumed after short pause voice still being characterised by tone of most touching melancholy father forced into hated marriage though gained rank proud position yet hope happiness appeared to have forsaken for ever can not tell exclaimed hastily a if sudden thought have struck warning that be about to be led by feeling into revelation of nature must repent must at least be unbecoming injudicious madam said lord william emphatically seek confidence even desire have to do with man of honour by whom everything may impart whether with premeditation unguardedly will be held a sacred thank lordship for kind assurance observed lady imagine wish to force into becoming depositary of secret in order to establish specie of claim upon friendship lord be not selfish be intriguer only most unhappy most unfortunate woman be because have manifested little interest in because have so generously promised to aid in clearing up mystery surround sudden disappearance of one so dear to be for reason lord that be anxious to explain so much of circumstance of connexion with a will convince that nothing sincerest affection on part must have placed in position world generally must regard with scorn have told lordship how loving gilbert heathcote be forced into most inauspicious marriage with name of other need not mention father saw when be too late that have indeed sacrificed happiness on altar of own selfishness died of remorse of broken heart husband noble husband be kind generous towards must not love knew then grew jealous other circumstance added casting down eye blushing deeply embittered life at length must rather say at expiration of few short year fled from fled from husband who have be forced upon sought refuge with object of heart sole undivided affection from moment have dwelt under protection of sir gilbert heathcote dwelt in strictest privacy happy in possession of love love a well a own have known diminution with lapse of year to one of generous soul of enlightened mind position may not appear so degrading so humiliating a must to one incapable of distinguishing between heart irresistible affection mere sensual depravity pardon lord for having thus obtruded slight fear rambling sketch upon notice must not endure conviction must appear in eye to be nothing more le than pensioned mistress of friend length of time that love for have endured may be alone sufficient to persuade that be not to be confounded amidst common mass of female degradation immorality madam thank for explanation comprehend delicacy peculiarity of position said lord william trevelyan rising from seat lady having set example for now struck that have remained until very late hour will pardon lord said for having thus occupied so much of time know to be one of sir gilbert best friend indeed one of whom be principally accustomed to speak whom loved relied upon most may hope that will favour with communication so soon a will have seen mr james heathcote although in virtue of marriage bear proud great name yet for year year have be known only a mr sefton by appellation must be known to lady then mentioned address in kentish town extending hand to young nobleman renewed thanks for kindness have shown offered to escort to home declined with firmness at same time in such delicate term a to convince that must neither compromise allow to be compromised by courtesy must not well have refrained from proposing although might not have be well pleased to carry into effect promised to call upon a soon a have anything important to communicate mr sefton then took departure trevelyan ringing bell in order that servant might attend to door so that there must be nothing clandestine stealthy in appearance of visit when trevelyan be once more alone threw in arm chair gave way to reflection for evening adventure have in detail furnished ample food for thought in first place there be strange unaccountable disappearance of sir gilbert heathcote man to whom young patrician be much attached whose friendship valued highly then in spite of remonstrance have addressed to mr sefton found suspicion existing in mind relative to james heathcote suspicion of nature dared not attempt to define even in secresy of own soul nevertheless moment grew stronger vague though be next pondered upon particular of slight autobiographical sketch lady have given dwelt with yet unsubdued surprise on fact that friend sir gilbert have maintained for so long time entirely unsuspected connexion fully accounted for bachelor life lastly trevelyan meditated upon course must adopt to discover baronet fate unless must speedily re appear relieve from cruel suspense uncertainty who be interested in young nobleman felt not slightest inclination to retire to rest although be now one oclock in morning adventure of evening have excited unsettled having pondered on various topic above enumerated thought insensibly reverted to beloved agnes suddenly eye caught portfolio that have left upon table opening took forth portrait of recluse of cottage ah why did start what did see rising from chair held picture in such manner that light gave perfect view of sure enough beyond possibility of mistake there be mark upon dress spot a if drop of water perhaps tear have fallen upon must mean how must such accident have happened again again looked looked steadfastly earnestly longer gazed more convinced did become that eye did not deceive that saw aright that stain spot be there yet have not noticed when after mr mortimer departure previous to mr seftons arrival have so long so ardently contemplated that portrait mark be not there then else lover devouring entire portrait artist scrutinising with satisfaction minute detail of own drawing oh yes must not have failed to observe slightest speck least least spot marred general effect of pleasing delineation be possible then that mr sefton have inspected portfolio yes such supposition be natural enough be left alone in room for nearly two hour in spite of sorrow time must have seemed so irksome to a to induce to have recourse to mean to while away if not to divert thought into le melancholy channel yes yes have divined truth now doubt at least such be idea then tear oh be easily accounted for be overwhelmed with grief at mysterious alarming absence of man whom loved be weeping while turned over content of portfolio well be matter thought trevelyan a arrived at conclusion must have be far worse have tear fallen on face of portrait for might labour for hour nay for day without being enabled to catch delineate so faithfully again that sweet expression of countenance agnes wear have succeeded in conveying to paper mark be upon dress single touch with brush will repair injury ala poor woman added in musing alluding to mr sefton have indeed enough to weep for if have lost love on earth even have spoilt portrait altogether must have forgiven trevelyan now returned drawing to portfolio conveyed to little room adjoining then retracing way into parlour approached mantel piece to take letter have written to agnes be astounded stupified by conviction burst upon that letter be gone gone might have dropped upon floor on rug in fender vainly did search uselessly did pry into nook corner must think of letter have disappeared rang bell furiously did one enter room during absence just now while lady be here demanded of domestic who responded to summons lord be answer be certain said trevelyan with interrogative emphasis be positive lord replied man then after pause observed hope nothing unpleasant have occurred lord yes may retire said nobleman abstractedly when domestic have left room threw into chair overcome with amazement grief at mysterious circumstance have occurred illustration must mr sefton have taken letter idea be ridiculous be too much absorbed in own sorrow to have leisure for gratification of idle impertinent curiosity besides be common thief for let lady be possessed with ever so prying disposition must not carry mania to point a to steal letter sealed letter unless be absolutely dishonest unprincipled surely must not be character of woman whom have seen in such deep affliction that evening woman who be assuredly what have represented to be whose appearance manner language forbade idea that be abandoned wretch wrong by entertaining such injurious suspicion even for instant thought lord william when reflection have passed through brain be impossible that afflicted lady can have taken letter besides have done so must have waited until return again of what use of what benefit must letter be to glanced around beheld several article of value lying about in accustomed place have gone out in such hurry that have left purse containing gold upon mantel remembering precise amount reckoned found to be correct lying upon table be splendid gold seal have used in closing letter be now missed in fine there be numerous object costly curious ill disposed person might have self appropriated of have be left untouched how then be possible to suppose that mr sefton have purloined letter nevertheless have disappeared therefore one must have taken else accident must have happened whereby be lost trevelyan racked brain to discover whether be possible that have removed from mantel after have placed there felt assured that during interval elapsed between writing of letter arrival of mr sefton have not quitted apartment affair be most mysterious nay be also alarming for how must possibly account for disappearance of sealed letter if have indeed be taken by ill disposed person content might be made known perhaps to prejudice of suit with agnes be assured that one have entered room during absence be so reluctant to fix deed on mr sefton have so many reason against supposition that became equally confident be in way connected with strange occurrence at length reasoned into belief that must have deposited letter in place must not recollect a have in first instance made rough draught resolved to write fair copy over again be soon accomplished having sealed addressed took new letter with to own bed chamber so that might retain in security until mr mortimer must call for in morning be past two oclock when lord william retired to rest though much fatigued must not immediately close eye in slumber affair of letter haunted filled with vague undefined misgiving assumed aspect more mysterious longer contemplated endeavoured to persuade that belief to have ere now temporarily lulled mind be real solution of theory then must come evidence of memory proclaiming that have placed letter on mantel in parlour that have not touched afterwards in fine be bewildered amidst variety of conflicting thought brain grew wearied with agitation jarring contention produced so that at length sleep stole upon insensibly though sealed eye in slumber did not protect against troubled dream visited pillow

for single instant dare to assert that if brother must have met with foul play a word just now implied suspicion do dare to assert ask that world must couple slightest imputation with good name though not of aristocratic rank social position be honourable one such a be own talent own energy own hard toil have made because can see nothing extraordinary in absence of man who have domestic tie to bind to one place who acting upon sudden caprice fancy may choose to depart from metropolis perhaps because behold nothing remarkable in be to be reproached vituperated even insulted by who adopt view of matter why lord be far more intimate with sir gilbert heathcote than even though be brother what must say be to repair to house force into presence refuse to leave when solicited actually level most injurious language amounting almost to positive imputation at head appeal to good sense if posse to consider impropriety of conduct here morning to take departure at once before irritate more deeply

long a possible so a to afford green ample time to carry deeply concocted scheme into effect be pleased to be jocular at something sir said trevelyan biting lip with vexation at insolence must not chastise leaning against mantel piece surveyed attorney with mingled anger aversion yes be jocular exclaimed latter again declare that conduct be admirable come to to aid in investigating what be pleased to denominate most mysterious occurrence by way of inducing thus to co operate start fresh mystery make enigmatic allusion to unintelligible matter concerning refuse to enter into explanation

than own brother replied lawyer in sarcastic tone be tantamount to what told just now yes sir circumstance to allude have reference to mysterious disappearance of sir gilbert heathcote rejoined trevelyan do in way relieve from responsibility a brother since be acquainted with mysterious unmentionable circumstance connected with brother said lawyer still in tone of bitter sarcasm have much more reason to accuse of possessing clue to cause of disappearance than have to level same charge at now from word for be man of world lord naturally infer that other person to whom so emphatically alluded must be lady did not say so sir gave reason for entertaining such opinion exclaimed trevelyan fearful of now compromising matter of great delicacy choose to think so said lawyer elevating brow

sincere in giving utterance to on one side be disposed to view affair seriously heathcote on other put own interpretation on in same way that trevelyan must not resist impression made upon felt bound to allow merit of equal conscientiousness on part of attorney at event there be utility in protracting discourse young nobleman accordingly resolved to take leave suspending for present opinion

ala may not be resumed leonard mournfully now young lady absolutely shuddered in arm a if ice chill have suddenly fallen upon heart instant before so warm with passion may not be continued leonard determined not to leave in least degree of suspense behold uniform uniform be accursed under circumstance not only on account of soul crushing merciless discipline degrading servitude of be badge also because constitutes barrier to wish so generously intimated so enthusiastically share discharge can be purchased can not asked ellen bending down head to conceal deep blush when enlisted ellen solemnly mournfully replied leonard swore within oath oath ratified by deem sacred in heaven by hope of hereafter to follow course of new destiny carved out for if possible to rise to distinction in service dare not quit be young when made that vow hope dictated never will be fulfilled for english soldier be serf slave idea of rising have have leonard laughed wildly at event added hastily again assuming solemn tone respect oath took who love will not counsel to break can see other often ellen can meet a have met to night then with assurance must content leonard interrupted impassioned young lady in whom a reader may have surmised hand of affliction tyranny of parent selfishness of old man who bought with gold have deadened delicate feeling even undermined virtuous principle have characterised in day of happy innocence yes returned leonard with understanding must endeavour to console ourselves now beloved one be time for to leave remember added bitterly that though man in year belong to service where be treated a child limited to particular hour must to god that be emancipated from dreadful thraldom exclaimed ellen weeping nay be wrong to say aught to afflict returned leonard embracing tenderly few minute more did pas together exchanging most passionate caress earnest protestation of unalterable affection when separated at last be not without having arranged for meeting at early day must be scarcely possible to describe feeling animated young lover a respectively hastened to abode one to barrack other to home a have before stated circumstance have so warped ellens mind that paused not even to reflect for instant upon dangerous course on have entered have no longer tie to bind with filial love to father never have bond of affection to link to husband therefore now thought of cared to think of be that have recovered lover whom adored must have ridiculed laughed at idea of disgrace of ruined reputation have friend counselled in matter on side leonard be le hardened for such indeed be term might be applied to ellens state of mind to consequence of new phase of existence shuddered at thought of inducing young wife to conduct in manner so injurious to husband happiness resolved in calmer moment when met ellen again according to appointment already arranged must represent to necessity of eternal separation when did meet in secluded place appeared so ravishingly beautiful spoke with so much tenderness seemed so completely happy in society be withal so unfeignedly loving that must not bring to give utterance to word trembled upon tongue word must have chased away charming smile dimmed with tear lustre of melting eye hushed with sigh language of fervid passion changed to dark despair bright glowing bliss therefore separated second time with arrangement to meet again on occasion of third interview leonard found le disposed than before to make representation must be fatal to happiness of to be brief interview succeeded interview leonard resolving that one must be last until at length love dalliance became irresistible in consequence opportunity serving in respect lover be criminal from day forth leonard thought no more of impropriety of meeting thereafter grew more frequent longer in duration will here interrupt thread of narrative for brief space in order to make few observation upon condition of private soldier in first instance let record conviction that there be not more generous hearted nobler minded more humane set of men breathing than who constitute rank of british army while there be not more tyrannical overbearing illiberal self sufficient class than composed of officer of army how be latter fact to be accounted for because army be mere plaything of aristocracy mean of providing for younger son of nobleman enabling titled mamma to show off stripling in red coat what opinion can have of constitution of army so far a officer be concerned when find prince albert suddenly created field marshal spectacle be nauseating in extreme german must have execrably bad taste else be endowed with inordinate conceit to hold baton of marshal when have not even military knowledge of drummer boy since army be thus made mere tool in hand of rascally aristocracy what sympathy can possibly exist between officer men former look upon latter a scum of earth mere slave on level with shoe black hence barbarous cry of flog flog flog there be love lost between class for soldier hate abhor officer whom naturally most justly look upon a tyrant oppressor be enough to make blood boil with indignation to think that fine stalwart gallant fellow must be kicked about at caprice of wretched ensign contemptible cornet just loosened from mamma apron string bullied by older officer whose only excellence be relationship to nobility power to obtain promotion by purchase generality of officer in british army be nothing more le than set of purse proud bloodhound whose greatest delight be to behold blood streaming down back of men who alone win country battle when duke of york who be humane man though a great scamp a ever have column of infamy erected to memory limited corporal punishment to lash full amount be invariably inflicted in nineteen out of twenty case even must not satisfy bloodhound who annoyed pestered duke on subject to extent that be literally bullied into empowering to hold general regimental court martial by whose decision lash might be administered to unhappy victim for year year be torture of military flogging in england shame scandal to europe be absolutely necessary that fine fellow must be murdered at hounslow by accursed lash before barbarous government must interfere world know that british soldier be murdered in revolting manner in presence of horror stricken comrade for be remembered that when appalling spectacle take place eye weep heart grow faint be of soldier never of officer again ask then what sympathy can possibly exist between private in command none soldier must be more grovelling than spaniel if must possibly kiss hand cuff lick shoe of who kick spurn british soldier have feeling a well a others aye spirit too feel iron of cruel discipline heartless system rankling in very soul celebrated john wilkes be wont to say very worst use can put man to be to hang agree with dictum aver in addition that be equally vile use to flog in fact whole treatment of soldier from day of enlistment until of discharge be one continuous system of tyranny deception be made use of to ensnare into service crushing despotism be maintained to render docile pliant tool while be in basest ingratitude mark departure from when be turned adrift on world without penny to help infamy commences with recruiting sergeant be perpetuated by officer be consummated by government take case of leonard mitchell in respect to enlistment young man be assured by recruiting sergeant that pay must be guinea week however turned out to be only s d from s d be stopped for messing washing s d for clothes d for article to clean uniform with leaving d per week one penny day for pocket money be condition of british dragoon with le pocket money than school boy receives from parent government relies upon fidelity of army from fact that be officered by scion of aristocracy who be of course interested in upholding kind of abuse hence belief government entertains that in case of popular convulsion troop must be certain to fire upon people in spite of lordlings aristocratic offshoot who command army firmly believe that depends upon cause in such popular convulsion might arise whether troop must really massacre civilian brother if be glorious just struggle for right pertinaciously withheld privilege doggedly refused army must not act against people even government have fear on head ignorant though be of real state of feeling anywhere save in circle of oligarchy for on recent occasion when tremendous military preparation be made to resist expected outbreak of working men of london government set policeman in plain clothes to act a spy in respect to private soldier spy threw in way of soldier enticed into public house plied with drink in apparently frank off hand manner questioned a to political opinion of gallant private thus treated interrogated little thinking that be in fang of government mouchards candidly expressed sympathy with popular cause a generously declared that must sooner cut hand off than draw trigger against people adding working men soldier be brother what be consequence spy followed brave open hearted men home to barrack laid information against so that number of british soldier thus shamefully entrapped found suddenly placed under arrest commanding officer did not dare bring to punishment be doubtless marked men will be persecuted with imaginable rancour bitterness to conclude portion of observation must remark that if disturbance have really occurred on great public occasion now especially alluded to troop be resolved not to fire upon people be equally determined to avenge most signally upon police day have gone by for british soldier to permit to be made tool of despotism will not be behind french soldier in noble sentiment generous conduct enlightened feeling more than be inferior to in bravery discipline british soldier must have wrong boldly proclaimed speedily redressed in many if not in most regiment love of self improvement be looked upon by officer a crime whereas reading must be encouraged a much a possible barrack room must be made more comfortable at present be so miserable cheerless that private soldier be driven to public house in spite of better inclination in many instance men have become drunkard from very fact be then entered in proscribed list though might be avoided be encouraged to remain pas evening at home food provided for mess table be seldom of good description frequently of very worst meat especially be too often of vilest kind unfit for human food yet poor soldier dare not complain not even in respect to for supply of be so heavily mulcted out of miserable pittance drunkenness even now then be heinous crime in respect to private soldier whereas veriest stripling be ever dubbed ensign cornet may get a tipsy a owl night of life with utter impunity in fine condition of british soldier be wretched in extreme while officer who buy rank enjoys privilege riot in luxury dissipation unfortunate private who be basely inveigled into service by damnable fraud be persecuted for slightest offence treated on occasion a mere dog now to return to narrative six month elapsed during period leonard ellen met a often a duty of former must permit while latter cared not to what extent husband suspicion be aroused by frequent unaccountable absence from home that old man did speedily entertain most heart rending suspicion be fact if questioned wife took refuge in stubborn silence answered in manner that only provoked more pride prevented from complaining to father felt that be now righteously punished for selfishness in sacrificing happiness of fair young creature to own desire at length unable longer to endure torture of uncertainty anxious to know worst at once else acquire conviction that have misjudged wife altogether watched movement aware of proceeding without affecting to notice adopted such precaution a completely to outwit husband to hold meeting with lover undiscovered a before up to period nearly three year half young man have conducted in regiment with utmost steadiness have never be reported never incurred slightest reprimand from superior be extraordinary case inasmuch a private soldier have so many person to please first corporal then serjeant then serjeant major then subaltern of troop next captain

detail only arouse reminiscence so painful to interrupted trevelyan bear with yet little while said marquis speaking in so mild plaintive tone lord william must not find in heart to manifest impatience farther disinclination to hear old nobleman narrative bear with say for have motive in entering into detail continued at same time will not be too prolix although there be thousand little circumstance recur to memory might be quoted to prove how patient enduring be under cruel indifference wherewith be treated will content by observing that sophia smiled only on occasion when

nature of apprehension now began to haunt like ghost oh how longed to question to know worst to hear proclaim injustice of suspicion dared not touch upon subject tongue clave to roof of mouth whenever sought to frame word must accuse in manner did drag on wretched existence experiencing misery of having young wife who must not love feeling bitterness of position in being allied to old husband who have grown so jealous so suspicious at last day came when repugnance to utter fatal accusation suddenly vanished have be more than ordinarily provoked for at dejeuner given at house of friend

before be deeply imbued with suspicion cursed anathematised rashness have marked conduct be painful distressing scene for remember fell upon knee to implore forgiveness to beseech to remain if not for sake at least for of child appeal only excited more when adjured in name of infant daughter to stay uttered wild cry fled a if suddenly seized with insanity from house here marquis paused for few moment passed handkerchief rapidly over eye reminiscence of past be still powerful enough to move to tear will not now detain long lord resumed wife went knew not in short time heard that be living in strictest seclusion under feigned name will not despise when learn that employed spy to watch action to institute inquiry concerning pursuit conduct will conceal nothing from candidly admit that such be course adopted for though still believed that be innocent up to time when abrupt accusation drove from house nevertheless naturally conjectured that on thus quitting have sought protection of whom loved be not therefore surprised to hear that sir gilbert heathcote be frequent visitor at abode of mr sefton by name be now known be unable to glean positive evidence of criminality on part did seek such evidence yes for raging jealousy have taken possession of longed to punish for daring to love rival a did a time passed on sober reflection worked influence upon grew ashamed of course have adopted now resolved to hush up to utmost of power unhappy position in stood with regard to wife for already felt deeply attached to little daughter determined that if human precaution must prevent such misfortune must never have to blush for mother shame be strengthened in resolve by fact that marchioness herself be disposed to shroud past in secrecy a much a possible else wherefore feigned name have adopted seclusion in dwelt in course of few month certain event transpired threatened to lay bare to public whole of most painful history must explain more fully by stating that wife father have made will leaving landed property to be to descend to child child might spring from marriage with daughter distant male relative of now set up claim to property proceeding be taken in court of chancery from transpired that marquis marchioness of delmour be living apart by mutual consent a be alleged that infant child be in charge of marquis will not weary with particular detail suffice to say that proceeding took turn be of such nature a to lead to decree to effect that claim of distant relative be rejected that trustee be appointed by court to administer property until agnes must attain age of twenty one that a allegation of misconduct have be made against marchioness of delmour must have charge of daughter portion of marquis narrative will explain to reader wherefore when conversing with daughter at cottage a detailed in chapter clxi said to two year more will no longer have secret from because at expiration of period agnes must attain majority decree in chancery likewise explained ground upon mr sefton alias marchioness of delmour have observed to trevelyan in chapter clxxxi that law be in favour in respect to endeavour might be made to wrest agnes from care same fact elucidates meaning of ladyship remark that two year must elapse ere must venture to dispose of hand of daughter in marriage thus be resumed marquis after brief pause that accursed proceeding did not provoke when once commenced must not arrest thus be that suddenly placed infant daughter within jurisdiction of chancery court deprived of right of retaining in care be true might have instituted counter proceeding in respect to portion of decree then must have be compelled to attack reputation of wife prove to be adultress if such evidence must be acquired cover noble family with shame while specie of hereditary taint must cling to reputation of agnes now lord can understand motive in rearing under circumstance of such privacy such secresy in dooming to existence of seclusion almost of solitude of adopting possible precaution to prevent falling into hand of mother now also that be acquainted with most sad most unhappy history appeal to whether will be mean of permitting innocent agnes to remain in care of unworthy parent if really love lord if propose to make wife when attains majority put to honour to good sense whether be preferable that must pas interval of two year with mother who occupies so equivocal position with father who have ever done duty towards trevelyan be cruelly embarrassed by appeal in reality carried so much weight with involved so important point that knew not how to act much a be disposed to make possible allowance for mr sefton a have better continue to call much a pitied in consequence of wretched marriage into have be forced great a excuse be for connexion with sir gilbert heathcote nevertheless must not avoid being shocked at idea of young creature whom intended to make wife remaining in maternal care good sense propriety of feeling naturally prompted therefore to advocate father claim to guardianship of agnes on other hand solemn pledge have given to sir gilbert heathcote likewise confidence in good principle of mr sefton in spite of equivocal position forbade to side at once with marquis yet how be to remain neutral who have deep tender interest in welfare of lovely innocent artless agnes while be still hesitating what course to adopt walking up down room in excited manner while too marquis of delmour who remained seated upon sofa be watching with most intense anxiety loud double knock ring at front
