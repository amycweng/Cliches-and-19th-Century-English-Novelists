after incident have just related dr lascelles received message at about noon requesting to repair immediately to dwelling of lady hatfield who be seriously indisposed obeyed summons with more than usual alacrity for ever since lord ellingham have made confidant curiosity of worthy doctor have be strangely piqued by unaccountable fact that lady hatfield must reject suit of man whom not only professed to love who be in way worthy of on arrival at lady hatfield residence be surprised to learn from miss mordaunt that patient be too unwell to quit couch when be introduced into georgiana bed chamber found labouring under strong nervous excitement in accordance with sacred privilege of physician be of course left alone with ladyship seating by side of bed questioned in usual manner georgiana explained sensation although alluded to nothing beyond physical detail directly came within province of medical man still dr lascelles have difficulty in perceiving that mind rather than body be affected dear lady hatfield said in a gentle mild tone a must possibly assume be in power of physician to administer certain drug may produce temporary composure opiate will encourage good night rest will forgive for observing that condition in now find be scarcely one to medical science will apply successfullyunless seconded by aid of more refined delicate nature comprehend doctor exclaimed georgiana casting upon glance of mingled surprise uneasiness mean lady hatfield resumed lascelles that be prey to secret griefsome source of vexation annoyance medical skill can not remove aid of refined delicate nature to refer be such a can be afforded only by sincere confidential friend without for instant seeking to draw into explanation be duty to assure that unless mind be tranquillised medicine will not successfully encounter nervous irritabilitythis intense anxietythis oppressive feeling of coming evil without apparent causeand sleeplessness at nightof complain thank most sincerely for candour frankness on part doctor said lady hatfield after long pause during appeared to reflect profoundly to deny have suffered much in mind during last few day be to practise useless deception upon require confidanti need not solace of friendship to medical skill trust for at event partial restoration to health travellingchange of scenethe excitement of visiting such mean of diversion will effect rest last word be however accompanied with deep sighas if upon lady soul be forced sad conviction that happiness must evermore remain stranger to other must scarcely recommend travelling in winter time lady hatfield observed doctor lascelles surely own city can afford constant variety of recreation ever changing scene of amusement may produce beneficial effect upon spirit abhor pleasure of fashionable world doctor said georgiana emphatically there be something so cold in ostentation of sphereso chilling in magnificenceso formal in pursuitsso ceremonial so thoroughly artificial in feature proceeding when in crowded ball room brilliant soire even feel more alone than when in solitude of own chamber yet lady hatfield throughout extensive circle of acquaintance said physician there must be at least few endowed with intellectual qualification adapted to render agreeable most pleasant party composed of select might be given rankyour wealthyour own well stored mindand pardon beautywould ensure to oh doctor exclaimed georgiana can anticipate argument be about to use ala mind appears to be in morbid state discolours object with own jaundiced thought speak thus candidly to doctorbecause be aware of friendship for mei know also that admission have now made will be regarded by a solemn secretand perhaps advice added slowly hesitatingly might prove beneficial to nono exclaimed utterance suddenly assuming great rapidity be useless to say more advice can not serve there be scarcely possible case of human vexation grief annoyance can not be relieved by solace ameliorated by counsel of friend observed doctor lascelles dwelling emphatically upon word georgiana played abstractedly with long luxuriant hair streamed over shoulder spread shining mass on white pillow at same time snowy night dress rose sank rapidly with heaving of bosom believe lady hatfield continued doctor lascelles after short pause during vainly awaited reply to former observation be deeply grieved to find that one who so little deserves sting of grief presence of misfortune must suffer from sharpness of first menace of latter be not possible dear ladyand now forgive if avail myself of privilege of physician to ask questionis not possible say that have conjured up phantom have substantial existence remember that there be certain condition of mind when imagination becomes prey to wildest delusion doctor be monomaniac said lady hatfield abruptly justly indeedoh most justly truly did ere now assert little deserve sting of grief if through crimeany weaknessany frailty on part have merited sore displeasure of heavenat that time checked abruptly burst into flood of tear for few moment countenance appeared to be sad index of breaking heart doctor observed at length pardon manifestation of weakness on part spirit be so depressedmy mind feel so truly wretched that can not control tear think more of what have be saying wish that have not said so much leave prescription visit again in course of day lascelles wrote out prescription then took departure wondering more than ever what secret cause of grief be nourished in bosom of lady hatfield that secret grief be motive have induced compelled to refuse hand of lord ellingham must not doubtthat arose from crimeweaknessnor frailty on part felt assured inasmuch a own word uttered in paroxysm of mental anguish not in calm moment when deception might be aim proved that factand that be associated with physical ailment must hardly believe because if be prey to insidious disease feeling of shameno false delicacy must possibly force woman of good sense naturally powerful mind to keep fact from physician what then must be that secret profoundly rooted cause of grief be monomania of novel very rare kind curiosity of man of science be keenly whetted already began to suspect that be destined to discover new phase in constitution of human mind resolved to adopt mean within reach to solve mystery curiosity on part be by mean of common vulgar base nature considering profession researchful disposition of man be legitimate entirely venial sentiment be not that curiosity love to feed upon material of scandal be purely in connexion with thirst of knowledge passion for discovery ever animated in sphere of science to be so enthusiastically devoted doctor be proceeding homewards when encountered lord ellingham earl be walking by side of elderly gentleman on whose arm hung tall graceful young lady physician did not immediately catch glimpse of countenance a be turned towards lord ellingham who be speaking at moment nobleman shook lascelles warmly by hand immediately introduced companion by name of mr miss de medina doctor bowed then cast glance at countenance of young lady started a if with sudden pangfor in beautiful jewess who now stood before beheldapparently past possibility of errorthe same female who few day previously have attempted self destruction in south moulton street almost simultaneously with unexpected conviction solemn promise have made to tom rainford whom only knew on occasion by denomination of jameson flashed to mind of doctor lascelles instantly composing uttered observation of general nature be glad have thus met doctor said lord ellingham who have not noticed sudden evanescent excitement for friend mr de medina be comparative stranger in london be a well added nobleman with smile that must become acquainted with leading physician of day believe that one enjoys health so good a to be enabled to dispense altogether with assistance said physician bowing in acknowledgment of compliment thus paid most perfect piece of mechanism must necessarily need repair sometimes decidedly so said lord ellingham will not assert that physician be necessary evil doctorin same sense a lawyer be appeal to miss de medina whether lordship be not by implication too hard upon profession exclaimed lascelles laughing lordship replied esther be yesterday riding very high spirited horse have be thrown in such manner a to have incurred injury question whether must have believed that medical attendant be evil however necessary owe profound gratitude for powerful defence of profession miss de medina said doctor who have thus succeeded in compelling young lady to speak then raised hat passed on have not proceeded many pace when be overtaken by lord ellingham who have parted from companion to have few minute conversation with doctor be lovely girl to whom lordship have just introduced said lascelles a good in heart a be beautiful in person exclaimed nobleman ah cried physician with sly glance be lady hatfield already forgotten far from said arthur tone instantly becoming mournful countenance overclouded can not think

from month back have already seenand if not have heard enough of to know that be pattern of integrity young lady personification of virtue illustration doctor made reply certain be that must tale unfold must totally undeceive noble friend relative to character of esther lip be sealed by solemn vow even if be not there be necessity to detail how have be summoned to attend on young lady rescue from fate crime of suicidehow have good cause to know that be wife mistress suspected latterhow have seen that splendid form stretched half naked upon bed bosom heaving convulsively with physical mental agony exquisitely modelled arm flung wildly about with excruciating painhow large black eye have be fixed imploringly upon vermillion lip have parted to give utterance to word demanding from fiat of life deaththere be necessity say to narrate even if vow have bound to silence because lord ellingham sought not that lovely jewess a wife that esther de medina lady of south moulton street be one same person doctor felt convinced tone of esther voice flowing upon ear with such silver melodythe two row of brilliant beautiful teeththe facethe hairthe eyesthe configuration of form with fine justly proportioned bust slender waistall be identical what chiefly amazednay bewildered physician be calm indifference with esther have met rapid searching glancethe admirable composure with have encountered himthe firmness amounting almost to insolent assurance with have spoken to himnever once quailing blushing manifesting slightest embarrassment actually treating a person whom saw for first time a if be totally unacquainted with thing militated against characterall be naturally subject of ineffable astonishment wonder lord ellingham accompanied doctor to grafton street when have entered house dr lascelles made acquainted with lady hatfield indisposition be ill ejaculated arthur profoundly touched by tidings dare not call even to inquire concerning wherefore must not manifest that courtesy asked doctor must forget heri can not demonstrate farther interest in behalf exclaimed nobleman if there really exist reason render impossible imprudent for to change condition by marriage be useless for to meet againand if be swayed by caprice can not suffer to be made sport of whim there be wanton wilful whim of coquette said doctor impressively there be delusion of monomaniacbut latter be not le conscientiously believed although be nothing save delusion be possible cried arthur sudden ray of hope breaking in upon can georgiana be subject to phantasy of nature oh then can be cured doctorand skill may yet make happy rest assured dear earl be reply knowledge posse will be devoted to purpose eternal gratitude will be due to doctor said nobleman with permission will return in evening to learn from how charming patient progress physician signified assent lord ellingham took departure new hope animating soul chapter xv opiate be about seven o'clock in evening when dr lascelles returned to lady hatfield house on piccadilly hill miss mordaunt whom encountered in drawing room informed that georgiana have become more composed tranquil since have taken medicine have prescribed for that have requested to be left alone a experienced inclination to sleep be nevertheless necessary must see said physician julia accordingly hastened to friend apartment speedily returned with information that lady hatfield be not yet asleep that doctor might walk up lascelles immediately availed of permission foundas indeed have fully anticipatedthat patient be rapidly yielding to invincible drowsiness produced by opiatic medicine have prescribed for seated by bed side asked few ordinary question then suffered to fall undisturbed into slumber at length slept profoundly smile of satisfaction played for moment upon lip of physician yielded to sombre cloud almost immediately succeeded itfor powerful struggle now suddenly arose in breast of dr lascelles in ardent devotion to science professed longed to satisfy on certain point at present admitting of doubt involved in uncertainty on other hand hesitated at accomplishment of deed must not help regarding a gross abuse of privilege a medical man by virtue of most sacred confidence be admitted to bed chamber of female patient shrank from exercising right in illegitimate way then again reasoned to that if be enabled to ascertain beyond doubt that physical cause induced lady hatfield to shrink from marriage must fall back upon theory that have become subject to certain monomaniac notion influenced mind to own unhappiness at length persuaded that must be acting for best interest be to put into execution project have already formed opinion operating upon man who possessed few of delicate refined feeling of nature who be ever ready to sacrifice consideration to cause of medical science speedily banished hesitation having convinced that georgiana slept so profoundly that there be chance of awaking locked door again approached bed now sacrilegious hand drew aside snow white dress covered sleeping lady bosom treasure of gently heaving breast be exposed to view not sensual thought be thereby excited in mind cold passionless surveyed beauteous spectacle only a sculptor might measure proportion of marble venus diana huntress not trace of cancer be there unseemly mark mole scar wound disfigured glowing orb that rising from broad ample chest swelled laterally over upper part of arm yet wherefore did dr lascelles abruptly start why did countenance suddenly assume expression of surpriseor rather of mingled doubt astonishmentas glance wandered over fair bust thus exposed to view carefully cautiously refastening string of night dress now assumed air of man who have discovered clue to mystery hitherto profoundly veiled unhesitatingly did resolve to clear up doubt newly awakened suspicion five minute afterwards dr lascelles left room lady hatfield still remaining buried in deep slumber countenance expressed surprise mingled with sorrow coldphlegmatic though disposition be must not help murmuring to be possible having just looked into drawing room to take leave of miss mordaunt state that patient be progressing a favourably a must be expected dr lascelles returned home lord ellingham be waiting for interview physician now dreaded be tidings favourable doctor be nobleman hasty anxious inquiry regret dear earl answered lascelles must have encouraged hope be doomed to experience disappointment added arthur bitterly oh might have anticipated thisunfortunate being that be how have ascertained that idea of morning be unfounded how have convinced that georgiana be not prey to mental eccentricity skill might reach have revealed to motive for refusingfor rejecting meme whom professes to love have revealed nothing lord replied doctor solemnly have satisfied that monomania lady hatfield be total stranger to other then must abandon hope exclaimed earl for be evident that be victim of ridiculous caprice yet added sudden thought striking will see once again be illshe be sufferingperhaps will be pleased to behold meand who know not evening lordnot evening cried doctor stopping nobleman who have seized hat be darting towards door lady hatfield sleepsand must not be disturbed lord ellingham be too full of new idea to pay attention to physician rushed from house chapter xvi lover uncle few minute brought arthur to residence of lady hatfield hand be already upon knocker when sudden idea struck himand asked how can demand admission to bed chamber of georgiana madness of project now being evident to mournfully turned away when door suddenly opened tall stout fine looking man dressed a country squire issued from house lord ellingham immediately recognised sir ralph walsingham georgiana uncle with whom be well acquainted baronet also perceived earl shook other cordially by hand be about to call inquired sir ralph be answered lord ellingham hearing of lady hatfield illness be bettermuch better interrupted baronet have just left have not long awoke from profound refreshing slumber be delighted to hear tidings said nobleman servant seeing sir ralph have stopped to converse with earl still kept door open a arthur have admitted that be about to call there be now no alternative save for to leave card baronet then took arm walked away together georgiana be singular being observed sir ralph although be niece yet there be time when hardly know what to make of be too intellectualtoo steadyto be capricious still dear sir ralph interrupted earl have touched upon very topic concerning longed to speak moment met will accompany to abode favour for short period with attention to what be so anxious to confide to with pleasure be reply have already learnt from georgiana lip principal fact to lordship doubtless alludes be indeed for purpose of introducing subject that ere now made remark relative to occasional incomprehensibility of character let not however continue discourse in public street nobleman baronet speedily reached mansion of former in pall mall west when be seated in elegantly furnished apartment with bottle of claret before renewed conversation georgiana said baronet have informed that lordship have honoured by offer of hand need hardly assure how rejoiced must feel to welcome a relative one whom already esteem a friend butto inexpressible surprisei find thatthat have refused exclaimed earlrefused without assigning reason can not think how be to be accounted for continued baronet georgiana have invariably manifested repugnance to topic of marriage have urged upon of course a uncleand double age lordi can give advice just a if be father for year past have recommended to consider well propriety of obtaining legal protector natural one being more reasoning have proved unavailing if lordship can not persuade obstinate niece added with sly laugh then one must hope to do so will frankly admit to said earl that happiness depends on niece decision be hero of romancebut entertain so sincere so ardent affection for lady hatfield that life will be embittered by perseverance in refusal to allow to call mine will not persist in follyshe can not exclaimed sir ralph emphatically be mere whima caprice indeed have often thought that disposition have somewhat altered ever since dreadful fright sustained six seven year ago ah said earl be nature of incident to allude must tell lordship returned baronetunless indeed be already acquainted with factthat hampshire be for three four yearsbetween scene of exploit of celebrated highwayman allude to black mask doubt interrupted lord ellingham interrogatively precisely so answered baronet black maskas villain be calledwas one of most desperate robber ever infested highway must stop stage coach a readily a must single traveller on horseback such be valour a well a extraordinary skill that defied attempt to capture remember reading exploit at time said earl most conflicting account be reported concerning declared be old manothers that be quite young believe that agreed in ascribing to more forbearing disposition than usually characterises person of class will even go so far a to assert that there be something chivalrous in character exclaimed baronet invariably assured traveller whom stopped that must be grieved to harm that if provoked by resistance must not hesitate to punish severely if fell in with carriage containing lady never attempted to rifle of jewellery trinket contented with simply demanding purse being surrendered must gallop away never heard of unnecessary violencenor of act of cruelty perpetrated did ever meet soul who must give anything like credible description of countenance invariable black mask concealed feature from use of derived name seemed portion of although gossip did now then tell strange tale about appearance be too contradictory to allow scintillation of real truth to transpire in what manner be black mask connected with fright lady hatfield experienced year ago asked earl impatiently be perhaps aware that late earl countess of mauleverer possessed country seat between winchester new alresfordnot very far distant from walsingham manor own rural abode said sir ralph must have be seven year ago that georgiana who always preferred mauleverer lodge to town mansioneven during london seasonwas staying alone therei mean so far alone at time there be other person at lodge save servant well one night black mask broke into placethe only time be ever known to commit burglaryand such be fright georgiana experienced that for week month afterwards family frequently trembled lest reason have received shock must indeed have be alarming situation for young ladyalone a be in spacious secluded country dwelling georgiana be eighteen think at time interrupted sir ralph walsingham certainly experienced dreadful fright although thank god reason be a unimpaired a ever be still can not say that sudden shock might not have produced strange effect may probably account for otherwise inexplicable whimsicalityfor can denominate nothing else oh thank dear sir ralph for explanation cried lord ellingham in joy of reviving hope yesi see niece experienced shock have produced specie of idiosyncratic effect upon constant kindnessthe unwearied attention of one who love whom love in return will restore mind to vigorous healthy condition to morrow will visit againoh how unkindhow ungenerous of to remain away so long there be pause during arthur gave way to bright allurement of pleasing vision now conjured up to imagination at length sir ralph felt silence to be irksome awkward ventured to break be talking just now lord said of famous highwayman known a black mask disappeared from hampshire very suddenly old woman declared that time being out be carried off by devil who have protected against device snare imagined by authority to capture perhaps highwayman who robbed lady other day observed lord ellingham may be very one who rendered so notorious in hampshire few year ago lordship judge by fact that scoundrel who stopped niece near hounslow wore black mask said baronet generality of robber on high road adopt that mode of disguise thank heaven public depredators of kind be becoming very scarce in

jewel be doubtless same who have conveyed to pall letter so mysteriously urged to hasten to police court give testimony in esther defencehe began to share mr gordon belief that there must be connexion between florid light haired man miss de medina at same time lord ellingham be convinced that esther have not stolen diamond that if have mr gordon have mistaken hour of day if not day on such theft be committed because arthur remembered beyond possibility of error that from two o'clock on afternoon until near eleven o'clock at night on day specified by diamond merchant esther be engaged in visiting

determined to walk a far a residence of mr de medina in great ormond street on arrival at gentleman house found servant standing at front door in act of receiving article from tradesman boy trivial fact be only recorded inasmuch a explains reason how lord ellingham ascended to drawing room without being duly announced considered to be on term of sufficient intimacy with mr de medina to take

yourselfdiscard for everthomas rainford swear said esther in tone led earl to imagine that took proscribed oath with dreadful shudder now rise exclaimed mr de medina be over word suddenly awoke earl to consciousness of position face became scarlet a thought flashed upon mind that have be playing part of eaves dropper despised for having listened to dialogue between mr de medina daughter attention have be so completely rivetted to strangemysteriousand exciting conversation that have unwittingly remained hearer invisible spell have nailed a be to spothad forced to linger drink in discourse ala appeared to speak so eloquently to discredit of whose character have so warmly defended two hour before now suddenly awakingas saidto sense of position perceived that subterfuge must alone save from imputation of being eaves dropper to subterfuge be really noble minded peer compelled to stoop hastily stepping to drawing room door opened closed again with unusual violence so that sound might fall upon ear of mr de medina esther induce to believe that have only just entered room stratagem succeeded for mr de medina immediately made appearance from inner apartment welcomed earl with wonted calmness of manner in reply to arthur polite inquiry relative to miss de medina father replied that daughter be somewhat indisposed hoped earl must excuse absence quarter of hour passed in conversation of particular interest to reader lord ellingham then took leave when found once more in open street must scarcely believe that be not sport of wild delusive dream have heard aright have ear beguiled be true that reproach have be levelled by angry father at head of daughter who did not attempt to deny guilt who be compelled to implore outraged parent forgiveness have not prescribed to oath seemed to imply in plain termsalthough earl have caught detached portionsthat esther have be seducedrobbed of purityand that villain be one thomas rainford have not that oath be administered for purpose of binding to break off connexion with thomas rainford did not mr de medina assure though world might not suspect yet have not le brought degradation on in finedid not angry father threaten to

artful hypocrite esther de medina georgiana conceals not tainted soul beneath chaste exterior be purity in mind a well a in appearance after esther did steal diamond father upbraided with theft even alluded to ring sold to mr gordon yesit be indeed too apparent be utterly depraved that name of thomas rainfordsurely have heard before earl strove to recollect oh remember now thought at expiration of few moment be thomas rainford who be accused of robbing georgiana on highway how strange be coincidence yet be not that man who plundered herfor proved innocence of at least imputation be doubtless rainford who sent letter desiring to appear in defence of esther must also have be who restored diamond to merchant that esther stole diamond be clearfor father accused of at least such be inference must be drawn from word that gordon be wrong a to day hour of day on theft be committed be also clear inasmuch a esther be at finchley at time stated still gordon be so positiveand when appeared to prosecute jewess at police office so short time have elapsedonly few hour indeedsince act be perpetrated that be difficult to believe how must have mistaken date there be mystery yet attending on affairbut that elucidation must establish innocence can not for moment be believed such be train of thought into earl of ellingham be naturally led by dialogue have overheard between jew daughter be sincerely grieved to be forced to come to conviction that esther de medina be lost ruined girl instead of pure artless being have previously believed to be although affection be undividedly georgiana yet have entertained sentiment of friendship for jewess be pained shocked to think that have ever experienced interesteven slightestin female so utterly unworthy notice for father still felt respect be also now blended with profound commiseration for beheld in honest honourable man who be cursed with daughter characterised by bad passion evil propensity earl be well aware that mr de medina be very rich man must not therefore suppose that necessity have induced esther to dispose of ring to steal jewel what then must conclude that required fund to support worthless abandoned lost manher paramour hence sale of ringhence theft of diamond arthur now remembered promise to mr gordon to make acquainted with particular might discover relative to business how must fulfil pledge shrank from contemplation of circumstance have made acquainted with guilt felt annoyed vexed with for having allowed curiosity so far to dominate honourable principle a to render eaves dropper must not therefore

of old deathfor incident have followed other in such rapid whirlwind like succession be so hostile to interest that felt a if be victim of hideous nightmare composed of most frightful image that

drop friend tidmarsh hint that may come presently release by arrangement will get a long start of a require there be one here at length replied old death aroused from torpor by word thus addressed to then good bye said tom taking up candle quitted room heedless of prisoner intercession to be released from captivity on gaining bed chamber situate above spiral staircase leading to subterranean passage highwayman remembered two circumstance made pause ere raised trap door in first place recalled to mind anxiety of old death to prevent from securing candle at moment when be about to emerge from secret avenue struck rainford that old man have intended to have extinguished light a if by accidentbut whether for motif of treachery merely to avoid discovery of something that fence wished to be concealed tom be at loss to conjecture secondly rainford remembered that old death have manifested considerable uneasiness when have approached first of two door opening from bed chamber now thought probable that fence have be desirous of extinguishing light in order to prevent rainford from observing that there be two door in room at event said tom to let see where other door lead to be unlockedas have expected to find because have be otherwise old death must not have manifested so much anxiety when have approached on entrance into bed chamber proceeding with cautionso a not to incur risk of having light extinguished equally to avoid sudden surprise in case house might really have other occupant besides old deathrainford entered spacious room seemed to be fitted up a chemical

intrepiddauntlessbold a tom rain be nevertheless experienced cold shuddering a surveyed object ranged upon long shelf for thought forced upon himi wonder whether cast of head will ever be there in order to chase gloomy reflection from mind rainford turned away from contemplation of shelf sinister content cupboard door stood partially open in one corner of room hastened to inspect recess what pen can depict language can describe astonishment when upon shelf within cupboard beheld four human head staring out at with eye wide open perfectly motionless on pupil of ray of candle flashed with extraordinary brilliancy for instant highwayman felt afraidin what description of place be what meant ghastly spectacle conquering terror of indeed in moment be ashamed approached nearer idea struck that beheld admirable model in wax still flesh be so closely resembling that of deadthe appearance of countenance of crown of head be closely shaven be so natural that extended hand touched cheek of one of appalling object great god be indeed human fleshicy cold producing sensation touch of naught beside can produce in spite of rainford cast shuddering glance around then once more ashamed of weakness resumed inspection of head be evidently prepared for preservation for odour of strong spice emanated from eye fitted into socket be of glass hence strange brilliancy produced by reflection of candle highwayman be still absorbed in contemplation of frightful object when door at farther end of room slowly opened man enveloped in loose dressing gown holding lamp in hand appeared on threshold instant beheld rainford uttered ejaculation of surprise alarmhastily retreatedand barred bolted door behind have however be long enough in room for rainford to obtain full view of countenance be with profound astonishment that highwayman have recognised dr lascelles what thought that respectable physician in league with old death stood for moment gazing vacantly at door by doctor have entered also so abruptly disappeared again then suddenly struck that physician might discover state of bondage in benjamin bone have be left not only must immediate release of old fence follow active pursuit be probably instituted by individual after accordingly determined to beat retreat a speedily a possible not that be afraid of encountering old death doctor knew not what principle of danger establishment possessed might be turned against have seen quite enough of house in turnmill street of where now be in red lion street to be well aware that be ordinary place of abode be also sufficiently well acquainted with character of old death to feel conscious that mercy be to be expected at hand must fall completely into power be therefore disparagement to heroism of highwayman to state that be now anxious to effect exit from strange place wherein found naturally struck that there must be more speedy convenient avenue of egress than subterranean readily comprehended that underground passage be used a medium of transferring good from house in turnmill street to store room of establishment in red lion street that might also serve at pinch of need a avenue of escape for old death from own bed room that subterranean be only mean of ingres egress in respect to house in red lion street tom must not for instant suppose a dwelling without door with door be never opened must soon become object of suspicion in neighbourhood judging by direction of subterranean passage highwayman be enabled to conclude that room in now found be at back of house that one where have left old death be in front a be also that into dr lascelles have retreated be moreover convinced that apartment be on first upper storey decidedly not on ground floor now a laboratory old death bed chamber larger store room formed suite at back of house there be flight of stair connecting with ground floor be clear to rainford that mean of communication with ground floor must be from front part of house into room looking on street did not choose to penetrate because might there encounter doctor old death therefore came to conclusion that must escape by back part of house else dare subterranean calculation have occupied time to record be made summed up in few moment by tom rain did now hesitate what course to adopt placing candle upon table hastened to throw up window to annoyance found securely barredand hand assured that bar must not be removed by mere physical strength have not time implement to attempt to force way through difficulty only alternative appeared to be subterranean resuming possession of candle returned into old death bed roomdrew away carpetraised trap doorand commenced descent of spiral staircase closing trap after bolting inside scarcely have proceeded ten step downwards when foot suddenly slipped in attempt made to recover light went out at same instant heard heavy step treading upon trap door overhead then hum of voicesbut whose must not distinguishin room have just left now tom rain look alive old fellow murmured in self encouraging apostrophe with resolute step hastened rapidly down spiral staircase amidst darkness so intense that be felt chapter xxxii rainford in subterranean tom rain reached bottom of stair in perfect safety a have carefully noted geography of subterranean when traversed hour previously with old death experienced little difficulty in threading path along even amidst black darkness through literally seemed to be pushing way in few minute progress be stopped by wall extended arm encountered now knew that have reached extremity communicating with house in turnmill street having succeeded in grasping wire passing through top of vault be connected with mechanism of clock overhead pulled vigorously machinery moved not then for first time during eventful night highwayman became appalled at danger on have entered again tugged at wire snapped short close by roof long piece thus broken off fell at foot damnation cried rainford stamped impatiently on cold damp stone suddenly struck that there might be one wire to move clock over opening at head of iron ladder wire to move away from that opening accordingly began to feel with hand for second wire existence of be suggested by imagination at end of minute be compelled to admit to that did indeed exist only in imagination such second wire be to be found then hastily ascended ladder endeavoured to hurl clock from off opening covered huge machine be a solidly fixed there a if have formed portion of vaulted roof escape seemed to grow moment more hopeless now came appalling thought old death doctor must soon have have sufficient time to repair from house in red lion street to in turnmill street thus secure against avenue covered by clockeven if be not sufficiently secure already what be to do again again tried to force away heavy clock there stood immoveableand when paused to reflect steady monotonous ticking fell ominously upon ear at length struck that must retrace way to other extremityforce up trap door leading to old death bed chamberand with pistol in hand dare thing what if trap door be secured on other side nohe remembered to have observed that there be not bolt bar to break level of upper surface a fitted in flush with floor encouraged by scintillation of hope that thus gleamed in upon rainford hurried back to other end of subterraneanascended spiral staircasegrasped pistolsand listened attentively be still in room abovenot murmur of voicenor creaking of footstep then slowly carefully drew back bolt of trap door tried to raise moved not applied additional force under impression that heavy piece of furniture might have be dragged over trap still be a motionless a thick solid substantial flooring in be set rainford returned pistol to pocket so that nothing might impede application of strength to task on liberty depended nothe door moved not highwayman bit under lip almost till blood started forthfor felt that calmness be abandoning then how bitterly did repent course have adopted after interruption in laboratory by appearance of doctor lascelles instead of trusting to hideous subterranean must have essayed escape by mean of front room of house regret be however uselesshe must actand not waste time in self reproach yes must actif must not die in dreadful place where vindictiveness of old death must be sure to leave to actoh how easy to think of actingbut how be to put thought into execution stone pavement beneathstone wall on sidea stone ceiling overheadat one end avenue closed by huge clockat other trap door evidently secured on outsidethese be obstaclesthese be barrier against have to contend be implement within power two handsa clasp knifeand pair of pistol quick a lightning idea flashed across that iron ladder at other extremity of subterranean be moveable that must serve a battering ram rejoiced at thought once more retraced way along vaulted passage eagerly grasped ladder conjecture be right merely hooked on to two iron ring fixed into masonry just below aperture covered by clock heavy though be yet rainford now bore a easily a if be of woodfor renewed hope have rendered strong bold a lion be however somewhat difficult to drag iron ladder up spiral staircase in few minute portion of task be accomplished rainford now prepared to assault secret entrance to old death dwelling placing in position that might deal vigorous blow upwards with ponderous engine then be able to seize pistol instant might be required went to work with stout arm still stouter heart oncetwicethriceand up ladderthat single blow be sufficientand trap door burst from setting quick a thought rainford seized pistol thrusting up trap ascended last few step of spiral staircase throwing back carpet have be replaced over trap door found to infinite surprise that there be resistance to egress from subterranean where at one time seemed probable that be destined to find tomb gazing rapidly around room perceived old death doctornor indeed single living soul recovering wonted calmness proceeded to examine trap door for purpose of ascertaining how have be secured against on close inspection observed spring bolt let into side of trap door in such way when trap be closed neither appeared above below bolt be either held back within wood made to fly into hole made to receive in beam against trap door closed by mean of two screw must easily be pressed inwards force of rainford battering ram have unsettled artfully contrived piece of mechanism be clear that one have secured trap door because even if spring bolt have flown into socket by accident still carpet must not have spread out of own accord moreover when rainford have retreated to subterranean have heard footstep voice in old death room therefore struck that who have so secured trap door have departed to protect avenue of escape in turnmill street in confidence that said trap door be too strong to be forced nevertheless be necessary to guard against possibility of ambuscade tom held pistol in manner calculated to render instantaneously available determined to proceed by way of laboratory on trying door found locked without instant hesitation forced open with one vigorously applied blow of foot here again encountered resistance passing through laboratory tried door by have seen dr lascelles appear disappear again so abruptly time be spared necessity of violent exertionfor door be not locked now entered passage leading to flight of stair down hastened reached kind of hall from whence street door

manner towards than rest did must take away bread from whenever caught eating apart alone laid to many theft on mother maggs cupboard committed false report got many many good beating from enraged hag in word boy tyranny became so insufferable that be resolved to adopt desperate measure to put end to be then little more than six year old fiendish instinct of revenge however urged to act secreted pin about rag one day when tib tucker be trying to take away morsel of mouldy bread mother maggs have just given suddenly thrust pin into right eye screamed in dreadful agony brought down mother maggs into court have not run awayterror rather horror at what have done nailed to spot bully tale be soon told expected to be half murdered by dreadful woman to surprise suddenly took partdeclared that have shown proper spiritand consoled tib tucker with assurance that if must only permit to operate on other eye in same manner must prove perfect fortune to parent 'there be nothing like blind child to draw alms said 'but one eye goodyou must be blind of remember word a well a if have only be uttered yesterday more so a seemed to be propheticas will explain presently terrible vengeance have taken upon persecutor who lost eye in consequence not only awed in future made feared by rest existence grew somewhat le wretchedat least in reference to treatment experienced from companion mother maggs also seemed to change towards through fear admiration at what termed bey spirit ' can not say be le bullied by herbut not whit better fed about six week after incident have related parent of tib tucker returned to london from country where have be harvesting passed evening with mother maggs great quantity of gin be sent for from public house afterwards learnt from companion for a to myself kept out of way through fear of being punished by boy parent for vengeance have wreaked upon when be quite dark returned to house stole up to miserable garret where companion be already huddled together on straw old sack tib tucker be amongst for heard talking about promise parent have made to take with into country where be going again in few day one of eldest girlsfor forgot to say mother maggs juvenile boarder be of sexesasked what parent have said about accident replied that have laughed at have declared that must turn to good account scarcely have thus spoken when door opened maggs appeared with candle in hand ordering tib tucker to get up follow added that father mother have little treat in store for have meant all along to sit up to supper tib be overjoyed at news made haste to accompany mother maggs to lower room where have left parent in miserable dark garret envied boy who have good supper in view rememberoh well do remember how cried night to think that friend ever came to see that indeed be ignorant whether parent be alive not have often asked mother maggs whether knew father mother invariably received cuff by way of replyand therefore at length grew tired of putting question there be however time when wretchedforlornabandoned condition almost broke heart for young a be knew that there be boy girl in world much better off than while tib tucker be absent other child began to discourse amongst saying how lucky be to come in for good supper then set to work to guess what meal be likely to consist of on sudden dreadful shriek echoed through house startled in miserable garret there laycrouching huddling nearer to other holding breath not daring to utter word filled with vague alarm a if dreadful danger hung over at length sleep came to relief when awoke in morning ran down into court first object that met view be wretched boy tib tucker being led away by parentsfor be now blind of eye be so frightened that ran into street where wandered about dayforgetting even pang of hunger have suddenly conceived dreadful terror of mother maggs have not dared to present at room door to obtain usual morsel of bread along with rest be very rainy day yet remember that roved roved about whole neighbourhood at one time cry bitterlyat stupified though still moving about like sleep walker when evening came on be so tired hungry be forced to retrace way to horrible den only discovered again with greatest difficulty mother maggs did not take notice of absence from morning distribution of bread gave evening ration along with rest once more did return to straw filth of close garret month year passedand reached age of nine last few month opened eye to more wickedness than have a yet known dreamt of just now told that mr maggs juvenile boarder consisted of boy girl believe understood that huddled together in same garret be regular pig sty in wallowed like swine like of brute also be conduct of eldest boy girl if other room in house be used a brothel by grown up person stew must be more atrocious than garret girl be more precocious than boy latter be corrupted by former mere child of nine ten practised vice of elder god let draw veil over dreadful scene oh siri have seen muchgone through much mere thought of horrible licentiousnessthe beastlinessthe monstrous depravity took place there even now make blood run cold in vein can wonder that such must be case not one of child have ever be taught what virtue be that knew of crime be that be something constable took up for have not least notion of saviournone of have ever heard that son of god died for sin of world have once seen bible because stole one from book stall eldest girl who went to sell gathered from what be said by person who bought that be bible even if have

familiar to even when must only lisp knew not who god be have one to tell useven if have wished to learn may think strange that there must be child of even ten year old in london who be completely ignorant of thing concerning religion can assure have met with youth girl of fifteen sixteen who be equally in dark in respect be nine year old when mother maggs one day fetched out of street where be playing in gutter with companion took into own room where saw mr bone for first timei mean first time a far a recollection be concerned looked at long time then turning to old woman said think have

on sunday have jacob dear'and a asked question gave terrific frown unseen by old death meaning of well understood so muttered 'yes seemed satisfied'but be going to take away same mr maggs ' said mr

only because new frock be in suds a for shoe stocking make boy hardy to go without ' remember that old death made answer to observation because portion of dialogue have just detailed produced so deep impression on mindyoung a wasthat have be continued must most probably have recollected rest can not forgetthat when old death told to follow mother maggs took in arm to embrace at parting screamed

more welcome than be article not that required themfor foot be inured to nakedness to walk even on pointed flintsbut experienced indescribable sensation of mingled pride satisfaction made supremely happy joy be however somewhat rudely interrupted by hard blow on head old death bestowed upon because dared to laugh in fulness of poor heart then burst into tear cursed for benivelling fool ' ordered to put on cap have also bought make haste to accompany cap be article of clothing till then quite strange to once more tear be succeeded by smile at length purchase be complete followed old death from shop walked a if be tipsy cap seemed to be quite weight on head shoe threatened moment to trip up have never worn skatesbut can fancy how person must feel when put on for first time imagine that awkwardness in stocking shoe be something of same kind near point where upper whitecross street join old street road beheld late companion huddled together at mouth of passage belonging to pawnbroker shop did not know till called of by name then must not believe eye must have seemed kind of prince to instantly overwhelmed with questionsbut old death looked back called in cross tone hurried away

said to be nevertheless impressed with conviction that have right to do what chose with be bound to obey remained time at public houseindeed if remember right until be dusk because old death have great deal to say to a be so very young so miserably ignorant be not easy matter for to make understand meaning there can be doubt that laboured to convince of right certain privileged person have to

in availing of opportunity moral have not be so carefully attended to a to excite repulsive feeling at specie of reasoning on contrary having from infancy practised art of pilfering pudding from cook

of common sewer sewer be not at time formed in village surrounding metropolis thirdly must scarcely believe that who have arrested in london must have run risk of removing out of precinctsfor be well aware that atrocious outrage diabolical crime may be perpetrated with greater chance of impunity in metropolis than elsewhere although be thus tolerably well convinced that prison house be within

for now possessed proof to convince secretary of state that in allowing law to take course individual rightly entitled to earldom must suffer death arthur be well aware of influence argument must have in supporting appeal for commutation of sentence thy generous act in giving up paper thou mightest have used to save thy life thought within apostrophising doomed half brother will not be thrown away on ingratitude to thee be impossiblethen turning to jacob said aloud be much mistaken boy if paper have placed in hand will not effect great object that have in view oh lord exclaimed jacob with most

spasmodic quivering then in few second be suddenly raised with eagerness impatience hand sought throat with convulsive motion that hand kept grasping throat a if to tear away something oppressed itas

alternative of sinister dubious import have ear for anything save blessed wordshe will be saved be literally wild with joy lascelles without desisting from occupation of applying electric fluid apparently without noticing excitementthe delirium of happiness hope have seized upon two companion began leisurely to explain how be necessary to adopt mean to equalise reviving circulation though called for hartshorn be not heard at length stamped foot violently on floor exclaiming will of give hartshorn do wish to die through neglect earl instantly checked exuberance of joyous emotion hastened to obey instruction physician gave hartshorn be applied to rainford nostril in few moment lip began to quiverthen on sudden a lascelles let fall upon stronger current of electric fluid terrific cry burst from object of intensely concentrated interest never be cry of human agony more welcome to mortal ear than now for told who heard that life be in who gave vent to physician felt highwayman pulse beat feeblyvery feeblybut still beat now limb moved with incessant tremblingand waved right hand backwards forward breast heaving with repeated sigh gasp painful moan doctor applied small mirror to rainford mouth nostril be instantly covered with cloud now opened eye slowly be much blood shotbut pupil indicated reviving fire of vitality breathing rapidly grew more regular though retained eye open yet seemed unconscious of be passing around gazed upwards with most death like indifference lord ellingham cast glance of frightful apprehension towards physician countenance of dr lascelles wore expression of calm complacent satisfactionand earl be reassured twenty minute have now passed since galvanic operation have commenced at last dr lascelles said emphatically be saved earl embraced a if be father who have just manifested extraordinary proof of paternal love who have forgiven deep offence on part of son must put to bed immediately said physician with difficulty extricating from nobleman embrace fearing lest must be compelled to undergo similarly affectionate process at hand of jacob smith who be equally enthusiastic in joywe must put to bed immediately repeated dr lascelles fortunately for there be bed chamber in house three then carefully lifted tom rain into small room furnished a bed chamber where undressed deposited in bed now said jacob smith must remember that there be one who will feel a much joy a ourselves true cried earl where doe live be acquainted with abode returned lad if lordship will allow yes good boy interrupted arthur be for to convey joyous tidings perhaps may have returned home to fatherfor after have occurred considering mr de medina affection for daughterbut while be talking enigmatically in presence of excellent friend doctor from whom there must be secret never mind said lascelles laconically who perfectly well comprehended nature of allusion care little for secret even if be otherwise be too much occupied with patient here then will not trouble with explanation at present interrupted earl jacob lad hasten to lady of whom speakbreak happy tidings to gentlyand bring hither yes lord answered lad delighted at being chosen a messenger of good tidings in such case fortunately miss de medina moved from brandon street into heart of city by mr rainford positive direction will not be long before come back with earl put gold into hand jacob returned declaring that be not without money in minute front door of house closed behind chapter lv laboratoryesther de medina when jacob have taken departure dr lascelles returned to laboratory mixed liquid ingredient in glass returning to bed chamber poured medicine down rainford throat then felt pulse applied ear to chest to listen to pulsation of heart carefully examined eye be far le blood shot than when opened first be getting on admirably said physician pulsation be regular too quick too slowbut just a must wish seems inclined to sleepyeshe close eye will awake to perfect consciousnessbut do know dear friend that in order to oblige have incurred awful risk continued doctor law must not believe be to declare that be in interest of science made galvanic experiment that having succeeded in recalling man to life be not capable of delivering up to justice let hope that there will be necessity to make such excuse at said earl have rendered immense service doctor then be satisfied interrupted lascelles for after told last night can not help liking half brother here be generous hearted fellow one must risk much to save man from death have frequently mentioned to galvanic experiment said earl last night when nearly driven to desperation by absence of home secretary reminiscence of wonder have at different time related to in respect to galvanism flashed to mindand sent for a drowning man cling to straw in adjoining room observed physician have tried influence of galvanism upon thousand of animal on several men have paid high price to obtain body of convict a soon a be cut downbut never until day did succeed in restoring vital spark must experiment have be successful have not adopted precaution suggested tube in throat to allow respirationand jacob smith in hearse to remove suffocating night cap from rainford head tube from throat then to apply hartshorn to nostril temple step with again into laboratory have not yet have time to examine curiosity added physician with smile rainford sleep continued glancing towards bed will have little leisure to inspect laboratory accordingly proceeded into adjacent room where lascelles directed companion attention to various galvanic electrical apparatus be also devoted disciple of gall spurzheim observed physician when have expatiated upon discovery of galvani behold that row of plaster of paris cast of head continued pointing to shelf whereon upwards of fifty of object mentioned be ranged have afforded much scope for curious speculation profound study observe that have cast of head of several celebrated criminal amongst said earl arthur thistlewooddaniel hoggartgeorge barringtonhenry fauntleroyjohn thurtellwilliam probert many others a perceive dear earl interrupted lascelles prejudice be a yet so strong amongst people in respect to phrenology craniology that be difficult to obtain cast of living head be therefore forced to make friend with turnkey in gaol with relation of criminal who be hung who die in prison to get cast moreover head of men who have led remarkable life who have suffered for crime afford such interesting subject for study comparison illustration comparison between head of man monkey said earl with smile decidedly exclaimed physician will not bore with theory speculation on subject may however suppose that be not little enthusiastic in matter since have taken trouble to have human head prepared articulated to facilitate study thus speaking opened door of cupboard earl started backfor four human countenance met astonished horrified gaze four pair of human eye seemed to glare ominously upon at same time nostril be assailed with strong odour of spice need not be afraid of ejaculated physician laughing will not speak to howwhence did obtain suppose think murdered four men for sake of head cried lascelles laughing more heartily still why dear earl must be surprised perhaps to learn often pas whole night in laboratory making galvanic experiment pursuing phrenological craniological research head be obtained from hospital embalmed prepared a now see be not aware that possessed laboratory observed earl until stated fact last night must ever have known have not be for desire expressed that science must exert to rescue half brother from grasp of death answered physician truth be have have laboratory upwards of seventeen eighteen year be always devoted to science especially that on own profession be based spirit of anatomical inquiry made anxious to obtain a many subjectsor in plain term dead bodiesas possible be therefore thrown into perpetual intercourse with resurrection men who of course be not best of character be afraid of having corps brought to own house in grafton street be also desirous to fit up for laboratory in retired neighbourhood where must pursue study without least fear of interruption on such occasion when humour might seize hinted a much to one of rascal who sold subject put in communication with man of name of tidmarsh after haggling hesitation on part of tidmarshand when have consulted pretended to consult principalhe introduced to house hired room at enormous rental did not however care about high rate demanded of for use of place because be not only in most retired neighbourhood there be also private subterranean mean of egress ingres from street be useful know for one who have to deal with resurrectionists be only tenant of house inquired earl for presume that bed chamber in poor thomas lie be not own old man occasionally visit house now then sleep in room returned physician have only seen once twice even know name have own key for front door be acquainted with secret of subterranean passage never hold communication with tidmarsh beyond paying rent when be dueand when happen to meet old man have alluded to merely exchange word pas on have room in house have mine a doe not interfere with never trouble about concern then for aught know doctor said earl may occupy apartment in house of bad character what do care exclaimed lascelles must not well have such laboratory a at own residencemy servant must talk about human head plaster cast galvanic experiment must be looked upon a sorcerer at event with so much suspicion aversion a to lose practice by bye dear earl must be very last added doctor with smile to hint at possibility of house being connected with bad character for have not laboratory in so quiet streeta street too where question be ever asked observation madeyour poor brother might have waited long enough for chance of resuscitation by galvanic mean true dear doctori be unjust said earl will forgive say more about arthur be men of scientific research to be over particular might a well abandon study at once experiment have made on corps in room must scarcely have be performed at own residence to tell very candidly believe that old man who have other apartment on floor be miser roguebut care nothing about affair now will mention to one very extraordinary circumstance must have be a near a can guess five week ago be one night pursuing galvanic experiment in roomi have be operating on diver rabbit frog ratsand may be for anything recollect few catswhen be compelled to go down stair for particular purpose on return a came back by door continued pointing to one at farther end of room lead to staircase be startlednay positively astounded at seeing man standing near cupboard gazing fixedly on human head confess be alarmed at moment because have heard voice in house during half hour previously remember rushed back instinctively barred bolted door man turned round before have time to close doorand caught glimpse of face that mannow who do think be be impossible to guess doctor said earl be half brother who now lie in adjoining room added lascelles thomashere cried arthur profoundly surprised must not possibly make mistake because have seen beforeno matter how whereand knew immediately continued physician well must confess be uncertain how to act did not wish to recognise mealthough perhaps have already done so must not very well leave house return to grafton street at once because have on dressing gown have left coat in room be half way down stair leading to hall when heard one opening front door with key knowing that must be old man have before mentioned tidmarsh a alone besides have key of front door waited till person came in be tidmarsh immediately told what have seen'ah ' said ' suspected there be something wrong that made get up dress come round'his word astonished requested explanation seemed sorry that have uttered inadvertently gave evasive reply however accompanied up stair entered laboratory one be there went into next roomthe one where rainford be now sleepingand there found carpet moved away from trap door trap door exclaimed earl yesa trap door lead to subterranean passage have mentioned to added lascelles must remember that have told about house be in strictest confidence well found carpet moved away from trap door though trap be closed old tidmarsh instantly fastened trap with secret spring there be to spread carpet over floor again'but doe know mean of getting out at other end inquired shocked at thought of rainford being immured in subterranean'do think must venture down there if be not acquainted with secret of place demanded tidmarsh struck a being consistent with common sense moreover began to fancy tidmarsh rainford must be connected togetherpardon dear earl for saying so that suspicion be encouraged in mind by singular mysteriously significant observation that tidmarsh have dropped when met on stair so felt farther uneasiness took departure for grafton street tidmarsh quitted house with left at corner of

adopting plan to prevent disagreeable consequence occurring in respect to esther de medina on account of attempted suicide on part of tamar for rainford naturally reflected that a physician be constantly moving in society must necessarily have immense circle of acquaintance be more than probable that might sooner later encounter esther whom must mistake for sisterhis real patient hence solemn promise rainford exacted from lascellesthat when once professional visit have ceased in south moulton street must forget that have ever beholden tamar must ever meet alone in company must not even appear to recognise hermuch le attempt to speak to herunless formally introduced when must consider acquaintance with to be commenced only from moment of such introduction on ensuing morning at

few minute previous to mr gordon arrival when diamond merchant mentioned particular of visit have received from light haired gentleman esther instantly comprehended that individual alluded to must be rainford for though have never seen to knowledge yet have heard few detail relative to personal appearance three year previously at liverpool mr gordon acquainted with restoration of diamond

again met younger sister breathed most tender expression of forgiveness in ear of whom though so guilty loved so tenderly on following evening met for third time then esther used power of persuasion to induce tamar to accompany hometo throw at foot of father implore forgiveness tamar answered in firm tone while tear nevertheless streamed down countenanceit be impossible esther rainford love so

occasion negative trembled upon tonguebut dared not utter recognised be generous noble in disposition of esther felt proud of a daughterthe only daughter whom considered to posse when in solitude of study reflected maturely upon interview be taking place between sister if not at once checked must naturally become more frequent mind be impressed with idea that tamar be utterly irredeemably profligateabandoned in character beyond hope feared lest esther must be corrupted by conversation therefore resolved painful a duty be to put end to meeting yet mitigate severity of blow by winking a be at continuation of epistolary correspondencebut still with firm intention of crushing indulgence also at very early period knew that oral communication be far more dangerous than written

attached believed engaged to be married to lady hatfield sighed involuntarilyscarcely comprehending whereforewhen thought thereon still loved himwhile believed in innocence of own heart that merely felt interested in a friend did imagination define true distinction between feeling actually experienced that only conceived to animate herno not even when glowing description of love sister have drawn on one occasion of meeting presented to mind must yet more easily understand how be possible for tamar to love rainford so devotedly a did hence acute anguish that esther experienced on account of sister when read arrest of highwayman mr de medina did not of course remain ignorant of occurrence made not slightest allusion to in presence of did put into force previously contemplated plan of

learnt that union be impossible arthursince have ceased to look upon otherwise than a sisterit be probablenay be natural certain that can not have beheld esther de medina with indifference georgiana exclaimed arthur in solemn tone never can forget that first love be devoted to andalthough circumstance have ala prevented unionyet must be unwilling to promise to that heart so freelyso gladly gave to be alike unjust ridiculous for to suppose that a can not become wife arthur may never marry continued lady hatfield must despise be to entertain such abhorrent selfishness ardent desire be to know that be happy esther de medina be well qualified to ensure felicity nayinterrupt not remember be now sister who counsel brother granting even that must never love a have loved meand be supposition

make happy oh believe such state of bliss must soon beget love in hearta love for esther a ardent sincere a with honoured for be mere idle theory of romance writer that same heart can not love twice nature proclaims falsehood of doctrine experience of wise legislator whether secular ecclesiastic declares same by mere fact of allowing second marriage believe arthur be speaking solely in regard to happiness day will come when lip breathe word thank thee for counsel thou gavest ' earl surveyed with respectful admiration that noble hearted woman who thus stifled own feeling through generous solicitude for felicity now resumed after moment pause can divine reason induced to express wish that introduction to medina must be postponed for present be weak womanand though can proudly say that petty feeling of jealousy must ever enter heartyet must rather not awaken in mind painful recollection of what might have be by beholding in society of one to whom must be engaged moreover a miss de medina have doubtless heard that union be once resolved upon added lady hatfield now unable to suppress profound sigh must not be agreeable for to visit if accept a husband until after marriage be motif arthur now will admit that so far from entertaining illiberal prejudice against jew have proved very contrary by earnestly recommending to espouse amiable beautiful lady belonging to nation illustration dearest sisterfor such indeed be to said earl of ellingham appreciate excellence of intention in thus advising will frankly admit to that did now think of uniting fate with woman esther de medina must be object of choice since alliance with have be rendered impossible be not quite prepared to take stepnor do even know whether miss de medina must accept suit be to proffer if affection be not engaged before saw youbefore knew so much of exclaimed georgiana love now oh of be convinced continued enthusiastically consider how much have done to render grateful to gratitude in woman be parent of affection have saved beloved sister tamar from depth of despair by adopting wondrous scheme by who be now husband be snatched from jaw of deathyou reconciled father to long discarded daughterand have at length seen that daughter made wifethe wife of man adores oh arthur think not that esther ponders on yesand in gratitude of generous soul already see god like being in earl of ellingham will render quite vain georgiana said young nobleman for be magnifying into glorious achievement few very common place act on part be giving due for be great noble in dispositionall be excellent estimable in character replied lady hatfield in tone of fervent sincerity that be thing describe be so much more to credit inasmuch a belong to class not famous for good quality aristocratic

vicious sphere possessing glorious exception such a world must be more ready to recognise merit will say no more on head dear arthur added georgiana with smile for fear that must think wish to coax into following that counsel ere now so seriously so conscientiously gave on advice will reflect deliberately replied earl who must not conceal from that be rejoiced have be given now georgiana must take leave of for present added rising from seat for have commission of somewhat important nature to execute for half brother indeed mention thereof reminds have never made acquainted with one of best trait in character doe annoy youdoes vex to hear speak of nono answered georgiana somewhat hurriedly since have known that be brother have be pleased to hear say a much good of a possible incident to

woman died suddenly through want exposure to inclemency of weather at obscure house in seven dial rainford happened to be there at time took compassion on little boy whom poor woman have in charge boy be not woman childas certain letter found upon person of female proved letter be at first detained by miserable wretch who so persecuted poor brother subsequently fell into hand entrusted to mr

namebut god be illand earl rushed forward to catch georgiana in arm a be falling from chair conveyed to sofa for moment seemed insensible be about to summon female attendant when opened eye glanced wildly around then said in excited tone ring for onei will be better in minuteremain with arthuri have now much to tell surprised grieved at effect word have produced on lady hatfieldyet unable to comprehend wherefore mere mention of name must have so seriously touched feelingsthe earl gazed upon with interest curiosity at length faint tinge of red appeared upon cheek with reviving strength sate up on sofa motioning young nobleman to take chair near arthur said ought not to have kept that one secret from youfor be not now brother sister ala youwith generous heart fine feelingscan well understand how painful be for to speak of own dishonourand more so since degradationthat deep disgrace be caused by who be nearly allied to what can be possible exclaimed earl sudden light breaking in upon that childthat boy whom rainford have adopted a own be mine said georgiana in voice of despairand covering face with hand burst into agony of tear earl of ellingham started from seat began to pace room in manner denoting most painful excitement be indeed deeply afflicted how wrongedhow profoundly wronged have georgiana beenand by who a have said be so nearly allied to oh tom raintom rain

arthur at length said exercising violent effort to subdue sorrow give not way to bitter reflection on account for sake have be forgiventhough may never be forgotten for memory be immortal that childthat boy of whom speakhe be indeed with own father providence doubtless willed that must be so paused stifled sob rent bosom may think cruel heartless mother arthur resumed at length now speaking in mournful plaintive tone thus to have abandoned offspring reflect ere blame be a be alone in house situated in retired part of countrya man entered at nighthe found way to chamberhe took advantage of lonelinesso god how have survived that disgracethat infamy desperate be resistancebut vain ravisher a already know be rainford ala pardon if then mentioned name with bitterness human patience must not speak calmly when such cloud of crushing reminiscence come back to soul again paused earl remained silent what must say loathedhe abhorred conduct of half brother whom must not attempt to justifyand good sense told that be worse than mockery to aim at consoling victim of foul night of maddened lust atrocious rape week afterwards continued lady hatfield in voice scarcely audible deeply plaintive found be in way to become mother may conceivebut be impossible to imagine state of mind into appalling conviction threw yet be compelled to veil grief a much a possiblefor at time suspicion of condition on part of world must have driven to suicide need noti must not enter into detail of plan have adopted to conceal dishonour suffice to say succeeded in so doingand in small retired village under feigned name did give birth to son to sarah watt be babe confidedand for sum of money paid down at once agreed to adopt a own by accident discovered who wasmy name be on article of jewellery have with promised strictest secrecy put faith in word oh blame if acted a have now describedif abandoned that child whose presence near must only have be proof of dishonour constant memorial of dread outrage levityno encouragementno fault on part have provoked blame georgiana exclaimed earl approaching taking hand kindlyhow must blame acted a prudence dictatedand indeed a circumstance inevitably compelled butnow that parentage of child be at length discoveredhow do wish to act remember georgiana thing in respect will be managed solely with regard to wishessolely according to direction will communicate in letter to half brother secret have thus strangely transpired dayor will leave in ignorance of fact that have adopted own son knew not that outrage perpetrated led to consequence said lady hatfield now cruelly bewildered uncertain how to decide nohe must not even suspect itfor never met again until night on hounslow roadand even then recognised notand be only at police office in bow street again beheld who have be ruin be convinced observed earl rainford have not least suspicion that indeed became mother oh when touched upon subject of atrocious behaviour towards youwhile be in parishad seen tear of contritionheart felt contrition shedbut added earl suddenly interrupting himselfit be impossible that must forgive forgive for sake arthur said georgiana in mild firm tone now relative to childyeshe will know that be with father brother must be informed that have adopted own son providence indeed seems to have so willed for can not believe that accident alone threw child thus wondrously into way of author of being arthur added taking young nobleman handyou will write to rainfordand will tell be not necessary to enjoin to treat child with kindnessfor say that disposition be naturally generous neverthelessi must wish continued lady looking down a uttered word sinking voice almost to whisperfor maternal feeling be stirring within bosomnevertheless must wish that impress upon mind of half brother necessity of bringing child up in path of virtue honour wish will be complied with answered earl fear not that rainford must inculcate evil principle into mind of son nohe be thoroughly changed will become good hope happy prosperous man young nobleman then took leave of lady hatfield whom left prey to emotion of very painful nature for deeply tenderly did love arthur great violence did to feeling when so generously conscientiously counselled to take beautiful jewess a wife a earl returned home to mansion in pall mall to pen letter to rainford who be then on voyage under assumed name accompanied by tamar jacob smith little charley to united stateshe reviewed detail of long interesting conversation have that afternoon passed between lady hatfield himselfand found that tendency thereof be to make ponder more seriously more intently upon image of charming esther than ever yet have done footnote have be

prevent exposure mr slingsby so much dreaded on thus parting with baronet have faithfully promised to call early in morning inform her of particular of interview with mr torrensbut be now past one o'clock in afternoon have not made appearance what must absence meanhad thing disagreeable occurredwas possible that rosamond must have made away with sir henry have taken to flight through dread of exposure consequence suspense mr slingsby endured be horriblehorrible guilty conscience invariably magnify into giant even most dwarf like cause of apprehension there be exception to rule on present occasion hundred time have glanced at elegant molu clock on manteland a hour after hour passed came not restlessness increased to degree that at length reached state of nervous excitement no longer endurable accordingly hurried to chamber dressed in walking attire having left word with servant that in case sir henry courtenay must call be to be requested to wait until return sped to nearest hackney coach stand where stepping into vehicle ordered driver to take over to torrens cottage yesthither be determined to proceed without delay even at risk of encountering rosamond though must scarcely believe that wronged girl have returned home for not precisely remembering detail of conversation took place between herself baronet rosamond have overheard guilty woman imagined that something more than mere allusion might have be made to connivance of mr torrens in ruin of daughter hence mr slingsby very natural supposition that victim of infernal plot have not returned to parental dwelling coach did not proceed with particular celerity distance from west end to torrens cottage be greatmrs slingsby have therefore ample leisure to continue harrowing meditation upon real supposed danger menaced in position be by mean enviable oneunless indeed convict under sentence of death might have preferred state to of imminent ignominious death for circumstance appeared suddenly to combine against be in family wayand be alone sufficient to cause most serious chagrin especially a impious scheme of proclaiming second johanna southcott have be so completely frustrated by determined opposition of paramour then there be affair of rosamond torrens one word from whose lip must have effect of tearing away mask of hypocrisy mr slingsby have so long worn exposing to world in hideous nudity of criminal character lastly unaccountable absence of baronet filled mind with most serious misgiving for knew that if have indeed absconded if must cease to maintain in pecuniary sense position must become lamentable in extreme maddening reflection raised storm of agitation in guilty mind must scarcely subdue excitement so that must escape notice of coachman a opened door of vehicle when stopped opposite torrens cottage mr torrens be at home mr slingsby be immediately conducted by jeffreys to parlourthe very parlour where paramour have be murdered on preceding evening rosamond from bed room window have observed arrival of hateful woman be lost in surprise at conduct in daring to visit father abode mr torrens received mr slingsby in apartment where a have just stated awful tragedy of previous night have be enacted be first time criminal pair have ever met bad a mr torrens be must not help feeling sentiment of extreme loathing disgust for woman who concealed so black heart beneath garb of religious hypocrisyand though endeavoured to speak politely to a desired to be seated manner be cold reserved indicative of influence presence produced upon know other by name mr torrens began mr slingsby be only now that have met can doubtless conjecture object of visit yes madam exclaimed rosamond suddenly bursting into room evidently in state of fearful excitement then hastily closing door added father can too well divine purport of insolent intrusion doubtless seek to recover possession of meto take back to infamous abodeto surrender up to own vile paramour oh dear father surelysurely will not allow polluted creature to remain beneath roof minute longer rosamondrosamond said mr slingsby becoming colour of scarlet will regret harsh word came for purpose of giving certain explanation to respected parent explanation madam cried young girl with bitter smile of contempt what explanation can offer have not already given have reason to believe that overheard conversation between sir henry courtenay said mr slingsby growing bolder a perceived that atrocious complicity of mr torrens be not suspected by daughter conversation seems to have alarmed youfor flight from house be wild precipitate have not already tarried there too long demanded rosamond emphatically oh think not to be able to delude more with specious misrepresentationsyour disgusting sophistry veil have fallen from eyesand now behold madam baronet whom so much vaunted in proper colour be wrong thus to suspect so cruelly said mr slingsby conversation overheard be repetition of conversation sir henry courtenay have overheard between two person whom know not be relating to appeal to father whether belief enough madam exclaimed rosamond in tone convinced base woman that be indeed no longer to be imposed upon father know to be degraded hypocriteand insolence be extreme in thus daring to violate sanctity of paternal dwelling to have be forced to return for shelter refuge be not added bitterly must be proclaiming own dishonour not moment hesitation must manifest in tearing away mask from face exposing to world oh when think of insidious wile have practisedall abhorrent tutoring have brought to play upon mind deploreyes deeply do deplore necessity compels to place seal upon lip mr slingsby have heard enough to satisfy that exposure must take place at hand of rosamond be not very solicitous to prolong visit cause of baronet absence have yet to learn concluded that be not at torrens cottage must seek to have curiosity in respect gratified accordingly rosebowed to mr torrens who have remained mute most alarmed spectator of whole sceneand hastily withdrew just in time to avoid coming in collision with john jeffreys for worthy judging by excited manner in unobserved have seen rosamond rush into parlour that something extraordinary be connected with arrival of mr slingsby have very coolly quietly listened at parlour door to word be uttered within mr slingsby returned home somewhat consoled by conviction that character be safe from vindictiveness on part of rosamond be still alarmed in respect to baronetand fear increased greatly when on arrival in old burlington street at about four o'clock learnt that have not called immediately despatched note to residence domestic returned with answer that sir henry courtenay have not be home since preceding daya circumstance caused small degree of alarm in baronet household inasmuch a though often slept away from abode servant be invariably kept ignorant of proof of irregularity on part in word be accustomed so to arrange matter that nocturnal outgoings be never suspected at own residenceand thus absence on occasion have naturally inspired degree of apprehension mr slingsby be astounded at message servant have brought back must not even hazard conjecture relative to cause of sir henry courtenay disappearance be at loss where to search for therefore resolved to remain at home in hope that must presently call upon time passedand still came not at length there be loud double knock at door fancied be announcement of sir henry arrival instead of object of anxiety mr torrens be ushered into drawing room fancied madam said that have particular reason in calling upon just now presence of unfortunate rosamond prevented from explaining therefore lost time in waiting upon alarm be somewhat appeased by word fell from daughter lip answered mr slingsby motioning to visitor to be seated inasmuch a expressed intention of remaining silent on subject must wish to become matter of public gossip be astonished grieved at behaviour of sir henry courtenay who left last night with intention of proceeding direct to house whom have not since seen came not to madam answered mr torrens with unblushing countenance be most extraordinarymost alarming cried mr slingsby for have not be home nightnor yet to dayand begin to have vague suspicion that something wrong must have occurred sir henry courtenay be gallant man yes interrupted mr slingsby hastily a if subject be not very agreeable one also maintains character for propriety good conductand dependant be never suffered to know that stay away from home at night see that be compelled to be candid with affair be most serious now only reflect for moment mr torrens upon what state of mind must be be questioned relative to sir henry disappearance suppose say that did not soon come backthat continued to be missingit must transpire that be with until late last eveningthat went out togetherfor did go out to search for rosamondand came back alone one must suspect madam of having made away with observed mr torrens nobut must be overwhelmed with most embarrassing question exclaimed mr slingsby hastily do know remark of have inspired with horror alarm one must suspect of having made away with of course nothow must weak woman assassinate man in street of london not leave trace of dreadful deed behind might not

of sir henry courtenay for jeffreys instigated robbery at torrens cottagebenjamin bone appointed two men to execute itand men assassinated baronet illustration have thus become depositor of very agreeable secret dear friend said doctor somewhat ironically how do intend to act for part consider position to be embarrassing for if two men be arrested will perhaps inform against jeffreys old

aware be indeed animated by such vile sentiment moreover in resigning claim to handor rather in recognising impossibility of contracting alliance with woman whom brother have ravishedthe earl have ceased to enjoy right to advise control in respect to moral conductand now struck that painfully situated a wasunable to become wife of honourable confiding manshe have accepted overture must render

not however seated near jew daughter being unacquainted with otherwise than by name a reader be already aware soon after five o'clock earl of ellingham rose from seat advanced towards table proceeded to address house on motion of have given notice illustration began by expressing regret so important subject a proposed for discussionnamely condition of industrious populationshould not have be taken up by noble lord more competent than to do adequate justice declared most solemnly that selfish idea of obtaining popularity have influenced in course be pursuing then proceeded to expatiate upon state of working class to urge upon house necessity of adopting measure to ameliorate lamentable condition be too frequently alleged observed that class be thoughtless improvident ungrateful intellectually dull assertion emphatically denied despair produced by unhappy condition naturally led to dissipation in many instance be working man placed in position so that livelihood must be rendered le precarious than now waswere labour adequately remuneratedwere more fairly paid by representative of propertywere scale of wage established having fixed minimum fixed maximum increased comfort thus ensured to must naturally remove from mind care drove to public house lordship must have fixed maximum of wage because wage ought always to be increased in proportion to value of productive labour to employer must have minimum established to obviate cruel disastrous effect of period when labour exceeded demand in market must not be considered unfair towards employer because when market be brisk trade be flourishing employer reaped greatest benefit from activity enriched in very short time therefore when market be dull trade be stagnant must still be compelled to pay such wage a must enable employed to live comfortably profit gained during prosperous season not only enabled employer to enjoy handsome income also to accumulate considerable saving a best wage scarcely enabled employed to make thing like adequate provision for period of distress be not fair that representative of property must use labour of working class just when suited discard only use on miserable recompense when did not so well suit for labour of employed not only made annual income for employer also permanent fortune value of labour must not be calculated a lasting only just a long a be available for purpose of producing large profit labour be working man capital must have constant interest a well a money placed in fundsthat interest of course increasing in proportion to briskness of market never depreciating below standard valuemuch le being discarded a valueless altogether in time of depression thousand pound must always obtain three per cent interest under circumstance at particular period might be worth six seven per cent labour must be considered in same light stagnant market diminished profit of employer did not ruin if did not obtain profit enough to live upon have accumulation of good season to fall back upon how different be case with employed to stagnation of business be ruinstarvationdeaththe breaking up of little homesthe sudden check of child educationthe cause of demoralisation degradationand terrible necessity of applying to parish supply demand of labour be necessarily unequal at many time in many district government must therefore adopt measure to prevent frightful fluctuation in wage carried desolation into home of thousand of hard working industrious deserving family in fact law must be passed to ensure working man against casualty of being employed at price below remuneration in england poor be not allowed to have stake in countrythere be small propertiesthe land be in possession of few individual comparatively thus landed interest constituted tremendous monopoly most unjust oppressive to industrious class only way to remove evil influence ameliorate condition of working populationthe only way to countervail disastrous effect of monopoly short of revolution must treble quadruple number of landed proprietorswas to compel property to maintain labour a long a labour sought for employment occupation noble earl then proceeded to state if working class be thus treated must not be driven by care trouble to excessive use of alcoholic liquor must not become demoralised by being compelled to migrate from place to place in search of employmentgoing upon tramp sleeping in hideous den of vice where number be forced to herd together without reference to age sex must not be unsettled in little arrangement to bring up child creditably with due reference to instructionthey must not be made discontented anxious for change matter what vindictive towards society thus rendered outcast sullen reckless in general conduct a thing now be industrious man never felt settled knew that hut called home be held on most precarious tenurehe felt sickening conviction that if have bread meat to day might have only bread to morrow food at day after be positively frightful to contemplate condition of mental uncertainty anxiety apprehension in million of person be thus existing who reproached with recklessness sullenness must blame a cause of that vituperated lord ellingham next proceeded to show that although there have be vast increase of wealth comfort amongst middle upper class yet condition of industrious million be not only unimproved have positively deteriorated population be increasing at rate of soul dayand pauperism be keeping pace with increase unrepresented in parliamentwithout mean of making voice heardpositively incapacitated from having stake in country industrious million be mere slave tool of wealthy class thus immense mass of person be kept in bondagein absolute serfdom by oligarchy be such state of thing just be rational be even humane million be ground down by indirect tax in shape actually contributed more to revenue in proportion to mean than rich only luxury poor enjoyed have become a be necessariesnamely tea sugar tobacco beer spiritswere most productive source of revenue if noble lord reproached poor for dirty habit a well knew that be custom to do must ask why soap be made article subject to so heavy tax be contemptible fallacy to suppose that because poor contributed little nothing in shape of direct taxation to revenue be positively untaxed must again declare that poor paid more in indirect tax than rich did in direct indirect way when relative mean of two party be taken into consideration from subject earl passed to consideration of inequality of law incongruity severity injustice of administration towards poor advantage be given to rich in way of procuring bail in case where security for personal appearance be required poor man must possibly give such security must go to prison there herd with felon of blackest dye perhaps on trial innocence must transpire then what recompense have for long incarcerationhis home broken up during absenceand ruined family be possiblenay often happened that man must lie thus in prison for four five month previously to trial during period must be strange indeed if escaped gaol contamination then again there be offence of comparatively venial kind for penalty might be inflicted in shape of fine alternative being imprisonment fine be insignificant trifle in estimation of rich man smallest of be quite fortune in eye of poor even person with hundred year must pay fine of five pound rather than go to prison for month six week labouring man earning ten twelve shilling week must no more satisfy demand thus made upon than must influence motion of earthunless indeed pawned pledged little article belonging to infliction thereby became blow never afterwards recovered did poor man offend clergyman be forthwith put into spiritual court a common saying be expensive proceeding must not stay involved in utter ruin when poor man be oppressed by rich one be vain ludicrous to assert that court of law be open to law be luxury in only who possessed ample mean must indulge in case where grievous injury be sustained by poor manthe seduction of wife daughter for instanceredress recompense be impossible unless attorney took up case on speculation be practice most demoralising pernicious if left entirely unassisted in respect poor man must no more go to westminster hall than must afford to dine at long hotel with regard to subject of education noble earl declared that be positively shocking to think that such care must be taken to convert negro to christianity thousand of mile off while most deplorable ignorance prevailed at home church enjoyed revenue amount of actually brought minister of gospel into discredit a evidencing avaricious grasping dispositionwhile people remained a uneducated a if not single shilling be devoted to spiritual pastor lay instructor boldly accused house of parliament upper class generally of being anxious to keep mass in state of ignorance where instruction be imparted gratuitously be entirely of sectarian nature just a if men required to study grammar history arithmetic astronomy on church of england principle whole land be over run by clergyman who lived upon fat of ituniversities public school have be richly endowed for purpose of propagating knowledge encouraging learningand yet people be lamentably ignorant be wicked impudent falsehood to declare that be intellectually dull averse to mental improvement common sensethat best of sensewas special characteristic of working class who must read be absolutely greedy in anxiety to procure book newspaper cheap publication for perusal fact be that mind of industrious population be rich soil wherein good seed must speedily take root shoot up bring forth fruit to perfection apprehension narrow prejudice of upper classesthe oligarchywould not permit seed to be sown now a soil must naturally produce something even of own accord too often gave birth to rank weed be made matter of scorn reviling reproach real object of scornthat revilingand that reproach be who obstinately wickedly neglected to put good soil to full test of fertilization lastly earl of ellingham directed attention to state of criminal law be only calculated to produce widely spread demoralizationto propagate viceto render crime terribly prolific manno matter what offence might have beenshould be deemed innocent untainted again when have paid penalty of misdeed because to brand human being eternally be to fly in face of almighty assert that there must be such thing a forgiveness be such thing a repentance nature of punishment in country be so to brand individual so to dare majesty of heaven for gaol be perfect nest of infamysinks of iniquity imprisonment in necessarily fastened indelible stigma upon individual came forth tainted else be supposed that must be so under circumstance vainly endeavoured to obtain employment utterly failing in attempt to earn honest livelihood be compelled perforce to relapse into habit of crime lawlessness fact accounted for immense amount of demoralization bishop so much deplored true cause of obstinately refused to acknowledge criminal gaol be moral pest house in cure be effected where contagious malady became more virulent society must not immure offender solely for sake of punishmentbut with view to reformation of character noble earl then summed up argument by stating that be anxious to see measure adopted for minimum rate of wage to prevent sudden fluctuation of wage to compel property to give constant employment to labourhe be desirous that indirect tax upon necessary of life must be abolishedhe wished law administration to be more equitably proportioned to relative condition of rich poorhe insisted upon want of general system of national education to be intrusted to layman to be totally distinct from religious instruction sectarian tenetshe desired complete reformation in system of prison discipline explained paramount necessity of founding establishment for purpose of affording work to person upon leaving criminal gaol a mean of obtaining honest livelihood retrieving character prior to seeking employment for themselvesand hoped that franchise must be so extended a to give man who earned own bread by sweat of brow stake interest in country welfare noble earl wound up with eloquent peroration in vindicated industrious million from aspersion misrepresentation calumny seemed to be fashion for upper class to indulge in against concluded by moving number of resolution in accordance with head of oration earl speech be received with very partial cheering by assembled lord to whom tenor be most unpalatable such be effect upon auditor in stranger gallery that contrary to established etiquette be loudly applauded by lord chancellor immediately called to order in few minute dead silence reigned throughout house leading minister present then rose to answer earl oration did in usual style adopted by official men under such circumstance entirely blinking main argument declaimed loudly in favour of prosperity of countrydwelt upon happiness of english cottagerslauded wisdom of ancestorsuttered invariable cant about glorious institutionsspoke of church state a if be siamese twin whom must be death to severand after calling upon house to resist earl of ellingham motion sate down several noble lord right reverend father in god took part in discussion at house divided when earl motion be of course lost by overwhelming majority against arthur be by mean disappointed have foreseen resultbut have made up mind to renew subject a often a must in full hope that steady perseverance must ultimately be crowned with success house adjournedthe stranger gallery be speedily clearedand lord spiritual temporal rolled home in carriage multitude who still remained assembled in vicinity of st stephen preserving profound silence until earl of ellingham be observed to issue forth by person who be nearest to lord entrance then arose shout more loudmore hearty even than have greeted arrival few hour previously be voice of generous grateful people expressing sincerest thanks for effort noble

be so considered for seemed to be main source whence emanated frightful noise must possibly alarm nervous old lady irritate gouty old gentleman sooner did day dawn than captain o'blunderbuss must fling up window of bed room be at back of house with crashing violence that made people think be mad thrusting forth head with white night cap upon must roar outjohn john to arm a lustily a must bawl be not only to save trouble of repairing to footman chamber to summon also for purpose of letting sheriff officer if be in neighbourhood know that be on alert then john must poke head out of window answer captain call few minute afterwards back door must open shut with terrific bang john must be seen to sally forth to mount sentry in yard with shouldered poker then hour interval of comparative

confusion dismay produced by alarm be terrific neighbour threatened landlord to give warning on next quarter for be not only in morning that noise prevailed throughout entire dayaye best part of night also sometimes captain must take into head to discharge pistol in yard else must have fencing match with frank curtis weapon being poker made hideous clang then there be row in nursery be truly awful by way of variety captain o'blunderbuss must occasionally show at drawing room window vociferate most appalling abuse at suspicious character whom might happen to behold prowling about exhibition frequently collected crowd in front of house captain must harangue with a much earnestness a if be candidate at general election on one of occasion parish beadle made appearance from pavement remonstrated with gallant officer who kept in parlance until frank curtis have time to empty pitcher of water over enraged functionary from front bed room window worst part of whole business consisted in going on at night time just when sedate quiet people be getting cozily into first sleep at about eleven o'clock mr frank curtis be getting uncommonly drunk though captain seemed proof against effect of alcohol matter in what quantity imbibed nevertheless grew trebly quadruply uproarious when under influence of poteen thus from eleven to twelve shout of laughterthe yell of delightthe cry of mirthand vociferation of boisterous hilarity came from front parlour made night perfectly hideous amount of human patience ever possessed by good forgiving neighbour must possibly tolerate din disturbance prevailed during small hour then must captain friend curtis rush like mad men into yard shoutingroaringand bawling like demon so that resident in adjacent house leapt from bed threw up window in horror alarm expecting to find whole street in blaze performance on part of frank o'blunderbuss be intended to show officer that be upon alert not only have desired effect accomplished far moreinasmuch a produced absolute panic throughout entire neighbourhood thus be that mr curtis abodelately so serene quiet in time of mr goldberrybecame perfect nuisance scandal have bedlam in very worst day be located there noise alarm must not have be greater will be remembered that captain plan when first took up residence in baker street be to get mr mr curtis child away on sunday night sell off furniture on monday morning scheme be postponed at first for one weekthen for because officer kept constant look out that captain saw necessity of standing siege until creditor must be completely wearied of paying disagreeable spy to watch premise determination be more readily come to inasmuch a five hundred pound obtained from sir christopher blunt supplied sinew to carry on war in grand style when captain paid second financial visit to worthy knight with view to effecting of further loan on assignat frank curtis have resolved to issue be not because money be scarce in baker street simply because captain admired fun of thing also considered prudent to raise a ample supply of bullion a possible rage experienced at discomfiture on occasion can be better conceived than described firmly believing that be sir christopher who have dealt from carriage window tremendous blow sent sprawling on pavement in most ignominious manner vowed most deadly vengeance against new justice of peace picking up a well a couldfor gallant gentleman be sorely bruisedhe repaired to nearest public house to cool a said in own mind with tumbler of invariable poteen having reflected upon insult have received thought best not to communicate dishonour discomfiture on return to baker street accordingly having returned to garrison into effected easy entryfor one dared approach door when opened to

like tempest a morning newspaper be duly dropped down area of besieged dwelling in baker street entire report be read aloud by frank curtis at breakfast table therefore being evident that sir christopher be not only in town at moment be likewise in london when captain have called upon gallant gentleman affected to fly into violent rage swearing that knight be denied to on purpose vowing to make repint of un gintlemanly conduct o'blunderbuss did not however in heart mean to do such thing a call again in jermyn street for have despaired of inducing knight by threatenings coaxing to advance further supply now that worthy gentleman be justice of peace captain thought that must be somewhat imprudent to visit for mere sake of committing assault battery accordingly invented diver excuse day after day for remaining in garrison a fund be abundant one urged to undertake financial mission to sir christopher blunt reader must remember that messrs mac grab proggs be very roughly handled by captain o'blunderbuss when visited house in baker street for purpose of arresting mr frank curtis honour of sheriff officer being particularly dear to possessor worthy considered to be at stake unless fully vindicated by capturing aforesaid mr curtis in long run therefore have recourse to kind of device to obtain entry into house being armed not only with writ against gentleman person on behalf of mr beeswing also with execution against furniture at instigation of of mr curtis creditor trick practised by worthy to obtain entry into besieged domicile be a varied a be ludicrous on one occasion mr proggs dressed for nonce a butcher carrying leg of mutton in tray on shoulder hurried up to door gave loud sharp single knock peculiar to trade shouted t cher in most approved style
