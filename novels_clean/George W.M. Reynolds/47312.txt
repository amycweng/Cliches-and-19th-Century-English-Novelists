silence prevailed throughout hall prisoner counsel rose for defence richard seated in dock prepared to listen with greatest attention to speech of advocate whittingham placed hand in curved position behind ear in order to assist organ on present important occasion counsel for defence began by giving account of family social position of prisoner who be born of parent accustomed to move in first rank of life who be heir to fortune of inconsiderable amount during minority guardian who be then present have promised to allow prisoner six hundred pound year with pecuniary advantage be absurd to suppose that young man of education young man whose noble honourable feeling have be object of remark on part of friend who have only to express want to guardian in order to receive immediate gratification be absurd to imagine that individual must either enter into conspiracy with others plan by for purpose of raising money upon forged note young man be one of most generous confiding disposition a have seen little of world be totally unacquainted with wile artifice thus be made dupe of designing villain at very outset upon life whole history of present transaction be to be summed up in few word gang of conspirator have hit upon desperate mode of passing forged note in order to retrieve ruined fortune not a magnanimous a highwayman who peril own existence while perpetrates crime men required tool of whom might make use who must be at time sacrificed to save instrument scapegoat be prisoner at bar witness whose real name be chichester who by own confession have travelled on continent under denomination be not person on whom jury must place reliance have assumed distinction to be by mean entitled have affected arrogance importance of man of rank fashion whereas be son of pawnbroker in refined locality of brick lane bethnal green endowed with much impudence clever in imitating manner of superior well versed in intricacy subtlety of world possessor of assumed distinction swaggering imitator of class far above adventurer with fascinating conversation ready wit amusing anecdote fashionable attire rou of present day with jewellery about person gold in pocket allowing ever engaging smile to play upon lip professing unmitigated disgust at slightest appearance of vulgarity in individual mr chichester be principal witness whom counsel for prosecution have brought forward english jury must condemn fellow creature upon such testimony testimony of one who be compelled to fly ignominiously precipitately from baden on account of rascality at card who left domestic in strange land pennyless ignorant of language surrounded by odium also attached to name of master prisoner have motive in passing forged note because be wealthy mr chichester have motive because evidently lived far beyond mean father must allow learned counsel here related manner in richard have be induced to change larger note have become possessed of smaller illustration then proceeded to observe that letter addressed to mr arlington mr monroe related to fact that prisoner eye have be suddenly opened to character of associate to career of dissipation in be leading phrase upon so much stress have be laid till at length yesterday alluded to suicide of young officer have taken place while prisoner be at gambling house whither have be inveigled instead of inveigling others must not have remained in london minute with safety to why because associate whom have accidently picked up must not leave quiet regularly beset be penitent hoped that mr monroe must defend protect reputation yes when newspaper report conveyed to knowledge of gentleman fact that ward have be arrested in common gambling house fined for being there letter be written hurriedly be ambiguous thus be susceptible of more than one interpretation let jury interpret in favour of prisoner be better to send dozen guilty men back again into society terrible a evil must be than to condemn one innocent person then with regard to precipitate departure witness whittingham have shown in cross examination that prisoner object be to escape from three men whose character be suddenly unveiled to be said that prisoner have requested three individual to accompany to gaming house that at first refused oh amazing fastidiousness especially on part of chichester who have be compelled to decamp from baden for cheating at card then be stated that prisoner asked for change for fifty pound note be said that must have availed of accommodation to pas forged note why learned counsel have already explained how fifty pound note came into prisoner possession own gold having be transferred by mr chichester to sir rupert harborough writing desk learned counsel concluded by asking how happened that other forged bank of england note copper plate to print with material for such fraud be found at prisoner house must be supposed that young man with prospect must risk reputation safety for few

thus terminated case for defence counsel of prosecution according to odious right give accusing party last word in instance where defendant have called witness rose to reply stated that wealth social position of individual afforded certain guarantee against crime besides law must not always be swayed by apparent absence of motif because of most extraordinary deed of turpitude upon record have never be traced to source must satisfactorily account for origin perpetration be object jury have to keep in view use of evidence be to prove deny perpetration by particular individual forgery have be committed money obtained by prisoner at bar through agency of forgery defence have not attempted to deny that prisoner be individual who have thus obtained money point to be considered be whether prisoner knew note to be forged one learned counsel considered that assemblage of circumstance of most unequivocal nature stamped prisoner with guilt mr chichester evidence went to show that never gave note to prisoner even if chichester be proved to be disreputable person there be nothing beyond prisoner mere assertion made through counsel to prove that have received two note from chichester mr chichester have certainly assumed name during german tour be for purpose of avoiding arrest in foreign land upon bill of exchange might have be sent from england after have moreover assumed distinction of honourable foolish vanity by mean crime for englishman who be called captain be more captain than learned counsel be senior judge now summoned up evidence to jury most profound interest

dispirited have told wherefore ellen must make same charge against against cried young lady with start while at same time deep blush suffused cheek yes against continued richard now glancing towards may think that be joking never be more serious in life for few day that have be in house have be subject to interval of profound depression repeated hue of blush becoming more intensely crimson a glance sank confusedly beneath of markham ala ellen answered richard have be too deeply initiated in mystery of adversity sorrow have drunk too deeply of cup of affliction have experienced too much bitter bitter anguish not to be able to detect presence of unhappiness in others by many sign ellen have discovered that be unhappy speak to a friend wish to penetrate into secret if there be thing in can aid if there be aught wherein poor service counsel may be rendered available speak command oh richard cried ellen tear starting into eye how kind how generous of thus to think of who have already done so much for father be not companion of childhood ellen must not be to a brother to a sister let be brother then tell how can alleviate weight of unhappiness be crushing young heart brother exclaimed ellen almost wildly yes will must be brother to will be sister ah there be consolation in idea then after moment pause added time be not yet come when a sister will appeal to a brother for aid brother alone can give until then ask more speak to farther upon subject implore ellen pressed richard hand convulsively then hurried from room markham have scarcely recovered from astonishment into last word have thrown word coming from lip of young beautiful girl be fraught with additional mystery interest when whittingham entered library young lad master richard said old butler have called about situation be wacated in household took percaution of leaving word yesterday with people at public of most dubitable respectability called servant arm where call now then when go into town

before good lad to tell truth sir be reply have be simple pot boy in public house of course landlord will give character yes for honesty industry sir what think be of use to apply to landlord for character because because what demanded markham seeing that young man again hesitated if can have character for honesty industry need not be afraid of thing else must be said of truth be sir answered holford absented without leave remained away for two three day then when returned morning at very early hour refused to give account of proceeding be whole truth sir if will only give trial there be something very straightforward ingenuous about said perhaps must have objection to tell how be occupied during absence that sir be impossible declare most solemnly that did nothing for can reproach unless added holford be in leading couple of villain to believe must do certain thing never once intended to do really answer be so strange cried richard know not what to say to however appears from last observation that two villain tempted to do something wrong that lead to believe must fall into plan that never meant to fulfil promise be perfectly true sir proposed certain scheme in be to be agent accepted office assigned to because suited disposition promised to gratify curiosity in way where be deeply interested how did explain conduct to two men whom speak of inquired richard not knowing what to think of young lad half inclining to believe that bruin be affected invented certain excuse sir be holford reply completely damped ardour in matter alluded to now sir will give trial feel convinced will have not thought so from very beginning must not have spoken so freely a have done be disposed to assist be desirous to meet wish said markham still representation be rather calculated to awaken fear than clear up doubt concerning what guarantee can offer that will never see two villain again what security sir said own manner be so frank kind so very condescending indeed to poor lad like must not deceive for world have promised to meet men to night for last time to meet again yes sir to receive reward promised for service undertook ah young man cried markham be most

with shudder be murderer murderer ejaculated holford starting from chair with mingled emotion of horror alarm yes murderer of most diabolical cold blooded description said markham be too long tale to tell now let suffice for to know be upon point of becoming victim to most infernal of miscreant resurrection man must conceive that other whom named be in respect a bad a murderer repeated holford mental eye fixed by horrible snake like fascination upon fearful idea now suddenly engendered in imagination murderer echoed markham solemnly through must be surrendered up to justice through cried holford yes through if be really imbued with such honourable feeling a ere now professed will not hesitate for one moment in discharging duty towards society must be odious act of treachery on part said holford let men be what may if manifest reluctance to rid metropolis of two murderer cried markham angrily will conceive that be more intimately connected with than choose to admit if imagine that villain be more innocent than describe if fancy that motive prompt to exaggerate infamy will tell that language can enhance guilt vengeance be too severe have not heard that men have disappeared

five side of one ace of other be underneath on table be very easy for thrower just to move box least thing before lift to that sound may tell whether scratched side be down not be to recollect that man must be very drunk when can use with degree of safety must think so indeed said sir rupert can assure that implement of craft be on certain occasion more destructive than observed chichester what

markham said extending to hand smiling so sweetly with vermilion lip disclosed set of teeth not quite even a white a ivory that richard must not find in heart to be angry with be resolved not to pas day without seeing a must not come to be compelled to come to miss gregory said markham be not aware that have taken most imprudent step that world must highly censure conduct why demanded mary anne in astonishment because lady matter whether single married never call upon single gentleman society have laid down certain rule in respect dear mr markham be not giving lesson now remember in father

thing about matter said mary anne with considerable ingenuousness how cross look thought added ready to cry that must be a pleased to see a be to see yes miss gregory be pleased to see be always pleased to see answered markham by way of soothing poor girl must allow to assure that step be most imprudent most thoughtless in world really tremble for consequence must father happen to hear of tell over over again persisted miss gregory that papa will never know thing at about matter now then pray be cross tell that be glad to see speak mr markham be glad to see how will ever be able to convince artless young creature of impropriety of conduct murmured richard within to argue with too long too forcibly upon subject must be to instruct innocent mind in evil vice of society to imbue with idea be a yet like foreign strange tongue to innocence then be not pearl of invaluable price to possessor in world since can so readily prepare path might lead to ruin answer be thoughtful will not speak to said mary ann rising from sofa with tear in eye preparing rather affecting intention to depart markham still gave reply be grieved deeply grieved to wound feeling thought that must be better to allow to return home at once with sentiment of pique wounded pride must prevent repetition of same step than to initiate into social mystery must only give impulse to lively imagination must probably prove morally injurious to mary anne be incapable of harbouring resentment burst into agony of grief oh how unkind be mr markham exclaimed after endeavour to please thought that must have experienced a much joy to see a felt when saw enter room since day that lost dear mother upwards of nine year ago have never loved one so much a love no not even father for feel that at moment must dare even anger if be to shelter have long thought have friend god to whom must communicate little secret now feel a if must bestow confidence upon since death of mother have never sought couch without resigning soul into hand of god without demanding of insight into truth virtue now must rather entrust safety to must rather learn must know from lip than from of ought therefore to treat with more kindness consideration than have done up to moment must bestow upon additional share of attention notice because be anxious to please must do thing to save pain must lay down life to ensure prolongation of yours mary anne have never spoken so seriously in so impassioned manner in life before be even astonished at very idea be now expressing for first time seemed to flow from inward fountain whose spring must not check markham be astounded suddenly comprehended true situation of innocent artless girl in respect to pang shot through heart when considered impossibility of happiness ever being ensured by mean thought within ala poor child doe not rightly comprehend state of own mind how must love of hers be stifled how must passion be suppressed remedy yet essayed to quench annihilate love have changed into poison even violent unexpected lesson will not always make heart reflect more slave bend heavier becomes yoke more man employ unjust force more will injustice become necessary to view one must attempt to exercise tyranny upon proud soul for will readily learn that be not easy to triumph over trample on noble love error succeeds error outrage follows upon outrage bitterness increase like torrent whose embankment have given way who can define termination of ravage will not tender affectionate woman whose love man may endeavour to stifle by coldness neglect perish in ruin will succumb to tear to devouring care even while love cherishes still preserve vigour loses nothing of ardour through intense suffering markham knew not how to reply to affectionate girl whose spirit dared not break by unkindness whose passion must not return because heart be devoted to whose mind be afraid to enlighten with regard to social duty originated in reason motif totally unknown to mr markham said mary anne wiping away tear tell that be not angry with for calling a say be not right will never come again angry with miss gregory can not be exclaimed markham ought to tell that must not give way to feeling of of preference towards oh suppose that rule of society also prevent single lady from liking single gentleman interrupted mary anne pettishly rule can control volition miss gregory said richard cruelly embarrassed how to explain to young lady if tell that prefer to father so do exclaimed mary anne quickly then be wrong returned markham wrong indeed yet have just told that rule can control volition true must endeavour to conquer feeling say that like suppose that be never to meet again must not then learn to forget that ever knew such being impossible never never cried mary anne enthusiastically be always thinking of time must come day whether now year ten year hence when must cease to meet may be married may marry married ejaculated mary anne do think of marrying then mr markham be certainly attached to young lady replied richard there be circumstance be attached to young lady be beautiful very beautiful very beautiful answered richard mary anne remained silent for moment appeared to reflect profoundly sudden glow of animation flushed cheek be light dawned in upon soul richard sincerely hoped so mr markham said mary anne rising from seat speaking in tone so serious that richard must scarcely believe be now listening to once volatile sprightly thoughtless playful creature have known mr markham have to apologise most sincerely for trouble have given intrusion of have be guilty veil have suddenly fallen from eye now comprehend impropriety of conduct ah see what mean by law of society god also mr markham well know innocence of motif in calling morning upon if friendship for have betrayed into error beseech to forget scene have ever taken place shook hand with richard with usual cordiality warmth then took departure no longer skipping like young fawn with steady measured pace still that young girl did not dream that love have influenced conduct continued to believe that sentiment experienced be one of friendship idea of richard marriage with have only enlightened in respect to law a social sympathetic being have conventionally enacted on ensuing sunday markham dined according to engagement with mr gregory mary anne be present striking be change have taken place in manner be no longer gay joyous confiding full of animation a sickness chase from cheek flush of hoyden health so have new sentiment banished that sprightliness of disposition that liveliness of temperament so lately have characterised child of nature love then be omnipotent if can effect such change a ala love can work much for unhappiness little for felicity may make gladsome companion melancholy serious seldom cover countenance of morose one with smile mary anne endeavoured to seem a reserved a possible with richard yet from time to time when thought did not notice fixed eye upon with expression of such heart devoted tenderness that seemed a if be pouring forth entire soul to divinity whom worshipped illustration in grotesque colossal sculpture mountainous architectural pile of east seem to behold product of imagination struggling with conception too vast for compass hence endeavouring to make approximation to reality by heaping up irregular huge invisible form thus did tortured embarrassed mind of poor girl unacquainted with precise nature of sentiment cherished maintain conflict with feeling oppressed offer up idolatry of own invention to object of unbounded veneration mr gregory must not perceive change in daughter behaviour be more le at loss to conceive cause have entertained for few day previously faint suspicion that mary anne have peradventure formed attachment must thus account for altered demeanour for since call upon markham have manner changed good hearted father be still loth to believe that daughter young heart have be smitten for simple reason because did not wish to be so although respected markham be like parent who possessing fortune be anxious that suitor for daughter hand must also be enabled to produce modicum of world lucre be therefore unwilling to admit in own mind conviction that suspicion be well founded fancied that change of scene amusement must probably operate favourably upon daughter mind bring spirit back to proper tone in resolution be confirmed when in course of sunday evening saw confirmation of suspicion must no longer doubt thousand little incident proved to attachment of daughter to richard markham quick glance convinced that be not loved by tutor in return night mr gregory lay awake pondering upon best course to pursue at one moment thought of communicating to markham state of daughter heart for must not suppose that richard be aware of passion of be object permitting young couple to look upon other a destined to be one day united at moment imagined that must be better to allow thing to take chance for short time thereby ascertain whether attachment gained ground on part of daughter whether must become mutual for be entirely ignorant of markham love for at length resolved upon dispensing with service of richard trusting to time to eradicate seed of unfortunate passion from heart of mary anne plan mr gregory put into execution in course of few day indeed very next time richard called at house mr markham said father deeply regret that certain circumstance be not necessary for to explain to compel to dispense with farther attendance upon child hope said markham have given cause not at not in least interrupted mr gregory shaking richard cordially by hand then in serious tone added daughter health requires rest repose quiet will see visitor for time markham be satisfied mr gregory have heard nothing prejudicial to character have evidently penetrated into state of mary anne feeling richard be delighted to be thus dismissed from house where presence be only calculated to destroy more profoundly peace of one of inmate indeed have already entertained serious idea of severing connexion with family if can at time be of service to mr markham in way may command said mr gregory when former rose to depart think that be merely uttering cold ceremonial phrase when desire to make use of a friend must ever require one richard thanked mr gregory for kindness took leave of also bade adieu to gustavus lionel of whom be deeply affected at idea of losing visit of tutor mary anne have be purposely sent to pas few day with friend in country chapter xci tragedy at evening upon tragedy be to be represented for first time arrived markham in mean time have seen little of manager have not attended single

so proficient dancer a be now appears to be equally fine in tragedy listen markham must ask more question for neighbour became attention towards piece richard reviewed in moment in mind principal appearance characteristic of ellen life during last few month lateness of hour constancy of employment variety of circumstance only now struck tended to ratify suspicion that be indeed selina fitzherbert attention be withdrawn from own piece determined to convince at once upon head taking advantage of termination of first scene in third act left box proceeded behind scene of theatre while

of help where be to meet inquired monroe somewhat surprised by singularity of announcement at eastern extremity of london on bank of canal near place called twig folly at what hour demanded old man to morrow night at ten precisely be reply do know man who brought message have received letter asked ellen who now began to breathe more freely never saw man before have letter surely can not suppose that one be deceiving in so cruel manner feel convinced of said ellen with peculiar emphasis on word warmth in manner impossible cried markham unwilling to allow hope have moment ago appeared so bright to be obscured by mist of doubt then acting upon sudden impulse rang bell violently whittingham speedily made appearance man have just sent below said richard hastily have come to inform that brother be in london mister eugene in london ejaculated old butler forgetting gravity literally beginning to dance with joy have appointed to meet to morrow evening in very distant lonely part of

sincerity a proof of veracity of statement a evidence that came direct from eugene many person be acquainted with fact of appointment said ellen there be not individual in neighbourhood who be ignorant of meeting be named for th of july between ash tree on hill true exclaimed mere mention of appointment be scarcely sufficient evidence yet brother might deem that must prove sufficient eugene may not know how suspicious deceit of world be calculated to render mind have be victim have doubt that eugene be by time a well acquainted with world a can be richard persisted ellen be also convinced that if be to send such message to a stranger have brought making appointment at strange place at very lonely hour must have be careful to accompany with undeniable token of genuineness reason sensibly ellen said markham yet be by mean inclined to surrender up hope be just now so consoling to heart wounded a heart be by many misfortune reason consistently with interest returned ellen nothing must persuade that brother must fail to write line to in case a be represented to be what say mr monroe inquired richard be hesitating between two argument answered old man know not whether to

compression be that be raly representation of court said come from questioned closely asked markham know master richard can put poser two now then if man have be compostor must have circumwented pretty soon can assure answered question in straightforward manner then persisted richard must have be more straightfor'ard replied whittingham be sure be honest simple hearted well meaning man then be decided ejaculated richard will go to appointment who know in what peril poor brother may be who can say from what danger may save who can explain what powerful motif may have for nature of appointment have made caution have adopted in making must be wrong to allow suspicion to interfere with duty be thing serious to happen to eugene through want of friend at moment how must ever after

prove to that be deceived ala be impossible unless indeed shook head impatiently a if to renounce a impracticable idea have for moment occupied mind continued that be madness indeed yet what can be done must not be allowed to rush headlong blindly into danger for danger awaits feel convinced perhaps terrible man from whose power once escaped who denounced at theatre may be instigator of if such be fact then who know where atrocity of miscreant may stop murder cold blooded ruthless murder may be result of mysterious appointment murder of whom said ellen shudder passing like cold chill over entire frame murder of benefactor of noble minded generous hearted young man who gave asylum when world forsook oh must not be dare not tell know can do somewhat to protect smiled in spite of

already described a being used by body snatcher returning to grave thrust rod into ground met with little resistance from substance little harder than soil man pushed downwards with strong arm sank at least twelve foot into ground satisfied with essay of nature of spot grave digger drew back rod from deep narrow aperture thus formed issued stench more pestiferous than ever came from lowest knacker yard man retreated rapidly to bone house that odour be too powerful even for one who have passed greater portion of life in very grave yard now proceeded to light fire in bone house when saw huge log heaped on grate blazing brightly covered with coke current of air from open door fanned flame roared up chimney grave digger felt invigorated cheered by genial warmth issued from ample grate after lingering for few minute in bone house grave digger returned to spot have previously marked for excavation baring brawny arm to very shoulder now set vigorously to work to dig grave be to receive new comer afternoon throwing earth up on side have digged to depth of about two foot when spade encountered coffin immediately took pickaxe broke coffin to piece then separated with shovel piece of wood

stock broker scarcely knowing what said must expect that such will be case for day to come returned surgeon with coolness of professional man who saw nothing extraordinary in such result following so strange resuscitation from death like trance think then asked tomlinson that be possible for poor old man to rave about thing of very extraordinary nature people when delirious burst forth into most wild fanciful raving answered surgeon a felt michael pulse might then rave of heaven hell thing relating to may rave of nonsense said surgeon abruptly be reason why must allow ourselves to be affected by a see that be be indeed very foolish on part observed tomlinson now acquiring confidence endeavouring to divest of strange sensation of horror dread eloquence of old man have excited within have

england exile from native shore have adopted style of count alteroni title being name of estate have possessed in italy together with remainder of vast property have be confiscated by order of grand duke uncle government of castelcicala be absolute despotism be because prince with view to ameliorate condition of people whom might one day be called upon to govern have placed at head openly avowed a patron of political party in state whose object be to obtain constitution have be proscribed by grand duke old aristocracy of country party advised to have recourse to arm meeting in favour of enlightened principle advocated be held at time throughout country prince be resolved never to plunge native land into horror of civil war preferred exile obscurity to alternative be indeed lofty patriotic soul knew how to sacrifice dearest interest to popular tranquillity accordingly on arrival in london have adopted rank comparatively humble in respect to exalted station in reality occupied to mode of conduct be instigated by same disinterested motif have led to fly from country rather than raise standard of civil strife knew that if settled in london under proper title must not avoid receiving patriotic exile who have fled from castelcicala to avoid consequence of liberal opinion be averse to idea of allowing dwelling to be made point of runion for who advocated enforcement of popular cause by mean of arm must not for moment consent to permit nucleus of open rebellion against reigning sovereign of castelcicala to be formed under auspex have therefore intimated to friend adherent that intended to retire into private life until circumstance might place in position to confer upon native land charter of liberty believed to be natural right few english person who be acquainted with secret religiously kept tremordyns armstrong earl of warrington whom numbered amongst best friend respected incognito highness thought fit to preserve thus armstrong have not even communicated fact to richard markham when introduced to prince dwelling reader may now understand reason led haughtiest of england peer earl of warrington on occasion of visit to mansion near richmond to solicit letter of introduction for eliza sydney to bend head with such profound respect in presence of heir presumptive to throne need now be made matter of marvel if letter of introduction proved such immediate passport for eliza sydney into first society of castelcicala little did who gave who solicited little did think that ulterior effect must be to open way for lady to eminence a one have attained have before explained point indeed intelligent reader must not fail to comprehend that chance of alberto to castelcicalan throne now depended upon contingency of marriage of angelo iii producing offspring not scarcely however have that marriage be consummated when minister of foreign affair wrote to castelcicalan envoy at court of queen victoria to communicate to prince intention of government sanctioned by grand duke to allow handsome income supply with immediate grant by way of indemnification for loss of estate political condition of kind being attached to concession prince did not hesitate to accept be even mentioned in montoni newspaper that influence of grand duchess aided by friendly feeling of of new minister towards prince have procured act of justice at hand of angelo iii few observation may not be deemed superfluous inasmuch a tend to explain real position of prince of castelcicala father of charming heroine said be with light heart richard markham retraced step to richmond after having parted with princess isabella be moreover desirous to examine content of packet have placed in hand not because cared for money be thus returned to because be anxious to ascertain whether note from father accompanied however restrained curiosity until reached richmond where entered hotel ordered private room bespoke refreshment then proceeded to break seal of envelope

apologise for may have said done on occasion now dear mr markham be compelled to touch upon subject though painful demand few observation that have be unfortunate know that be never guilty be now well convinced have read document prof have inspired daughter with affection understand be reciprocal never can end otherwise than in disappointment to crush then sentiment in breast for peace of mind of

with delight that illustrious exile once more addressed a friend that suspicion of guilt have be extirpated from mind of nobleman on other hand barrier between isabella seemed to be rendered insuperable by positive term in prince bade eradicate passion from bosom that barrier be doubt twofold father of isabella never must consent to union of daughter with one whom world have stamped with ignominy although innocent chiefly italian prince probable heir to throne might aspire to far far higher connexion for child then richard thought be directed to handsome sum of money prince have placed at disposal must not do otherwise than admire delicate manner in be proffered manner scarcely admitted of refusal yet richard be resolved to return surplus above amount have disbursed to procure prince liberation from prison thus be with mingled feeling of joy melancholy that markham reviewed content of letter still clung to hope for isabella have bade hope thought that same good

birth mother must perhaps come up from pit once in middle of day to give natural nourishment when screamed during absence little girl who acted a nurse most probably thrust teaspoonful of strong opiate down throat to make sleep keep quiet many child be killed by treatment reason of death in such case be seldom known because coroner assistance be seldom required in mining district when be

to be issuing from very bowel of earth be in reality burning upon surface for purpose of converting coal into coke there be also blazing field of bituminous shale tall chimney of great tower of iron furnace vomited forth flame whole scene thus forming picture well calculated to appal startle infant mind remember at moment what feeling be then a well a if incident be relating have only occurred yesterday during day light have seen lofty chimney giving vent to column of dense smoke furnace putting forth torrent of lurid flame coke fire burning upon ground be first time have ever beheld meteor blazing amidst utter darkness be afraid be afraid shaft be perfectly round not more than four foot in diameter mode of ascent descent be precisely that of well with difference that instead of bucket there be stout iron bar about three foot long attached in middle suspended horizontally to end of rope from end of bar hung chain with hook to draw up basket of coal apparatus be called clatch harness two people ascended descended at time by mean have to sit cross legged a be upon transverse bar cling to rope thus person who got on first sate upon bar other person sate straddle on first one thigh old woman presided at wheel wound up lowered rope sustaining clatch harness a be by mean averse to dram life of person employed in mine be constantly at mercy of old drunken harridan moreover there seemed to to be great danger in way in miner got on off clatch harness one moment giddiness missing of hold of rope down to bottom of shaft headlong when clatch harness be drawn up to top old woman

suspended in little recess in side of shaft mother lighted bit of candle have brought with stuck into piece of clay to hold by then perceived long dark passage about two foot half high branching off from foot of shaft mother went on hand knee told to creep along with passage be nearly six foot wide thus there be plenty of room for to keep abreast of have not be case be sure that never must have have courage to precede follow for nothing must be more hideous to infantine imagination than low yawning black mouthed cavern running into very bowel of earth leading knew not whither indeed a walked in painfully stooping posture along by mother side fancy conjured up kind of horror trembled lest invisible hand must suddenly push forth from side of passage clutch in grasp dreaded lest step took might precipitate into tremendous abyss deep well thought that echo heard afar off be sound of miner pickaxe rolling corves on rail be terrific warning that earth be falling in must bury alive then when light of mother candle suddenly fell upon human being groping way along in darkness shuddered at idea of encountering ferocious monster hideous spectre in word feeling a toiled along subterranean passage be of so terrific nature that produced upon memory impression never can be effaced make turn cold over a contemplate feeling now must remember have be reared in complete state of mental darkness that enlightened instruction have dispelled cloud of superstition naturally obscure juvenile mind must not read have not even be taught alphabet have not heard of such name a jesus christ mention of god have ever met ear be in curse execration fell from lip of father mother acquaintance even little girl who have nursed can not wonder then if be so appalled when first found in strange terrific place at length reached end of passage struck into echoed with noise of pickax in few moment saw undergoers miner lying on side with pickax breaking away coal did not work to greater height than two foot for fear a subsequently learnt that must endanger security of roof of passage seam of coal not being thick one well remember infantine alarm horror when perceived that men be naked stark naked mother did not seem to be least abashed dismayed on contrary laughed exchanged joke with one a passed in fact afterwards discovered that bet flathers be great favourite with miner well went on

dragged cart now made fill one cart while hurried thus at seven year old have to carry about fifty six pound of coal in wooden bucket when passage be high enough carried on back when be too low have to drag push along a best must part of passage be only twenty two inch in height be where working be in very narrow seam difficulty of dragging such weight at age can be better understood than explained can well recollect that when commenced that terrible labour perspiration commingling with tear poured down face phil blossom worked in complete state of nudity mother stripped to waist to perform task have to drag cart holding seven hundred weight distance of at least two hundred yard for ours be very extensive pit have numerous working cutting running considerable way underground person who doe duty be called hurrier process be termed tramming cart be denominated skip work be certainly harder than of slave in west indie convict in norfolk island mother have girdle round waist

stooping posture in high one phil blossom be what be called getter first made long straight cut with pickaxe underneath part of seam where be working be called holing a be commenced low down getter be obliged to lie flat on back on side work for long time in uneasy manner did a well a must with labour allotted to be dreadful work be constantly knocking head against low roof of passage against rough place of side at other time fell flat on face with mass of coal upon else got knocked down by cart by collier in dark a toiled along passage eye blinded with tear with dust of mine many many week passed away at length grew quite hardened in respect to sight language have at first disgusted became familiar with constant presence of naked men half naked woman most terrible oath filthy expression ceased to startle walked boldly into great cavern have before described served a place of meeting for who took meal in mine associated with boy girl worked in pit learnt to laugh at obscene joke to practise petty theft of candle food even drink collier left in cavern at place of work mere fact of boy girl in mine meeting together without control without one to look after be calculated to corrupt who may be well disposed remained a carrier of coal along passage till be ten year old be then ordered to convey load by time amounted to hundred weight on occasion up ladder to passage over where have hitherto worked load be strapped by leather round forehead a ladder be very rudely formed step be nearly two foot apart be with great difficulty must keep balance have seen terrible accident happen to young girl working in way sometimes strap tagg round one person forehead have broken whole load have fallen on girl climbing up behind then latter have be precipitated to bottom of dyke great mass of coal falling on top of on other occasion have seen girl lose balance fall off ladder burden of coal a in other case showering upon companion behind work be indeed most horrible slave ship must not have be worse if did not do exactly a phil blossom told treatment received from be horrible mother did not dare interfere must serve in same manner thrashed with fist with stick until be bruised all over flesh be often marked with deep wale for week together one day nipped with nail until actually cut quite through ear often pulled hair till literally gave way in hand sometimes must pelt with coal thought nothing of giving kick must send with great violence across passage dash against opposite side on one occasion be in such rage because accidentally put out candle have to light at work that struck random blow at with pickaxe in dark cut great gash in head miner in pit baste bray be beat flog helper must be surprised if be to tell how many people in pit be either killed severely injured by accident year there be so many danger to poor miner be exposed falling down shaft rope sustaining clatch harness breaking being drawn over roller fall of coal out of corves in

thousand of fire side death from accident of nature be seldom if ever brought under notice of coroner indeed to save time be usual to bury poor victim within twenty four thirty six hour after decease earned three shilling week when be ten year old mother eleven may imagine then that ought to have be pretty comfortable household be just a wretched a other in mining district filth poverty be characteristic of collier population nothing can be more wretched nothing more miserable than dwelling hut in live be generally from ten to twelve foot square consisting only of one room have seen man wife eight ten child huddling together in one room yet might have earned by joint labour thirty shilling more week perhaps pig jackass fowl form part of family then furniture not comfort scarcely necessary yet absence of even such article a bedstead be upon principle collier like to be encumbered with household good because be often obliged to flit be to leave one place of work seek for such thing a drainage be almost completely unknown in district filth be permitted to accumulate before door collier be dirty set of people poor creature how can well be otherwise descend into mine at very early hour in morning return home at very late hour in evening be then too tired to attend to habit of cleanliness besides be so natural for to say 'why must wash to night since to morrow must become black dirty again 'why must wash for sake of sleeping with clean skin a for boy girl be often so worn out so thoroughly exhausted that go to rest without supper can not keep awake when get home know that be often often case have preferred indeed have be compelled by sheer fatigue to go to bed before mother must prepare thing to eat again how can collier home possibly be comfortable make wife child toil with in mine married woman from mine daughter know thing of housekeeping how can disorder be prevented from creeping into collier dwelling when one be there in day time to attend to then money can save from tommy shop of will speak presently go for whiskey husband wife son daughter look after whiskey habit of collier be hereditarily depraved be perpetuated from father to son from mother to daughter none be better worse than parent be before rag filth squalor dissipation crushing toil hideous want ignorance immorality be feature of collier home characteristic of collier life home be not whit better than of of fellow labourer be mother le attached to whiskey than neighbour chief source of poverty frequent want amounting at time almost to starvation amongst person earning sufficiency of wage be truck system atrociously oppressive method consists of paying collier wage in good partly in good through medium of tommy shop proprietor of tommy shop have understanding with owner of mine in district owner agree to pay person in employment once month once fortnight consequence be that miner require credit during interval be compelled to go to tommy shop where can obtain bread bacon cheese meat grocery potato chandlery even clothes proprietor of tommy shop sends book to clerk of owner of mine day before wage be paid thus clerk know how much to stop from wage of individual for benefit of shopkeeper if miner wife go to tommy shop for domestic article instantly lose employment in mine in consequence of understanding between employer shopkeeper perhaps must not be so bad if tommy shop be honest because be very handy for collier to go to store contains article that may require tommy shop charge twenty five thirty per cent dearer than other tradesman so that if collier family can earn between thirty shilling week loses seven eight shilling out of amount in course of year about twenty pound out of seventy five go to tommy shop for nothing interest on credit afforded that interest be divided between tommy shop keeper coal mine proprietor in district where mother lived there be such thing at a payment of wage in current money of kingdom tommy shop keeper paid wage for proprietor once month how do think settled in ticket money coinage consisted of pewter medal marker with sum that represented name of tommy shop on thus there be half crown shilling sixpence half penny money must only be passed at tommy shop from be issued there must be taken out in good so see that what with truck system tommy shop poor miner be regularly swindled out of at least one fourth part of fair earnings wage in time be subject to great change have known men earn twenty five shilling week at one time twelve fifteen at out of that be obliged to supply own candle grease for wheel of cart tram cost of be about three penny day then again fine be frequent vexatious be calculated that amounted to penny day per head sum went into coffer of coal owner such be state of superstitious ignorance prevailed in mine one believed in ghost spirit even old men be often afraid to work in isolated place spot where death from accident arose be particularly avoided be stated that spectre of deceased haunted scene of violent departure from world by time be twelve year old be a wild young devil a in mine like other female worked with only pair of trouser on must not consent to hurry tram skip saw that mother have got great bald place on head where pushed tram forward up sloping passage a be told that even amidst black filth with be encrusted be good looking wench determined not to injure hair may a well observe stranger visiting mine seeing boy girl huddling together half naked in cave obscure nook must not possibly tell one sex from other must say that think with regard to bad language licentious conduct girl be far far worse than boy be true that in neighbourhood of pit sunday school be established very few parent availed of mean of obtaining gratuitous education for child when be twelve year old did not know how to read write be unaware that there be such book a bible knew of god jesus christ be through oath imprecation of miner be at period mean

amongst have seen jolly looking butcher blacksmith carpenter plowman porter so on never beheld jolly looking entire population labour in pit appears to belong to race be accursed pondered seriously upon circumstance occurred scene around tended to strengthen resolution to quit employment worse than of galley slave saw mother wasting best energy in terrible labour yet remaining poor beggared scarcely enough for present not hope for future sometimes wept when contemplated although have little claim on sympathy affection nevertheless when saw bald head scalp thickened inflamed sometimes so swollen that be like bulb filled with spongy matter so painful that must not bear to touch when heard complain of dreadful labour of pushing heavy corves tram with sore head when perceived spine actually distorted with severe work stomach growing so weak that frequently vomited food almost a soon a be eaten heart so seriously affected that interval of violent palpitation frequently made faint lung performing function with difficulty chest torn with sharp hacking cough accompanied by expectoration of large quantity of matter of deep black colour called by collier black spit when saw thus overwhelmed with complication of malady dying before eye at age of thirty three when looked around beheld nine out of ten of person employed in pit whether male female similarly affected shuddered at bare idea of devoting youth to horrible toil then passing to grave while yet in prime of life thought of running away seeking fortune elsewhere knew that be use to acquaint mother with distaste for life to have devoted must only have answered objection by mean of blow while be still wavering what course to pursue circumstance occurred must not forget to relate one morning candle have accidentally gone out be creeping along dark passage to spot where phil blossom be working to obtain light from candle when heard mother conversing together in low tone with great earnestness of manner curiosity prompted to stop listen 'be sure be case said phil 'certain ' replied mother ' will be confined in about five month 'well observed phil know what be to be done old woman will kick up

so comfortable together be sure man can be cursed with wife of worse temper than mine ' 'yes returned mother behe be horrible for ' 'do think there must be much harm in pushing down shaft shoving head under wheel of tram bet asked phil after pause 'there must be harm ' said mother 'if so be wer found out ' 'that be exactly what mean ' observed phil then continued mother did happen to die at once might peach get into scrape might ' said phil `` ll tell what might do exclaimed mother in joyful tone 'does wife come down at one to bring dinner ' 'yes replied phil blossom 'that be old cripple be good for 'well then pursued mother `` ll tell how can manage business ' then began to whisper must not gather word fell from lip be so frightened at what have heard that crept quickly cautiously back

understood that mother be with child by have heard coolly plotting death of woman who be obstacle to marriage at age such idea be calculated to inspire with terror think sate for nearly hour in dark mind filled with thought of nature may be well understood at length young woman bearing corf came with light be no longer left in obscurity then plucked up courage took basket went to phil blossom for load of coal mother be not there be working with pickaxe a coolly a possible asked what have made so long in returning for load told have fallen down few step of ladder hurt said more on subject be

respiration artist be doubt anxious to dispose of statue said rector precisely so answered hag profess to be judge can speak of effect produced upon when saw finished standing upon pedestal be about to address a living being effect must then be indeed striking observed reginald with voluptuous train of whose idea picture be well adapted to associate be to judge for reverend sir said old hag must find have not overrated perfection of masterpiece sculptor demand small price for statue must be charity be to purchase recommend one of friend to do so when where must see matchless work of art asked

accompany now can inspect without delay reginald referred to watch found that be past nine o'clock evening be pitch dark did not therefore dread being seen in company of hideous old woman besides even if be be not often summoned at hour to attend upon last moment of dying sinner will proceed with at once to abode said rector after few moment hesitation will do well answered hag for can promise fine treat in what be about to see while rector stepped aside to put on cloak strange smile curled lip of wrinkled harridan a reginald again turned towards countenance instantly resumed wonted composure then went out together chapter cxxxi statue old woman led way at rapid pace towards golden lane rector following at little distance although there be nothing improbable in tale hag have told nothing improper in step be taking nevertheless experienced vague indefinable idea of doing wrong something told that ought to retreat at same time superior influence urged onward therefore followed old woman wrinkled creature pursued way at length turned into dark dirty court with reader be already well acquainted be strange place will say observed old woman a pushed open door of one of house in court be strange place to contain such treasure for reason treasure must not long be allowed to remain here answered clergyman hag chuckled sound be between hollow laugh death rattle seemed horrible to ear of reginald tracy old woman then slowly ascended narrow dark staircase until reached landing where drew key from pocket leisurely applied to lock of door fumbled about so long with key muttering to herself while reginald thought must never open door offered to assist at moment key turned in lock door be slowly opened hag beckoned rector to follow found in tolerably large room decently furnished with excellent fire burning in grate there be candle lighted did hag offer to provide content of apartment be plainly visible by mean of strong glare of fire heavy curtain of dark colour covered

artist best room in house observed hag a placed chair near fire for rector statue stand in adjoining chamber can inspect at once while mumbled remainder of sentence in way that be wholly unintelligible to rector then left room for few minute reginald stood before fire uncertain what course to pursue now began to think that entire proceeding be somewhat extraordinary singular manner in old hag have left inspired with feeling not entirely free from alarm for what purpose must have be inveigled thither if be not really to behold marvellous statue perhaps after old woman have only left in order to fetch candle to summon artist moreover have not informed that statue be in next room that might inspect at once be therefore easy to satisfy whether have be deceived not ashamed of transient fear threw off hat cloak advanced towards door communicating with inner chamber even then hesitated for minute a finger grasped handle at length boldly entered room moment door be thrown open perceived by light of fire burned in front apartment that inner one be small comfortably fitted up bed chamber be involved in more than semi obscurity not to such extent a to conceal from reginald tracy penetrating glance semblance of female form standing upon low pedestal in most remote corner of room be not then deceived exclaimed aloud a advanced nearer towards statue by time eye have become accustomed to obscurity of chamber into glimmer of fire threw faint mellowed light still in somewhat bold relief against dark wall stood object of interest seeming beautiful model of female form colouring of be that of life be naked to middle arm be gracefully rounded one hand sustained falling drapery being also coloured produced upon mind of beholder effect of real garment lost in wonder at success with sculptor have performed work experiencing feeling of soft voluptuous nature reginald drew closer to statue at moment light of fire played upon countenance seemed to a if lip moved with faint smile then how be surprise increased when conviction flashed to mind that face be gazing upon be well known to o cecilia cecilia ejaculated aloud hast thou sent thy statue hither to compel to fall at foot worship senseless stone while thou sweet original art elsewhere speculating perhaps upon emotion phantasmagorian sport be calculated to conjure up within ah cecilia if thou wast resolved to subdue once more if thou couldst not rest until became thy slave again oh why not have invited to meet thine own sweet self instead of speechless motionless passionless image counterpart of thee only in external loveliness yes there be perfect hair brow eye mouth heaven lip seem to smile once more eye sparkle with real fire cecilia cecilia reginald tracy be afraid scarcely knew wherefore entire adventure of evening appeared to be dream yes yes suddenly exclaimed after having steadfastly contemplated form before for moment standing at distance of only three four pace afraid to advance nearer unwilling to retreat altogether yes exclaimed there be something more than mere senseless marble here eye shoot fire lip smile bosom heave oh cecilia cecilia be a spoke rushed forward statue burst from chill marble into warmth life be indeed beauteous wily cecilia who returned embrace hung around neck rector be again subdued again enslaved will pardon for little stratagem adopted to bring back to arm said cecilia how can do otherwise than pardon murmured rector whose licentious soul be occupied only with gross delight who must at moment have dared exposure disgrace rather than tear away from syren on whose bosom head be pillowed oh cecilia have have violent struggle with feeling will now contend against more no from instant abandon hope of empire wish for dominion over yield up to pleasure of love to thee sweet cecilia thou hast taught how ineffable be bliss mortal may taste in world after sure present be preferable to uncertain future reginald beloved reginald didst thou imagine must resign thee so easily a thou wouldst have resigned said lady cecilia oh know not heart of woman there be two alternative for to bring back to avenge on avenge exclaimed reginald starting yes replied wily creature purposely adopting discourse in order to enchain lover in future woman who fondly madly love a love reginald will not so willingly part with object of affection what must suppose must surrender to one day to be abandoned next never never must permit to be made victim of caprice wrote to to implore not to seek to see again requested one last interview refused demand then smarted sorely said to myself 'he love ' added ' love also ' accordingly resolved to attempt one grand effort to draw anchorite from cell chance threw in way old woman whom sent to in whose house now be what chance be that demanded reginald who entertained strong yet unaccountable aversion for old hag will tell dearest reginald answered cecilia evening after received cruel note desiring that might end between be going out with intention of calling upon yes of throwing at foot imprudent cecilia murmured rector imprinting kiss upon lip yes be on point of leaving own abode to seek yours continued cecilia when heard hoarse ominous voice muttering behind looked round perceived that old wretch smiled rather leered significantly said 'happy happy lady to enjoy rector of saint david love ' said that cried reginald how must divine what passed between have since explained to how one evening saw leave house with certain wildness in manner true true ejaculated rector mind of old woman being perhaps naturally evil conceived evil of others on faintest suspicion exactly answered cecilia when accosted in manner be so wretched so miserable at idea of being separated from sweetest creature be indeed ungrateful in return for so much love be so unhappy that be even glad to speak of thee to wretch a old creature then uttered word of consolation talked together talked for hour in cold damp street poor cecilia murmured reginald what must not dare for said wily woman pressing warmly in snowy arm now can guess rest how old woman proposed that stratagem must be invented to bring recreant back to arm have thus blindly confided not only secret mine also to perfect stranger o cecilia be prudent exclaimed reginald in alarm doe love know prudence asked lady fear not gold will seal lip of confidant better be for obscure dwelling to be scene of love than for caress to be exchanged at abode where intrusion of servant at moment true interrupted reginald

only of must be detected be ruined only in profession not a man for with man there be dishonour in illicit love if be detected be not lost a wife a woman will not all wrath of avenging society light upon for be upon upon poor woman contumely shame disgrace fall forgive dearest cecilia murmured rector clasping frail beauty in arm have be unjust to have thought only of unmindful of immense sacrifice be made by thee forgive say never again will expression of cowardly alarm egotistical terror impair happiness love love cecilia oh heaven know how sincerely how madly love will love always
