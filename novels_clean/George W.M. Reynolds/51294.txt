longer audible nevertheless markham kept ear fixed to key hole of chamber door silence now once more reigned throughout house in few minute noise bustle seemed to have be transferred to yard richard hurried to window moon have gone down darkness without be intense concealed light in corner of room then gently raised one of window must distinguish nothing with eye sound met ear be of footstep bustling to fro at length ceased door be closed at end of yard almost immediately afterwards richard heard in same direction rumbling noise of vehicle moving heavily away when din have ceased most profound tranquillity prevailed not only in home also in neighbourhood that silence be interrupted only for few moment by sonorous bell of st giles church proclaiming hour of three time wear on said markham impatiently opportunity of satisfying upon one point seems to present to attempt to seek repose be impossible to pas dull hour in suspense like be intolerable then seated on one of bed considered what course must pursue slowlyslowly passed time though revolved in mind many plan must fix upon none at length clock struck four hour for departure will come will leave house a full of doubt uncertainty a when entered ejaculated starting up eye chanced to fall upon long nail in wall opposite to bed from have just risen scheme have already suggested to mind now assumed feasible

stylefor be writing of brother eugene with hasty trembling hand opened letter wafer of have already be brokenhe did not hesitate to read contentsjudging by own frank generous heart conceived that licence be permitted between brother moreover experienced profound painful anxiety to ascertain what link must connect brother with terrible individual to whom letter be addressed that letter contained be come to to night without fail between eleven twelve knock in usual manner richard examined handwriting with most minute attention longer scrutinized more became confirmed in belief that be eugene eugene patron colleague of greatest miscreant have ever disgraced human nature be such thing possible letter bore dateno signatureand be addressed from place have post mark upon have therefore evidently be delivered by private hand oh thought richard within if unhappy brother have really be victim associate employer of incarnate demon may god grant that wretch be indeed morefor sake of eugene then curiosity to ascertain truth relative to alleged assassination of tidkins became more poignant must be so reasoned markham within that stranger have not deceived methe presence of pocket book here be undeniable trace of miscreant oh how much now behoves to convince that be indeed removed from theatre of crime subduing a much a possible painful emotion that letter have suddenly excited within markham secured pocket book about person for now accident have revealed to to whom belonged did not consider called upon to part with object in case statement of tidkins death must

in manner then thought how fearful be fate of miscreant evidence of whose death believed to be beneath eye cut off in midst of crime without moment preparation repentance suddenly asked himselfam certain that be more lint to stanch bloodthose bandage to bind wounddo not rather bear testimony to blow be not fatal left life behind yet for what purpose must body be removedsave for secret

miss monroe ellen wrong excellent man said markham somewhat severely will call upon to morrow morning learn from own lip particular of most mysterious deed chapter cliv reflectionsthe new prison richard markham passed uneasy night thought wandered from topic to topic until variety seemed infinite pondered upon brother again reflected for thousandth time what connexion must possibly exist between resurrection man fatal letter desiring terrible individual to call upon be too decidedly in eugene handwriting to be doubted other content of pocket book richard have found in gipsy palace threw light upon subject indeed only consisted of few paper of consequence to one then richard thought travelled to resurrection man be individual really more have truth be told relative to death at gipsy encampment near pentonville prison next hero imagination wandered to death bed of innocent girl who have entertained so unfortunate passion for what fervent love be that what disinterested affection then to perish in such mannerwith darkness of tomb upon eye long ere death made dread appearance with what inspiration have prophesied most exalted destiny for loved with sybilline finger have pointed to throne then how speedily be prediction followed by communication of event portended grand political change in castelcicalachanges threatened reigning sovereign with overthrow inevitable result of must be elevation of prince alberto to ducal throne isabellahow many proof of unvaried love for hero have not given have confessed attachment to deceased maidenshe have avowed to

hand next hero pondered upon awful deed have be ascribed to katherine wilmot here be lost in labyrinth of amaze distrust doubt must be possible that blackest heart be concealed in so fair shrine have circumstantial evidence accumulated with fearful effect to enthral innocent girl in mesh of criminal law richard remembered how have suffered through overwhelming weight of circumstantial evidence thought rendered slow to put faith in guilt of others then amidst other topic richard meditated upon mysterious instruction be conveyed to in document left behind by armstrong seemed to promise much by solemn earnestness characterised direction relative to circumstance time must justify in opening sealed packet thus if of hero thought be calculated to produce uneasiness others be associated with secret hope of successful love dazzling vision of prosperity in three year half appointment with brother be to be kept how must meet must eugene appear on day named upon hill where two tree stood why have not written in meantime be progressing so well that wished to surprise brother with great prosperity be so wretched that proud heart prevented from seeking assistance of one of whom have taken leave with specie of challenge to race in path lead to fortune eugene be alive richard felt convinced because inscription on treeeugene own treeand letter to resurrection man proved fact same circumstance also showed that eugene have be several time in london even if did not dwell in metropolis altogether since parted with richard upon hill then richard reflected that if be eventually prosperous success must be owing to fair honourable mean sincerely hoped that brother might be pursuing equally harmless career idea however seemed to be contradicted by mysterious note to resurrection man hero remembered that bad men often enjoyed immense success then thought of mr greenwoodthe man who have robbed of property whom so far a knew have never seen that greenwood be rising rapidly richard be well aware newspaper conveyed that information so well have played card that baronetcy if not even junior post in administration must be moment party must come to power richard knew tory journal be strenuous in praise of mr greenwood lauded to sky devotion to statesman who be aspiring to office then great wealth of mr greenwood have become proverbial not grand enterprise of day

be so great man a mr greenwood be then while reflected upon fact hero be compelled to admit that brother eugene might appear upon appointed day emblem of infinite prosperity yet being from whom truly honest must shrink back with dismay will not follow richard markham further in reflection during sleepless night rose at early hour anxiously awaited arrival of morning newspaper from vehicle of information learnt that katherine wilmot have be examined on previous day before magistrate at marylebone police court have be remanded for one week in order that deposition might be made out previous

at length must however observe that when richard markham perused testimony adduced against girl before magistrate be staggered for seemed crushing connected overwhelming indeed nevertheless remembered own unhappy case determined not to desert called upon mr tracy found that gentleman unwilling to believe that so young seemingly innocent girl must be capable of so enormous crime yet reverend gentleman be compelled to admit not only that evidence weighed strongly against that be difficult to conceive how housekeeper have come by death unless by katherine hand richard took leave of rector

teach practically that while there be life there be hopethat be never too late to repentthat man can show mercy to greatest sinner even a god doesthat most degraded mind may rise from depth of society seek reformation prevention in respect to crime not vengeancethat christian religion in word exists in heart a well a in book what sentiment do convict entertain be taught by oppressive treatment to lose sight of own turpitude therefore to consider that mankind be bent on inflicting demoniac vengeance upon themthey look upon authority a persecutorsthey begin to fancy that be worm be justified in turning on who tread under footthey swear blaspheme talk obscenely merely because there be earthly solace left save in hardening own heart against kindly sympathy emotionsthey receive word of god with suspicion because man doe not practically help to belief in divine assurance relative to efficacy of repentancethey be compelled by terrific unceasing hardship to look upon tear of contrite heart a proof of moral weaknessand in word study how to avoid reflection can lead so far a can see to beneficial end therefore welcome hardness of heart obstinacy recklessness of disposition a actual mean of

modern name of craven windham jersey carlton house have indeed beheld strange varied scene said duchess low orgy voluptuous revelsmusic floating heredice rattling therethe refinement of existence in

own chamber while visitor be at mansion must surgeon who attended wounded duellist conjecture if refused common courtesy became mistress of mansion total retirement of lord ravensworth be already sufficient reason to provoke strange surmise on part of newly arrived guest although existence of extraordinary unaccountable malady be well known in fashionable world if to fact be superadded

mr graham said be happy to state that lord dunstable be in a favourable state a under circumstance must be expected have succeeded in extracting balland now sleep thank god exclaimed cholmondeleynot with real piety merely using that common phrase a expressive of joy to think that matter be not more serious than now appeared to be be however afraid continued surgeon turning towards adeline that patient will be compelled to trespass for few day upon kind hospitality of ladyship in case lord dunstable will receive attention can be here afforded observed adeline must be idle compliment to sir under circumstance to say that ravensworth hall will be honoured by presence so long a may see fit to make abode surgeon bowed in acknowledgment of courteous intimation for part colonel cholmondeley hastened to say will not trespass upon ladyship hospitality forsince be assured that friend be longer in dangeri must attend to certain pressing business call elsewhere adeline threw glance of

richard began by reading various letter accompanied old woman narrative a epistle merely corroborated main point of tale will not quote narrative will explain that important document may be found in ensuing chapter chapter ccxxv old hag history must carry recollection back between seventeen eighteen year not that requires effort to call to mind leading fact in sad history nonothey be too well impressed upon memorybut there be certain detail connected with own position at time will need fullest explanation in order to show how one like must have become friend of harriet wilmot at epoch kept boarding housea fashionable boarding house in fashionable street at west end be not then ugly withered a be now have remains of great beautyfor be very beautiful when young be also of pleasant agreeable manner knew well how to do honour of table will not therefore be surprised when tell be great favourite with person who lodged at establishment with still more numerous visitor be true that establishment be boarding house be conducted to outward appearance in most respectable manner have interior mystery a well a many other dwelling in metropolis fact be be well known to large circle of noble gentleman who employed leisure time in intrigue amour having be gay from fifteen to forty be deeply versed in various mode of entrapping respectable young person even lady in mesh artfully spread to ensure constant supply of new victim to lust of men of pleasure having changed name thrown veil a be over past opened boarding house by mean of fund supplied by patron soon experienced great success by paying tradesman with utmost punctuality acquired good character in neighbourhood for tradesman can always make mar shop being scandal mart where report favourable unfavourable be put into circulation a consider that who pay well must necessarily be respectable regularity on point be certain to ensure advantageous opinion having thus founded respectability of establishment rest be easy enough calculation made by patron be theseboarding house be usually inhabited by lady possessing income though derived from source be sure be too small to enable to set up in housekeeping for elderly widow with daughtersyoung widow who coming from country from abroad be stranger in london who wish to marry again therefore seek that society be most easily enteredfriendless orphan who posse small annuitiesaunts niecesgrandmothers with grand daughtersthese be class of lady who principally support boarding house thus there be always large proportion of young lady in establishment out of dozen there be sure to be three four very good looking there can now be difficulty in understanding motif induced patron to place at head of boarding house must now record plan of operation in boarding house number of lady preponderates greatly over of gentleman average be usually about twenty lady four five gentleman three time week have music dancing in evening a there be lack of beau of course supplied deficiency by inviting beome highly respectable gentleman with whom have honour to be acquainted be of course patron when be at house always took care to treat with proper politeness a if

spared upon occasion mamma aunt grandmammas be very fond of evening entertainment considered gentleman whom invited to be most delightful creature in world sometimes rubber of whist must vary amusement a patron be not only all rich have own private purpose to serve in frequenting house allowed old lady to cheat without manifesting least ill will else actually played badly to enable said old lady to win be therefore impossible that must have failed to become especial favourite of advantage availed in design upon young lady lodger in boarding house be always mean avaricious smallness of income doe not permit to indulge largely in natural taste for dress yet nowhere do female maintain such desperate struggle to appear fine in apparel thus lady in boarding house can easily be persuaded to accept of present of patron be by mean sparing gold chain be certain passport to young lady favour velvet silk dress must secure good opinion of aunt grandmamma even of mamma moreover when one of patron appeared particularly attentive to young lady concluded of course that intention be honourable in very short time became victim in word boarding house though ostensibly so

eliza oh madam cried quentin somewhat reproachfully be not for to dictate to youbut since have discovered who man be how must permit to remain for one single day at largewhy must be allowed to take place at same table with honest people admit that such society must be abhorrent in extreme answered eliza mildly firmly also acknowledge that for short space be depriving justice of due listen however to reason gilbert vernon be man of so desperate character that will hesitate at crime will make master of land title of ravensworth have reason to believe that caused death of brother have equally good ground for suspecting of intention to murder nephew a speedily a circumstance will permit be adopting measure to collect evidence will place guilt beyond doubt until evidence be obtained must excite in mind suspicion that there be counter scheme in progress be to do so be impossible to imagine what desperate deed might immediately risk in furtherance of aim suspicion be already so strong against madam observed quentin that magistrate must grant warrant for apprehension if evidence against be found to be incomplete vague a indeed now be answered eliza must soon be at large again to pursue detestable machination quentin good sense must show that be better to take decisive step until evidence will be so complete that will serve two objectsnamely to punish for crime have already committed thereby release lady son from future danger at hand submit to superior judgment madam said quentin in respect to anthony tidkinsthis james whitethis villain who be now quartered upon until

mind where such superiority really exists accordingly expressed readiness to follow eliza counsel in thing connected with present business also promised that must not by conduct towards tidkins excite in individual mind idea that be known suspected eliza sydney then separated must pause for moment to explain system of argument upon lady present proceeding be based if said to herself tidkins be delivered up to justice be possible that will not turn upon employer vernon who might readily account for having villain in service by declaring that be entirely ignorant of true character when

ravensworth for only positive ground of suspicion can a yet be adduced against be that have be time in england while represented to have be still dwelling in east circumstance might be disposed of by feasible excuse on part must also be inefficient unless coupled with more conclusive evidence in month will probably be able to collect testimony require be not likely that vernon will immediately attempt life of infant heir a such deed following so closely upon death of late lord must of afford matter of serious inquiry arouse suspicion against be therefore necessary to remain tranquil for
