to ladyship honor to pay money at most befitting convenience ladyship doe not require now exclaimed bandit chief emphatically marquis looked at stephano inquiringly for there be something ominously mysterious in word brigand stalked in dogged manner toward door a if anxious to hurry departure so long protracted manuel having renewed expression of gratitude toward isaachar ben solomon hastily followed verrina from house chapter xxvii stephano marquis stronghold of bandit moment stephano marquis be alone together in open street former related incident have occurred at arestino palace after

more than once for new female victim promised to save signor exclaimed with enthusiastic warmth gave pledge in manner described to lordship returned verrina will not swerve from think that liberation can be effected demanded manuel remember that convent be protected by highest personage in state violence never will succeed in accomplishing object for must armed man dare to pas sacred threshold sbirro in florence must fly to spot be then lordship who be afraid of attempting rescue of countess interrupted stephano in contemptuous tone observation be hardly fair signor verrina said young nobleman considering that right arm be disabled that wound be received in combat with crave lordship pardon exclaimed bandit captain remark be most uncourteous particularly to one who have ere now given equivocal proof of valor pretend not to courtly manner such a be will find faithfully devoted to service that of lady giulia attempt to rescue will be somewhat hazardous be however tolerably sure of success can only be undertaken on certain condition regard lordship self indeed have not so opportunely met at jew house must have sent one of fellow to to morrow in what way do condition that

interest in behalf of countess be well aware that from have little to hope in shape of reward that countess will be in better condition than to recompense even if succeed in effecting rescue be well aware of lord answered stephano will give explanation of motif a frankly a solicit in first place suit project to make friend a much a possible with noble great lady a one can say how when such interest may be available to to connected with secondly be not sorry to have excuse for paying visit to carmelite convent in case of failure will be a well to have florentine noble amongst because

with well lord reply exclaimed robber captain impatient of long silence have followed explanation be content to abide by condition ere now proposed perfectly content answered marquis knew that be useless to reason with brigand against spoliation of convent have more than hinted at for be not likely that robber must incur so great risk a involved in sacrilegious invasion of sacred establishment unless be with hope of reaping adequate reward bandit chief young nobleman have now reached boundary of city instead of entering street turned abruptly to right stephano acting a guide plunged into thick grove of evergreen here lord said stephano stopping short must consent to be blindfolded wherefore demanded manuel indignantly think that will betray secret of dwelling wherever whatever may be

of working at pump vainly did captain endeavor to exercise authority vainly did wagner hold out menace promise by turn death seemed imminent yet men who felt that be hovering on verge of destruction flew madly to wine store then commenced scene of wildest disorder amidst desperate men even captain perceiving that must laugh shout sing in delirium of intoxication rushed from side of wagner joined

appalling din of whelming billow wagner be only soul on deck at instant fury of water tore away from bulwark to have be clinging became insensible when awoke from stupor into have be plunged be still dusk roar of ocean sounded in ear with deafening din be on land though where knew not rising from sand on have be cast beheld billow breaking on shore at distance of only few pace retreated further from reach then sat down with face toward east anxiously awaiting appearance of morn that might ascertain nature aspect of land on have be cast by degree glimmering have already subdued blackness of night into le profound obscurity of duskiness grew stronger yellow luster a of far distant conflagration seemed to struggle against thick fog then faint roseate streak tinged eastern horizon growing gradually deeper in hue spreading higher wider harbinger of sunrise while simultaneously feature of land on wagner be thrown began to develop like specter stealing out of complete security till at orient luster be caught successively by thousand lofty pinnacle of rock finally majestic orb appeared lighting up series of verdant plain delicious grove glittering lake pellucid stream a well a still turbulent ocean far off mountain have first peeped from amidst darkness fair delightful be scene thus developed to eye of wagner a glance swept country rose amphitheatrically from shore not vestige of presence of man must be beheld smoke curled from amidst grove church spire peeped from amongst tree have wilderness of nature be disturbed by artificial culture turned toward ocean there be not trace of vessel to be seen further along sand lay dark object approached with shudder for divined what be be mistaken be swollen livid corpse of one of sailor of lost ship wagner first impulse be to turn away in disgust better feeling almost immediately animated hastening to nearest grove broke off large bough with hollowed grave in sand deposited corpse in hole throwing back sand have displaced thus completed christian task during visit to grove have observed with delight that tree be laden with fruit now returned thither to refresh by mean of banquet thus bountifully supplied by nature having terminated repast walked further inland verdant slope stretched up before variegated with flower glittering with morning dew a advanced development of feature of land lake wood hill undulating like sea in sunset after hour of tempest rivulet crystal stream with own peculiar murmur of melody grove teeming with most luxurious fruit of tropic valley carpeted with brightest green varied with nature own embroidery of flower development of scene be inexpressibly beautiful far surpassing finest effort of creative fancy wagner seated on sunny bank fell into profound meditation at length glancing rapidly around exclaimed aloud a if in continuation of chain of thought have already occupied mind oh if nisida be here here in delicious clime to be companion what happiness what joy never must regret world from isle for isle must be be separated never must long to return to communion with men from must be cut off here must eye of nisida cast forth ray of joy gladness upon everything around here must sweetest transition of sentiment feeling take place nisida must be island queen must deck with flower fair hand might weave into wildly fantastic arabesque oh must be happiness happiness so serene that never must love of mortal more truly blessed ala added a dreadful thought broke rudely upon delightful vision must be compelled to reveal to secret appalling secret of destiny that when period for transformation came round might place in safety wagner stopped abruptly rose hastily from seat on sunny bank remembrance of dreadful fate have spoiled one of most delicious waking dream in have ever indulged dashing hand against forehead rushed wildly toward chain of mountain intersected island suddenly stopped short for on ground before lay doublet of man doublet of fashion then prevalent in italy lifted up examined found nothing in pocket then throwing on ground stood contemplating for minute must be possible that be in part of italy that ship have be carried back to european continent during tempest of night be impossible that so lovely tract of land must remain uninhabited if known to men longer reflected more became convinced that be on island hitherto unknown to navigator on other shipwrecked individual have probably be cast why doublet must have be discarded must well understand a be thick heavy heat of sun be already intense although be not yet near meridian raising eye from doublet have occasioned reflection happened to glance toward knot of fruit tree at little distance attention be drawn to large bough hung down a if almost broken away from main stem approached little grove several circumstance now confirmed suspicion that be not only tenant of island at moment bough have be forcibly torn down very recently too several of fruit have be plucked off little sprig to have originally hung still remaining bearing evidence to fact if additional proof be wanting of human presence there be afforded by half eaten fruit be strewed about wagner now searched for trace of footstep such mark be not likely to remain in thick rich grass if trampled down must rise fresh elastic again with invigorating dew of single night grove where wagner observed broken bough scattered fruit be further from shore than spot where have found doublet reasoned that man whoever might be have thrown away garment when overpowered by intensity of heat have then sought shade refreshment afforded by grove therefore concluded that have gone inland most probably toward mountain whose rocky pinnacle of form now shone with hue in glorious sunlight overjoyed at idea of finding human being in spot have at first deemed totally uninhabited filled with hope that stranger might be able to give information relative to geographical position of isle even perhaps aid in forming raft by might together escape from oasis of mediterranean wagner proceeded toward mountain by degree wondrous beauty of scene became wilder more imposing le bewitching when reached acclivity of hill grove of fruit copse of myrtle citron of vine almond shrub be succeeded by wood of mighty tree further on still forest ceased fernand entered on wild region of almost universal desolation yet forming one of sublimest spectacle that nature can afford sound of torrent a yet concealed from view resembling murmur of ocean wave inspired feeling of awe be now for first time since entered on region of desolation having left clime of loveliness nearly mile behind attention be drawn to nature of soil be hard bituminous in appearance truth almost immediately struck there be volcano amongst mountain up be ascending be lava have produced that desolation cold hardened formed soil whereon walked be now past midday seated once more to repose limb wearied with fatigue of ascent overcome by heat be there intolerable at distance of about two hundred yard on right be solitary tree standing like sign to mark tomb of nature vegetation upon tree eye be fixed listlessly be marveling within how single scion of forest must have be spared when burning lava whenever eruption might have taken place have hurled down reduced to cinder verdant brother suddenly attention be more earnestly riveted upon dense wide spreading foliage of tree for bough be shaken in extraordinary manner something appeared to be moving about canopy of leaf in minute long unmistakable appalling object darted monstrous snake suspending by tail to one of lower bough disporting playfully with hideous head toward ground then with sudden coil drew back into tree entire foliage of be shaken with horrible gambolings of reptile wagner remembered frightful spectacle have beholden in ceylon awful shudder crept through frame for although knew that bore charmed life yet shrank with loathing from idea of having to battle with horrible serpent starting from ground rushed flew rather than ran higher up acclivity speedily entered on wild scene of rugged barren rock cared not winding of natural path now pursued might lead since have escaped from view of hideous boa constrictor gamboling in solitary tree wearied with wandering sinking beneath oppressive heat of sun wagner be rejoiced to find cavern in side of rock where might shelter repose entered lay down upon hard soil sound of torrent rolled still unseen amidst chasm toward have approached full near produced lulling influence upon in few minute eye be sealed in slumber when awoke found in total darkness started up collected scattered idea advanced to mouth of cavern sun have set outside cave azure twilight prevailed adjacent peak of mountain stood darkly out from partially though faintly illuminated sky while wagner be gazing long intently upon sublime grandeur of scene strange phenomenon took place first small cloud appeared on summit of adjacent hill then gradually cloud became more dense assumed human shape oh with what interest what deep enthusiastic interest did fernand contemplate spectacle for well stored mind at once suggested to that be now witness of wondrous optical delusion called mirage human being in plain on other side of range of mountain be subject of sublime scene might not be individual of whom be in search owner of doublet ah wherefore doe wagner start with surprise shadow of human being a gradually assumed greater density more defined shape in word a be now properly developed by reflection of twilight wore form of female be there then many inhabitant on opposite side of mountain be there only one female whose reflected image now beheld knew not at event pleasure of human companionship seemed within reach presence of doublet have convinced that there be man upon island now mirage showed semblance of woman vast colossal like dense dark shapely cloud stood that reflected being in sky for several minute remained thus though wagner must trace particular outline of feature yet seemed to a if female be standing in pensive attitude a twilight gradually subsided rather yielded to increasing obscurity image be absorbed likewise in growing gloom until dusky veil of night made entire vault above of one deep uniform purple hue then wagner once more returned to cavern with resolution of crossing range of hill on ensuing morn chapter xli island queen oh how beautiful how enchantingly beautiful seemed nisida a delicate foot bore glancingly along sunny bank of crystal stream to soft music of water how slight drapery wore set off rich undulation of magnificent form how wreath garland of fantastically woven flower became romantic loveliness of person that glowing hebe of south holding in fair hand light slim wand moving through delicious vale with soft abandonment of gait limb feared intrusion on solitude appeared that mediterranean island queen what though evening breeze disporting with raiment lifted from glowing bosom cared not need for sense of shame be there what though laid aside vesture to disport in sea at morn furtive glance did cast round haste did make to resume garment for whose eye save that of god beheld be happy ala there be moment when despair seized upon soul throwing on yellow sand on verdant bank must weep oh must weep such bitter bitter tear that who have be forced to contemplate character with aversion must now be compelled to pity yes for there be time when loveliness of island seemed hideous place of exile abhorrent monotony surrounded grasped clung to hemmed in a if be evil spirit having life power to torture thought of whom loved pondered upon grand scheme of existence felt cut off from world to there be so many tie to bind in have so much to do then must give way to anguish of soul anguish amounted to deepest blackest despair when glance wildly swept cloudless horizon beheld not sail speck on ocean to engender hope when tempest of grief passion be past must be angry with for having yielded to in order to distract thought from subject of gloom must bound toward grove light a fawn dazzling whiteness of naked polished ankle gleaming in contrast with verdure of vale one morning after nisida have be many many day on island be seated on sand having just completed simple toilet on emerging from mighty bath lay stretched in glassy stillness far a eye must reach when suddenly sprung upon foot threw affrighted look around have possessed faculty of hearing must be thought that be thus startled by sound of human voice have at instant broken upon solemn stillness of isle human voice emanating from short distance behind a yet saw one in few moment man emerged from nearest grove came slowly toward be dressed in light jerkin trunk breech tight hose boot in a italian gentleman of day save in respect to doublet of have none neither wore sword by side carried weapon of defense be evident approached island queen with mingled curiosity awe perhaps deemed to be goddess endowed with power will to punish intrusion on realm peradventure superstitious imagination dwelt on tale sailor told in time how mermaid who fed on human flesh dwelt on coast of uninhabited island assuming most charming female form lured into embrace victim whom shipwreck cast upon strand instead of lavishing on rapture of love made prey of ravenous maw be thought man drew near with evident distrust now why doe nisida countenance become suddenly crimson with rage why rush toward store still remained piled up on strand wherefore with rapidity of most feverish impatience doe hurl weapon of defense into sea save one naked sword with arm because eagle glance quicker than of man who be approaching have recognized ere have even be struck with suspicion relative to who be that man be stephano verrina now nisida summon thine energy to aid thee for strong powerful remorseless man devoured with lust for thee be near thou art so ravishingly beautiful in thy aerial drapery thy wreath of flower that anchorite must not view thee with indifference ah stephano start stop short advance suspicion have struck aquiline countenance brilliant large dark eye that matchless raven hair that splendid symmetrical maturity of form withal close compression of vermilion lip o nisida have be scanned in rapid detail by brigand nisida exclaimed yes be bounded toward with outstretched arm sharp sword be presented to chest lady stood with air of such resolute determination that stopped short gazing upon with mingled wonderment admiration heaven have never beheld so glorious specimen of female loveliness a whereon eye be fastened fastened beyond possibility of withdrawal how glossy black be that hair with diadem of white

indeed touching strand still so far in water that slight exertion must send completely afloat be large boat curiously shaped painted in variety of fantastic color have mast standing sail be lowered on closer inspection boat proved to be altogether unimpaired heaven delight to effect wise intention by natural mean thought wagner within surely must not have be through agency of nisida that boat be left upon shore added aloud after still closer inspection rope fastened to prow have be snapped asunder doubtless boat became detached from one of ship appeared off island yesterday said in low

weakness how must have hoped ever to rejoin without rendering again liable to witchery of siren tongue eloquence of silver toned voice persuasiveness of graceful manner be better that must depart be preferable that must lose preserve immortal soul thus reasoned that reasoning be effectual waited only long enough to assure that fleet be positively approaching island then knew that must depart without permitting to yield again to weakness have for few moment threatened to send back within sphere of nisida fatal influence tore away from point amongst height commanded view of side of island where be hastening around base of volcano reached defile leading to part of isle where have periodically fulfilled dreadful destiny a wehr wolf carefully avoiding outskirt of forest knot of large tree proceeded toward shore heart be rent with feeling of deep anguish a everywhere beheld trace of destruction left behind by recent run in horrible form of savage monster then too when melancholy thought have once again entered soul image of nisida appeared to flit before in most tempting manner more endeavored to banish from memory recollection of charm more vividly delineated did become at length jealousy took possession of suddenly stopping short in progress toward shore exclaimed aloud what if must be wooed won by if return to native land a assuredly now will may meet handsome elegant cavalier who will succeed in winning passion who love so well will be forgotten oh be madness to think that may posse clasp in arm press lip to hers feel fragrant breath fan cheek play with rich tress of beauteous hair oh bare thought be enough to goad to despair must not depart thus have separated if not in anger at least abruptly too abruptly considering how have loved that have wedded other in sight of heaven heaven repeated wagner tone changing from despair to deep solemnity heaven oh rejoice gave utterance to word for reminds that to regain nisida must lose heaven a if to fly from own reflection rushed on toward sea there stopped to gaze a oft before have gazed on mighty expanse seeming in liquid sunlight a stretched away from yellow sand resplendent lake of molten silver bounded by golden shore how like to human countenance art thou oh mighty sea thought wagner a stood with folded arm on brink of eternal water now thou hast smile a soft dimple a beautiful a ever appeared in face of innocence youth while joyous sunlight be on thee if dark cloud gather in heaven above thee thou straightway assumed mournful gloomy aspect thou growest threatening somber in how many varied voice dost thou speak oh treacherous changeful sea now thou whisperest softly a if thy ripple conveyed faint murmur of love if gale arise thou canst burst forth into note of laughter a thy water leap to shore with bounding mirth if wind grow higher thou canst speak louder more menacingly till when storm come on thou lashest thyself into fury thou boilest with rage thy wrathful voice vies with rush of tempest roar of thunder deceitful sea imaging beauty thought passion of earth within thy mighty depth too thou hast gem to deck crown of king brow of loveliness yet thou cravest for more more engulfest rich argosy with treasure thou insatiate sea in thy dark cavern be skeleton of myriad of human being whom thou hast swallowed up in thy fury whose bone be trophy thou retainest in thy fathomless depth a heart of man enshrineth relic of hope have wasted away perished thus thought wagner a stood gazing upon sea then so calm beautiful knew to be so treacherous when wearied of reflection scene inspired not daring to allow mind to dwell upon image of nisida repaired to nearest grove refreshed with cooling fruit plucked then extended ramble amongst verdant plain strove strenuously to divert thought a much a possible from one grand mournful idea departure of nisida from island vainly did endeavor to fix attention upon enchanting characteristic of clime flower appeared to le brilliant in hue than be wont to be fruit be le inviting verdure be of le lively green plumage of bird seemed to have lost bright gloss rendered color so gorgeous in sunlight for oh power of vision be almost completely absorbed in mind that mind be mirror wherein be now reflected with painful vividness incident of last few hour still be sustained in determination not to retrace way to spot where have left nisida when several hour have passed sun be drawing near western horizon exclaimed in moment of holy triumph have doubtless by time quitted island have be enabled to resist anxious longing prompted to return clasp in arm o god thank thee thou hast given strength wagner now felt so overcome with weariness after wandering roamings of so many hour especially a two preceding night have be sleepless for that sat down upon piece of low rock near shore quiet dreamy repose insensibly stole over in few minute slumber be profound now beheld strange vision gradually darkness appeared to surround grew le intense gauzy vapor rose in midst at first of palest bluish tint possible by degree obtained more consistency when nature began to undergo sudden change assuming semblance of luminous mist wagner heart seemed to flutter leap in breast a if with presentiment of coming joy for luminous mist became glorious halo surrounding beauteous holy form of protecting angel clad in white shining garment with snowy wing drooping slowly from shoulder ineffably supernally benign reassuring be look angel bent upon sleeping wagner a said in softest most melodious tone choir of heavenly host have hymned thanks for thy salvation after thou hadst resisted temptation of enemy of mankind when spoke to thee with own lip angel came to thee in dream to give thee assurance that thou hadst already done much in atonement for crime endangered thy soul warned thee then that much more remained to be done ere that atonement must be complete rest be now accomplished for thou hast resisted temptation of evil one when urged by tongue in melodious voice of lovely woman be thy crowning triumph day when thou shalt reap thy reward be near at hand for bond connect thee with destiny of wehr wolf will be broken thy name will be inscribed in heaven own book of life will give thee sign what thou seest hearest now in thy slumber be idle delusive vision conjured up by fevered brain sign will be on awaking from thy sleep retrace thy way to spot where morning thou didst separate from whom thou lovest there shalt thou find boat upon sand boat will waft thee to sicily there in town of syracuse thou must inquire for man whose year have numbered one hundred sixty two for man be who will teach thee how spell have made thee wehr wolf may be broken scarcely have angel finished speaking when dark form rose suddenly near that heavenly being wagner have difficulty in recognizing demon enemy of mankind appeared not armed with terror of countenance with withering scorn of infernal triumph for moment feature denoted ineffable rage then expression yielded to one of profoundest melancholy a if be saying within there be salvation for repentant man none for cloud now seemed to sweep before wagner eye denser more dense grew first absorbing in increasing obscurity form of demon then enveloping radiant being who still continued to smile sweetly benignly upon sleeping mortal until glorious countenance shining garment be no longer visible be black darkness around fernand wagner continued to sleep profoundly many hour elapsed ere woke slumber be serene soothing at length when opened eye slowly raised head from hard pillow mass of rock have formed beheld rich red streak in eastern horizon heralding advent of sun a various feature of island gradually developed to view a if breaking slowly from mist collected rearranged in mind detail of strange vision have seen for few minute be oppressed with fear that vision must indeed prove delusive sport of fevered brain for there seemed to be in component part wild admixture of sublime fantastic solemn language of angel appeared strangely diversified by intimation that must find boat upon shore that boat must convey to place where be to inquire for man whose age be one hundred sixty two year that man be being destined to save from doom of wehr wolf then again thought that heaven worked out design by mean often inscrutable to human comprehension blamed for having doubted truth of vision feeling of joy therefore accompanied reassurance of soul having poured forth thanksgiving for merciful intervention of providence in behalf tarried not even to break fast with fruit clustering at short distance from hastened to retrace way across mountain no longer doubting to find sign fulfilled boat upon shore now thought rose within must again behold nisida be fleet have seen on previous day still off island have departed bearing nisida away to clime expected not to behold fleet loved one for felt convinced that angel must not send back within influence of temptation be mistaken for having traversed volcanic range of height beheld naught to break uniform monotonous aspect of sunlit sea on drawing nearer to shore saw dark spot almost immediately in front of little hut nisida have constructed wherein have passed so many many happy hour now advanced with beating heart to hut door be closed be possible that nisida might be within oh how weak in purpose be strongest minded of mortal for instant pleasing hope filled wagner breast then again summoning resolution to aid opened door resolved must indeed be there to remain proof against appeal might make to induce to sacrifice to mundane prosperity immortal soul hut be empty lingered in for few moment reminiscence of happy hour passed therein swept across brain suddenly note nisida have left for met eye must be representing a something far more else far le than human be to declare did not experience feeling of intense pleasure at beholding memorial of love tear flowed down cheek a read following line hour approach dearest fernand when in probability will quit island think not that hope be unaccompanied by severe pang oh thou knowest that love thee will return to thee own adored fernand so soon a presence will be no longer needed at florence yes will come back to thee will not part until death will deprive thee of for must perish first while thou still remainest in glory of regenerated youth ala thou hast fled from morning in anger perhaps in disgust thou wilt forgive fernand if yielding to strange influence must not control urged appeal so well calculated to strike terror into thy soul oh must embrace thee ere leave isle ala thou comest not back thou hast fled to mountain be however in ardent hope of thy return to spot leave few line to assure thee of undying affection to pledge to thee intention to hasten back to thine arm a soon a possible to implore thee not to nourish anger against thy devoted nisida wagner placed letter to lip exclaiming wherefore did evil influence ever prove power on thee thou loving loved beauteous being why be thy hand raised against hapless agnes wherefore did fate make thee murderess why oh why didst thou assail with prayer tear reproach menace to induce to consign soul to satan nisida may heaven manifest merciful goodness unto thee even a same benign care have be extended to fernand then placed letter in bosom next to heart dashing away tear from long lash began to turn attention toward preparation for own departure from island a approached pile of store beheld light drapery nisida have lately worn have laid aside previous to leaving island also observed that rich dress have often seen examine with care be no longer there how beautiful must have appeared in garb murmured to ala return to great world to resume former character of deaf dumb nisida have often employed in gathering quantity of fruit form excellent aliment when dried in sun there be large supply of comestible now at disposal accordingly transferred to boat then procured quantity of fresh fruit lastly filled with pure water cask have be saved by nisida from corsair wreck

nisida once more alone island of snake have be lost sight of for hour fresh breeze of evening be playing upon cheek of lady nisida a sat at open casement of splendid saloon watching ship followed in wake of in be when sound of voice in adjacent cabin attracted attention a partition be slight person discoursing spoke italian must not help overhearing conversation there look place even if have possessed punctilious feeling to have prevented from becoming willing listener lady nisida be magnificent woman demetrius observed voice heroine immediately recognized to be that of grand vizier splendid aquiline countenance never before beheld such eye too such delicious mouth such brilliant teeth what pity 't be that have not use of tongue voice of such glorious creature speaking mine own dear italian language must be music how admirably be formed upon somewhat too large scale perhaps to precisely suit taste yet contour of shape be so well rounded so perfectly proportioned in most harmonious symmetry be le of hebe must be le charming be highness already enamored of donna nisida asked person to whom grand vizier have addressed preceding observation must confess that be demetrius replied ibrahim must give year of life to become favored lover for one day considering hope to see sister flora become wife of donna nisida brother francisco must restrain passion of mine within due bound wherefore do sigh thus heavily demetrius ala lord mention make of sister reminded that once possessed sister also returned greek in plaintive tone when returned to constantinople sought vainly for heaven know what have become of whether will ever see more poor calanthe treachery have doubtless be practiced toward thee give way to despair demetrius said grand vizier who know calanthe may have espoused youth on whom affection be set ah lord interrupted greek be considerate be kind on part of highness to suggest consolatory belief calanthe must not keep honorable bridal secret yet better be that must be dead that must have be basely murdered by ruthless robber than must live dishonored however will not intrude grief upon highness although friendship condescension highness manifest toward emboldens to mention sorrow in presence must must really console thee demetrius answered ibrahim with well affected sincerity for thou hast shown sincere friend to poor sister flora now that be alone together demetrius for almost first time since hastily undertaken voyage began let recapitulate in detail occurrence have led to enter upon present expedition real nature of alone know save imperial master moreover let continue to discourse in italian for thou canst speak language more fluently than can express in thy native greek besides rejoices heart added with sigh to converse in tongue so dear a of land gave birth if donna nisida only knew that in representative of mighty solyman have beholden brother of late menial flora how surprised must be be not prudent that must learn that fact lord observed demetrius for more reason than one since from sundry hint signora francatelli lordship worthy aunt dropped to be easy to believe that donna nisida be averse to attachment brother francisco have formed that ladyship indeed be mean of consigning highness ' sister to convent of carmelite albeit will not treat count francisco sister le worthily now that be in power said ibrahim pasha indeed matchless beauty must command forbearance be inclined to be vindictive moreover deaf dumb a be must not obtain least insight into plan therefore be unable to thwart reader may suppose that not one single word of conversation be lost upon nisida who have indeed learnt with most unbounded wonderment that high mighty grand vizier of ottoman empire man enjoying almost sovereign rank who bore title placed on level with greatest prince of christendom be brother of detested flora francatelli during short pause ensued in dialogue between ibrahim pasha greek confidant nisida stole gently up to door in partition between two saloon so fearful be of losing single word of discourse so deeply interested nearly concerned a be saying ere now demetrius resumed grand vizier who young a be have acquired methodical habit of wise statesman let examine in detail whole posture of affair in florence so may maturely consider precise bearing of case finally determine how to act for although have at disposal fleet might cope with even of enterprising england imperious france though twenty thousand well disciplined soldier on board ship be ready to draw sword at nod though a seraskier sipehsalar of army of sultan be responsible for action to majesty alone yet be not small thing demetrius to march invading force into heart of italy thereby risk war with christendom therefore let pause to reflect upon detail of incident occurred two month ago at florence good lord said demetrius will therefore begin with arrival in fair city to repaired with possible dispatch a soon a have received instruction of highness must appear that lord count of riverola reached florence same day a myself having be detained at outset of voyage home from rhodes by contrary wind severe storm be somewhat late in evening when called at cottage of signora francatelli highness ' worthy aunt for previously passed few hour in instituting by indirect mean a many inquiry concerning circumstance welfare a must be prudently made to grief however must not ascertain tidings concerning highness sister therefore came to mournful conclusion that disappearance still remained unaccounted for pondering upon sad tidings in respect must have to forward to highness having already devised fitting tale whereby to introduce to lordship aunt went to cottage a heard in course of subsequent conversation don francisco of riverola have just quitted highness ' aunt received with a much cordiality a must well show toward stranger then in accordance with pre arranged method of procedure stated be sent by son of debtor to estate of late signor francatelli to repay to of surviving relation large sum of money have be so long so very long owing loss of at time have mainly contributed to plunge signor francatelli into embarrassment added that son of debtor having grown rich have deemed act of duty honor to liquidate liability on part of deceased father tale be believed case of jewel have previously caused to be estimated by goldsmith in florence be received a mean of settling fictitious debt be forthwith welcome friend at worthy lady table stratagem be good one demetrius observed grand vizier proceed fear not that thou wilt weary with lengthened detail stayed to partake of evening repast continued greek signora francatelli grew confiding communicative a be nothing more than natural inasmuch a necessarily appeared in light of agent of worthy honorable man who have not forgotten obligation to family have suffered by father conduct assured signora that person by whom be employed to liquidate debt must be rejoiced to hear of success of francatellis ventured to make inquiry concerning orphan child of late merchant proceed demetrius said grand vizier spare not single detail highness will be obeyed returned greek though now speaking with considerable diffidence worthy lady shook head mournfully observing that alessandro son of late merchant be in turkey believed then rose hastily opening door leading to staircase called niece to descend a 'there be only friend present ' be overjoyed to learn thus unexpectedly that signora flora have reappeared when entered room must scarcely conceal delight beneath that aspect of mere cold courtesy became stranger to wear young lady appeared perfectly happy wonder for when have retired after staying few minute in room good aunt in fullness of confidence in not only related particular of signora flora immurement in carmelite convent also explained to motif for so long concealing young lady return home a have heretofore narrated to highness worthy aunt then informed that count of riverola have only returned that day from war that have made honorable proposal to on behalf of signora flora that be intended to sustain mystery veiled young lady existence safety in cottage until marriage must have be privately effected when must be too late for count friend to interfere renew persecution against lordship sister highness ' aunt dropped hint intimating suspicion that lady nisida be principal if not indeed sole mean of persecution have consigned innocent young maiden to carmelite convent more reflect on point in view of know of affair of donna nisida strange resolute character more be convinced that really perpetrated that diabolical outrage be not for young francisco sake must bring dishonor into family with sister will hope be soon connected with marriage tie exclaimed ibrahim must avenge sister wrong by forcing cruel nisida to yield to arm must not be nisida who overheard syllable curled lip while eye flashed fire at dark menace renegade have dared to utter qualified though be by avowal of motive must prevent from putting into execution no must not be repeated ibrahim yet be so wondrously beautiful must risk great deal to win love proceed demetrius now come to portion of narrative so nearly concern present proceeding yes lord god give highness success exclaimed

obtained suitable apartment in house of widow named dame margaretha there immediately took up abode having written letter to highness be anxious to get expedited to constantinople for be well aware that highness must be rejoiced to hear that beloved sister be indeed in land of living that be in good health that brilliant marriage be in store for accordingly spoke to dame margaretha relative to

desired in course of day that individual be fetched by mother to speak to on subject having repeated wish to asked several question seemed to indicate prying disposition curiosity a impertinent a be inconvenient in fact did not like manner at conceiving that conduct might arise from sheer ignorance from sinister motive still felt inclined to avail of assistance to procure messenger finding that must not sift at length said that have doubt friend of whom named venturo must undertake commission promised to return with individual in evening then left true to promise came back shortly after dusk accompanied by same venturo bargain be soon struck between promised to set off very night for rimini whence vessel be constantly sailing for constantinople gave handsome sum in advance also sealed

successful result proceed for although have hastily sketched particular to before yet be anxious to consider in more attentive detail having thus disposed of important business resumed young greek went out to saunter through street of florence while away hour two in viewing splendid appearance of charming city when lighted up with innumerable lamp of palace casino at length entered dark obscure street knew must lead toward river have not proceeded far down street when sound of many step rapidly approaching a if of patrol stepped aside under deep archway a chance must have stopped short within few pace of spot where be shrouded in utter obscurity of arch must have immediately passed on way be induced to stop by hearing voice recognized to be that of venturo whom believed to be already mile away from florence be perfectly astounded at discovery if have entertained doubt a to identity of voice be speedily cleared up by conversation between men have better separate here ' said venturo 'and break into at least two party a at bottom of street will come within blaze of light of casino on arno bank ' 'well spoken returned voice to increasing wonder recognized to be that of antonio landlady son 'you venturo will keep together friend can go on first will follow in few minute then unite again at angle of grove nearest to dame francatelli cottage what say lomellino ' a

resumed antonio 'the young count of riverola whom have traced to cottage evening will doubt be coming away about time will meet down there therefore will have nothing to do to carry off to cave 'why be count of arestino so hostile to young riverola ' demanded man who have answered to name of lomellino care nothing about young riverola one way other replied antonio 'but have persuaded lordship that if francisco be left at large will only use influence to mitigate vengeance of law against countess giulia who be friend of flora francatelli so count of arestino have consented to follow advice have francisco locked up until inquisition have dealt with countess lover marquis of orsini francatellis aunt niece ' have spite against man ' said lomellino 'truly have ' responded antonio 'you

'it be use to waste time talking of past let only think of present come men will go on first a already agreed ' three four armed ruffian then put in motion passing close by place where be concealed fortunately without discovering presence oh miscreant must have assuredly murdered faithful demetrius said grand vizier of lord there be little doubt returned young greek must confess that shuddered more than once while listening to discourse of cold blooded monster venturo antonio still remained behind for few minute discourse took place between gave still further insight into character of gang venturo ' said antonio after short pause examined packet be intrusted to ' ' have content be written in greek arabic such outlandish tongue for must not read word of ' answered venturo 'and so thought best plan be to destroy ' 'you acted wisely ' observed antonio 'by saint be good thought of mine to introduce to mother lodger a trustworthy messenger if only knew that have shared gold be laughing at

fulfilled lost way amongst maze of garden connected with villa bordering on arno much valuable time at crisis be wasted in circuit have to make to extricate from labyrinth reach bank of river at length drew within sight of cottage heart beat with terrible alarm a beheld light moving rapidly about house be too late ' thought yet rushed on toward place suddenly door opened by glare of light within saw three female closely muffled in veil led forth by several armed men instantly struck that third must be countess giulia of arestino to whom miscreant allude stopped short for knew that violent demonstration interference on part must be useless measure of kind must be adopted on behalf of victim a procession now advanced from cottage concealed in adjacent grove wondering whether count francisco have be already arrested whether have managed to elude enemy procession consisting of officer of inquisition with three female prisoner who be dragged rather than led along passed by

reality of appearance whose promise have be fulfilled up to point must not possibly mislead will obey command received even though must visit human dwelling in town of syracuse for heaven work out wise purpose in wondrous manner be not for to shrink from yielding obedience to order to pause to question propriety oh if can shake off demon influence weighs upon soul if can escape from shackle still enchain to horrible doom how sincere will be thanks to heaven how unbounded rejoicing a wagner have reached point in meditation stopped at door of barber shop of mean appearance pole with basin hanging to denoting that occupant of place combined a be usual in time function of shaver blood letter surgeon hastily surveying exterior of shop fancying that be precisely one at inquiry must commence barber in age being a famous for gossiping propensity a in fernand entered be immediately accosted by short sharp visaged dark complexioned old man who pointed to seat saying in courteous rather obsequious tone what be will signor fernand desired barber surgeon to shave superfluous beard trim hair while individual be preparing lather sharpening razor in most approved style of craft wagner asked in seemingly careless tone what news have good master in syracuse naught of importance signor be reply mere everyday matter syracuse be indeed wretchedly dull there be only two murder three attempt at assassination reported to lieutenant of police morning be nothing for town usually so active bustling a ours for part know have come over people stepped a far a dead house just now to view body of young lady unclaimed a yet who have head nearly severed from trunk last night then proceeded to great square to see whether execution be to take place to morrow really there be nothing of consequence to induce one to stir abroad in syracuse just at moment murder attempt at assassination be matter of very common occurrence amongst then said wagner inquiringly get perfect surfeit of signor returned barber now applying soap to customer face fail to create sensation now can assure beside one get tired of execution naturally enough said fernand have heard that there be very extraordinary personage in syracuse indeed there be one who have lived to remarkable age oldest person know of be abbot of st mary interrupted barber repeated wagner with feverish impatience be ninety seven three month signor great age truly responded barber surgeon fernand hope be immediately cooled down thinking that ought to put inquiry in direct manner said then be not true that have in syracuse individual who have reached wondrous age of century three score two holy virgin have mercy upon signor ejaculated barber if really put faith in absurd story people tell about rosicrucian ah then people of syracuse do talk on such matter said wagner conceiving that have obtained clew to aim object of inquiry have never heard signor of order of rosy cross demanded barber who be naturally of garrulous disposition who now appeared to have entered on favorite subject have heard in travel vague mention made of such order answered fernand never experienced curiosity to seek to learn more indeed may say that know nothing of rosicrucian save mere name well signor continued barber for common pas talk be a good subject a other one will ever persuade that there be really such order a brother of rosy cross that be possible for human being to attain power attributed to fraternity interest much by remark good leech exclaimed fernand pray to give further explanation with infinite pleasure signor since appear to desire returned barber still pursuing tonsorial duty must know that there be many wild legend story abroad concerning invisible being denominated rosicrucian one gain most general credence be that brotherhood be founded by certain christianus rosencrux german philosopher who fancied that art science might be developed in such manner a to confer greatest possible blessing on human race then aim of rosencrux be entirely good philanthropic said wagner interrogatively a matter of course signor said barber therefore if such man ever did live must have be insane visionary for who must believe that knowledge must possibly make richer happier better philosophy in universe must never convert shop into palace be wandering from subject good friend gently remonstrated fernand crave pardon signor let see oh recollect be talking of christianus rosencrux well signor fabled philosopher be monk very wise a well a very good man be only telling most generally received legend mind must not have think that believe so rosencrux finding that cloistral existence be inconvenient for prosecution of study traveled into east spent many year in acquiring knowledge handed down to wise men of clime by ancient magi chaldean visited egypt learnt many wonderful secret by studying hieroglyphic on egyptian pyramid forget how long remained in east be said that visited place of interest in holy land received heavenly inspiration on spot where saviour be crucified on return to europe saw full well that if revealed knowledge at once must be put to death by inquisition a wizard world must lose benefit of learning have acquired so say legend go on to recite christianus rosencrux then founded order of rosy cross be nothing more le than brotherhood of wise men whom initiated in secret with intention that must reveal from time to time small portion thereof thus give to world by very slow degree that immense amount of knowledge supposed must have stupefied astounded everybody if made public at once strange most strange thought wagner within must never have gleaned detail before eager a inquiry research in pursuit of knowledge have be heaven have willed everything for best be doubtless intended that salvation will proceed from very quarter be least known to concerning have manifested most contemptuous indifference in sphere of knowledge appear to be much interested signor said barber in same tale of christianus rosencrux there be too much intelligence depicted on countenance to allow to suppose that will place reliance on absurd story how be possible signor that order must have existed for so many year without one member ever having betrayed secret bind together moreover place of abode study be totally unknown to world if inhabited deepest cavern under earth accident must sooner later have led to discovery believe signor 't be naught save ridiculous legend though poor ignorant man hope have too much good sense too much respect for father confessor to suppose for minute that there be on earth set of men more learned than holy minister of church how long ago be christianus rosencrux reported to have lived demanded wagner suddenly interrupting garrulous narrow minded sicilian there be again ejaculated credulous declare that rosencrux discovered in east mean of prolonging existence though be born a far back a year be still alive have not barber turned aside at precise instant to fill ewer place towel for customer use must have be surprised by sudden start expression of ineffable joy denoted fernand emotion a by rapid calculation mentally made hero perceived that if rosencrux be born in alive at moment namely in age must be exactly one hundred sixty two be christianus rosencrux then said to whom have inquired for whom be to see who will dissolve spell have be placed upon where will seek whither will go to find secret abode duty of barber be completed wagner threw down piece of gold saying keep coin friend for discourse have greatly interested have indeed well deserved poor old man have never possessed in life so much money at one time so vast be joy that must only mutter few broken sentence to express gratitude require not thanks good friend said wagner one word ere depart knowest thou spot rumor indicates a abode of sect of whom have be speaking nay excellent signor replied barber there question master for in case rumor go not to such length a to afford hint for investigation must prove utter fallacy have heard signor concerning rosicrucian have learnt from lip know more wagner finding that further inquiry in quarter be useless took leave of old man traversing suburb entered town of syracuse chapter lix fernand be now at loss how to act felt convinced that be useless to institute further inquiry relative to whereabouts of secret order of rosy cross because have popular rumor ever hinted at clew in respect garrulous inquisitive barber must have be sure to hear of be not however disheartened very far from for be confident that same supernal power have hitherto directed be rapidly clearing away obstacle in path toward perfect emancipation from influence of evil one must carry
