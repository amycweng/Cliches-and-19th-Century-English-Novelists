ceased to read to ruth mother for know always think together answered joseph eagerly dont know how have be longing for evening for verse have chosen have made think so much with thinking can not quite satisfy ourselves what be boy be one dear father repeated on death bed mother have often thought of since feared must make sorrowful if spoke of for first year two a found ruth have thought of wished explained also said must ask to talk about to night repeat ruth pronounce hebrew so prettily timidly sweetly ruth said first in hebrew then in english commit way unto lord trust also in will bring to pas way continued child be word first puzzled have explained to so plainly understand better now tell then sarah dear said aunt seems to said that word way have many meaning in verse show thy way o lord think mean action in verse lord made known way unto moses act unto child of israel think way mean thought there be several in proverb interposed simeon must make regard way a path be to tread a for instance who leaveth path of righteousness to walk in way of darkness ruth want to know in of way be to regard in verse persisted joseph a meaning outward action inward thought dear child replied mother have thought long on verse be glad have chosen for discussion perhaps know little joseph that must think to act that be very seldom good bad action be performed without previous thought consequently if must be pure in act must commit thought unto lord how be to do mother asked leah by constant prayer love by endeavouring wherever be whatever may be doing to remember god know thought before have word long before becomes action be apt perhaps to indulge in wildest thought simply because imagine secure from observation from human observation be secure not from father who be in heaven therefore must endeavour so to train thought a to banish dare not commit unto god be there not thing dear aunt too trivial too much mingled with earthly feeling to bring before being of such ineffable holiness purity inquired sarah in voice notwithstanding effort audibly faltered ah be what want so much to know added joseph must not forget dear sarah resumed mr perez that god be god of love compassion a infinite a holiness that throb of pain joy in creature love have formed be felt a well a ordained by nation have god so near to a israel of others ought to derive realize comfort from belief that know nature in striving after righteousness a well a in sin know temptation struggle far better than dearest earthly friend loving mercy towards be infinitely stronger therefore can better commit secret thought feeling unto keeping than to of nearest friend on earth may child do mother yes dear boy father have child in tender care guiding even a of more experienced age accustom yourselves while engaged in thought to ask can ask father blessing on thought on action lead to rest assured conscience will give true answer if say dismiss trifling sinful meditation on instant send up brief prayer to god for help will hear if on contrary conscience approve thought encourage a leading nearer closer more lovingly to god be not close communion more necessary for woman than for men mother inquired simeon woman may need more dear boy believe be equally if not more necessary for man think of many temptation to evil men have in intercourse with world daily almost hourly call for conquest of inclination passion without very strong incentive can never be subdued one unguarded moment labour of year after righteousness may be annihilated man may not need comfort of close communion so much a woman yet more requires strength nothing be so likely to keep from sin a committing thought even a action unto lord thank dear mother first bit be clear said joseph now want second third be most puzzling of will come to by bye surely know what mean by to trust in joseph said leah think do sister mine for be mother humble trust in lord supported in sorrow that saw felt though be child hesitated well boy to trust think mean to have faith now henry stevens said other day jew have faithand how can trust then dearest joseph let companion so mislead answered mother earnestly know be charge often brought against be always from who know religion who judge only from who by word action condemn jew must have faith not only in existence of god in sacred history god inspired be jew must feel faithbelieve god hears will answer prayer however fervent be of avail without faith very existence must be enigma whole life misery oh believe dear child a nation have god so near so nation have so much need of faith nation have so experienced strength peace fulness brings how doe verse mean that be to trust in lord mother asked ruth belongs to first last division of verse love if commit way unto lord trust also in remember one be of avail without other then will bring to pas ah be be so glad have come to eagerly exclaimed joseph mother doe mean can mean that father will grant prayer will give what most wish if be for good boy if wish be acceptable in sight if will tend to eternal a well a temporal welfare bring before in unfailing confidence believing firmly that will answer in own good timewe may rest assured that will answer that will grant prayer be for good may not be what most wish for resumed joseph despondingly boy if what wish for be not for good be not more merciful kind to deny than to grant remember god know better than know may ask what must lead to evil temporally eternally if for wise merciful purpose even good desire be not granted be assured that peace strength healing will be given in stead little circle looked very thoughtful a impressive voice of widow ceased sarah seemed more than usually moved for a bent over little bible have opened at verse tear one by one fell silently upon page whether ruth heard drop from seat close by cousin felt that hand caressingly held trembled know not child rose threw little arm around neck do remember who be wrote verse be considering said widow after pause king david answered joseph simeon together then see be prosperous monarch peaceful lawgiver one whose life have passed in trial compared to severest

faith very prayer at time seemingly unheededyet be faithful servant of god who exclaims commit way unto lord trust also in will bring to pas know not exact time wrote word know wrote from experience for did not god indeed bring happiness to pas for if think of life of who wrote blessed word a well a word must derive strength comfort from reflection yes yes see feel now exclaimed joseph eagerly a

criminal one of first most important point on ezra nehemiah insisted be putting away of strange wife be idolater jeanie worship same god believe in same creed therefore be belief in one god more dangerous ought to keep yet more distinct now that be mingled up amongst who know god serve though not a do think thus dear son therefore may do be to pray that happiness expect may be realized in praying for of course doubt though still can not imagine why sarah have not spoken do believe so terrible reprobate that there be chance for happiness temporally eternally spoke bitterly perhaps harshly for have longed for to speak silence strangely painfully reproached did not choose to know why so vented in bitter word to anger felt towards opinion can be of little value after aunt answered meekly believe dear cousin if jeanie be only a blessed happy together a wish will be one of happiest couple on earth do believe said passionately springing towards seizing hand sarah dear sarah forgive be harsh bitter to who be always better angel say forgive repeated word with strong emphasis upon did not know that have given anything to forgive reuben replied struggling to smile if think have do forgive from very heart bless for word said still gazing fixedly in face calmly met look thank god one misery be spared muttered to then added think may be happy trust will if please god to

reuben may never repent engagement then young man actually trembled at startling earnestness of word will surely will not marry in church brother timidly inquired joseph must can not help hoarsely interposed simeon who have remained sitting in moody silence for time yet must say be apostate deserter from faith said have something to ask mother reuben said ruth pressing close to side for feared painful altercation between brother might recommence have answered fear be useless now mother jeanie hoped to have offered hometo have entreated to live with return to comfort be yours must seek to give joy after have passed evening fear have hoped in vain wonder dared hope muttered simeon must mother live with one who life not a jew whose dearest pride be to seem in point like stranger with whom life thank for kind will dear son replied widow affectionately though sorrowfully be right in thinking can not be be too old too ailing to mingle now with stranger can not leave own lowly dwelling can not give up form ordinance have learned to love believe obligatory upon bring wife to if indeed doe not scorn poor jewish mother will meet love from mine reuben flung impetuously on neck felt whole frame tremble a with choking sob sister sarah joseph reiterated mother word simeon alone be silent half hour passedan interval painful to party despite exertion of sarah widow to make cheerful then reuben rose to depart affectionate embrace warm good night god bless be welcomed returned a warmly by then looked for simeon youth be standing at farther end of apartment in deepest shadow arm folded on breast lip compressed eye fixed sternly on ground simeon exclaimed reuben a approached with frankly extended hand simeon be brother let part friend give up intended marriage come back to faith have deserted be brother answered simeon sternly if not be severed for ever be a will then answered reuben controlling anger with violent effort must need brother friend will find in god of father demand not violence like doe nothe doe not simeon beseech command part thus with brother on love duty to a only remaining parent command mother said mildly imperatively for once spoke in vain leah sarah joseph according to different character sought to soften dark cloud only thickened on brow at moment light form pressed through clasping knee looked up in agitated face a if sightless orb have more than common powerand ruth be that spoke brother said in clear sweet voice brother father bade love brother even if turned aside from hold most sacred most dear stood around death bed promised thisto love to end brother will not break vow father look upon hears still there be strong terrible struggle on part of simeon heavy groan of repentant anguish broke from very heart of reuben father poor father did so love will still hate simeon gasped forth moment brother be clasped in others arm chapter iii have be with most simple heartfelt prayer that widow perez have sought to instil beautiful spirit breathing in verse forming subject of sabbath conversation in heart of child yet ere evening closed how sadly painfully have faith be tried how bitterly did feel that to prayer there seemed indeed answer be firstborn whom have daily almost hourly committed to lord for sought with whole heart to trust that must in deep mercy awaken boy to error of way did appear a if indeed gracious promise must be fulfilled lord must indeed bring to pas ala farther farther did now seem removed from fulfilment by marriage with gentile what must ensuea yet more complete estrangement from father faith mother heart indeed felt breaking quiet ever gentle who loving child might trace bitter grief there be not wanting very many to give mother blame of son course of acting what else must expect by weak indulgence be almost universally said why did not threaten to cast off if persisted in sinful connection instead of encouraging such thing in other child of course did by receiving reuben a usual why have not commanded on peril of parent curse to break off intended match then must have done duty a be must be something very extraordinary if other child did not follow elder brother example widow might have heard unkind remark heeded little for have long learned that spirit guiding blessed religion husband have felt practised be too often misunderstood undervalued by many of co religionist idea of love bringing back wanderer be by many thought too perfectly ridiculous ever to be counted upon conscience be at rest none own heart god knew how have striven to bring up firstborn a must go how agonizing have ever felt failure of struggle prayer in conduct of son last act more agonizing than knew aye felt secure that of other child needed severity towards reuben to prevent following example in saw fruit of effort in education knew that felt brother wandering from beloved faith too sorrowfully ever to walk in way saw enough of poor mother silent uncomplaining grief to suppose for moment that absence of harshness towards reuben proceeded from approval of marriage lifted up fervent cry for strength always to resist such fearful temptation to adhere to faith of father even until death be quite aware that by far greater number of reader widow perez will be either violently condemned contemptuously scorned a weak mean spirited foolish woman can only say that if so be sorry so few have power of understanding that loving piety spiritual religion of character must find so faint echo in jewish heart consequence of forbearance will be too clearly traced in simple tale to demand further notice on own part must only ask with humility reader of class grade to recall one single instance in parental violence severity even coupled with malediction have ever succeeded in bringing back wanderer to fold if so will grant that idea of love forbearance effecting more than hate violence be dangerous false to return to tale there be in little household bowed like mother in grief sarah have believed that be care for reuben spiritual welfare have engrossed so muchthat be a distinct from temporally a from rude shock awakened from dream oh so fearfully wild tumult of thought pressing on heart brain need description from first year of residence with aunt reuben have be dear to affection so strengthening increasing with growth so mingled with being

saved to sarah life be one cheerless blank heart so chilled stagnant seemed a be power of prayer be gonethere must be darker woe in store perhaps very determination to conceal feeling from eye increased difficulty of self conquest day after day passed aunt cousin saw nothing different from usually quiet cheerful way might be that suspected nothingthat even widow knew not sarah trial be yet greater than own at night be that effect of day control be felt week passed time seemed to bring respite can trust if can not pray clear still voice of conscience one night breathed in ear of poor sufferer so strangely distinct seemed a if spiritual voice have spoken come back to father god who have love tenderness for allwho love despite of indifference neglectwho have balm for wound even such a thine doth not say cast burden on will sustain trust in word sin no more be strange almost awful in dead stillness of night low piercing whisper have effect for hot tear streamed down like rain upon deathlike cheek word of prayer faint broken yet still trustful burst from that sorrowing heart brought balm from hour stagnant misery be at end sarah awoke to duty alike to god a to then be felt to full how unutterably precious be close commune with father in heaven aunt counsel have infused where must have turned for comfort have be taught to regard a too far removed from earth earthly thing to love be approached time passed reuben marriage took place at time appointed still with seemed prosperity be impossible to see not to love gentle wife still in seeming mere child so delicate in

within himyet be not christian be wife except in name believed there be god at least said did life smiled on be not needed so lived without simeon true to prejudice must not meet brother wife did mother demand such from be enough that with reuben when chanced to meet be on kindly term ruth appeal have touched heart for remembrance of father be a omnipotent a wish have be during lifetime interest of brother alike temporal a eternal be however too widely severed to permit confidence between so passed on separate way loving perhaps in inward heart year apparently more more divided about six month after reuben wedding sarah received letter caused great uneasiness reader may remember at conclusion of first chapter mentioned isaac levison having written to daughter stating be again well to do in world offering affluence cessation from labour if liked to join know also that sarah refused offer feeling that inclination duty bade remain with benefactor of youth when be in affliction

heyward with vehemence be because need most domestic woman for happiness tell marry clara stanley be determined bluelight dark imaginable shadea poet philosopher preacherwrites for periodicallays down law on subject of literature from fairy tale to philosophical treatise ministerial sermon for heaven sake have nothing to do with literary woman be very antipode to domestic happiness fly before peace be seriously at stake granville dudley looked evidently felt disturbed at first startled incredulous compelled friend to reiterate charge proof nothing loath charles heyward brought forward so many particular so many fact concerning lady in question from near relationship to family with whom lived have be enabled easily to collect that granville unable to disapprove even contradict one of sank back on chair almost with groan why dear sober minded philosophic friend can not surely have permitted heart to escape wise keeping so effectually in so short space of time that can not call back

not display granville one must imagine be whit cleverer than other people have pretension air of superiority writes writes there rub love toowhich be worse stilland public literary character can not be domestic wife one who be ever pining for receiving fame can never be content with praise of one one who be always creating imaginary feeling can have none for reality to speak more plainly who love thousand time in idea can never love once in reality so say clara stanley can not value sufficiently ever to posse rich honour of being chosen a wife be angry with bluntness granville only speak because love granville dudley be not angry perhaps have be better for happiness if have be a then must not have be so easily convinced by specious reasoning of friend conversation lasted that evening when dudley retired to rest be with firm determination to watch clara stanley few week longer if really be a heyward stated to dismiss from thought at once even quit england for time rather than permit momentary fancy to make miserable for life now though charles heyward have spoken in language of world be not by mean worldly man granville dudley though have listened be convinced unjust

practice be equal to theory nay did reach ear though banished thought with horror that father early death might have be averted have received more judicious care tender watchfulness from literary wife mr dudley however died before son strong affection have be entirely blunted through apparent indifference therefore only permitted to remember fault a being necessary consequence of literature genius encouraged in woman be old experienced enough at time of death to distinguish between real genius true literary aspirings willow representative superficial knowledge overbearing conceit a be case be not in least surprising that must be so easily convinced of truth plausibility of heyward reasoning that charles heyward aware of dudleys youth have endured from literature authorship in mother must be so very eager to save from repetition in closer relationship of wife clara stanley be mere pretender to genius wise judicious training of affectionate parent have saved from irregularity of temper indecision of purpose inconstancy of pursuit because have characterised wayward one be regarded a peculiar to genius earliest childhood have displayed more than common intellect constant companion

reader may judge by sketch have given in vocabulary authorship learning be synonymous with romance folly worse still a dooming possessor unavoidably to state of single blessedness therefore to be shunned a must plague that clara devoted to literary pursuit same number of hour one miss barclay did to music be mechanical not mental part to oriental mezzotinting to creation of wax work berlin wool etc be not of least consequence horror of blueism be such that to prevent supposition of approval of claras mode of life never lost opportunity of bewailing unfortunate propensityand of so impressing who visited at house with idea of great learning obtrusive wisdom that gentle unpretending manner of authoress must not weigh against found universally shunned a something too terrible to be defined with write on hope on once wrote to intimate friend struggling to feel that if indeed accomplish good will not live in vain own personal loneliness sorrow will be of little consequence oh how different be to write merely for good of others to same effort to same goal pursued under influence of sympathy affection because woman have mind be supposed to have heart have occasion therefore for sweet charity of life when by if possible more than other be imperatively needed others may find pleasure satisfaction in foreign excitement to home be in if there be one to love therebe parent

dear mary to love for must be unreturned simply because be general belief that authoress can have time capability of emotion save for creation of own mind so wrote clara though at time knew not how soon word must be verified a soon a term of mourning have expired though little inclined for exertion conquered own shrinking repugnance to asserting adopting own right to astonishment of mr mr barclay accepted of invitation courtesy have sent though entered into merely a duty society gradually became source of pleasure in discovery that aunt circle be not of same frivolous kind then slowly surely pleasure deepened into intense enjoyment from conversation attention of granville dudley whom met constantly though did not visit uncle clara be so very unlike cousin whose endeavour to gain husband be somewhat too broadly marked that dudley have be irresistibly attracted towards fancy interview so strengthened that began very seriously to question own heart a to whether really be in love a miss stanley name be not generally known to literary world lady at whose house granville mostly met be scarcely aware that be anything more than amiable sensible strongly feeling girl granville dudley knew nothing of claim to literature authorship till conversation with charles heyward near close of season revealed a have said very next time met dudley half fearfully half resolutely led subject to literature literati drew from claras own lip avowal dreaded in happy state of feeling presence always created at first imagined thus spoke from interest sympathy in did enthusiastic a be wont in conversation with who thought understood said more on subject enjoyment resource than have ever done in london granville said nothing in reply must have chilled at time yet when evening be over claras heart sunk within knew not wherefore save that secret foreboding whispered within conversation have sealed fate dudley must not trust happiness with at one other party be to meet ere season closed veriest devotee to ball soires must not have longed for more than poor clara who looked forward to a confirmer dispenser of fear morning of day on be to take place little emily youngest of family be seized with violent attack of fever increased a evening advanced so happened that barclay family who be out be engaged that evening mr mr barclay two elder daughter at card musical soire other two brother under chaperonage of mr smith gouvernante at ball to clara looked forward with so much eagerness what be to be done child must not be left without mr smith what be to become of sister be impossible for to go alone equally impossible for mother father sister of little sufferer to give up fashionable party for dreadful doom of sitting by sick bed look hint of variety be levelled at clara who with usual benevolence have stationed close by little cousin ever ready to administer kindness relief at other time must not have hesitated moment with restless craving to see granville dudley again giving up only chance for time at least be so exquisitely painful must not offer to remain mr barclay however seeing hint of avail at length directly entreated that a be le fond of going out than one else might be glad of excuse to give time to book writing must really be doing mr barclay especial favour if must stay nurse emily claras high spirit strong sense of selfish indulgence obtained such unusual dominion that have well nigh proudly refused little sufferer looked in face so piteously entreated so pleadingly to remain that ever awake to impulse of affection miss stanley consented disappointment be bitter one though claras strong sense of rectitude caused to reproach for keenness a uncalled for what did granville dudley care for that must so think of vain question backward glance on intercourse convinced that have thought of have singled out to pay attention gentle winning deference from man of honour such a world designated must not be misconstrued there be one comfort however in not meeting if knew what kept at home must scarcely continue to believe that only thought be of literature authorship little did know before departed on several way be settled in barclay parliament that nothing be to be said of little emilys illness lest people must fancy contagious send more invitation so closing chance of matrimony for season before be quite time if clara be asked for dearswhich be not at likelyyou can say know that must not leave writing correcting proof such literary business leave to matilda be sharp enough particularly in framing excuse for rival whom know be glad to get out of way folk say granville dudley have literary mother be not likely to wish for literary wife young lady answered with knowing nod performed mission so admirably that after evening granville dudley disappeared power certainly have to separate from clara to attach to herself be not quite so easy answer have given to granvilles inquiry after cousin be so carelessly naturalthat clara a authoress literary character have so many superior claim that party everything else must be secondary followed up by high encomium on great talent must say genius be thought almost pity to be so gifted a incapacitated from common sympathy dutiesthat confirmed granvilles previous fear while made almost turn sick with disappointment anguish for seemed only then felt how completely have become part of vowed to tear from influence ere be too late very next morning left london be right heyward suppose will be happy man again day other not now so try to philosophise into being so good fellow perhaps after have be frightened at shadow hang be sorry said so much at first that emily barclay have be very ill be so that eventful night be fact in opinion clara stayed to nurse because others be too selfish sentimental excuse to obtain time for dear delightful solitary musing such thing be too late heyward be literary so can not be domestic will not think of more be not quite so easy to do a to say granville dudley be man of world far too proud resolute to bow seem to bow beneath feeling particularly when believed on point of loving one who be utterly incapacitated from giving heart in return went abroad travelled during remainder of summer joined first parisian circle in autumn before year closed be married man ii eight year have passed clara

longing yet more for kindly heart on to rest own let not be mistaken be not for love in world adaptation of word needed be parent fostering carea brother supporting friendshipa sister sympathy one friend to love for herself for quality of heart not for labour capability of mind from time heard of dudleys marriage thought of individual happiness a wife faded from imagination only effort be to rouse energy to supply object of interest affection so prevent listlessness despondency too often fate of disappointed woman have at first be indeed painfully difficult task for heart have whispered be because be different from fellow because be what world termed literary learned granville have shunned few word undesignedly carelessly spoken by charles heyward relative to dudleys dislike to female literature from effect on mother confirmed idea made shrink from former favourite pursuit too have character to sustain once more compelled to work believing that talent be lent to be

happily that have refused simply because must not permit unloved reality to usurp place of still loved shadowall doubt think be answered of granville dudley must never hear trace of seemed lost within last few year newspaper have indeed often teemed with praise speech of sir dudley granville though conjunction of name have at first riveted eye made heart turn strangely sick banished thought a folly be granville dudley not dudley granville whom have too fondly loved miss stanley have resided about seven year with mr langley when application be made to latter lady to receive only child of sir dudley granville a pupil child be motherless in such very precarious health that milder climate of devonshire have be advised a combined with extreme care only chance of rearing to womanhood mr

be yet be first word heard for look manner be sufficient introduction benevolent physician who have instant quitted little patient grasped sir dudleys hand with reassuring pressure baronet tried to return with smile quivering lip must only gasp forth ejaculation of thankfulness sinking on chair covered face with hand let see incomparable young woman preserver of child passionately exclaimed a dr bernard mr langley after describing progress crisis of lauras illness attributed unexpected recovery under providence to incessant care watchfulness of miss stanley physician declaring utmost skill have be without of avail being assured appearance must not injure laura who be in truth daily expecting eagerly followed mr langley to room paused moment on threshold unobserved laura be sitting up in little bed supported by pillow looking pale delicate indeed smiling with joyous animation in childhood be so sure sign of returning health dressing with greatest zest beautiful doll with plentifully supplied wardrobe lay beside near bed seated by small table covered with book writing be clara who by rapid movement of pen immovable attention be evidently deeply engrossed in employment sir dudley must not see face for be bent down even profile turned from strange thrill shot through a gazed oh look miss stanley how beautiful work show now be dressed how kind be to make pretty thing can do button will do for clara laid down pen with smile to comply with child request a did so laura laid little head caressingly on bosom saying fondly dear dear miss stanley wish papa must come must thank for goodness much better than can wish must come for sake own dearestnot to thank though will not love le for being so grateful laura be reply in voice whose low musical tone brought back a by flash of light to sir dudleys heart feeling thought memory of past year thought be hushed for ever miss stanley clara inscrutable providenceis to owe child exclaimed springing suddenly forward clasping little child to heartone moment covering lauras upturned face with kiss next turning earnest grateful gaze on astonished clara for instant heart grew faint for fatigue of long continued nursing have weakened must realize in agitating moment lapse of ten year since have last looked on face listened to richly expressive voice time have passed over heart leaving early dream unchanged vainly strove to feel how long period have flown all seemed thick traceless mist when succeeded in shaking off that prostrating weakness forcing to remember be sir dudley granville not granville dudley who have thus addressed still one fact be certain object of first only affection be at side once moreit be child care have saved day after day did clara stanley sir dudley granville pas hour together by couch of laura though conscious secret be still own grateful that after first burst of natural feeling granvilles manner to be only that of obliged appreciating friend claras peculiarly delicate feeling must have kept from lauras room during visit of father child be restless uncomfortable whenever be absent granville so evidently entreated continued presence that to keep away be impossible be during pleasant interview sir dudley related cause of change of name have become most unexpectedly heir to godfather sir william granville who have left estate on sole condition of adopting for heir name of granvillesir granville granville added with smile be not sufficiently euphonious so have placed dudley first instead of last alluded in term of warmest admiration to work wondered at own stupidity in never connecting miss stanley of lauras letter with authoress have once known very peculiar smile beamed on lip of clara a thus spoke did not say meaning one day six seven week after granvilles appearance at ashford clara have just comfortably seated herself at desk after seeing laura ensconced in little pony chaise when be startled by hearing sir dudleys voice in accent of unusual
