strangely blind not to do so villager understood not that preoccupation of mind doe indeed render blind to thing save to one intense subject of thought complaint be made to heard by rector who faithful to trust visited parish made inquiry heard tale concerning curate startled charity finally spoke severely to arthur on careless neglectful conduct must have be better for arthur have pride

quite indescribable that arthur be unhappy that profession be more than ever distasteful to soon discovered real cause of feeling tried in vain to probe saw with deepest regret that former exhortation

upon stunning young mind with sense of scarcely defined yet most painful consciousness arthur myrvin have looked to emmeline return to oakwood with many mingled feeling might be perhaps even a sister

be softened though be strengthened in resolve four day afterwards very evening of day when mr howard have alluded to neglect of duty before herbert cousin tendered resignation coldly proudly refusing explanation assigning reason for so doing except that wished to obtain situation a tutor in nobleman gentleman family about to travel so greatly have mind of mr howard be prejudiced against unhappy young man by false representation of parishioner that rather rejoiced at myrvin determination having more than once feared if conduct did not alter must be compelled to dismiss from curacy while pleased at being spared task so adverse to benevolent nature yet must not refrain from regarding strange apparently sudden resolution a tacit avowal of many of error with be charged feeling thus will be subject of surprise mr howard accepted curate resignation while did so must not refrain from giving young man kind good advice a to future life arthur aware rector regarded through medium of prejudice received not in same kind spirit a be offered listened silently indeed with air of pride checked mr howard really kind intention in favour rector aware that mr hamilton must be annoyed displeased at circumstance did not inform of myrvin intention till few week after caroline marriage not indeed till felt compelled by wish to obtain approval of young clergyman who have be pupil be eager to secure situation near mr howard to whom therefore curacy arthur have resigned must be indeed most welcome gift mr hamilton be even more disturbed when be told than mr howard have expected seemed a if arthur have forgotten tie of gratitude mr hamilton service to father even forgetting to certainly demanded determined resolution to assign reason for proceeding one above mentioned told against mr hamilton aware of many evil report flying about concerning young man immediately imagined that resigned curacy fearing discovery of misdemeanour might end even more seriously herbert too be deeply pained that friend have left to learn such important intelligence from lip of instead of imparting explained apparent contradiction of arthur conduct last month surprised grieved yet mystery

cheek bloodshot eye sympathy thus ever kept alive in one so keenly susceptible of woe of others a be herbert hamilton sympathy continually excited prevented decrease of interest regard percy be irritated annoyed myrvin have disappointed conduct in return for mr hamilton kindness appeared a ungrateful a unaccountable caused more fiery temper of young heir of oakwood to ignite burst forth in flame in presence of arthur whose meek forbearance now began to fancy silent suffering tamed after brief period caused with usual frankness quick transition of mood to make apology for violence be touched by young man manner continued not on same term of friendly intimacy a formerly mr hamilton charitable nature heightened also by herbert unchanging regard must not permit to credit tale be

determined have even requested ellen edward who be still friend to say little concerning during stay at llangwillan if revealed intention implored to use influence with father to reconcile to bitter disappointment of cherished hope have determined not to return to llangwillan felt must not bear to see parent with consciousness that have acted contrary to wish must not therefore do so till have succeeded in obtaining situation so earnestly desired a period when must resign curacy now rapidly approached no longer refrained from writing to father ellen proved regard for father son by affectionately endeavouring to soothe mr myrvin disappointment solicitude be a son expected extreme succeeded at length in persuading must obtain situation so much desired arthur must be more likely

pallid feature attenuated form be such constant evident proof of mental a well a bodily fever that mr hamilton must not look on without pain be still inwardly restless uneasy though evidently struggling for cheerfulness mr maitland to whom necessary particular of tale have be told gave a opinion that secret anxiety still rested on mind must be much better removed real cause of solicitude parent very easily penetrated mr hamilton fearing effect of excitement in still very delicate state have refrained from telling all have accomplished in young myrvin favour during sickness on hearing mr maitland report parent felt assured be for information pined therefore determined on instantly giving relief be with utmost tenderness caution mr hamilton alluded to subject seating by couch playfully asked if must promise to get well sooner if gratified by pleasing intelligence that arthur myrvin character be cleared that enemy have be discovered design exposed obliged to leave village whole population be now a violently prejudiced in arthur favour a have formerly be against provoked also with for blind folly in receiving encouraging idle report propagated against not one of now

kindling on pale cheek rapid movement with caught father hand looked in face a if fearful must deceive minute striking circumstance must have betrayed truth in voice almost inarticulate from powerful emotion implored to tell particular tenderly complied have followed said advice confronted nurse langford with unprincipled man who have dared accuse fellow creature of crime in reality committed by reckless a be have shrunk in guilt shame before accusation be indeed accusation of dying avowing real perpetrator of sin offered large bribe for secrecy a might be expected widow indignantly refused be easy to perceive art have worked on old woman mary grandmother to believe friend arthur foe poor old creature failing intellect assisted plan while report have insidiously circulated against unfortunate young man also confirmed tale little aware that widow langford have be almost mother to poor girl villainy have ruined that be likely to have heard truth being quite unconscious have attended dying moment published falsehood without feeling of remorse shame hoping by so doing effectually to serve employer effect disgrace of myrvin completely screen mr langford now found be time indeed for to come forward perform promise to emmeline by proving young myrvin innocence hesitated how to commence be therefore relieved pleased at entrance inquiry of mr hamilton promised to obey direction faithfully only imploring to clear mr myrvin character expel farmer jefferies from village from time of settling there said have be one scene of anarchy confusion frankly avowing in answer to question of mr hamilton that be for miss emmeline sake be so anxious be sure be interested in mr myrvin fate therefore have mentioned unhappy fate of poor mary brooke to prove to young man have attended to duty many other startling proof of jefferies evil conduct have good widow by silent watchful attention be enabled to discover a also convincing evidence that young curate have not be so neglectful faulty a have be reported valuable information now imparted to master to be used by in way discretion might point out promising to be ever ready at slightest notice to prove have alleged mr hamilton carefully examined circumstance reflected for brief period on mode of action finally assembling principal inhabitant around in public school room of village laid before important fact have collected besought impartial judgment owned said that too have be prejudiced against mr myrvin whose life while among many circumstance have combined to render unhappy now heartily repented injustice for felt convinced greater part of what have be alleged against be false evil report proved have originated from machination of jefferies implored to consider whether must still regard word of one against whom so much evil have now be proved a have formerly done must really prove that young curate have in truth be guilty of misdemeanour with have be charged mr howard who be present seconded word acknowledging that too have be prejudiced adding that must not feel satisfied till have avowed truth asked young friend pardon for injury have done nothing be more sudden complete than change in popular feeling shameful act of jefferies in casting on innocent stigma of shame crime be own be quite enough for honest simple villager at once condemned perhaps might not have be quite so ready to do have not mr hamilton rector shown example not only defended completely exculpated myrvin in incredibly short space of time so many anecdote of young man performance of duty be collected that have not mr hamilton be aware of violent nature of popular feeling defect still remained though excused by recollection of mental torture myrvin have be enduring must undoubtedly have departed a entirely a darker shade on character have done convinced that arthur attention to parochial affair a well a conduct in other matter have be very opposite to have be reported mr howard mr hamilton must feel satisfied till have written to frankly avowing injustice asking pardon forgetfulness of past assuring that if conduct continued equally worthy of approbation a be at present time must ever find in sincere active friend mr hamilton felt have much very much to say to young man in what manner to word be somewhat perplexed must not speak of daughter yet myrvin conduct towards have created feeling of gratitude admiration must not suppress many father must have felt indignation only at young man presumption mr hamilton be so unreasonable so completely devoid of sympathy be thought who have acted imprudently in allowing to associate so intimately with daughter not fault of sufferer myrvin have done duty indeed mr hamilton knew well there be very few young men who must have acted a have done when conscious that affection be returned with enthusiasm devotedness of disposition such a emmeline how few must have played with feeling tortured by persuasion to forget duty for sake of love arthur have not done father heart swelled towards in gratitude esteem even while knew hopelessness of love felt for anguish sympathy told arthur must endure after more deliberation thought than must have believed necessary for simple thing a to write letter mr hamilton did achieve object retaining copy of epistle to prove to child have be earnest in assurance that arthur character must be cleared painfully agitated by tale have heard unexpected confidence of father emmeline glanced eye over paper read a follows to rev arthur myrvin hanover dear myrvin will be doubt astonished at receiving letter brief a intend to be from one with whom parted in very friendly term who have grieve to own given little reason to believe friend when man have be unjust prejudiced becomes peremptory duty however pride may rebel to do in power to atone for by honourable reparation in word deed towards may have injured such young friend be at present relative position be at loss to know how best to express sense of honourable conduct own injustice occasioned degree of harshness in manner towards when separated believe now recall with regret pain circumstance have transpired in parish once under care have convinced not only still more violently prejudiced against that fair fame be tarnished by secret machination insidious representation of enemy not by faulty nature of conduct knowing most earnestly appeal to nobleness of nature for forgetfulness of past beg will endeavour henceforward to regard a sincere friend whom have unhappily have too much reason to believe otherwise for dear myrvin doubt that will do for candidly own that only now have learned true nature of character when first knew be interested in welfare a chosen friend of son also for father sake now be for own different position occupy in life wide distance circumstance place between will feel sure prevent misconception on part a to meaning prevent drawing from friendly word conclusion opposite to what intend therefore hesitate to avow that not only esteem from heart thank myrvin for indulgence of honourable feeling perfect integrity bade resign curacy depart from oakwood did wrong great wrong word can faintly compensate injury though word have be weapon by injury have be inflicted yet feel confident will not retain displeasure natural a be will consent once more to look on appeal if must ever require to father of herbert a willing friend believe that if be in power to assist will never appeal in vain lord malvern rejoice to find be staunch friend nothing will be wanting on part to render friendship a permanent a advantageous mr hamilton begs to inform that in communication of feeling have transcribed own injustice indeed never did admiration esteem gratitude be inmate of bosom a sincerely a be of own continue young friend unwavering regard to high principle of nature steady adherence to duty spite of prejudice wrong if indeed must ever again assail respecs of fellow creature will be yours a warmly a unfeignedly a be that of sincere friend arthur hamilton word sound broke from parched lip of emmeline a ceased to read returned paper to father in same silence turning from glance buried face in hand mr hamilton guessed at once be passing in young tortured heart drew to whispered fondly speak to emmeline think can mistake feeling will not doubt prejudice be removed oh replied after severe struggle for composure have said enough dear dear papa must not have expected more for moment clung to neck covered cheek with kiss then gently withdrawing from arm quietly hastily left room for about hour might have remained absent mr hamilton must not disturb when returned there be trace of agitation pale be indeed eye have lost brightness be too customary now to be deemed effect of excited emotion further notice be taken save perhaps manner of parent ellen towards that night be even fonder than usual once again mr hamilton mentioned arthur myrvin to speak of pleasing satisfactory letter mr howard have received from addressed to ellen telling arthur have written in manner tending to satisfy even friendly feeling towards emmeline joined not in conversation father did not offer to show letter stilled yearning of young loving heart from hour name of arthur myrvin be never heard in hall of oakwood there be appearance of effort in avoidance still be not spoken not even by percy herbert by caroline husband even letter of lady florence lady emily lyle ceased to make principal object emmeline knew volatile nature of latter therefore be not surprised that have grown tired of theme lady florence must so completely cease mention of tutor of favourite brother be rather more strange did so perhaps in letter to ellen of emmeline have not courage to ask st eval must speak of lord louis expressing hope that be becoming more steady so chanced that although at such time emmeline spite of ever longed for somewhat more magic name must have bidden pulse throb never reached ear excited spirit must sink back in despondency gloom increased from momentary excitement expectation have vainly called forth astonished indeed have arthur myrvin be at receipt of letter from oakwood rectory mr howard be productive of gratification alone that of mr hamilton afforded even greater pleasure combined with more than equal measure of pain have hoped emmeline must have answered letter did not knew influence have be exercised in favour agony a be acknowledged have acted wisely there be too much devotedness in emmeline character for myrvin to encourage one lingering doubt that affection be returned a thought on steady discharge of filial duty a recalled parting interview felt have not wavered from path have pointed out own energy notwithstanding that still lingering still acute suffering be roused within resolved must obey must see appeal have not be made in vain must never blush for man have honoured with love must endeavour to deserve esteem though might never meet again felt have be too much victim of ill fated passion have by neglect in trifle encouraged prejudice against lost active willing friend must no longer be myrvin devoted so perseveringly so assiduously to pupil allowing scarcely time for solitary thought not keenest observer must have suspected there be that upon young man heart be poisoning buoyancy of youth robbing

have be so long shrine of secret fondest thought have so long indulged in delicious fancy known to few others save now have be intruded on even by voice of gratulation must no longer throng around be strange that on night when choice have be so warmly approved of by friend when word of such heartfelt kindness have be lavished in ear that same dull foreboding of future evil of suffering of death pressed heavily on a in earlier year have be so wont to do struggled against must not listen to voice must have sway donned be not indeed from mystery more saddening herbert wrestled with in fervent prayer night be to almost a sleepless a be to cousin ellen cause of weary watching be ala too well defined bright sun joyous voice of brother cousin beneath window roused herbert from thought ere day have passed have partly recovered usual tenor of mind though buoyancy be still subdued secret temperament somewhat sad to family seemed a usual chapter vi week passed emmeline health be rapidly

decisive character week confirmed mr mr hamilton in wisdom of decision by revealing more clearly myrvin character be more devoted to duty of clerical profession pride haughtiness dislike to mingle with parishioner have departed a observed how warmly delightedly emmeline entered into many plan for doing good for increasing happiness of villager under spiritual charge felt that domestic virtue gentle disposition be far more suited to wife of clergyman than to life of bustling gaiety might perhaps under other circumstance have be portion be there not responsibility attached to clergyman wife once asked mother feel a if so much depended upon to render respected beloved that sometimes fear may fail in duty through ignorance not intentional perhaps bring discredit on name dearest mother how can prevent fear be natural to one of character emmeline will quickly pas away must be more likely to fail in duty of fashionable life than in will soon have to fulfil occupation have be more fashionably educated must have be irksome will to remain pleasure have ever be heightened encouraged by sympathy of husband wife to be truly happy virtuous must entirely forget truth partner of country clergyman must ever remember a family be larger more constant in call upon attention sympathy sometimes exertion be le productive of satisfaction pleasure than of many other station in life own demeanour must be alike gentle unassuming persuasive yet dignified so that action may assist uphold husband doctrine more than language have to follow principle of christianity dictate of own heart emmeline duty will be done almost unconsciously to yourself only drawback to emmeline happiness be that lord lady st eval be obliged to leave england ere marriage must be solemnized health of latter prohibiting further delay did not expect to be absent much more than twelvemonth earl laughingly told emmeline if must defer wedding till then must promise to be present to however none of party concerned seemed inclined to consent st eval owned must much rather on return see comfortably settled at vicarage where preparation be rapidly advancing percy however promised to defer intended tour till favourite sister must be myrvin bride edward on leaving to join ship declared if wind tide be not very contrary too must take run down dance at wedding short time after departure of earl countess edward ellen received from hand of cousin herbert letter for moment caused emotion felt eye be fixed upon with peculiar expression shrinking from be hastening to own room to answer letter there when herbert called after run away from nelly be answer be to be bearer returning instantly asked with cheek suddenly paled lip compressed be then aware of content of letter herbert be in captain cameron confidence to demand be happy enough to answer yes ellen replied smiling archly captain cameron have made father confessor in return have promised to use influence in favour to tell what letter may perhaps have incoherently expressed that love ellen devotedly faithfully that feel life without however brilliant in appearance will be blank promised must play lover well indeed dear cousin affection esteem for admit single doubt be sorry for said ellen calmly very sorry a be not in power to return feeling consequently be compelled to give pain be grateful very grateful for high opinion kind feeling letter express towards will never cease to respect value a friend more can not give nay ellen take time to consider of offer refuse at once thus decidedly say respect know admire conduct a son brother a man what objection be there so great a to call for decided instant refusal simply because a husband can never love never be long day ellen surely have not so much romance in composition a to refuse young man possessing virtue can make woman happy merely because doe not excite very violent passion do not know there be disposition never love to full extent of word yet be perhaps happier in marriage state than who do now may be one of ellen may be so said still calmly though deep flush stained cheek herbert have spoken playfully there be that in word to heart seared a be hers be productive of intense suffering may be so perhaps will never meet one to love a believe husband ought to be loved yet must not satisfy conscience for accepting walter trust be not romantic herbert will say that vow to love honour obey to think only of demand something more than mere cold esteem may deem sufficient for happiness walter be estimable young man one who will make woman happy deeply indeed regret that have chosen one who can only return warm devoted affection with comparatively chilling sentiment of friendship esteem must not do kind heart so much wrong a to accept take time ellen give hope can urge objection against family be dear to have told that from childhood loved that remembrance never left when again met fanciful vision became beautiful palpable reality give at least time for hope be impossible with heart disengaged a yours to associate intimately with not love heart disengaged a mine how know that herbert said cousin with smile must have deceived most penetrating eye be not presuming too far in inspection of heart seeking in rather roundabout way to obtain entire confidence dearest ellen speak feel in business a edward must be in place happiness be a dear to a be to have for very many year be to other a brother sister believe in urging acceptance of good young man seek welfare alone believe dear cousin replied ellen frankly holding out hand herbert warmly pressed indeed in instance be deceived union with walter cameron must not form happiness worthy a be suitable a world must deem such match in respect sorry a be to inflict pain disappointment on companion of childhood a also fear on kind mother can not be wife if affection be already engaged far be from to urge farther said not that be herbert interrupted ellen steadily fixing a spoke large eye unshrinkingly on cousin face herbert felt fairly puzzled must not read heart must have asked confidence must have promised to do in power to forward happiness there be something around that while called forth almost unconscious respect entirely checked farther question did not fancy that loved yet why determined rejection of young man whom knew esteemed be only grieving by continuing subject said therefore grant forgiveness dearest ellen final answer to cameron will be resumed more have nothing to forgive herbert replied ellen somewhat mournfully sat few minute longer in saddened thought gazing on open letter then quitted room sought own softly closed door secured then sinking on low seat beside couch buried pale face in hand for few minute remained overwhelmed by intensity of secret tearless suffering be called forth afresh by interview with cousin to hear lip plead thus eloquently cause of to hear say that perhaps be one of who must never love to full extent when young heart felt bursting beneath load of deep affection pressing there one sweet alone mingled in cup of bitterness herbert guessed not suspected not truth have succeeded well in concealing anguish called forth by unrequited love must struggle on never never will be known have given rebellious heart to one who seek not no that tale will live die with one will know how low have fallen poor walter will think can not feel for unreturned affection when know too well pang why must not be happy with why live on in lingering wretchedness when perhaps a wife new duty might rouse from lethargy away from herbert might forget be reconciled swear to love walter when have love to give return affection by indifference oh will not be so guilty ellen again hid eye in hand thought long painfully pride urged to accept young cameron better feeling revolted from started from posture of despondency with bursting heart answered walter eloquent appeal kindness breathed in line wrote regard for welfare esteem for character calmly yet decidedly rejected address be grieved said most deeply grieved that anything in manner towards have encouraged hope have acted a felt looking on companion of early childhood son of father own kind friend a brother friend in light hoped must ever permit to regard hope found resting place in letter breathed such true gentle sympathy kindness that walter must not feel soothed even in midst of disappointment ellen paused ere sealed letter must not bear to act even in matter without confiding in aunt captain cameron have proposed be rejected felt assured report must soon convey to ear why not then seek task of writing have calmed heart taking therefore walter letter own repaired to aunt dressing room fortunately found alone mr hamilton looked earnestly at a entered made observation till in compliance with ellen request perused letter offered to have reflected sufficiently on decision ellen said after thanking for confidence reposed in have thought well on estimable character of young man far be from to urge persuade in important matter a marriage have not trust answered letter on impulse of moment aunt have not indeed herbert have be most earnestly pleading captain cameron cause have thought on have said little can bring forward to combat still have refused because a husband can never love honour good quality can not remember one fault failing in character might render wife unhappy grieve for disappointment must not think be doing justice to accept merely on consideration herbert know considers romantic perhaps unkind towards friend painful a such idea be can not act otherwise than have done let idea then continue to give pain dear girl manner towards walter have never expressed more than kindness friendly regard if have seen anything like encouragement to on part do not think must have called to account long ago added with smile a ellen much relieved kissed in silence young folk have know sometimes in sport allied name with have generally checked walter certainly did fancy admired did not imagine feeling so decided a have proved will not blame decision though perhaps may not be very wise one marriage be too serious thing to be entered upon lightly if can not love walter a husband why be quite right not to accept be not so eager to part with ellen a to advise marrying whether like not will soon have only to cheer old age know look so pained sad love be not thus young lady in general refuse offer go give letter to herbert tell have unqualified approval then return to marked beautiful passage in one of favourite author other day will read to now run away come back quickly ellen obeyed gladly gratefully be enabled playfully to return smile with herbert received letter mother message mr hamilton felt more more convinced that suspicion be correct that niece affection be unhappily engaged thought again again who must be object still fancied be arthur myrvin scarcely knew why except from ellen agitation night of arrival at oakwood engagement with emmeline that herbert be object be to so improbable that idea never crossed mind have lived so long a brother sister have from earliest childhood so intimately associated with other ellen edward be to so like own child that not once did imagine ellen loved cousin watched closely be more more convinced that have something to conceal be certain decided rejection of walter proceeded from affection being already engaged have also blinded to attention be convinced also ellen loved in vain therefore though longed to console soothe resolved not to speak to on subject wring from secret when once betrayed though revealed to alone might be still more painful to endure mr hamilton manner be so kind so soothing so calculated to support strengthen ellen more than once wondered whether aunt have indeed discovered secret must not speak of must not even to being loved best on earth with exception of one thus lay bare aching heart often often longed to throw in arm of aunt weep controlled impulse bore on in silence outward cheerfulness strengthened in effort by conviction that herbert knew not imagined not truth young cameron be grieved disappointed for love for ellen be indeed sincere must not mistake letter saw there be hope expression of friendship kindness be soothing gratifying prevented bitterness of feeling determined to preserve friendship brotherly regard so frankly proffered mr cameron be at first somewhat hurt at ellen decided rejection of son must not long retain emotion of coolness towards must not resist affectionate manner of ellen be soon a usual between visit with percy to castle malvern at lord louis earnest entreaty to walter be agreeable change though have at first be struggle to rouse

first to win affection slowly surely merit be not dazzling be generally long before be discovered when be ever commanded reverence love in child mr hamilton felt indeed care fully repaid in ellen more far more than have ventured to anticipate thus left alone in filial care ellen character appeared different to what have be when one of many steady quiet cheerfulness be restored to heart of who now composed small domestic circle of mr hamilton family have private moment when sorrow for loss of beloved herbert be indeed recalled in bitterness such sacred hour never be permitted to tinge daily

of marriage even with woman sincerely loved till heart must in degree recover deep wound death of only brother have so painfully inflicted to parent indeed family revealed engagement mr mr hamilton anxiously anticipated return of lord lady st eval to introduce to intended bride of only son intention be to remain at richmond till spring when arthur wife must pay promised visit at oakwood instead of spending christmas with arrangement emmeline have suggested because said if husband be away family party have ever assembled at oakwood during festive season must be broken up herbert absence be le

sufferer that peaceful death must indeed be blessed release be peaceful death lucy writes mournfully resignedly say can not be sufficiently thankful that be spared long enough to see daughter must be happy under charge that have gained young affection that a far a mortal eye must see by leaving entirely under guardianship maternal care have provided for happiness said almost with last breath poor lucy say that among many consolation in trying time assertion be not one of least precious to heart doubt be to be friend adopted mother of child must be one of many blessing created for herself by noble conduct in youth be glad now prophecy be not verified that never became wife did ever think must uncle asked ellen surprised fancied seymour must have discovered affection then admiration on part must have done rest be own much better a be child will love more regarding in light of sister aunt than have become stepmother why did seem so surprised at prophecy nelly be there anything very impossible in union not impossible think likely miss harcourt must have betrayed affection at very time when be endeavouring to soothe cousin for loss of beloved wife be much more likely to conceal even more effectually than have ever done before do think probable mr seymour accustomed from very earliest year to regard a sister must ever succeed in looking on in other light seem well skilled in history of human heart little ellen said uncle smiling do think then quite impossible for cousin to love ellen bent lower over embroidery frame for felt tell tale flush be rising to cheek without looking up replied calmly miss harcourt be proof that such love can doe exist more often perhaps in woman heart in man seldom unless educated living entirely apart from other think be right ellen said aunt never thought with uncle that lucy must become mr seymour wife have prophesied thing uncle what must have called said ellen looking up archly from frame for momentary flush have gone that be prophecy of most romantic young lady much more like emmeline heroic than quiet sober ellen answered in same tone a own idea of course be wisdom joke apart a be so skilled in knowledge of human heart dear ellen must know entered room to day for purpose of probing own mine exclaimed astonished girl turning suddenly pale what do mean only that rev ernest lacy have be with morning entreating permission to address indeed making proposal for hand told that permission must have with earnest wish for success did not doubt aunt consent must be a readily given look so terribly alarmed told must not let matter proceed farther without first speaking to pray let go farther then dear uncle said ellen very earnestly a needle fell from hand turned eye beseechingly on uncle face thank mr lacy for high opinion must have of in making offer indeed can not accept by consent let encourage hope must end in disappointment approbation can not withdraw ellen for most sincerely do esteem young man there be few whom must so gladly behold united to family a why do so positively refuse to hear may not know sufficiently now grant to love yet believe more know more will find in to esteem love doubt dear uncle be one among young men who visit here whom most highly esteem must be sorry to lose friendship by refusal of hand why not allow to plead for be not one of romantic being ellen who often refuse excellent offer because imagine be not violently in love pray condemn a such dear uncle indeed be not case mr lacy little know of appears to posse virtue calculated to make excellent husband know fault to can bring forward objection what dear niece surely be not afraid of speaking freely before aunt uncle have little to say except have wish to marry that must be more pain to leave aunt than marriage must ever compensate why nelly do mean to devote to young life old irritable a will in probability become think again dear girl many enjoyment much happiness a far a human eye can see await wife of lacy emmeline be silent do not agree with in wishing to behold gentle ellen wife of one so universally beloved a young clergyman not if wish lead to remain with husband replied mr hamilton impressively have not spoken before for have be too attentively observing fluctuation of ellen countenance now tone be such a to check forced smile with niece have tried to reply to mr hamilton suggestion of becoming old irritable bring painfully checked tear back to eye too powerfully to be restrained tried to retain calmness effort be vain springing from seat flew to couch where aunt sat kneeling by side buried face on shoulder murmured almost inaudibly oh bid leave be happy here elsewhere oh must be so very very wretched own mr lacy be must wish for in husband precious indeed must be love to girl who must return not to oh not to one who can give nothing in return paused abruptly crimson have mounted to cheek brow choking sob prevented farther utterance mr hamilton pressed lip to ellen heated brow in silence while husband looked at niece in silent amazement be affection then given to dear child said gently tenderly why overwhelming grief ellen surely believe must thwart happiness of one so dear to by refusing consent to man of choice if be worthy of speak then dear girl without reserve who have so secretly gained young affection that for sake other offer be rejected ellen raised head looked mournfully in uncle face tried to obey voice for moment failed love be given to dead murmured at length clasping aunt hand in hers word slowly falling from parched lip then added hurriedly oh reprove weakness thought secret never must have passed lip in life wherefore must hide now be sin to love dead though have lived never must have ceased to struggle till wild pang be

with purity self devotedness of woman mr hamilton felt that at moment must not speak raised niece from ground where still knelt beside aunt folded to bosom kissed tearful cheek placing in mr hamilton arm hastily left room same thought have likewise occupied mind of aunt a ellen still seemed to cling to for support comfort be mingled with sensation almost amounting to self reproach at own blindness in not earlier discovering truth why not imagine ellen affection fixed on herbert a on arthur myrvin be equally probable must now well understand ellen agitation when herbert engagement with mary be published when performed marriage ceremony for arthur emmeline when mr hamilton recalled how completely ellen have appeared to forget in devotedness to how instead of weakly sinking beneath severe trial have borne up through have suppressed own suffering to alleviate of others be strange that admiration respect must mingle with love bore that from hour ellen appeared dearer to aunt than have ever done before be only on account affection increased for sake of beloved son be that niece refused to marry for love of even though have departed heart rejected other love fond mother unconsciously
