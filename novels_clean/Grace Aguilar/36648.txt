concealment a only sure mean of guarding from blame from childhood mr fortescue have be creature of passion impulse maternity have unhappily not altered one tittle of character in what manner at what cost ellen might be enabled to keep promise never entered mind have never be wont even in day of health to examine reflect present weakness permitted only morbid indulgence of one exaggerated thought for several minute lay quite silent ellen resumed seat work temple throbbing knew not why vain longing to throw arm round mother neck entreat only for one more kiss one other word of love consciousness that dared not caused hot tear to rush into eye almost blind must not let fall for have learned long ago that while edward tear only excited soothing caress hers always called forth

restorative evincing unusual alarm careless observer might have said feeling be only momentary thought mr hamilton must give to ellen feeling be engrossed in deep emotion with gazed on faded form altered face of still beloved though erring one who when have last beheld thirteen year previous be bright buoyant lovely a boy beside voice yet more than proffered remedy seemed to recall life after brief interval choking thought found word father father oh emmeline know that be dead disobedience ingratitude for too indulgent love killed know did did curse emmeline did love turn to wrath a ought

must not have be very happy ellen yet still young a be little more than child in day thrown among who did not know right from wrong remembered that father have taught prayed to god tried to love obey god be pleased with gave grace to continue good at last so blessed a to permit to see dear father darling brother again joseph be father favorite child be ellen sole rejoinder tear be checked in eagerness with have listened seemed again ready to burst forth must have be happy when thought of think so dear ellen replied mr myrvin more moved than chose to betray for being father favorite first excited dislike envy of brother caused to wish to send away there be excuse indeed for conduct perhaps if joseph have always remained near father might have be spoiled by too great indulgence never become a good a afterward be perhaps in solitary prison might even have regretted that father have not treated alike a then angry feeling of brother must not have be called forth so see being favorite will not always make happy ellen be indeed very delightful to be loved caressed if try to do duty love a much a can even if be not sure of being loved at first may be quite certain that will be loved happy at last do understand child question be almost needle for ellen large eye have never moved from face expression be so full of intelligence meaning that whole countenance seemed lighted up then do think mamma will recover eagerly exclaimed will ever love oh if thought so must never never be naughty again will love dear ellen replied mr myrvin now visibly affected can not dare not tell that will recover to love on earth if indeed be god will that must go to will look down on from heaven love far more than have done yet for will know then how much love will know if do wish if love help edward asked ellen in low half frightened voice little did mr myrvin imagine how vividly how indelibly reply be registered in child memory be question none can answer positively ellen be own firm belief that beloved one have lost be permitted to watch over love still that see be often near though can not see even to help edward continued somewhat anxiously must not be tempted be interrupted by appearance of stranger who addressing courteously apologized for intrusion noticing child inquired if be mr myrvin replied that must only lay claim to one little girl be miss fortescue name be hamilton so think have uncle privilege be reply ellen to astonishment received affectionate embrace from unknown relative whom mother ill judged word have taught actually to dread mr myrvin gladly welcomed in interest of conversation followed forgot lesson have be so anxious to impress upon ellen arthur accompanied to garden gate gentleman soon afterward entered cottage together day merged into week still mr fortescue lingered weakness increasing so painfully from alternate fever exhaustion that to remove be impossible be first time mr hamilton have ever be separated from child there be many disagreeables attendant on nursing beloved invalid in confined cottage with only little luxury comfort must be procured even be obtained with difficulty for nearest town be twenty mile distant not selfish repining thought entered mr hamilton mind be filled with thankfulness not only that be permitted thus to tend sister whom error absence silence must estrange from heart that be spared long enough for gentle influence enduring love to have effect in changing train of thought calming that fearful irritability by slow degree permitting to look with resignation penitent hope to hour human effort must avert that mr myrvin must seek mr hamilton society delight in conversing with mr fortescue considered so perfectly natural that conversation took place in sick room whenever be strong enough to bear excited neither surprise impatience different a be willfully a have always neglected mild counsel example of sister year of separation too often excited reproach have fully awakened to mr hamilton superiority have never found one at like so good holy yet so utterly unassuming strong affection even deep emotion in one usually so controlled with sister have met naturally increased feeling ah emmeline will find much to converse about have be address to mr myrvin on first introduction to mr hamilton talk a much a please mind with emmeline near can restrain irritability must have frightened away know be right oh must to god have always be like suffering betrayed in last word be painful contrast with lightness of previous tone mr myrvin answered soothingly for first time word be patiently received from listening listlessly mr fortescue by slow degree became interested in conversation between mr mr hamilton so change in sentiment be gradually wrought by other method of proceeding must have be sought for in vain one evening a mr hamilton sat watching faded countenance of patient recalling day of youth buoyancy when seemed a if death care must ever have assailed one so bright lovely edward before sought favorite stream threw arm round neck pressed rosy lip on cheek a thus to wish good by will repay for care dearest emmeline mother said with heavy sigh a left room know have what husband will think fault oh for sake treat harshly noble spirit will be broken if do dearest eleanor dismiss such fear be not mother equally with do think when child become mine will show difference between own must trust even in former year surely will trust now indeed indeed do be always kind forbearing with when little deserved poor edward be so hard to part with love so fondly few natural tear stole down cheek will continue to love dearest eleanor oh believe that have be to will be have won devoted affection of own darling fear to gain love of yours then will be easy task to make happy a own edward love will very quickly obtain if be not yours already ellen will have more trouble with be strange cold unlovable child be disposition of child so unlike must not have fancied ellen cold be timid thought must wear off when knew better be not timidity never knew otherwise than cold reserved from birth never must feel same toward a did toward edward therefore there must be something in ellen to prevent mr hamilton did not think so answered gently be quite sure dear eleanor that have equally studied character of child because know there be case require more study carefulness than others never be fond of studying thing emmeline a may remember replied mr fortescue painfully trying to smile therefore dare say have not studied child a have yours besides know always thought still think doctrine of mother forming character of child good people say about importance of early impression perfectly ridiculous disposition for good bad loving unloving be from moment of birth what human effort can alter why very infancy of child be different edward be always laughing animated happy ellen fretful peevish so heavy that never seemed even to know when entered room while edward must spring into arm shout laugh only to see now what conduct on part must have done surely be justified in feeling differently toward such opposite disposition know never made more difference between than than papa did between emmeline have have greater reason to be partial be always better than be ceased from exhaustion flush have risen to temple trembling hand evinced agitation always called for by mention of father mr hamilton with earnest tenderness endeavored to soothe must speak emmeline continued natural impetuosity for moment regaining ascendency how did repay fond father partiality too great indulgence did not bring down gray hair with sorrow to grave did not throw shame misery upon by conduct to ill fated one have chosen for husband did not oh god god death may indeed be merciful edward might do same by shuddering violently hid face on sister bosom be long before mr hamilton must calm fearful agitation long before whispered word of heavenly hope peace pardon if indeed believed must bring comfort did at length such fearful paroxysm returned at longer longer interval at length ceased in deep submission clinging trust to be at last permitted to attain though mr hamilton be detained six week at llangwillan devoted attendance on sister prevented thing more than occasional observation of child so soon about to be committed to care that edward be most engaging riveted affection at once that ellen be unlike child have ever known seen must not feel be not one to decide on mere feeling present mournful task prevented actual interference with except endeavor by kindly notice to win confidence love mother illness uncle presence besides for present perfect freedom with regard to employment have deprived edward of inclination to rebel exert self will mr mr hamilton felt that certainly have fewer fault than be generally consequence of unlimited indulgence whether ellen extreme attention to mother silent ever ready help when aunt required proceeded from mere cold duty really have origin in affection mr hamilton must not satisfactorily decide sister have avowed partiality that neglect unkindness must have be shown to extent by mother a to create cold exterior beheld be so utterly incomprehensible so opposed to dictate of maternal love knew so well that actually must not even imagine must believe in possibility of preference for one child more than not in utter neglect actual dislike must imagine that ellen love for mother might be le warm than edward believing a did that parent must call for child affection not be satisfied with leaving to nature if be not love that dictated ellen conduct be strange almost unnatural so unpleasing that so young child must have such idea of duty be only passing thought cost what trouble might mr hamilton determined must understand niece a did own child though to ellen be riddle to sister nature be resuming sway too late ala for save mother own reproach weakness have become such that day must pas when speech save few whispered word be impossible must gaze upon child a hour after hour must sit by bed resisting edward entreaty sometimes even aunt to go play long to fold to heart confess have be cruelly unjust that did love now almost a much a edward be much too weak to do more than feel ellen remained unconscious of change except now then a must bring nourishment bend over to bathe forehead mother must a if involuntarily kiss cheek murmur caressing word ellen longed to cling to neck say how much loved did not dare must hurry out of room to conceal tear instead of returning caress thus unhappily confirming idea of natural coldness even comfort of sitting by mother be at length denied mr fortescue became so alarmingly painfully ill that mr hamilton felt unnecessary trial for child to witness especially a must be comfort to for did not know evening of fourth day recovered sufficiently to partake of sacrament with sister mr

military captain whose furlough from india have just expired whose pale face somewhat melancholy expression very elegant figure presented new subject for conquest impossible to be resisted be unhappily only too easily achieved made secret of admiration speaking of in such term to intended husband a to excite anew jealous feeling be easy for captain fortescue to discover fitzclair be rival believing decidedly object of eleanor preference increased attention little imagining storm be exciting more fearful from determined suppression lord delmont interfered several time not only by reproach to eleanor by determined coldness to new suitor finding at length that encouragement actually neared criminal extent after desperately stormy interview solemnly declared that if did not dismiss captain fortescue at once must shame in face of whole world by proclaiming engagement with young marquis eleanor in equal anger declared that if threatened so too must if tormented more must prevent publication of engagement by snapping asunder pledging faith to captain fortescue be too much even for lord delmont declaring if did so father heaviest malediction must fall on head hastily

without waiting for reply haughtily brushed by disappeared of extent of fitzclair passion eleanor have not least idea be saying great deal for generally exaggerated own power believed have inflicted pain not a much a deserved determined that must torment yet more at ball that evening to extreme mortification did not appear there be vague dread on spirit a retired for night prevented thing like rest absence have excited surprise in especially lady lascelles who knew that to leave eleanor entirely to attention of young fortescue be so unprecedented a to bode good wildest conjecture be far from reality very next morning cheltenham be thrown into most painful excitement by incomprehensible most extraordinary fact of suicide of lord fitzclair by what occasioned plunged into such mystery that nothing sudden aberration of mind be imagined belief justified by very peculiar temperament manner of young nobleman during sojourn with will valuable present with few line of regard to faithful attendant letter addressed to arthur hamilton esq be sole evidence that awful deed have not be committed without preparation a be often case with madness excited remark state of eleanor mind when awful tidings be communicated to be by father in agitation anger without least preparation leave reader to imagine hardened heartless willful a be be still woman very young one till captain fortescue appeared have loved a far a be in nature lord fitzclair to believe that have nothing to do with miserable end be attempt so vain hollow that even shrunk from hopeless struggle to realize remorse in

association lessen present misery for three day night never quitted own apartment then joined usual circle without smallest evidence of internal agony be still hers be very easy to displace paleness by artificial rose gay smile joyous sally be tempered only by judiciously expressed horror when late event be discussed before supposed natural to one who have known so intimately hour of loneliness followed conduct in society be terrible indeed by strange contrariety of feeling better nature longed for emmeline artificial have ala only too forcibly become natural self felt a if must leave kingdom rather than encounter mild sorrowful glance of penetrating eye lord delmont be in most pitiable condition even minor evil have always be great to effect of wish to take eleanor away from captain fortescue increased annoying attention yet dread that doing so must connect with fitzclair death so distracted a to render really ill information instantly brought mr mr hamilton to cheltenham young wife mother might have felt hard that domestic enjoyment must so continually have be disturbed annoyed from fault of others emmeline have be accustomed to trace thing created personal suffering to highest source feel that be good for must not be conviction enabled to bear with still to love erring one be visible cause of pain eleanor be at gay ball night of arrival mr hamilton requested might not be informed of till following day about hour before usual hour of rising after such scene entered sister room around lay ornament of previous evening looking so strange gaudy faded in darkened room judged by calmer feeling of morning sensation of intense depression crept over emmeline a gazed increasing a looked on face of sleeper divested of unnatural bloom looked so fearfully wan haggard beautiful hair lay in tangled mass on damp brow a emmeline gently tried to remove eleanor started awoke be already time to get up said languidly only half unclosing eye feel a if have not slept at be dreaming added starting up have slept in one place awoke in be at oakwood dearest eleanor will not welcome to malvern house voice look seemed to thrill through temple be throbbing heart weighed down a always be when first awoke with undefinable sense of guilt pain tried to be cold proud reserved must not do suddenly flung arm round sister neck burst into agonized tear be most unexpected greeting mr hamilton argued hopefully from ala unwonted softening only lasted one brief half hour left at eleanor entreaty while dressing when returned though reckless girl told with half smile that be ready for lecture for must only have come from oakwood to give one however severe word might be must not alter tone must be kind in spite of herself yet emmeline must not succeed in convincing how wrongly how cruelly have acted eleanor must persist that be not in least to blame that poor fitzclair fearful end be only owing to own violent passion in fact that must have be out of mind that though be certainly very dreadful have perhaps escaped very terrible doom speak a might emmeline be not deceived a to agony be actually enduring finding however that gentle effort be useless that even perusal of fitzclair brief line to husband eleanor insisted on seeing in deplored madness in not having followed advice flown from presence bade take forgiveness to say that mean have adopted must trusted dissolve engagement to satisfaction have effect save in causing to turn so deadly pale that sister be convinced nothing almost supernatural effort of pride preserved from fainting desisted hoping against hope that eleanor must yet repent become different being knew harshness must only harden so tried to prevail on father to treat a usual lord delmont must not do be strange how often find parent who have be over indulgent to childhood unusually harsh to fault of youth weak character also when driven to anger be always more violent than firmer one certainly eleanor continued haughtiness coldness a if be injured one did not tend to calm angry feeling be unfortunately too soon aggravated by proposal in form from captain fortescue for hand of eleanor without moment delay dispatched decided almost insulting refusal to young soldier then sought daughter vented on anger vexation overpowered upbraiding not only with death of fitzclair for having dared so to encourage young fortescue a to give courage for audacious proposal to astonishment be heard without attempt at reply must have be startled must have seen pallid cheek compressed lip clenched hand with when have left eleanor muttered father if be sin to leave be on own head must have wedded with consent have permitted now destiny be fixed there be peace in england at least let be spared agony of breaking loving heart nearly three week rolled on eleanor extraordinary submission even in degree withdrawal from society for mr hamilton arrival be good excuse caused father irritation against almost entirely to subside that passed several hour day apart from sister excited surprise emmeline be thankful even for change of deportment nothing confidential ever again passed between report be floating about connecting name of miss manvers late lord fitzclair seemed little heeded by eleanor though caused natural vexation to family about time invitation arrived for eleanor from lady of rank slightly known to father living ten mile from cheltenham in beautiful villa at expected select party of fashionables to ruralize for week two there be nothing in note to excite dread weighed on mr hamilton spirit a eleanor carelessly threw to for perusal must not express a lord delmont seemed inclined that eleanor must accept knowing that lady be much too exclusive for captain fortescue to join guest believing that eleanor apparent indifference to visit originated from cause telling be so gratified by having devoted so many evening to sister added have full consent to go if liked a must better spare than when emmeline returned to oakwood quietly thanked evinced particular pleasure day before intended departure sister be sitting together little percy who now ran firmly without fall be playing about

that may have after minute merry play in lap mother hoped have forgotten little gentleman be not thought to be so governed forbidden plaything be quietly grasped seated on ground in silent triumphant glee surprised at sudden silence mr hamilton looked toward be first act of decided disobedience knew must not waver young a be have already learned to know when be displeased when desired very gravely to give toy passionately threw down burst into violent fit of cry nurse took struggling from room mr hamilton quietly resumed work there be such expression of pain in countenance that eleanor exclaimed emmeline have be watching for last half hour can not comprehend do explain will if can mr hamilton looked up smiled why must not let that poor little percy have toy because must have be encouraging touching taking thing see whether proper for not must not understand that not now perhaps wish to know when speak must obey be think mistaken doctrine that ought to give child reason for

sometimes much more valuable than money education of one hour knew might for right cultivation of heart do more than mere teaching of five six education much a loved valued miss harcourt have from first resolved must come from alone to emmeline mode of life be so happy must not imagine thing happier caroline often often envied great friend annie grahame believed that occasional visit to london must make much happier than remaining year round at oakwood only with own family knew expression of such sentiment must meet sympathy at home certainly not obtain gratification so tried to check except when in company with annie lady helen mother knew from discontent unhappiness so often engendered in child caused pain uneasiness did not waver in plan because only in emmeline seemed to succeed did a perhaps over scrupulous mother must have done check caroline association with miss grahame knew that principle must be indeed of little worth must only actuate in retirement when free from temptation that to prevent intimacy with except with of whom exactly approved must be impossible if ever meant daughter to enter world therefore endeavored so to obtain unrestrained confidence

london made go there so often a know never refuse that indulgence mamma miss harcourt did not object be glad to do so have only one objection dear caroline think know what be that whenever be with annie think wish more about going to london mamma be afraid do indeed try to think that must know what be better for try not to be discontented though sometimes know succeed eye filled with tear be satisfied that endeavor to trust experience love be quite aware of difficulty have to encounter in doing so therefore most trifling conquest of self be great source of comfort to must feel that pain of increased discontent so of course increased difficulty in conquering constant accompaniment ill must more than balance pleasure of annie society so not indulge in one so often at expense of other of that be best judge know in case always permit to be free agent what have become of mary emmeline begged mr greville to let be a much together a possible during absence did not society afford

daughter returned at length dearest emmeline be former lively greeting evincing far more warmth of manner than be usual to do know bank of dart have seemed so desolate without guardian spirit that very flower have hung head tree be withered rather think change of season not absence have be cause of melancholy fact replied mr hamilton in same tone even london will not change kind thought for helen nay must follow example of neighbor rich poor whom may appeal to a to fact of absence causing terrible lamentation ask naughty little girl too who scarcely ever came to see because have so many thing to do to please mamma forgive added more seriously a glanced on deep mourning of friend indeed of group what cold heartless being must believe to run on in way when there have be so sad cause for absence poor eleanor trust may say happy eleanor dear helen mercy have indeed be shown to to will talk of time annie continued addressing miss grahame who be already deep in conversation with caroline have little girl to introduce to whom hope will be a friendly with a with caroline emmeline young lady turned round at word sole notice of ellen who have come timidly forward be haughty stare fashionable courtesy few unintelligible word caused emmeline to feel so indignant that be with difficulty kept silence made ellen so uncomfortable that be with even more than usual shyness received lady helen proffered hand why not introduce to too emmeline knew mother when be little older than be dear so hope will learn to know to like a fast a can ellen might have found courage to reply for there be interest attached to who have known mother a raised eye to speak again encountered annie rude disagreeable stare word died on lip young party be however soon in garden for mr hamilton never made scruple in dismissing child when wished to speak on subject did not choose to hear be anxious so to relate eleanor illness change of sentiment a to remove impression early career have left on lady helen memory must be nearly time for brother to be returning will go look for ellen dare say edward will have great deal to tell be be affectionate address a annie caroline turned in different

like why afraid because mamma must be so sorry be to know know wish to love one nonsense caroline mr hamilton can not be so unreasonable a to expect to love body alike mamma be never unreasonable replied caroline with spirit do wish annie must treat ellen exactly a do indeed will not what be colonel fortescue daughter to now be angry caroline be too old friend to quarrel for nothing will certainly hate ellen altogether if be to be subject of dispute come look kind again caress with concluded restored caroline serenity other subject be discussed between annie grahame be few month

lady helen made still more agreeable from becoming so very companionable to mr hamilton to in fact who loved childhood for childhood sake be source of real regret a banishing freshness artlessness warmth ought to have be characteristic of age father be only one of own family who did not admire so tried to check assumption of fine ladyism on part of daughter be not likely must succeed only estranged from affection of child annie grahame have great many fashionable acquaintance in london still regarded caroline hamilton a favorite friend why must not exactly tell except that be so very

not help laughing so devoted did appear to that have only time to greet miss grahame with very marked polite bow passed on wished to provoke succeeded for annie be always particularly pleased when handsome spirited percy hamilton paid attention that must be so devoted to little pale disagreeable looking cousin a not even to give word annoyed a much a desired edward hasty progress to aunt be slightly checked at seeing stranger with when be introduced made bow with so much of mother grace combined with extraordinary likeness feeling already interested in mr hamilton account of sister suffering death lady helen must not for moment speak except to exclaim oh how look recall past must almost fancy poor eleanor stood before did did know mother madam said edward with so much eagerness that cheek crimsoned voice trembled be one of mamma must not finish sentence leaning head against aunt burst into tear poor child said lady helen pityingly a mr hamilton pressed closer to stooped down to kiss forehead without speaking sudden unexpected display of feeling contrasted with ellen painful shyness stamped at once indelibly lady helen opinion of two orphan chapter iv variety few day more brought mr greville mary to welcome friend ellen have again pain of being introduced to stranger time be only pain of own shyness for must have overcome that feeling might have felt even pleasure a be gentle voice manner with mr greville addressed timid yet expressive glance of mary told of such sympathy kindness that felt attracted toward must quite enter into emmeline enthusiastic admiration of friend not however believing possible that must ever be worthy to win mary regard taught from such very early age to believe so far inferior to edward such character a herbert mary appeared to so exalted that be quite impossible must ever think of constant little act of unobtrusive kindness that cousin showed attributed to extreme goodness not from most trifling merit in did indeed love very dearly best next to aunt so much of reverence mingled with that be almost more reserved with than with others herbert be naturally reserved in word so did not think thing about except to wish endeavor

mother fondly for there be something in emmeline guileless confidence irresistibly claiming love have to do when find nothing exactly sympathizes with own feeling own idea of right wrong be to try find out reason for being so different circumstance may have exposed to greater temptation trial for know have often told pleasure amusement if too much indulged in be much greater trial to than sorrow pain now annie have have great many more temptation of kind than mary can not expect one so very young entirely to resist do mean mamma going out so much in london yes love be very much noticed so perhaps think little more of appearance dress pleasure than be quite necessary lady helen need not take out so much if did not like do think be quite right to do so asked emmeline very thoughtfully must never pronounce judgment on other people action little girl think better not to interrupt present quiet hope happy life therefore take caroline to london mr grahame be obliged to be there for several month lady helen very naturally must not like to be separated either from child then have large family annie so many young relation that see lady helen must not keep child quite a free from

unkind thought about be quite sorry now for see can not help a much a thought must think must ever make friend will try very much not to dislike avoid be be required of love when tell that father in heaven command to love one to avoid unkindness in thought deed mean that desire to love alike because knew must be neither for happiness good that must be so only to prevent too great influence of prejudice dislike might think such feeling can do harm because only confined to own mind must be sure gradually to lead to taking pleasure in listening to dispraise joining in to seeing talking only

hers have heard quite enough to think about be sure will not forget so go play ellen must be wondering what have become of again full of glee happy child bounded away exclaiming a did so poor annie be glad be not exposed to such temptation for be sure must not be able to resist though one who have seen next half hour might have fancied that serious thought sober task must not approach conversation psalm be forgotten with herbert explanatory assistance not only found psalm committed to memory second sunday after conversation with mother repeated so correctly prettily to father a to give delight of caressing approbation learning correctly by rote be always greatest trial for vivid fancy very versatile power occasioned actual lesson to be considered such drudgery a to require great effort on part to retain sense indeed if understood learned quickly enough preferred own language to one else mr hamilton have difficulty in making understand that in time of study required correctness not fancy that attention be necessary to conquer word a well a sense of lesson be much more important valuable however disagreeable might seem than facility of changing language to something prettier than original when therefore a in present case voluntarily undertook conquered really difficult task for little lively girl parent have scruple in giving only reward cared for approbation be in bestowal of praise mr hamilton be compelled to be almost painfully guarded found that least expression of unusual approbation caused caroline to relax in effort thinking have done quite enough perniciously increasing already too exalted idea of while to emmeline be most powerful incentive to continuance in improvement determined conquest of fault there be constantly dread on mother heart that caroline must one day accuse of partiality from different measure of approbation be compelled to bestow yet painful a be to persevere under impression future welfare of be too precious to be risked for gratification of present be watching with delight emmeline unrestrained enjoyment of father caress lively conversation in percy a usual joined for tiny a chose to call be especial pet plaything when be startled by low evidently suppressed sob near ellen be bending over book of bible story herbert have lent long ringlet completely concealed face miss harcourt caroline looked up surprised rapid

joined without taking more notice of ellen very pale cheek heavy eye than gently to put back thick tress seemed to annoy by weight gave so much interesting information on subject so delighted edward with allowing to drag down several book from library to find out said about two hour slipped away quite unconsciously be very painful feeling have be so soothed that must smile join emmeline in making animal walk in grand procession to temporary dwelling mr hamilton did not forget child involuntary evidence of suffering vainly tried to imagine what at moment must have caused herbert seemed to think about too for next day heard ask edward if knew why sister always looked so sad if thought be because be not yet reconciled to oakwood be not be edward reply have always looked seemed sad a long a can remember one reason may be be always ill in india papa be often telling how very much suffered how patiently bore then too knew be poor mamma favorite voice trembled used to make very unhappy know why

being almost frightened be so altered so pale thin weak then be very ill after poor papa death since then have never complained never kept bed know be often in pain for when have touched forehead sometimes have burnt hand like fire childish explanation certainly told mr hamilton more than have known before that ellen have witnessed fearful scene of father death be still concealed edward a grew older though did not know why seemed to shrink from subject particularly that have be at ball same awful night few day afterward a mr hamilton be crossing large hall on way to school room for so spite of percy determination that must receive more learned refined appellation of studio be still called overheard caroline voice exclaiming in angry impatience indeed will not have enough to do with own lesson without attending to other people be idleness ellen not difficulty of lesson for be sure be easy enough for shame caroline be emmeline indignant reply be not idle be sure lesson be not so easy wish must explain properly know miss harcourt herself said be careless idle to day must know be not going to lose hour of recreation to help who wo help how can be so ill natured so unkind began emmeline ellen be beseeching voice interrupted quarrel with sister on account dearest emmeline dare say be very stupid head doe feel confused to day pray mind dear emmy go with caroline aunt emmeline will not like remaining in caroline have already quitted room in haste ran against mother who instantly perceived have heard said with deep blush turned a to re enter school room mr hamilton stopped

little of time to help cousin must have experienced more real pleasure than will now feel day dear mamma will help ellen asked emmeline very timidly for though at ellen reiterated entreaty have left felt almost disrespect to run across hall while mother be speaking thought suddenly crossed that a be quite sure ellen be not idle though miss harcourt thought be mother by assisting might save from increased displeasure yes dearest if necessary have heard enough to satisfy that must if must so will for sake emmeline ran away quite happy to try must to soothe caroline whose self reproach have a usual terminated in fit of ill temper anger against ellen instead of against mr hamilton entered school room stood by ellen so quietly that child did not perceive attention be completely absorbed in book after few minute suddenly pushed from exclaiming almost passionately can not learn try can miss harcourt will be so very very angry gave way for first time since arrival at oakwood to violent burst of tear what be very very difficult lesson little ellen inquired aunt kindly taking one hand from face tell will be able to learn together perhaps oh be because be so very stupid miss harcourt have explained to twice know know ought to understand well then never mind to day can learn much better day than others know dare say to morrow will be able to conquer miss harcourt be already displeased will be still more so if leave without permission replied sobbing girl longing not daring to throw arm round aunt neck lean aching head against bosom not if beg reprieve replied aunt smiling must not let make so very unhappy ellen be afraid be not only lesson that be ill unhappy about something else tell dearest what can do to make more happy more at home oh nothing nothing replied ellen struggling with tear indeed be happier than ever thought must be must be very ungrateful to make think be unhappy when be so good so kind head ached to day always make feel wish to cry indeed be not unhappy never when kiss call ellen may feel when be not by a if frightened at own confession hid face in aunt dress mr hamilton lifted into lap kissed without speaking must learn to love more more then ellen said after pause when be feeling ill in pain must not be afraid to tell will think that only fancy love oh be not fancy never loved one a do except papa own darling good papa word be almost choked with sob used to fondle praise call darling ellen a uncle hamilton did emmeline last sunday when be ill so ill said must die never left except when military duty called away used to nurse try to amuse might forget pain weakness oh will never never forget dreadful night closed eye shuddered a horrid scene of blood death flashed before what dreadful night poor child inquired mr hamilton soothingly after doubting whether not must be better for ellen to pursue evidently painful theme longer requiring explanation of emotion previous sabbath night poor papa be killed oh there be so many horrid form on grass native poor papa own men looked so ghastly in moonlight grass be covered with blood limb head have be shot off there be such cry groan of pain see hear again so often before go to sleep when head feel a doe to day fancy hear poor papa last word feel kiss a lay bleeding bleeding slowly to death voice be so strange lip so cold how came in dreadful scene poor ellen who must have permitted little child to be there because wished so very much knew must die before must bring to did so want to feel kiss hear voice once more oh aunt emmeline will never see again know can not come to will oh will ever be good enough to go to looked up in aunt face with countenance of beseeching entreaty mr hamilton eye filled with tear be full minute before must speak when did ellen felt more relieved comforted than on subject of father death have ever felt before from mother not being able to bear subject even partially alluded to from having one to whom must speak of have taken still stronger hold of imagination whenever be unusually weak head aching confused became still more vivid very visible sympathy interest of aunt gentle word in tried to turn child thought from scene of horror to happiness of father in heaven assurance that if tried to do duty to love serve god trust in mercy to render effort acceptable must rejoin seemed to remove mass of tangled thought within young mind head indeed still ached very painfully eye seemed a if must close notwithstanding effort to keep open when awoke from long quiet sleep on sofa in mr hamilton dressing room where aunt have laid found that kind friend still watching over little heart temple have ceased to throb so quickly felt better happier mr maitland medical friend of family confirmed opinion edward have said physician in india have given of sister state of health did not said consider liable to serious illness of constitution must not endure that feared must be year before knew blessing of really good health be constantly subject to lassitude severe headache depression of whole system thence proceeding must prevent liveliness quickness of acquirement natural to most child thought evil have be very greatly increased by want of sufficient care in early year unwholesome climate in have so long lived that wondered mother have not be advised to send over to england adding with smile be quite sure mr hamilton must not have refused charge anxious a might have be earnestly not only on account of child physical mental health did mr hamilton wish that such have be case that have have care of niece from earliest infancy how much more must have wished have known that mr fortescue have really be advised to do with ellen a mr maitland have said that believing merely idle fancy persisting too in own headstrong idea that be ill temper not illness rendered ellen so disagreeable must not stoop so to conquer unfortunate pride a to ask favor of relative to whom else must appeal colonel fortescue have none distant cousin did satisfy qualm of conscience by once suggesting to husband a own idea however not a of experienced physician that a fancied ellen be always ill might be better in england a expected not only intense love for little girl rose up against idea of separation pride revolted from sending to claim pity of relative who have so completely cast off parent yet have be told be absolutely necessary for health so greatly for happiness must not have hesitated to sacrifice thought of self eleanor satisfied that have done duty delighted that in one respect be quite a proud a be never again referred to subject physician who have thus advised from constant removal never chanced to meet great indeed be amount of childish suffering selfish decision on part of mother occasioned ellen mean pain of constant languor though in full amount happy healthful young reader can not have least idea of perhaps think almost pleasant change care petting present so often lavished on brief decided illness be very different thing to kind of suffering only so affect a to be dull heavy know why to make very difficult task to learn lesson others find so easy such pain sometimes to move that be thought slow unwilling perhaps even idle when must gladly run help work a others so weak sometimes tear start at first harsh unkind word be thought cross when in least feel so not for few week with few exception trial of month even year be ellen not even tenderest most unfailing care of aunt must entirely guard from be most difficult thing for who be strong healthy to understand always bear with physical suffering in others miss harcourt though in general free from thing like prejudice ardently desirous to follow up own mr hamilton idea of right wrong must not so govern affection a to feel same toward ellen a did toward edward child have lived with taught so long task with ellen required more patience forbearance care than with of others sometimes must not help believing acting toward a if be willful idleness carelessness not languor of disease with recollection evidence of herbert who have be delicate from birth who be yet of such remarkably gifted mind so bright in aspect so sweet in temper that illness seemed to have spiritualized instead of deadened faculty must not understand a mr hamilton did force of circumstance in producing from nearly same cause two much different effect how be that complete neglect have engendered more evil than indiscreet indulgence that appeared to have done so be unhappily only too evident not only to miss harcourt to mr hamilton seemed almost surprising certainly proof of remarkably good disposition edward appeared so free from great fault of such warm generous frank seemingly unselfish nature so open to conviction to good impression except occasional fit of violent passion there really be a far a aunt uncle must perceive nothing to complain of did not know that stood in such awe of mr hamilton from mother lesson of exceeding sternness that exercised greatest control over be so excessively fond of mr howard day glided by in such varied delightful employment that there be temptation to do wrong except certain act of trifling disobedience of more consequence from self will betrayed than act might have be source of anxiety to aunt lessened confidence in have known did not for ellen not only constantly concealed be sufferer for so brought reproof suspicion on must truth have be known might have be averted truth of act a well a word have never be impressed on edward therefore though be constitutionally too brave to utter falsehood too honorable to shield at expense of if knew that other suffered have be too long taught to believe that ellen be inferior must always give up to to imagine that be even acting deceitfully unmanfully in permitting to conceal act of disobedience there be so much to love admire in edward that mr mr hamilton imagined real weakness of character that lovable quality sprung from natural impulse unsustained by thing like principle quickness apparent fervor with received religious impression mr howard sought so earnestly to instill in short time be allowed before entered navy augured so hopefully from that not only preceptor uncle ever anxious aunt looked forward to career with scarcely doubt a to probity honor ellen caused infinitely more anxiety there be disregard to truth want of openness candor though mr hamilton believed effect of neglect extreme timidity husband miss harcourt feared be natural much indeed sprung from poor child mistaken idea of nature solemnity of promise have made mother constant watchfulness determination to shield edward for disregard to truth mother have indeed alone be answerable ellen naturally very timid character required inculcation of high firm principle to enable so to conquer a to speak truth even if suffered from be only indeed in extreme case of fear never to father that have ever spoken falsely to mr hamilton high principle by extreme diligence care have so successfully imparted to own child even concealment be often acted untruth of fault equivocation ellen be too often guilty exciting miss harcourt caroline prejudice yet more against latter with fault never swerved from rigid truth have strong contempt dislike toward who did except friend annie who a always took care to speak truth to did not suspect of being le careful than emmeline who have have difficulty in restraining love of exaggeration also in so conquering own timidity fear a always to speak truth only pitied ellen did not love le of course be not till month have passed that light shadow of character in orphan in opinion culled forth in around must be discovered notwithstanding stood almost alone in opinion notwithstanding there be very little outward evidence that be correct mr hamilton believed there be great deal more in niece than be discernible seemed to posse strength almost intensity of feeling warmth of affection if properly guided must effectually aid in removing childish error engendered by neglect be belief not only enabled to bear calmly anxiety care often pain fault compelled correction occasioned actually to love niece if possible still more than edward very nearly with same amount of quiet intense affection felt for own child chapter v young gentleman in passion walk scene of distress one very fine morning in may mr hamilton invited edward to join in walk intending also to call at moorland greville manor on way lad be released for few day from attendance on mr howard that gentleman having be summoned on clerical business to exeter percy be to accompany father on equestrian excursion herbert have be commissioned by emmeline day before to take book to mary greville have looked forward to spending morning with edward delighted at being selected a aunt companion prepared with haste glee for excursion robert be however unfortunately not at hand to give clean pair of shoe have already spoiled two pair that morning by going into stream ran through park to sail newly rigged frigate angry at delay fearing that aunt must not wait for worked into violent passion that when robert did appear gave vent to more abusive language than have ever yet ventured to use concluding by hurling discarded shoe at domestic who only escaped severe blow by starting aside permitting to go through window robert leave room desire that will not again give assistance to master fortescue till know how to ask be mr hamilton most unexpected interference edward so started at voice look that passion be suddenly calmed finish toilet when have found shoe put away may join in breakfast room edward only wait pleasure never did edward leave presence more gladly shame have suddenly conquered anger though chest still heaved cheek be still flushed did not utter word till nearly quarter of mile on walk twice have looked up in aunt face a if about to speak expression be so very grave that felt strangely afraid to proceed at length exclaimed be displeased with dear aunt indeed must not help feeling angry be still more sorry than displeased edward have hoped be learning more control to know duty to domestic better uncle oh pray tell implored edward will ask robert pardon moment go home certainly will not complain of to edward if argument can convince of error if be only to ask robert pardon for fear of uncle must rather must not do so tell truth if be quite sure uncle must know nothing about must still ask robert pardon edward unhesitatingly answered why not because think ought to ask mine for keeping waiting a did for being insolent first to did not keep waiting above five minute be fault not a be employing a for insolence can tell what said edward hesitated remember exact word know called impatient if be have right to tell so did heard passed must not help thinking how very far superior be robert poor country youth to young gentleman who abused color rose to edward temple set teeth clenched hand to prevent farther display of anger aunt after attentively observing continued said that young master percy never required impossibility though often impatient never abused heard word feeling have be so believed applied to yourself in what can be superior asked edward in low voice a if still afraid passion must regain ascendency will answer question by edward suppose one have used abusive term toward contemptuously desired to get out of sight how must have answered must have struck to earth replied edward passionately quite forgetting wished for control equal superior must dare speak so to again what prevented robert acting in same manner do think have feeling that be incapable of such emotion a pain anger edward stood for minute quite still silent did not think thing about said at length certainly supposed have right to say what pleased to one so far beneath in what be robert so far beneath be servant be gentleman in birth rank stop edward did make gentleman be credit to individually to be higher in world receive better education than robert edward be again silent aunt continued to talk to so kindly yet so earnestly that at length exclaimed feel have indeed be wrong dear aunt what can do to prove to robert be really sorry for having treated so ill be really sorry edward do only say for fear of uncle displeasure indeed have quite forgotten replied edward earnestly deserve anger must willingly expose to if must redeem fault must rather see endeavor earnestly to restrain passion dear boy than inflict such pain upon will be great pleasure to if can really so conquer a to apologize to robert think pain of so doing will enable more easily to remember have be saying than if weakly shrink from life have chosen make even more anxious that must become le passionate than be to remain longer with fear will so often suffer seriously from very often make resolution never to be in passion again returned edward sorrowfully whenever thing provokes something seems to come in throat be compelled to give way will not be able to conquer fault dear edward without great perseverance remember more difficult task greater reward that can control anger have even during walk have proof edward looked up surprised did not feel very angry when said robert be superior yes replied edward blushing deeply yet successfully checked rising passion for fear of offending can not be always near dear boy must endeavor to remember that lesson have tried to teach so often that be never alone can not even think angry thought much le speak abusive word commit most trifling act of passion without offending god if must ask for help recollect to offend be far more terrible than to incur displeasure of uncle think must find task much easier than if attempted trusting in own strength alone only for fear of man edward did not make reply countenance expressed such earnest thought softened feeling that mr hamilton determined on not interrupting by calling at moorland a have intended so turned in direction of greville manor walked on for little time in silence gradually ascending one of steep narrow green flowery lane peculiar to devonshire on reaching summit of hill pausing moment by little gate opened on rich meadow through path lay exclamation of how beautiful burst from edward field of alternate red green sloped down to river edge green bearing glistening color peculiar to may red from full rich soil betraying that plow have lately be there contrasting beautifully with limpid water whose deep azure seemed to mock very heaven dart from point seemed no longer meandering river be so encompassed by thick wood fertile hill that resembled lake to there be outlet inlet save from land tree presented that exquisite variety of green peculiar to may so lofty be slope on grew that seemed to touch very sky while others bent gracefully over water thick branch nearly touched hill presented complete mosaic of red green field divided by high hedge from oak elm beech ash must start up of growth so superb a to have semblance of cultivated park not of natural woodland greville manor elizabethan building stood on right surrounded by ancient wood though lovely still mr greville excess have already shorn off of finest timber part of river be in complete shade from overhanging branch while beyond must stretch bright blue of heaven in other part stray sunbeam must dart through opening in thick branch shine like bright spot in surrounding darkness farther on cloudless sun so flung down full refulgence that moving water flashed sparkled like burning gem be not beautiful dear aunt sometimes feel a if be not half so passionate in open air a in house can tell why not exactly edward replied smiling be very pleased to hear say so to find that can admire such lovely scene a to feeling presence of loving god be so impressed upon work can so distinctly trace goodness love power in gift of such bountiful world feel still more how wrong be to indulge in vexation care anxiety when in midst of beautiful country than when at home perhaps be something of same feeling working in though know how to define can never do feel thing wrong dear aunt said edward looking with surprised inquiry in face indeed dear boy know that very often have wrong thought feeling that only father in heaven infinite mercy enables to overcome must be very sad if be a faulty a easily led into error a cousin may be when have have so many more year to think try to improve in just in same way a have duty to perform feeling to overcome so have if fail in endeavor to lead in better happier path feel too much anxiety shrink from giving pain when compelled to correct fault in of be just a likely to incur displeasure of father in heaven a be when be passionate angry perhaps still more so for more capable be of knowing doing duty more wrong be when fail in even in thought there be so much in reply to surprise edward seemed so to fill mind with new idea that continued walk in absolute silence that aunt must ever fail a seemed to say have did even still at time found difficult to do right be very strange yet somehow seemed to comfort to inspire with sort of courage to emulate conquer difficulty have fancied that must not possibly understand how difficult be for always to be good when found that must do so even from own experience word appeared endowed with double force loved looked up to more than ever ten minute more brought to gothic lodge of manor instead of seeking front entrance mr hamilton led way to flower garden on mr greville usual morning room opened by glass door herbert be to tell mary of intended visit wonder be not watching for a usual observed mr hamilton somewhat anxiously anxiety increased a on nearing half open door saw poor mary head leaning against herbert deluged in tear mr greville be not there though book work map upon table told of morning employment

mother ill dear mary what can have happened to agitate so painfully inquired a at first sound of voice poor girl sprung toward tried to say how very glad be that have come just then word be inarticulate from sob mr hamilton desiring edward to amuse in garden made sit down by told not to attempt to check tear to let have free vent few minute then to try tell what have occurred be very sad

called boy right spirit promised required there be quivering on mother lip deadly paleness on cheek that spoke volume of suffering to heart of observant mary who sat trembling beside still mr greville did not speak till husband left room then a alfred be about to follow caught hold of hand implored with tone look of agony only to listen to for sake to give up intended pleasure almost frightened by emotion in gentle mother have scarcely ever seen suddenly remembering that have lately be indeed most unkind neglectful to threw arm round neck promised with tear that if gave so much pain must not go

conveyed to own room partially undressed laid on bed before at recovered brief while have clasped mary to bosom a if in be indeed only earthly comfort then in faint voice desired to be left quite alone mary have flung on neck of sympathizing herbert hamilton who have arrived just in confusion attendant on mr greville unusual illness wept there in uncontrolled violence of early sorrow mr hamilton remained time with afflicted friend for so truly must sympathize with that society brought with only solace mr greville be capable of realizing from human companionship be not for be only word that in painful interview might have even seemed like complaint for poor child how be fragile frame gentle spirit to endure through trial such a oh emmeline to lose through father difficult

resume usual avocation by assumption of cheerfulness constant employment to restore degree of peace happiness to child herbert edward seemed inclined to converse on walk home mr hamilton be so engrossed in thought for mr greville that did not feel disposed to speak herbert be contrasting father with mary with such vivid sense of own happier lot that felt almost oppressed with thought be not

take notice of when be good have mr hamilton told not to go to race not exactly have merely said think day most unprofitably wasted that gambling excess always attendant of race be not fit scene for young person be to take horse go must not perhaps be actually displeased a be old enough now say in thing to judge for must be acting against principle just now be not inclined to do for be sure to suffer from afterward well can say be that when be a old a be percy will certainly consider under one hope will be at eton by time then will see if cecil grahame have not spirit in must not be tied down to oakwood to mr howard humdrum lesson a be percy for world take care cecil grahame spirit doe not effervesce so much a to make when at eton wish back at moorland replied percy laughing heartily at young companion grotesque attempt at self consequence by placing cap dandily on head flourishing cane trying to make look taller cecil took laugh however in good part continued in amicable conversation till mr hamilton summoned percy to attend home reader have perhaps discovered that percy day be not quite a lively a usual if have not mother did for strange to say walked by side silent dispirited thoughtlessness very often led into error disagreeable consequence fearing have again be case playfully inquired cause of most unusual abstraction colored evaded question successfully roused to talk mother be not anxious for have such perfect confidence in that know if have committed error must redeem that own good feeling high principle must prevent recurrence so happened however that young hamilton by series of rather imprudent action have plunged into very unusual disagreeable position a not very well to know how to extricate from without full confession to father daringly brave a in general be felt almost a if really have not courage to make one of mr hamilton most imperative command be that son must never incur debt to prevent temptation monthly allowance be ample one fully permitted recreative indulgence might desire now percy be rather inclined to extravagance from thoughtlessness profuse generosity have often caused such annoyance a to make resolve again again to follow father advice keep account of expenditure a slight check on admiration for beauty in fine art mother have so sedulously cultivated have have only one bad effect be that passion for print painting illustrated richly bound volume sometimes carried beyond bound very often occasioned regret that have not examined letter press of such work a well a engraving binding have given order to mr large fancy stationer librarian publisher of t to procure for set of engraving whose very interesting subject beautiful workmanship mr grahame have so vividly described to that young hamilton felt to do without till father must visit metropolis so judge of worth be quite impossible order be given without least regard to price arrived at end of month young gentleman to extreme astonishment discovered that month allowance have be so expended a not to leave half quarter of necessary sum what to do did not very well know mr harris have have great difficulty in procuring print of course be bound in honor to take if waited till must pay for must sacrifice whole of one month allowance then how must keep free from debt till next a for applying to father shrank from with actual pain how must ask ever kind indulgent parent to discharge debt incurred by such thoughtless act of unnecessary extravagance mr harris made very light of declaring that if mr percy did not pay for twelvemonth be of consequence must trust for sum time liked to make attempt to liquidate debt be a impossible a to speak to father no after violent struggle with pride did not at like idea of betraying inability to pay whole of asking favor of mr harris agreed to pay debt by installment so in two three month at very latest discharge whole one week afterward received month allowance riding over directly to town relieved conscience of load to have only usual sum however for monthly expenditure caused so many check annoyance a to make hate very sight of print whose possession have so coveted looked forward to next month to be free at least of mr harris idea of disobedience to father in incurring debt at causing more annoyance than rest again first day of month came round putting full sum required in purse set off on way encountered scene of distress that thought fled from mind except how to relieve accompanied miserable half famished man to hut in lay seemingly dying woman with new born babe two three small half starved half naked child listened to story be really one of truth misfortune not of whining deceit poured whole content of purse into lap rode off to t to find not mr harris mr maitland implore to see what skill must do for poor woman encountered that gentleman at outskirt of town told story be so delighted at mr maitland willing promise to go directly also to report case to who must relieve that never thought of thing else till found directly opposite mr harris shop bounding heart sunk suddenly down a impelled by weight of lead conviction flashed upon that have be giving away money be actually not own deed have be productive of so much internal happiness now seemed to reproach condemn rode back without even seeking mr harris for what must tell a reason of non payment certainly not having given away first of may be birthday have be long engaged to spend with young men lad who be to have grand game of cricket jovial dinner adjournment to evening amusement to conclude day gay supper with glee song mr hamilton have rather wished percy to leave party after dinner have told so merely however a preference not command giving permission to use own discretion percy knew there must be several expense attendant on day still have promised so long to be one of party have declared must be nothing without own inclination so urged to join that seemed to utterly impossible to draw back especially a must give excuse for doing so how must say that must not afford when be ought to have be nearly richest of party what must father think went day be thoroughly delightful so exciting that though have started from home with intention of leaving after dinner must not resist pleading of companion own wish remained at supper alone excitement revelry seemed to have gained upper hand percy though steady in entirely abstaining from excess be not quite so guarded a usual clergyman have lately appeared at t whose appearance manner opinion have given more than usual food for gossip much uncharitableness cloth indeed ought to have protected rather increased satire sarcasm laughter excited be brought forward by thoughtless youth of percy party quizzed unmercifully made object of clever caricature satire though young hamilton at first kept aloof must not resist contagion dashed off about dozen verse of such remarkably witty clever point that be received with roar of applause unanimous request for distribution positively refused put up with one two other poem of more innocent wit in be fond of indulging into pocket day closed next morning brought with so many regret confused recollection of very unusual excitement of previous evening that be glad to dismiss subject from mind threw satire a believed into fire in fact be so absorbed with disagreeable conviction that must only pay mr harris third of remaining debt trifling a in reality be that thought of nothing else now mr harris be editor publisher of rather clever weekly paper percy happened to be in parlor waiting to speak to while be paying contribution wish head be clever enough to get out of debt in comfortable way said half laughing a gentleman left together wish customer be a desirous of paying large debt a be small one be mr harris reply have heard something of clever verse mr percy if will let see really may be able to oblige a seem so very anxious to have nothing more to do with in way of debt not of purchase mr harris assure be not thinking so much about a of own disobedience will lend paper only must give word not to publish with name will not be worth so much replied mr harris smiling only let feel have helped to discharge debt at least let know how much more be wanted to do so will worship mus henceforth replied percy with almost natural gayety for felt wrote better verse than mr harris have be so liberally paying for idea of feeling free again be so very delightful that after receiving mr harris solemn promise not to betray authorship galloped home more happy than have be for day mr harris have said must have that evening robert be leaving for town a young master entered house hastily put up portfolio sent off conscience be so perfectly free from keeping thing that afterward have cause to regret that did not think of looking over great be delight when few line arrived from mr harris speaking in highest term of talent saying that set of verse have selected even without attraction of name must entirely liquidate trifling debt for next few day percy trod on air have resolved on waiting till poem appeared then a really have discharged debt take courage confess whole to father for idea of truth made shrink from farther concealment hoped believed that father must regard pain constant annoyance have be enduring so long a sufficient penalty for disobedience after time give back confidence feared must at first confession be withdrawn what then be grief vexation almost despair when recognized in poem selected verse thought believed have burned morning after be written in print read by sober self seemed heartless glaring cruel insult not only on fellow creature minister of god that felt almost overwhelmed what must do mr harris be not to blame for have made reservation a to content of portfolio name indeed be not to only having be read lightly once to companion of hateful supper for so now felt almost of whom be not perfectly sober there be chance of never being recognized a a subject did not live near town where paper be likely to circulate might never meet eye be poor comfort paper be very seldom seen at oakwood content be often spoken of before parent how must endure reference to verse how bear accumulation of concealment a felt deceit sprung from one thoughtless act of ordering expensive unnecessary indulgence without sufficient consideration how be to be paid to tell father avow author of such satire on subject must not must tell mother implore intercession that seemed like want of confidence in father no if ever must gain courage to confess must be to mr hamilton alone more thought more for first time courage failed be only day before visit to lady helen that have discovered accumulation of misfortune therefore be not much wonder be so dispirited two day afterward herbert with blushing cheek very timid voice asked father to grant great favor be almost afraid to ask said hoped believed parent must trust assurance that be for nothing improper be that might be from home next day unattended for several hour must go on horseback be so accustomed to ride horse be so steady hoped might be allowed to go alone mr hamilton looked very much surprised a did present that quiet studious herbert must wish to give up favorite pursuit so soon too after mr howard return go on appeared mysterious excursion be something so extraordinary that various expression of surprise broke from sister edward percy did look up made observation mr hamilton only paused however to consult wife face then replied certainly have mystified dear boy freely grant consent if can read mother face aright hers be not far distant be now nearly fifteen never once from birth have conduct given hour pain uneasiness have therefore quite sufficient confidence in integrity steadiness to trust a wish alone will not even ask intention for be sure will not lead into wrong thank again again own dear father hope will never do thing to forfeit confidence replied herbert so eagerly that cheek flushed still deeper eye glistened then throwing on stool at mother foot said pleadingly will too trust dearest mother promise not to be anxious if appear till after dinner hour promise will have pleasure in expedition most faithfully replied mr hamilton fondly trust herbert almost a must father say a much for young man for added playfully laying hand on percy shoulder laughing at edward who be so excessively amused at sage herbert turning truant that be giving vent to variety of most grotesque antic of surprise percy sighed so heavily that mother be startled did not intend to call very heavy sigh boy said in emergency must trust quite a implicitly a herbert have often wished have steadiness indeed do mother wish be more like in thing exclaimed percy far more despondingly than usual will be steady in time boy have not very slightest fear a like variety even in son must rather retain percy with boyish error than have even herbert so pray look so sad will fancy have given pain when only spoke in jest percy threw arm round waist kissed two three time without saying word when started up said in usual gay tone a be not going to turn truant next day must go finish work saw tear in eye that something be wrong felt certain still trusted in candor integrity did not express fear even to husband morrow came percy edward went to mr howard herbert at half past nine mounted quiet horse after affectionately embracing mother again promising care steadiness departed have risen at five morning studied till breakfast so earnestly that double portion be prepared for next day have said a be starting that if might remain out so long must like to call at greville manor on way back take tea there return home in cool of evening next request very modest son will be suppose to stay out night replied mr hamilton that certainly will be refused be last to will consent off with boy enjoy herbert did not expect to enjoy half a much a if have gone to mr howard a usual did not like to mention real object for appeared a if chance be so much against attainment if be fulfilled to speak about must be equally painful from having be act of kindness day passed quietly full hour before prayer herbert be seen riding through ground when entered usual sitting room looked so happy so animated that if parent have felt anxiety have not must have vanished at once though be contented not to ask question young party be not except by percy who seemed intently engaged with drawing be attacked on side to add to mirth mr hamilton took part of curious wife that of son ah mamma may well take herbert part exclaimed little joyous emmeline for of course know about must never keep from indeed indeed have not even told mamma be reply from at same moment denial be useless prayer bell rung before satisfaction for curious must be obtained except from half past six herbert have be very quietly at mr greville night a percy sat in gloomy meditation in own room before retired to bed felt hand laid gently on shoulder looking up beheld brother have lost interest in percy asked herbert with almost melancholy reproach if have expressed one word of inquiry a to proceeding must have told without slightest reserve have never before be so little concerned for indeed like must not ask confidence dear herbert when for last three month have be wanting in openness to indeed annoyed a be with own folly be a deeply interested a rest in expedition though guessed object must be nothing kindness how must ask secret when be so reserved with then let have secret from other longer dearest percy pleaded herbert twining arm round neck looking with affectionate confidence in face at see why secret must comprise more worth kindness than yours talk of folly have fancied for day that be not quite happy often blame so much more than deserve that frighten in least said last night wished be more like indeed if be must be very sorry what must become of without mirth liveliness strength ever working care to protect from thing like pain mentally bodily must not like own self for brother at for mine replied percy so strangely cheered that almost laughed at herbert very novel idea after listening with earnest interest to story took courage told own herbert in instance however must not comfort a successfully a usual satire be terrible thing thing else that even disobedience of debt thought might be easily remedied by open confession to father unfortunate oversight in not looking over paper before sent to mr seeming utter impossibility to stop circulation be to single hearted high principled lad something almost overwhelming did not in least signify to percy might never be known a author herbert must not tell what to do except if must get sufficient courage to tell father even if must not help be sure must be great weight off mind then gently reproached for not coming to to help discharge debt be surely much better to owe trifle to brother than to mr harris to gratify extravagance deprive of much purer better pleasure replied percy indignantly bertie never expect to do such thing must rather suffer penalty of own fault fifty time over wish to heaven be child again added with almost comic ruefulness have mamma to come to night a used to do before went to sleep be so easy then to tell have done wrong in course of day then one error never grew into so many now must be out before sunday suppose never can talk to father a do on day unless be go to bed dear herbert will have pale cheek upon conscience to morrow too chapter vii mr morton story confession young pleader generosity not always justice do remember emmeline mr morton who officiated for mr howard at aveling five six week ago

happy comfortable home for parent comfort now enjoyed earned by worth of son amply repaid for former privation one cold snowy night be summoned to poor parishioner living about ten mile distant road be rugged in part dangerous be not man to shrink from duty for such reason be detained eight hour during time snow have fallen incessantly be pitchy dark still believing knew road proceeded next morning be found lying apparently dead at foot of precipice almost crushed under mangled distorted carcass of horse exclamation of horror burst from little group except from percy herbert face of former be covered with hand brother seemed so watching feeling for a to be unable to join general sympathy however be so engrossed with mr hamilton tale that be observed be so severely injured that for month very life be despaired of symptom of decline followed inability to resume ministerial duty for year if ever again compelled to resign rich beautiful living in yorkshire felt once more burden on parent with scarcely hope of supporting again be figure once so slight supple have become so shrunk maimed that at first seemed actually to loathe sight of fellow voice once so rich almost thrilling became wiry almost painfully monotonous for month conflict for submission to inscrutable most awful trial be so terrible that nearly sunk beneath be of course still more physical than mental gradually subsided a after eighteen month residence in madeira where be sent by benevolent friend portion of health returned same benefactor established father in humble most welcome business in london earnestly on return did parent persuade to remain quietly with not undertake ministry again must not do gratefully accepted poor most miserable parish on moor not eight mile from here when did become acquainted with papa asked caroline have never mentioned before dear never saw till sunday officiated for mr howard appearance so deeply interested did not rest till have learned whole history mr howard have already discovered have be nearly year in devonshire so kept aloof from own poor parishioner dreading ridicule sneer of more worldly wealthy that be mere accident made mr howard acquainted with good minister friendship earnest exhortation have so far overcome too great sensitiveness a sometimes to prevail on to visit vicarage trust in time equally to succeed in bringing here what be so afraid of dear papa innocently asked emmeline surely nobody must be so cruel a to ridicule because be deformed unfortunately dear child there be too many who only enter church for sake of sermon preacher to criticise severely uncharitably that differs from preconceived idea to such person mr morton must be object of derision now come to real reason of asking mother if remembered then have reason answered mr hamilton smiling story have made wonder whether have not must tax memory once more emmeline before cause be told do recollect for fortnight after sunday heard preached twice week at torrington to oblige very particular friend yes that feared increased number of congregation proceeded far more from curiosity than kindliness devotion did say so fear be confirmed affair brought morton to torrington for two three day week yesterday called on have hour interesting conversation be evidently even more than usually depressed shrinking if may use word at length touched seemed by sympathy drew attention to poem in harris 'weekly magazine ' 'it be not enough that have pleased god to afflict ' said fellow creature must unkindly make subject of attack such a there be indeed name to none else will apply ' must not reply for really felt too deeply for be such cruel wanton insult very talent of writer for verse though few in number be remarkably clever adding to gall wonder harris must have published observed miss harcourt paper be not in general of personal kind be never sufficiently guarded must require person of higher principle than fear harris have to resist temptation of inserting satire likely to sell double treble number of paper spoke to at once bought up one remained though expressed regret be not in tone at satisfied a to feeling of course a paper have be published since last saturday evening circulation have nearly ceased if must know author think must make feel excessive cruelty if not actual guilt of wanton deed dear papa person who wrote might not have known story interposed caroline to edward ellen astonishment that have courage to speak at for uncle unusual tone look brought back almost more vividly than have ever done before mother lesson of exceeding terrible sternness doe not excuse ridicule dear child only confirms lesson have so often tried to teach that thing tending by word deed to hurt feeling of fellow creature be absolutely wrong wrong in thing not according to greater le amount of pain may excite dear husband writer may not have be so taught satire ridicule be unhappily so popular that verse may have be penned without thought of evil tendency merely a to eclat must bring author must not be too severe for know mother mother speak so if have ever loved at length exclaimed poor percy so choked with emotion that must only throw by side bury face in lap sob for few minute like child recovered with strong effort before of family must conquer anxiety alarm standing erect though pale a marble without in least degree attempting excuse extenuation acknowledged poem a poured out whole story with sole exception of how have disposed of money with second time of receiving allowance have intended to discharge debt manner in told that part of tale from fear that must seem like excuse boast be certainly more calculated to call for doubt than belief herbert be about to speak imploring glance from percy checked mr hamilton be silent several minute after son have concluded before must reply percy be so evidently distressed have suffered so much from consequence of own error felt so intensely unintentional publication of poem for father knew truth far too well to doubt tale there be something so intrinsically noble in brave confession that to condemn severely felt a if must not of willful cruelty toward mr morton story have certainly exculpated said a sternly a must otherwise must be aware that have given grief pain more so because evidently shrink from telling in what manner squandered away that money must have be sufficient to have fully discharged debt six week ago must therefore believe there be still deed of folly unrevealed condemn to punishment be old enough now to know right from wrong own feeling must condemn applaud have be firm a have hoped be example must not so have worked upon a to tempt even composition of satire a be must reap consequence of weakness in painful consciousness that have deeply wounded one who must seem have be already sufficiently afflicted confidence must for time be broken between go sir hour of attendance on mr howard be passed mr hamilton rose with last word somewhat hastily quitted room percy only ventured one look at mother seemed so grieved so sad that must not bear darting out of room be seen in le than minute traversing ground in direction of vicarage at rate edward fleet a in general be must not overtake herbert lingered must not bear that part of percy story must remain concealed so told at once how second allowance have be expended mr hamilton eye glistened percy incoherence on one point have given more anxiety than thing else relief truth bestowed be inexpressible imprudent be there be something so lovable in such disposition that must not resist going directly to husband to impart always bring comfort dearest be fond rejoinder anxious a boy thoughtlessness must make for what be temptation now to what will be still must imbibe fond belief that with open generous truthful heart can not go far wrong what be to do about unfortunate poem can not associate with morton knowing truth yet permit to believe be a ignorant of author a let speak to percy before decide on anything dear arthur be mr morton still at torrington be to return to heathmore morning mr hamilton looked very thoughtful did not make rejoinder in hour of recreation emmeline declaring be much too hot for garden sought mother private sitting room with intention of asking where must find father to great delight question be arrested on lip for be there seated on knee remained there for minute without speaking only looking up in face with most coaxing expression imaginable well emmeline what great favor be going to ask said mr hamilton smiling weighty boon be quite sure indeed papa how do know that can read in eye eye be treacherous tell tale then will not see more replied laughing shaking head till long bright ringlet completely hid eye blushing cheek have told favor be going to ask replied father joining in laugh leave to tongue can read more think said mr hamilton be very much mistaken if know what emmeline be going to ask only that still hesitated a if afraid to continue mother added that papa will not be very angry with percy emmeline be not that boon have courage to ask still deeper glow mounted to child fair cheek throwing arm round father neck said coaxingly fondly mamma have guessed dear papa must indeed must forgive poor fellow be so very sorry have suffered so much already did not throw away money foolishly a thought gave to very poor people be always pleased when be charitable pray forget thing else treat a always do dear papa will not wonder be most certain that mamma must be witch emmeline most eloquent little pleader said mr hamilton caressingly stroking ringlet have disordered suppose after to day do grant request what then oh will be such dear darling good papa exclaimed emmeline almost suffocating with kiss then starting from knee danced about room in perfect ecstasy of delight percy will be happy again will be so happy mamma dear mamma be sure will be glad too now emmeline when have danced sober again come back to seat for a have listened to answered must listen to answer in instant be on knee again quite quiet attentive in first place do think percy be justified making mr morton object of satire at even if must never have left own portfolio papa be quite sure if have not be rather more excited heedless than usual be very likely must be know papa after such day of nothing pleasure must never have done thing be sure did not think of hurting mr morton feeling only wanted to prove that be quite a clever a companion be very natural know when be so clever at such thing brother percy willingly ridicule clergyman dear papa pray believe well defended little girl how do justify disobeying command incurring debt emmeline be silent be very wrong to do papa be sure when ordered engraving did not intend to disobey know be naturally very mean little impatient still on defensive emmeline even against better judgment well well must not make condemn brother doe know what eloquent pleader have in sister papa pray tell why not because might think be only for sake forgave not for own know must not like that if be in place will know nothing more than desire dear little girl replied father drawing closer to with almost involuntary tenderness now will try remember what be going to say wish only to think of percy kind act in giving money to poor people must have be better pleased in case have be more just not so generous know be not unfrequently said by young person when think be doing charitable act can only do by postponing payment of debt mr so so have plenty of business can afford to wait for money poor creature be starving ' now be not generosity charity actual injustice giving away money be literally not own believe percy thought so because have doubt forgot mr harris at time entirely still a be mere impulse of kindness doe not please quite so much a doe be charity papa be not have said that whenever be kind good to poor god be pleased with if percy did not intend to wrong mr harris only thought about relieving poor family be not good feeling be might have be still worthier suppose percy have encountered case of distress when on way to order engraving to enable to relieve a wished have given up purchasing that found must not afford two so gave up one mere individual gratification to succor unhappy fellow creature must not have be still worthier by conquest of own inclination rendered charity still more acceptable to god do quite understand emmy think do dear papa mean that though god be so good be pleased whenever be charitable be still better pleased when to be so give little pain very well explained little girl so see in instance if percy have be just before be generous then to be generous have denied pleasure conduct must not have given pain have be quite a worthy of praise must bestow now wonder how mamma must have discovered so exactly what favor have to ask mamma always know feeling wish almost before know though never can find out how will tell emmeline mother have devoted hour week month year to studying character of child so to know that may not only be able to guide in path of good to share little joy sorrow to heighten one guard from other ought not to be very grateful to father in heaven for giving such mother child made answer in word slipped from knee darting to mother clasped little arm tight round neck hid glowing cheek tearful eye in bosom from hour a felt mother fond return of passionate embrace love became religion though knew not thought flew to cousin many others who have mother to others whose mother left to nurse governess seemed always to keep at distance felt how must thank love god enough be mere feeling of moment became part of being for right moment have be seized to impress chapter viii unpleasant proposal mystery solved father grief from mother weakness father joy from mother influence meanwhile young heir of oakwood have passed no very pleasant day thought since mr howard return have be so pre occupied that study have be unusually neglected so much so a rather to excite displeasure of gentle forbearing preceptor emotion of morning have not tended to steady idea severe reproof long imposition be consequence not one word did deign to address herbert edward who perceiving leave vicarage with mark of irritation endeavored during walk home to soothe step be even more rapid than in have left home neither stopped spoke till have reached father library fortunately for indulgence of ire in word be untenanted dashed cap from brow flung book with violence on ground burst forth be not fool idiot thus to torment for one act of folly when hundred of boy at age be entirely own master do what please spend what please questioned reproved that poem how many must glory in authorship not care whit whom might wound why be fool a to reproach about then be punished like school boy with imposition to occupy at home because did not choose to learn in hour of study not choose wish mr howard must feel a have done to day nay week challenge to bore head with greek latin why be so cowed a to feel so why can not have same spirit a others instead of being such slave percy exclaimed mr hamilton who having sought moment heard hall door close have heard nearly whole of violent speech be almost alarmed at unusual passion evinced voice of astonished expostulation checked word not agitation threw on chair leaning arm upon table buried face upon while whole frame shook mother sat down by laying hand on arm said gently what be have so irritated dear percy what have made return home in such very different mood to in left tell boy percy tried to keep silence for knew if spoke must a expressed be child again pride tried hard for victory even father herbert at moment must have chafed into increased anger almost passionate love reverence felt for mother triumphed over wrath told be much more unhappy than angry that longed for to comfort a always have done in childish grief so put arm round laid head on shoulder said in half choked voice be very unhappy mother feel a if have be thing be bad cruel foolish so be relief to be in passion did not mean to hear cause more grief than have done already have be very thoughtless very foolish not quite so firm a must have wished own dear boy will not have accuse of graver fault replied mr hamilton a lightly pushed back clustering hair from heated forehead gentle touch of cool hand seemed a restorative a soothing word percy a listened to a continued speaking to in same strain for little time felt more relieved than five minute before thought possible more than ever determined that must never act so thoughtlessly if be tempted to do so never keep concealed so long again mr hamilton anxious desire with be always to do justice to better quality at same time that blamed convinced of fault be very delicate thing very difficult to succeed in perhaps impossible to mind le peculiarly refined heart le intensely anxious than mr hamilton difficulty failure have ever deterred in percy be already rewarded be of high fine spirit that unjust harshness must have actually confirmed in error unguarded word bring argument on argument so for mere sake of opposition cause to abide in opinion when acknowledgment of being right in thing produced voluntary confession of error in others now about unfortunate verse dear boy be not quite clear a to fate how happened that did not destroy directly returned home fully intended believed have done so mother whirl of night seemed to extend to morning dressed prepared for mr howard in such hurry have overslept too that though have quite resolved must not pollute pocket book longer have time to look over paper thought must not be mistaken in outside burnt really wished to keep threw have caused pain into portfolio if have be firm enough to have followed father advice left companion before supper if did join have not be so weak so mad a to yield to temptation adhered to principle notwithstanding might have be laughed at might have be spared be so excited so heated with more than sufficient quantity of wine did not know what be about not extent of wrong at least have suffered enough for evening excitement poor boy be sure must atone for if must atone for must give posse to cancel odious poem blot from mr morton memory a from own think can do percy looked at in utter bewilderment do mother repeated yes boy be painful remedy must be effectual one seek mr morton tell whole story percy crimsoned to very temple ask thing mother answered very hurriedly can not do think so at moment dear boy be not at astonished that must for will be very humiliating very painful if must spare humiliation pain yet produce same good effect need not tell how gladly must one can remove sting of poem from mr morton sensitive feeling be quite sure if will allow little time for quiet thought will agree with why must inflict such pain upon granting deserve answered percy still much heated when though poem be only one have unfortunately met eye others be quite a galling companion quite a much to blame why must be sufferer because by many error have brought on companion did indeed act very wrongly be quite sure that principle father mr howard have so carefully impressed upon have be a carefully impressed upon in such case be not more responsible have evidently no inward check to keep from amusement have for have acknowledged that kept aloof at first knowing be wrong only yielded from want of sufficient firmness inflict pain of avowal upon boy memory will help in future from yielding to too great weakness act prove to that though for moment led into great error be still a brave honest a believe percy did not reply countenance denoted inward struggle mother added suppose a be very likely mr morton becomes intimate here how can with open truthful heart associate with with comfort confidence even though perfectly satisfied that must not betray that must never know truth may fancy now that must know percy better must not talk to more for dressing bell rang minute ago remember dear boy lay command on to seek mr morton have only told that believe must restore to happiness atone for fault more effectually than thing else be quite at liberty to act a think proper left room a spoke percy remained for few minute longer in deep thought

greville mary returned with to house emmeline who have not seen mary for nearly fortnight be in ecstasy of enjoyment ellen always felt real pleasure quietly to walk by mary side answer many question with always contrived to interest on entering house mr hamilton herbert edward joined mr hamilton be somewhat surprised at even more than ordinary warmth with son be greeted by friend at flush stained cheek at mr greville first word be not too much fatigued last thursday hope dear herbert inquired a looked at eye glistened in tear oh not in least replied instantly a if must exceedingly like to change subject mr greville turning to mr hamilton continued will forgive emmeline if confess that visit evening be more to inquire after son than even to see be so anxious to know that have suffered inconvenience from unusual be sure fatiguing exertion suppose must not be jealous a be so candid replied mr hamilton smiling feel very much inclined to be so finding that be more in son confidence than be know herbert be from home on thursday be not aware of particular exertion on part did not know then where went exclaimed mary mother at same moment former continued with unusual eagerness did not know that went to race to try hear something of alfred that by hunting about fair race ground scene know so much dislike actually found amused so successfully that kept with day papa be so engaged that have time to look after alfred who from being left entirely to might have sought worst companion can not think what charm herbert used alfred be quite contented to be with dined together brought what next to boy be greatest consolation must have interposed mr greville voice so faltering that tear almost escaped few line assures alfred thought of writing telling must not bear to think have left home without kissing that though be so happy with father that must not wish to return home still loved mary very very much must continue to love come see whenever must oh emmeline can not imagine relief of such letter of hearing of at be through kindness goodness of boy when mr greville mary have first begun to speak herbert tried to retreat edward placing against door so that to open be impossible caroline emmeline at once catching hold of to keep prisoner egress be not to be thought of so in laughing despair broke from sister flung on usual seat mother stool almost hid in dress must have be relief indeed answered mr hamilton rejoiced be that quiet herbert thought of plan look up master shamefaced tell reason of most extraordinary mystery on occasion why did so carefully conceal intention from mother because papa feared might not approve of hardly dared think about for seemed a if be doing actually wrong in disregarding principle for only chance of effecting good know if have mentioned wish to find alfred hear something about must not have refused going then mamma must have known must have be anxious uncomfortable if have not appeared very moment have named must not continued looking up in face with expression of affection very few even comparative stranger have power to remit must indeed dear boy fear must have condemned scheme a very wild one really be glad thought so much of comfort a not to tell more than did so must not even be jealous jessie rather propose vote of thanks to mary for solving mystery think herbert ever excited so much curiosity speculation in life before entrance of mr grahame changed current of conversation greatly to herbert relief for did not at like being thus brought forward austere a grahame be at home be always welcomed with pleasure by young hamilton who never must understand why annie cecil must so fear that something unusual have annoyed mr hamilton perceived at first glance took notice for grahame seemed to find relief in talking gayly to young people where be friend percy inquired a joined happy group at tea percy be still absent mr hamilton repeated question in surprise wife replying that have gone to ride might not be back yet subject dropped after tea mr greville mary attended by herbert edward returned to manor little girl went to finish business for next day amuse a liked grahame remained alone with friend who at length drew from cause of solicitude have that morning discovered that notwithstanding positive command cecil have gone to prohibited place of amusement wife have prevaricated when questioned at one moment almost denying connivance at boy disobedience at unconsciously acknowledging by insisting that there be harm in if grahame must persist in so interfering with child amusement must expect to be disobeyed if such be home where be to look for truth honor affection what must be son after career if such be lesson of childhood have punished severely there be little hope of producing good effect when wife be yet more to blame than child must only alienate boy affection still more from yet what must do must let such disobedience untruthfulness for cecil have denied having be at race pas unnoticed have shut up in library remainder of day at length unable to bear own thought have walked over to oakwood feeling sure if peace be to be found must find there sympathy be easy for mr mr hamilton to give for felt sincerely to advise be delicate difficult to interfere in household be not part even of most intimate friend when lady helen encouraged boy in disobedience showed example of equivocation what must be said grahame must not bear idea of public school for boy scarcely eleven whose home influence be so injurious mr hamilton must not advise tried therefore merely to raise depressed spirit of friend bringing forward many instance when even best training failed others where fault of childhood be subdued by circumstance became fair promising youth grahame shook head despondingly can scarcely be fit judge of trial hamilton said have known nothing blessing of hand in hand companionship in training of child a in thing else there must be unity between father mother there be little hope of joy in offspring for be wife only in thing like yours see must not speak so added hurriedly a met glance of reproach from mr hamilton turned to address two lad who at instant entered from walk bell for prayer rung soon afterward grahame rose to say good night nay stay with said mr hamilton earnestly why must call for devotion be signal for separation join grahame be not first time by very many that have prayed together grahame yielded without instant hesitation still percy have not returned mother became dreadfully anxious husband at request waited quarter of hour reluctantly for be more particular that member of household must assemble at stated hour of prayer than in other point relating to establishment scarcely however have first word be said when percy robert entered former with very rapid noiseless step traversed large room kneeled in accustomed place in vain did mr hamilton try to keep thought fixed on service have really be to mr morton if have how have be received have fine spirit be soothed irritated thousand other nameless natural fear thronged heart one look on son a rose reassured cheek be flushed with rapid riding dark eye sparkled looked more bright joyous than have done for week advanced without hesitation to mr moment domestic have quitted library said eagerly still respectfully will too forgive dear father mr morton know whole truth have not only pardoned cruel folly assured have more than atoned for pain hateful verse inflicted that will laugh at declare know author a most particular friend hope will permit to become whenever have opportunity for such notice of will be surest way to consign to oblivion have endured so much pain last few week think will be so thoughtless weak in hurry again will try once more astonished touched far more than be ever in habit of allowing to feel much le to display mr hamilton have difficulty in replying word be even more than satisfactory to son eager heart for answered earnestly pray give praise for courage papa be quite sure if have not be for mamma suggestion never must have done might have crossed mind fear pride must not have permitted to listen to when mamma put case before a did must not prevent conscience from feeling truth of said if have not followed advice must have be more miserable still dearest mother continued a turned with even more than usual affection to receive nightly embrace have made so happy how can thank if made happy certainly have returned blessing for mr hamilton have seldom felt more exquisite pleasure than did at moment little emmeline though must not quite understand mother feeling felt in way almost a glad well mr hamilton will not son word confirm mine said mr grahame trying to speak cheerfully when young party have retired be again alone with friend can go far wrong with such friend indeed have done more than justice not enough when left have scarcely hope that very disagreeable advice must be followed besides mr grahame added more playfully be not from disagreeing with on mother influence that look reproached know well enough what meant still say that even now if must be le reserved stern must see many better quality a clearly a do fault might still win to will even with regard to child not now mr hamilton be too late have idea how look transported back to year past added evidently resolved to change subject when actually almost feared to approach do remember hamilton when told if miss manvers have fault be too cold will not easily forget incident of night replied mr hamilton with fond glance toward wife poor eleanor when conduct that evening fell under lash little thought orphan child must be living under roof to almost like own one very image observed grahame doe resemble in mind disposition edward almost a much in mind a in personal beauty replied mr hamilton not in point of disposition ellen doe not resemble poor mother in thing be like father did not know sufficiently to judge fancy not in fact hardly yet understand ellen indeed answered grahame smiling be penetrative genius here at fault fear be answered in same tone ellen be youngest child have be successful help five time have become blunted at sixth refuse to aid further grahame heed interposed husband laughing fancy there be something extraordinary about ellen can not comprehend feel certain that imagination have be playing with wife sober judgment that little niece be very ordinary child only rather more sad quiet than be usual at age may be easily accounted for by early trial constant ill health so solve what wife pronounces mystery have so few fancy however that quarrel with for have charm of novelty there be more than usual subject of thought on mind of young inmate of oakwood before went to sleep night percy herbert emmeline be peculiarly happy peaceful caroline be not so agreeable praise lavished on others never gave pleasure question must always come why did not receive too be very hard that so seldom received love be always ready to accuse parent of degree of partiality rather than of unworthiness thought only came when be alone moment heard father voice met mother smile fled from till be pertinaciously recalled ellen thought mostly of herbert have be a curious a rest to know where have be though have not said so much about that be for good kind deed have never doubted wonder mary love so much said internally how can ever hope will love one so often naughty a be if edward be so much superior what must herbert be how wish be sister then must love deserving not that poor ellen be often thought a expressed naughty be true be mingling of many apparent fault especially disregard to aunt command too often endeavor to conceal equivocate instead of open confession with sorrow repentance too deep painful for year that so fairly bewildered mr hamilton really a have told mr grahame prevented from understanding ellen if must have known of unfortunate promise strong hold have taken of child vivid imagination that by dwelling on have actually made believe that by always shielding edward from blame punishment be obeying making mother love from heaven so still more deepening father affection for that idea enabled to bear suffering of most painful of punishment aunt displeasure mr hamilton must have left mean untried to remove mistaken impression doubt must have succeeded have not slightest conception of real origin of niece incomprehensible contradiction have believed hoped influence of earlier life must disappear before quiet wholesome routine of present often often found fearing that must not be only maternal neglect actual disposition at fault when convinced of great importance of truth ellen frequently instead of attempting to conceal what edward might have heedlessly done actually took upon not being able to define that in such self sacrifice be also forfeiting truth if did believe so be also clear that to tell real truth to aunt betray edward be breaking solemn promise to mother way be doing wrong to describe define chaos in poor child mind from contending feeling must be almost a impossible to a be to herself only knew that be often naughty when most wished to be good that aunt must think did not care for displeasure when made so very unhappy that be scarcely ever in disgrace without being ill that never must feel happy for even when good there always seemed weight hanging over therefore must be different to worse than body else little do mere superficial observer know capability for joy suffering in young child heart exquisitely tender germ be committed to awful responsibility lie in hand of adult for joy grief good evil a portion of child happily for ellen mr hamilton love be a inexhaustible a patience niece might have be still more unhappy for few must have so understood practiced delicate difficult task of constantly being called upon to correct yet to love young reader must not think edward very cowardly very dishonorable always to let sister bear penalty of fault have never be taught therefore must not understand imperative necessity when guilty of heedlessness disobedience boldly to step forward whether others be injured not avow did not understand how not to say thing about unless be asked must be want of truth be also mr hamilton constant custom never to mention to member of family who might have be absent at time thing of fault disgrace have fallen under own immediate jurisdiction unless nature absolutely demanded absence of young offender from happy family circle at meal hour of recreation when unusual proceeding be necessary in consequence never excited remark very general feeling of regret edward therefore scarcely ever heard actual cause of sister disgrace sometimes did not even know have incurred did indeed when be sometimes absent feel very uncomfortable immovable awe of really indulgent uncle impression of mother creating quite a strong a ellen idea of sanctity of promise caused to adopt mean of removing uncomfortable consciousness that be far more to blame than ellen right one fearless inquiry a to why be punished open avowal that be who have led into error be real offender thought on percy conduct be very different to of cousin exclaimed almost aloud in energy of feeling must have suffered thing thing rather than have done seek mr morton humble myself by avowing truth to ask pardon for mere clever joke that percy ought to have be proud of instead of regretting if did not know well must believe craven milk water lad without particle of right spirit within what must have possessed uncle look must have frightened out of sober sens to be sure be very terrible poor mamma be indeed right a to unbending sternness think must have dared even anger rather than beg mr morton pardon when there really be necessity sleep overtook with firm conviction resting on mind that though in thing percy might be equal yet in manliness spirit edward be decidedly superior chapter ix temptation disobedience fear falsehood punishment be christmas vacation always happy season in hall of oakwood previous year general juvenile party with mr mr hamilton indulged child on first sixth of january a circumstance permitted have not taken place on account of mr fortescue death be therefore year anticipated with even more than usual joy caroline emmeline be never permitted to go to indiscriminate party two three really confined to child mother allowed joining with miss harcourt in course of year own ball be always considered acme of enjoyment especially now that caroline began to fancy very much too old for only child party annie went almost where with lady helen quite laughed at idea of joining child caroline year began to wish most intensely that mother must take out to grown up party too lost relish for pleasant party have enjoyed mr hamilton never obliged to go out with emmeline ellen if really did not wish caroline must not get farther in considering woman week before christmas mr mr hamilton did not allow to be holiday amusement season be to feeling of religion one of earnest intense thankfulness wished to make equally so to child source of joy hope indeed joy hope of heaven not mere amusement pleasure of earth have thought long tried earnestly to make child so to love serious thing a never to associate with gloom sadness never to fancy to be truly spiritually religious demanded relinquishment of joy pleasure innocent happiness of age admirably have succeeded christmas week be always anticipated with quiet gladness for be still more with father mother few serious reading lesson have be from with alone miss harcourt time be then entirely own a soon a christmas day be passed young party with sole exception of two hour work by in morning part of day if morning be wanted for mr hamilton never permitted duty to be suspended believing child have experienced wisdom of belief that pleasure recreation be infinitely more enjoyable after performance of duty however brief easy than have nothing to do to amuse day be allowed to be just a free happy noisy a pleased exuberance of innocent happiness must have be envied by many who might have thought quiet routine of usual life irksome indeed edward fortescue be looking forward with greatest delight to becoming midshipman in course of following year hoped indeed must be in very few month uncle mr howard have only told to work on a hard a must for summons might come for to join at very short notice must be very dreadful if commission must be refused because guardian did not think forward enough in various study to leave have looked very mischievous when have told edward have enjoyed joke resolved must not have such amusement must go to sea if worked night day for privilege really did so well that uncle gave great praise be a unexpected delightful a anger be terrible happened that on morning after christmas day edward ellen be quite alone in school room former be in one of most impatient mood for at own request uncle be to examine in favorite study one of necessary book be wanting have read few evening previous something have crossed in desperate passion have flung book from where fell neither knew cared caroline emmeline have already gone on expedition to poor people with mother ellen have asked received permission to put seed in little garden percy having kindly promised to show where to do harder work in for be however still engaged with father must be have told for perhaps hour longer must be sure to come to then to employ interval have intended to work hard at purse be making for edward however entirely engrossed for nearly hour hunted in nook corner of room at length see see edward ellen exclaimed adding however in very desponding tone what will do can not get why not answered edward impatiently where be ellen behind stand of flower replied pointing to one filled corner of room though be winter be filled with beautiful flowering geranium of color few rare myrtle in full flower there said edward joyfully oh that be very easily moved will get in minute know aunt emmeline desired not to touch implored ellen clinging to arm flower be almost caroline dear edward pray move stuff nonsense ellen how be aunt to know thing about what do care about flower being caroline may be whose like will not prevent getting book will be disobeying aunt edward pray pray know how displeased be with emmeline last week for much more trifling disobedience than will be if thing must happen to flower caroline will be so angry what do care for caroline anger retorted edward impatiently uncle indeed be something to care about if get book go to directly will have like to disobey aunt in case there be help for be sure can reach without doing harm besides must get book can not do without then only wait till aunt come home at least let ask uncle if may move dear edward do let go will not be minute so betray being in passion other day get reproof for for carelessness into bargain nonsense ellen will get must help for have not moment to lose edward indeed indeed can not touch replied imploringly shrinking back say rather wish to get into disgrace perhaps prevented from going out evening to morrow friday too exclaimed edward irritated beyond forbearance other day be so very sorry be going from home so soon much must care about that can not do trifling thing a to oblige hate deceit ellen made reply though tear started to eye a usual firmness deserted heavy stand be carefully moved little forward without injuring of plant book be obtained at moment voice of percy be heard exclaiming edward edward what be about papa have be expecting last half hour say if come directly will not have time to do wish what can be about edward did not wait to hear much more than name darted off leaving sister to push back stand ellen felt almost sure must not do by how be to act to ask assistance must not only be confessing own disobedience inculpating brother really perhaps deprive of enjoyment anticipated so confirm unkind word tried to replace thought have quite succeeded a moved one of myrtle fell to ground beautiful blossom hung on stalk preserved from being quite broken off only by three four delicate fiber be caroline favorite plant one so cherished tended that percy called petted child poor ellen stood paralyzed raised pot mechanically rested broken head of flower against still uninjured sprig looked so well natural that thought for moment darted across mind that after might not be discovered then came aunt lesson of many way of acting untruth without word therefore even if must not be discovered be comfort must dared voluntarily confess what must appear willful disobedience if aunt have be at home might in first moment have gained necessary courage be not expected back for two three hour ellen sat with face buried in hand only conscious of misery till cousin joyous voice called out from hall come along nelly have kept long enough tiny must never have left quiet so long there be tiring patience however will make up for now glad to escape from own thought hastily collected various seed ran after percy be so active so obliging so amusing in queer way of working talking that almost forgot impending trial till met aunt cousin at luncheon edward have be so intent so happy at business with uncle that have never cast thought a to how stand got back after lunch have to go for row on river after dinner to attend lecture on astronomy night one following be to be given in town hall in t uncle percy herbert be to accompany so that must give thought to thing disagreeable be not likely day wore on ellen little courage have gone almost unconsciously hoped that nothing must be discovered mr hamilton lad departed at six mr hamilton proposed adjourning to daughter room to finish entertaining book that be reading aloud have noticed with usual penetration that day ellen evidently shrunk from eye felt quite sure something be wrong again asked question fearing again to tempt equivocation caroline passionate exclamation that somebody have broken beautiful flower drew attention of to stand one glance sufficed to tell mr hamilton that have be moved anxious suspicion at once connected with ellen shrinking manner turned to ask if knew thing about ellen have disappeared rang bell inquired of only domestic whose department ever led into room if must explain accident of must all uniting in declaring that in morning myrtle be quite perfect ellen be at home mamma must know something about percy said did not begin gardening till more than hour after be gone exclaimed caroline whose temper be sorely tried by downfall of care dare say did spiteful thing have gone to hide rather than confess be just like stop caroline condemn till be quite certain in anger say what be not true ellen have given evidence a yet of being spiteful mischievous emmeline go tell cousin that want child obeyed miss harcourt have continued working most industriously at table without uttering word though mr hamilton countenance expressed such unusual perplexity pain that must have seemed kinder to have spoken one look at ellen convinced aunt actually paused before spoke dreading reply almost a much a child did question be scarcely audible might have be denial certainly be not affirmative for miss harcourt instantly exclaimed ellen how can tell deliberate falsehood must not tell aunt for really wished to have opportunity of in degree redeeming disobedience saw move back stand sinful attempt at concealment by replacing broken flower now dare deny did not replace flower with intention of concealing exclaimed ellen bursting into tear for one unjust charge seemed to give back power of speech though violent reproach invective burst from caroline prevented thing further must beg to be silent caroline to leave room till have done speaking to cousin said mother quietly fate of flower seems to make forget have never yet permitted disrespect display of temper in presence what right have ellen to touch stand none have disobeyed again tried to deceive fault be duty to chastise not yours to upbraid answer ellen at once briefly fault be known therefore further equivocation be useless did move that flower stand yes replied child almost choked with sob called forth more from contrast aunt mildness presented to miss harcourt harshness caroline violent anger from painful longing to say that first disobedience be not entirely own fault did remember have expressly forbidden either of to attempt to move yes replied ellen again exclamation at apparent hardihood of conduct escaped from miss harcourt caroline yet persisted ellen be indeed strange contradiction to seemingly sincere sorrow for similar fault few month back what did move for for full minute ellen hesitated thus unhappily confirming suspicion that when did reply be equivocation to get book have fallen behind know how book must have fallen behind unless have be put thrown there ellen said too that did not replace broken flower for purpose of concealment hardly know how to believe of assertion why did leave room just now because because knew must question felt must not have courage to speak truth knew must be so so displeased word be scarcely articulate must have be better satisfied ellen if fear of displeasure have prevented committal of first fault not to aggravate so sinfully by acted spoken untruth painful a be to in season of festivity enjoyment to inflict suffering must share sin if did not adopt measure to endeavor at least to make remember so avoid in future have told so very often that be not mostly offend when speak act falsely god who be truth that fear word alone will be of avail go to own room ellen perhaps solitude thought when brother cousin be so happy unrestrained may bring to sense of aggravated misconduct better than thing else will not leave apartment except for hour of devotion exercise will take with elli not with till think have have sufficient time to reflect on have said to on subject ellen quitted room without answering be several minute before mr hamilton must sufficiently conquer very painful feeling niece conduct own compelled severity excited to enter into daughter amusement must not punish for misconduct of by exertion temper to caroline cheerfulness to emmeline whose tear of sympathy have almost kept pace with ellen of sorrow gradually returned book became a delightful recreation a have be before great be edward grief consternation when found effect of what be actually in first instance fault have not sufficient boldness to say so aunt have expressly said be untruth have occasioned greatest displeasure if disobedience have be confessed at once must in consideration of season have forgiven with very slight rebuke now thought be only disobedience in be concerned if confess be mostly fault wo help ellen in least so what be use of acknowledging of course if wish will how must tell deliberate story that be acting one of equal deliberation of far more culpability if possible for be permitting to bear whole weight of fault never struck if did did not at understand believe went to sister offered to confess share in fault when a fully expected begged not that must do good perhaps only get punished too conscience be so perfectly satisfied that actually took upon to ask how must be so foolish wrong a when be asked not to allow that have moved at once must have be right then said added almost with irritation must not have be teased with thought of being in disgrace just now when wanted so much to enjoy think about then edward be sister reply know untruth be entirely own fault so why must torment if must always tell act truth not be so very very frightened oh how wonder if ever will leaned head on arm rested on table so despondingly so sorrowfully that edward felt too uncomfortable to remain with be satisfied that must not help disagreeable thought must come that if have not tempted to disobey must have have temptation to tell untruth so sought variety of active amusement to get rid of feeling continuation of entertaining astronomical lecture too be so very delightful thursday friday morning brought so many enjoyment that almost forgot till startled back into self reproach by finding that be not to accompany on friday evening to mr howard whose great pleasure be to collect young people around whose soiree in christmas holiday whose day in country at midsummer be anticipated by girl boy great small with such delight a to pervade whole year round caroline never refused to join mr howard party though be juvenile percy always declared be a unlike other person a mr howard be unlike schoolmaster ellen have so enjoyed day in country timid a be have looked forward to friday with almost a much delight a emmeline in vain emmeline edward percy herbert even mr hamilton entreated that might be permitted to go mr hamilton own kind heart pleaded quite a strongly remained firm ask dear child said almost a beseechingly a have implored do assure be quite a much if not more pain to on occasion to refuse a be for to be refused if be first second even third time that ellen have disregarded truth must yield for sake in hope that indulgence must produce a good effect a continued severity can not hope now habit be fear so deeply rooted that nothing firmness in inflicting pain whenever be committed will succeed in eradicating god grant may remove at last tone word be so earnest so sad that not only did child cease in intercession felt still more forcibly solemn importance of virtue in ellen have so failed from effect of conduct upon mother be always grieved when have done wrong never remembered seeing so very sad a now edward indeed must scarcely understand a cousin did a aunt still only alluded to untruth qualm of conscience be again silenced for have only caused disobedience emmeline asked timidly if might remain with ellen edward followed example thinking very magnanimous in so doing be refused surely have done enough went mr mr hamilton miss harcourt a well a young people be such happy evening first there be orrery that mr howard have prevailed on lecturer to display first at house edward be almost wild in delight then there be game intellectual puzzle made think a well a enjoy then there be music singing dancing thing be so quiet orderly yet so full of youthful enjoyment that be not much wonder there be longer room for sorrowful thought in of young party from oakwood mr hamilton alone thought of ellen again again accused herself of too great harshness for perhaps after might have better effect than kindness what must do almost envied quiet unruffled unconcern of le anxious guardian for to feel indifferent to responsibility be impossible ellen be so often unwell that absence did not occasion so much remark a brother of cousin must mamma did not wish to come be answer have desired child to give to inquiry character for indulgence be so generally known that one suspected thing more than indisposition annie grahame dislike to ellen might have made more suspicious be not there cecil lilla be with father miss grahame did not condescend to attend mr howard juvenile party caroline though must not have allowed even to be happier much more inclined to enjoy with amusement society offered to when annie be not at party than when be next night to ellen disposition be greater trial than friday neither expected hardly wished to be allowed to go to mr howard though a affectionate emmeline have come to wish good night with tear in eye repeated regret that be not to go felt bitter disappointment more than in morning have thought possible saturday night have be aunt custom from time have be at oakwood to visit daughter niece before went to sleep prepare for sabbath rest enjoyment by examination of conduct during past week full forgiveness of thing have be wrong when younger mr hamilton have attended to duty night wishing to give habit of private prayer examination independent of have after emmeline be twelve year old set apart saturday night until be fifteen old enough for to relinquish altogether have be habit with own child that felt perfectly natural with ellen edward from never having be accustomed to a young child have never felt duty understood by a satisfactorily performed by a with own still ellen looked forward to night a termination of banishment for great indeed be offense whose correction extended over sabbath ellen must not remember one instance since have be at oakwood when heard door of cousin room successively close aunt step retreating without approaching hers did indeed believe irreclaimably wicked kind good aunt must at least have come to mr hamilton have purposely refrained from indulging own inclination a well a comforting ellen hoping still more to impress upon how greatly have sinned impossibility of perfectly comprehending niece character while poor child felt sacred duty to victimize made far more severe than must have be must have known real disposition how be possible must believe ellen grief a deep remorseful a seemed when short time afterward must commit same fault task be infinitely more difficult perplexing than le anxious mother can have least idea of chapter x pain penitence truth impressed reconciliation family tree in feverish dream of parent recalling death with alternate wakefulness fraught with deadly incomprehensible terror poor child of strong imagination know so well ellen night passed next morning rose with painful throbbing in throat temple always ended with one of intense exhausting headache to have be so subject aunt care mr maitland remedy have much decreased in frequency violence went to church however with family a usual remain out edward percy exclaimed a neared house old year be taking leave of in glorious mood tiny be going to ruralize poetize till dinner will come with ellen ellen withdrew arm from brother saying a did so go dear edward be very tired must rather not tired with short walk really do look a if be what be matter ellen be not well sister did not reply shrinking from look mr hamilton who be passing at moment fixed earnestly upon ran into house edward again felt uncomfortable in fact have done so so often since tuesday morning that temper be not so good a usual did not choose to acknowledge even to that uncomfortable feeling be self reproach so vented more than once in irritation against ellen declaring be so disagreeable must be in disgrace just then be mr mr hamilton custom always to dine on sunday at past one to allow of household who be unable to attend divine service in morning to go in afternoon with regard to child pursued plan many rigid religionist might perhaps have condemned yet fruit be very promising great wish be to make sabbath day of love divine domestic to make child look to with joy anticipation throughout week a day quite distinct in enjoyment from other for reason while child be young only went to church in morning afternoon be devoted to teaching to know to love god in work a well a word evening to such quiet happy amusement literature a must fill young heart with increased thankfulness for very happy lot a grew older be perfectly at liberty to do a pleased with regard to afternoon church herbert whose ardent desire to enter ministry increased with year generally spent greater part of sunday with mr howard with parent glad full consent contemplation of serious thing be greatest happiness mr mr hamilton did not expect that other child be to be like be contented intensely thankful also to perceive diverse a be character still constant sense of god presence of infinite love be active earnest in inciting love reverence for herbert even though must not sympathize with entirely peculiarity of mr hamilton consisted in permitting sunday school at aveling other village saturday afternoon be set apart instead of sunday wished wife daughter when be old enough to superintend help child in preparing for sunday service sunday enjoyment particularly disliked system of overwork on day of rest must not fail to be case if there be school to attend to twice three time day a well a church being last day of old year mr howard have expressed wish percy edward a well a herbert must attend church afternoon lad without least reluctance consented mr hamilton miss harcourt be going too caroline emmeline of own accord asked permission to accompany be pale suffering face have so haunted aunt that must not think of thing else remained for very much longer time than be usual to character in state of indecision next night be child ball be too first day of new year always in happy circle festival of joy thankfulness ellen face certainly looked a if have suffered quite enough to prevent recurrence of fault so have always done yet before must possibly have forgotten consequence failed again mr hamilton sat for time after child have left in meditation trying to silence pleading of affection listen only to reason a to whether continued severity returning kindness must be more effective save ellen further pain to child physical suffering be so increasing a gradually to deaden mental till at last became so severe that felt sick faint knew medicine be in habit of taking when similarly suffering lotion aunt applied to forehead always succeeded in removing excessive throbbing be in mr hamilton dressing room seemed quite impossible that must get at for did not like to leave room without permission did feel a if must walk so far head throbbing with increased violence with step took at length summoned sufficient courage to ring bell beg fanny to ask elli to come to girl who have be already dreadfully concerned that miss ellen have eaten dinner on sunday too gave such account of that housekeeper hastened to directly begged to let go for mistress be so lucky have not gone to church ellen clung to imploring not dear dear elli get medicine bathe forehead will get well then in hour two without giving aunt trouble pray pray tell scarcely feel pain when be nursing soothing deserve now be afraid never will indeed miss ellen will be displeased if why only other morning be quite concerned that have not told jane be ill directly went two three time day to see have thing proper comfortable be quite different dear elli do get lotion feel a if must not bear pain much longer without cry can tell afterward if think ought seeing that farther argument only increased poor child suffering elli promised left ellen leaned forehead against side of little bed held curtain tightly clasped a if so to prevent utterance of hysteric sob must rise in throat though did not know what be wholly unexpected sound of mr hamilton voice saying close by be afraid have one of very bad headache ellen so startled a to make raise head suddenly movement caused such agony that spite of effort must not prevent almost convulsive cry of pain dear child have idea of pain like why did not send for have always prevented becoming so very violent by taking in time ellen miss ellen must not let go for madam rejoined elli who to mistress inexpressible relief be close at hand with remedy wanted repeated what child have said again old mistake ellen must so much so very much rather hear say be resolved to deserve love than that did not merit why must not deserve a well a brother cousin if determined with heart to try not do thing to lessen nothing be so likely to prevent even endeavoring to deserve a mistaken fancy that never will be too unwell to

however small in appearance talent for music still mr hamilton cultivated in boy a well a girl simply for sake of giving home resource amusement must be pursued together thought mistaken notion in

unrestrained affection a own emmeline did so often with only difference that with latter seemed always to spring from very exuberance of happiness must only be thus displayed with ellen night appeared like deep quiet feeling almost of devotion a if though mr hamilton sober reason tried to persuade imagination that be too much meaning to attach to mere embrace must thus tell how intensely felt not only indulgence of evening true kindness watchful love have caused preceding sorrow might have thought a doubt many of reader will ellen be much too young too childish to contrast system of treatment with poor mother that felt soothing care in hour of physical suffering indulgent love making distinction between cousin still more keenly gratefully from recollection of own mother constant preference of edward utter neglect of that contrast so deepened love bore aunt that exceeded in intensity even borne toward by own child adult will think very fanciful perhaps interesting wholly improbable mr hamilton must have banished idea a too imaginary to be entertained seriously for moment a guide for conduct ellen must not have explained told that so felt yet notwithstanding have written be there be real prompter of almost passionate embrace bless darling be mr hamilton fond reply instead of permitting child to perceive surprise excited in ellen sunk to sleep almost more happy than ever in little

effect of earnest prayer care at once without constant relapse in cherished object of care did must to counteract tendency situated a must be when entered life must without strong high principle lead to suffering perhaps to sin for what be coquetry indulged in idea of security never believed that because have so tried so striven to sow good seed must not fail to bring forth good fruit knew many trial might be in store for for how might hope to pas through life blessed a be then might please father in heaven to try faith duty through loved so intensely if failed not in task must bring joy at last to emmeline idea of dancing be quite enough to be acme of enjoyment only drawback be that in interval of rest there be to be little music though mother have excused at mr howard knew that if anybody expressed wish to hear at own house play must at time be half sorry have chosen to learn harp instead of piano a caroline played so well on latter instrument nobody must care to hear harp be rather novelty little girl who be coming played so be sadly afraid there be escape for be very disagreeable must not think about till time came dancing to such music a mr hamilton have ordered from

pain of confession be instantly soothed indeed think mamma have shown much better taste requires more care than be yet perhaps aware of to dress so exactly according to age station a to do justice yet excite unpleasant feeling in of lower contempt in of higher grade many of friend who be coming to night must not afford to dress child a might ours do not think must be inhospitable unkind by being over dressed to excite unpleasant feeling of inferiority in mind when actually none exists for difference of fortune alone can never constitute inferiority be wizard enough to guess be mamma reason for being attired so simply yet so prettily to night equally wizard enough to guess reason for wishing to be smarter will tell added playfully because fancy miss grahame will be attired in such very

caroline very happy for have inwardly feared ill temper not only deserved have excited mother displeasure emmeline look of disappointment reproach at own unusual forgetfulness be so irresistibly comic that percy edward burst into immoderate fit of laughter former only checked to ask caroline where have be what have done to produce such extraordinary change for better in appearance in so short time oh have right to secret percy be perfectly good humored reply think will answer except by having charity to refer to papa who have produced change by mean of pretty flower then imagine said mr

at little sister required very vivid recollection of father word to prevent feeling of false shame while annie looked at emmeline even favorite caroline for few minute with almost contempt people talk

sister be scarcely possible for one much le parent to look at caroline night without admiration be so animated so graceful so pleasing a such completely center of attraction really without effort on part to gentleman young old in room lad congregated round be rather difficult task to keep clear of offense when so very many more entreated to dance than length of evening permitted managed to talk

night seeming truly to enjoy said mr greville addressing mr hamilton who be standing rather apart at moment watching caroline with such mingled feeling of pride dread that be quite glad when friend voice disturbed train of thought looked so ill in church yesterday that half feared must not see told be quite grieved that be too unwell to be at mr howard last friday what did say inquired mr hamilton anxiously that be not illness prevented looked so confused pained that changed subject directly smile soon came back touched on very painful theme replied mr hamilton with real relief ellen be not quite a good friend a usually be last week poor little girl felt severity more than imagined meant gave to dear mary especial care to night for be so timid that left quite to herself be afraid must be more pain than pleasure mary have taken hint most admirably for ellen seems quite happy must be rather hard if little niece be only sad face in scene of enjoyment surely if ever there be happiness without alloy be here if think so mr greville will agree with friend morton who have just be half poetizing half philosophizing on scene said mr hamilton joining with young clergyman leaning on arm say there be something singularly interesting in watching countenance movement of child in tracing dawning of respective character be not one of then who think childhood mere negative specie of existence rejoined mr greville indeed there be much more pleasure to in watching scene than similar one of adult be full of kind of poetry from beauty freshness of present creates future of happiness sorrow good evil a something in countenance seems dimly to foretell how many will be longing thought thrown back in after year upon to night do think then childhood happiest season of life answered in affirmative mr hamilton shook head differ from good friend said childhood feel grief a bitterly a of maturer year be apt to think be joy in retrospect perhaps because have not anxiety care of riper year sorrow be felt a keenly from reason not being perfectly formed difficulty to control self will to acquiesce in to incomprehensible wish of parent guardian restraint be often compelled to use must be trial even to well regulated child to subject to caprice of weakness indolence neglect indulgence at one time tyranny at feeling disbelieved in therefore never studied soothed little heart thrown back upon morton believe be trial a full of suffering a hard to be endured a belong to manhood may be right replied morton do not think there be elasticity in childhood fling off sorrow can realize happiness sooner than older year undoubtedly most happy be that be so constituted else what must become of if susceptibility for joy sorrow be equally quick if former did not balance latter how must tender frame quick affection bear burden idea that childhood be in happiest season in life be so far mischievous that prevents necessary care watchfulness alone can make so must not philosophize more for have made grave see wife be addressing miss grahame think be for music come morton take mr greville to music room woo melody instead of poetry for next half hour miss grahame promise to be very fair musician so will be charmed adjourned to music room where percy have already gallantly conducted annie several of guest young old seconded move annie grahame really played remarkably well so far a execution brilliancy be concerned mr hamilton be delighted at expression of grahame face a listened to child applause excited why will not try to win home affection thought when be so formed to enjoy why why have helen so indolently so foolishly cast away happiness be thought followed at contrast lady helen face presented to husband knew annie played well have heard from very superior judge how must concern what present company thought very pretty vocal duet from two sister followed soon afterward caroline approached music stand near percy mr morton be talking percy with usual love of provoking exclaimed surely be not going to play after miss grahame caroline if power deserted few hour ago prevented execution of waltz must certainly do charity in deserting completely now caroline cheek burned answered with spirit mamma desired to oblige friend percy must not do so if thought must disgrace heed brother miss hamilton interposed mr morton taking music from offering arm to lead to piano have have pleasure of hearing often who can not find equal if not superior charm in playing to miss grahame deserve to listen nay must be flattering mr morton think of annie advantage indeed dear miss hamilton yours exceed hers master heart be in pupil progress a mother in child even must not teach merely superintend caroline be seated at instrument a spoke there be something in few word touching right chord for a began to play certainly thought more of mother than one else determined if possible that others must think with mr morton forgetting at moment very few except own immediate circle knew whose pupil be not imagining that mistress of oakwood large possession must have time inclination for part of education of daughter morton be certainly right a to amount of admiration equaling if not surpassing that bestowed on miss grahame there be soul depth of expression feeling in caroline far simpler piece won way to heart at once if did not surprise a much pleased more excited earnest wish to listen to again doe not younger daughter play inquired lady who have be much attracted with emmeline very little compared with sister replied mr hamilton be not nearly so fond of therefore doe not devote so much time to acquirement just yet do think right to permit child to follow own inclination with regard to education asked rather stern looking lady with much surprise only with regard to accomplishment emmeline be a fond of drawing a caroline be of music therefore indulge by permitting to give more time to one than to other do think natural taste can be traced so early that can be distinguished from idleness perverseness indeed do replied mr hamilton earnestly if child be allowed leisure to choose own pursuit not always confined to routine of school room natural taste for employment in preference to will think always display not must depend entirely on because think right useful to cultivate taste for fine art only giving more time to be favorite niece have shown decided taste for particular pursuit yet neglect cultivation of accomplishment on account if in few year preference manifest will be quite time enough to work hard at particular branch be that pretty little harp used by of daughter inquired first speaker look very much a if be especial property of engaging little friend guess be correct replied mr hamilton smiling emmeline be quite sure must hate music if must learn great ugly piano if might only have harp must do must to learn really have may not hear when room be not quite so full have not half sister confidence so large audience must frighten away little power will promise very sweet song instead added a herbert approached eagerly whispered request be if persuasion can prevail on young friend mr greville must ask

peculiarly sweet thrilling though not strong trembled audibly a commenced herbert be turning over leaf of music mother be standing close beside after first few bar enthusiastic spirit forgot presence of save loved spirit of song mr hamilton never listened to looked at at such moment without trembling foreboding vainly struggled to overcome there be something in deep blue earnest eye hectic color with least exertion rose to cheek transparency of complexion warm elevated spirit almost angel temper endurance in peculiarly tried lot scarcely seemed of earth never be that sad foreboding stronger than at moment a looked round crowd of young happy face none seemed to express same a mary must scarcely command voice smile sufficiently to warmly thank young favorite a ceased mary be more than satisfied by fond pressure of hand little interruption to actual business of evening only increased zest enjoyment when dancing recommenced even call to supper be obeyed with reluctance speedily accomplished that might return sooner to ball room hour have worn away seemed on gossamer wing a happy child felt assured that delight must not last much longer longing to dance to very last moment

so pettishly because because thought be displeased deserved then come redeem character be mr hamilton only notice of reply actually made heart throb with thankfulness that lesson of truth be so fully understood practiced by one naturally so gentle timid a emmeline while mr allan knew not what to answer from feeling of involuntary respect must have be so easy to escape disagreeable task by tacitly allowing that be too tired to play what careful training must have be to have so taught truth mr allan must not ask before because knew did not like to play while room be so very full therefore ought not to do very best to oblige emmeline looked timidly up in mother face to be quite sure that displeasure have subsided a word seemed to denote quite satisfied tear be checked taking mr allan offered

wherever please compelling flag of land to acknowledge mr grahame landsman know what liberty be if talk of imprisonment in ship take home wherever go landsman can not do though do so poetize on maternal property of old mother earth only hear hamilton exclaimed grahame laughing heartily one must think have be sailor little life talk boldly now boy may change tone when have once tried cockpit

pleasure of land exchange for others more delightful still sea be to be sister uncle aunt cousin altogether yes replied edward laughing adding a put arm affectionately round ellen sister have so many kind friend that will be able to spare till be old enough to do brother ought be good fellow edward see must not talk of parting if must preserve evening pleasure unalloyed grahame said a laid hand kindly on ellen head then turned to obey summons of wife young party doubt felt that must be infinitely more agreeable to sit up night talk of only too quickly concluded enjoyment than to retire to respective pillow habit of oakwood be somewhat too well regulated for such dissipation though doubt dream land night be peopled with pleasant shadow of reality according to respective source of enjoyment brought back evening happiness again again chapter xii effect of pleasure young midshipman ill temper origin consequence return to quiet routine of work le exciting recreation after christmas pleasure be of course trial to young friend not so much to boy a to sister percy elastic spirit found pleasure in thing being somewhat too old to care for study feel now a restraint herbert only exchanged one kind of happiness for edward looked to month passed a bringing nearer attainment of wish be so fond of mr howard so quick at learning favorite with schoolfellow that did not care at when time of work came again ellen emmeline found very difficult to like lesson again especially latter who felt a if work regularity be most particularly disagreeable thing sometimes be almost in despair a to ever enjoying again tried very hard to overcome indolence never give way to petulance succeeded so a to win delight of parent approbation indulgence always made feel a if effort on part be too great to prove how much felt when one old young experience sort of feeling need never be afraid that will succeed in effort painful hard a may at first seem be not so difficult for ellen a for emmeline because be le able to realize such intensity of pleasure seemed safer when regularly employed besides to work hard at respective study be one of very few thing must do to prove how much loved aunt accustomed from such early childhood to conquer inclination in fact never to fancy pleasure indulgence be due there be happiness enough for even in more regular life to caroline change be actually unbearable while admiration praise only incited emmeline to greater exertion caused caroline completely to relax in hers to give in consequence a much trouble annoyance a have received pleasure perseverance in various study especially in music unceasing control over temper before holiday have so striven for have now entirely given way be much le trouble for to learn than emmeline therefore study with miss harcourt be generally well performed admiration have excited made long for more believe person deserving much more consideration respect than received from own family thought persisted in of course produced retained ill temper a there be longer fear of being debarred by indulgence from pleasure made attempt to overcome praise bestowed on music made fancy much greater proficient than really be though love of music be great love of praise be greater so not only relaxed in practice inwardly murmured at very little praise received from mother how can give mamma so much trouble caroline when know can do so much better herbert exclaimed one day when attack of weakness to be liable have confined to sofa mr hamilton after giving usual hour lesson in caroline have chosen to hing have left in very evident displeasure even herbert be roused to most unusual indignation what be use of practicing day after day be angry reply be sure must play just a well if practiced le did not think so month ago caroline because then have something to practice for have nothing now be mamma approbation nothing be pleasure give of by talent for music nothing oh caroline why will throw away so much real gratification for vain desire of universal admiration there surely can be harm herbert in wishing to be universally loved admired there be when make discontented unhappy blind to love admiration of home what be praise of stranger worth compared to of who love best there be not much chance of receiving at present be cold reply because will not try for one most easily happily obtained even without thinking of praise how can be so ungrateful a to repay mamma care trouble by indolence coldness almost insolence have shown to day how few mother of rank must may spare sermon herbert for at moment be not disposed either to listen to profit by interrupted caroline left room in anger faint flush rose to pale cheek of brother quickly conquered natural irritation sought mother by fond attention on part to remove pain of caroline conduct continued for about fortnight at end of time caroline suddenly resumed music with assiduity there be more ebullition of ill temper herbert hoped expostulation be taking effect mr hamilton trusted that child be becoming sensible of past folly trying to conquer banish memory however be mistaken annie grahame have imparted to friend in strict confidence that mother intended giving grand ball about end of february meant to entreat mr hamilton a personal favor to let caroline be present caroline little knew very slight foundation annie have for assertion lady helen have merely said perhaps must ask be only said because be too indolent weak to say at once not that have unkind feeling toward caroline simply because be perfectly certain mr hamilton must not consent to persuade a earnestly a annie wished be really too much trouble caroline wish in instance triumphed over better judgment for have allowed to think soberly ought to have known mother principle of action sufficiently not to entertain slightest hope of going invitation three week notice for parent brother came in did not expect to be included when above week passed still not word be said disappointment took place of hope be only still lingering belief that might go even at last moment prevented return of ill temper now lady helen really have asked though did not persuade mr hamilton thanked a expected decidedly refused caroline be much too young said for such party did know thing about being asked lady helen said with truth that have not mentioned subject to have desired annie to be equally silent mr hamilton quite forgot that miss grahame be not famous for obedience relying on friend assurance determined on not saying thing to caroline about wishing to spare pain knew refusal must inflict a happened must have be better if have spoken weather have prevented caroline from seeing annie be quite sure must not deceive her proud heart rebelled against mother not only for refusing lady helen request for treating so much like child a to hide that refusal from under influence of such thought of course temper became more more difficult to control a natural consequence anger irritation against mother self reproach for indulgence of such feeling increased till became actually miserable happened that about time miss harcourt left oakwood for week on visit to invalid friend at dartmouth mr hamilton have given full liberty promising that pupil must lose nothing by absence left on saturday thursday be lady helen ball on monday mr hamilton detained edward a be leaving library after morning prayer told that have received letter thought might chance to interest ten minute afterward edward rushed into breakfast room in

darling charles have rushed into room to tell glee for one ever listened to shared in joy trouble a did be then scarcely older than edward a full of hope joy buoyancy where be must fate be that of bright beautiful boy before a edward threw arm round neck kissed again again telling must not be quite sure be not dream unless wished joy too be utmost effort to prevent fast gathering tear so command voice that must not hear tremble poor ellen looked felt bewildered have always tried to realize edward to be sailor must leave in fact aware that summons must soon come aunt uncle have often alluded to departure before still have never thought near now news be so sudden edward be so wild with joy fancied ought to rejoice too must not percy be obliged to ask merrily what ailed if must not trust to being much more worthy brother than water rat who have business on land before must take place at breakfast table try to smile eye must rest on edward even then felt a if there be something across throat must not swallow nice roll herbert have so kindly buttered cut so quietly placed in plate when edward said something very funny a be in habit of doing made laugh tried to laugh too instead of laugh be sob startled for be quite sure did not mean to be so foolish instead of being reproved a be afraid must be felt aunt arm thrown gently round till must hide face on shoulder cry quite quietly for few minute for went on talking laughing round breakfast table nobody took notice of be quite glad of for must not bear edward to think be unhappy when be so pleased after breakfast though be in such desperate hurry to tell mr howard good news that when did set off left even percy far behind found time to give hearty kiss to tell that loved very much though must not help being so glad be going to sea that be quite proud of because though knew be very sorry be going did not cry make fuss a selfish people must then really did smile be monday morning dear find elli morris require

order carriage at half past twelve if require be completed will pay favorite old ruin visit emmy morning be so lovely that think may venture to take sketch book see what other part of berry pomeroy can take pencil possession of such anticipation be quite enough for emmeline dance about room be only checked by idea that lesson must never be ready exercise sum done unless sat quietly down so with great effort gave attention to various task mastered even before mother returned though tried quite a much be not so successful prince william must sail in miniature on slate over figure recollection of awful storm have encountered on voyage to england must return so vividly that very room seemed to heave then must not make out why must think about then mother death bed came before promise seemed harder still to part with edward from vague dread came over still tried to attend to what have to do congratulated on completion before aunt appeared caroline alone be determined not to work because have not made miserable enough already most unfounded jealousy entered head from seeing mother caressing kindness toward ellen at breakfast why be not manner a kind to be quite a unhappy mother must see took notice of only of ellen might be cross sometimes never told story tried to hide fault be very hard unjust that must be treated so like child ellen made so much of so thought thought not attempting to do single thing till actually made believe for time that kind indulgent mother have love for thing looked blacker than before made effort to rouse even in mr hamilton presence listened to remonstrance with such extreme carelessness almost insolence that mother felt patience failing self control however for have successfully striven enabled so to overcome irritation a to retain own quiet dignity simply to desire caroline to give attention at once to study conquer ill temper not to think of accompanying on excursion a idleness peevishness be better left to insolent haughty reply rose to caroline lip with effort remained silent flushed forehead alone denoting internal agitation emmeline diligence approbation received irritated still more rejoiced when heard mother tell ellen there be not correct line in french exercise sum compound long division wrong from very first figure pleasure soon gave place to indignant anger when instead of reproof believed must follow mr hamilton said very kindly must very much like done correctly ellen before go out suppose ensconce in bay window there be table chair ready for will not interrupt a must if remain at table know be very difficult to day especially more merit in accomplishment know more pleased will be ellen obeyed directly little care with assistance of grammar aunt permitted to refer to instead of depending entirely on memory that morning enabled to succeed with french four time be that tormenting sum returned to till at last tear effaced figure a fast a be written still patience resolution in teacher pupil conquered fifth time there be not figure wrong mr hamilton fondly putting back heavy ringlet in ellen absorbed attention have fallen over tearful cheek said playfully will tell secret little ellen be quite a disinclined to be firm morning a be to be patient so see have gained grand victory conjuring propensity a emmy think told that have real cause for little inattention therefore that be very cruel in to be so determined judgment must tell that feeling be wrong to conquer disinclination overcome difficulty be much better way of lessening even natural sorrow than to give up expect to think so just now fancy be not very sorry disagreeable terribly tiresome sum have not to be done to morrow must have be have left to day ellen be so glad that felt almost happy few other duty be done quite briskly for mr hamilton have be so kind a to countermand carriage till one caroline might have time to finish caroline if have not tried before be now still le capable of doing so word of kindness addressed to ellen increased storm raging within difficulty of restraining in mr hamilton presence caused to burst forth with unmitigated violence moment quitted apartment desiring emmeline ellen to make haste put away book still without taking least notice of invective reproach almost abuse be poured against ellen who stood actually frightened at violence have so very innocently excited at fearful deforming passion inflamed cousin feature caroline anger have miscounted time must have known that mother must not have gone far enough for such unusual tone of excitement to escape quick hearing mr hamilton startled alarmed returned directly so vividly did child appearance word recall own misguided sister in uncontrolled fit of fury under have so often trembled that present disappointment dread for future took possession of for moment rendered powerless caroline be too much engrossed to perceive at first have therefore time to rally from momentary weakness what doe mean exclaimed fixing eye on caroline with expression of quiet stern reproof when did use be very seldom have power of subduing even wildest excitement what have ellen done that must abuse with unjust cruel most unfeminine violence have indulged ill temper till know what say do be venting on anger displeasure have caused to feel toward toward desire that will control directly retire to own room till can behave with degree of propriety not disturb comfort happiness of others in most uncalled for manner will not go answered caroline bursting into violent tear scarcely aware of what be saying know dislike ellen have reason to dislike for before came be never so often displeased with be always kind indulgent to always treat a reasonable being not a child infant think know have lost love for must have seen be unhappy spoken kindly to a did to ellen have reason to dislike stealing affection from a have do with heart go prepare for drive dear child mr hamilton said a calmly turned for moment to emmeline ellen who stood bewildered former from actual terror that sister must dare so to address mother latter from pain at violent avowal of dislike have intuitively felt have always tried to disbelieve beauty of day will be gone if linger much longer intend to be disappointed of promised ramble think thing of what unhappy girl be saying at present scarcely know will by by wish recalled far more intensely than ever can emmeline longed to throw arm round mother with tear beseech to forget what caroline have said though mr hamilton have spoken cheerfully in quite usual tone of voice to there be something in countenance that checked display of softness even in affectionate child something almost awed left room with ellen to prepare for promised excursion have however lost anticipated enjoyment from uncontrolled temper of now caroline will answer said mr hamilton a soon a be alone again regarding caroline who be sobbing violently with same searching look charge be such very heavy one really must request during absence to arrange define in order be so perfectly ignorant of having given foundation for before can attempt defense must inform exactly definitely of what complain that morning manner be kinder to ellen than to quite acknowledge inattention depression have cause yours have none for if be unhappy be from own fearful temper by encouragement have blackened thing around may employ time till dinner a choose at five o'clock come to in dressing room prepared to define inform of charge can bring against will consider command caroline disregard evasion of will be disobedience left room in very short time afterward caroline heard carriage drive off for nearly three long hour never moved from seat so utterly miserable a scarcely even to change position never in life before not in most angry moment have so spoken to mother remorse be almost intolerable again again remembered what mr hamilton have told so often that if did not strive pray against dominion of ill temper while young must become more more uncontrollable older became more difficult to subdue even in moderate degree word be indeed true have be many month since temper have gained ascendency effect be far far more violent power over more determined if a grew older must be still worse what must become of how insufferably wretched what must not have given to have recalled word jealousy have arisen now knew not how have sunk into air before few calm inquiring sentence from mother in excessive misery kind deed word look fond indulgence forbearance in fact love mother have so lavished on from infancy rushed back upon till actually hated longed more intensely for comfort of soothing affection in real pain childish sorrow have never be refused why why did annie tell thing about hateful ball exclaimed at length a sound of many joyous voice dressing bell proclaimed return of various member of family only in time to prepare for dinner be from know now only from that one thought one wish why be fool a not to tell mamma at once knew be to be asked wished so much to go if have refused must not have be pain have made for how can meet papa eye percy unkind joke with eye like added a on rising to go to own room caught sight of own face in mirror actually started at disfigurement violence of emotion have wrought oh how wish mamma have not desired to go to must hide from body get rid of horrible black cloud from eye mother must did hide herself for saying that head ached be truth did not wish thing to take refused to go down to dinner mr hamilton have successfully exerted during excursion emmeline ellen enjoyed so thoroughly a almost to forget alloy of morning even when caroline message recalled boy be so merry that did not disturb percy always declared that caroline headache be only term for temper ache must certainly have sent message of mock pity if quick eye have not discovered fancied that mother did not look quite a well a usual so contented by trying still more to be life of dinner table mr hamilton have seen at single glance that be not quite right caroline non appearance message explained to extreme regret for have begun to hope believe that wife extreme solicitude on account be beginning to decrease mr hamilton have not much doubt that silence solitude have so far have effect on caroline a to subdue passion bring to sense of misconduct have scarcely power to lessen anxiety pain caroline word have so wantonly inflicted have indeed evinced thing like undue partiality idea alone almost brought smile fondly almost a own child a loved little niece very anxiety caroline occasioned deepened affection very control be obliged to exercise in mode of guiding strengthened feeling toward be so enwrapped in painfully engrossing thought in strict examination of own own heart that be not aware time have appointed have passed by full ten minute till be roused by handle of door being softly turned left again a if one have wished to enter hesitated very hesitation gave hope for really did not know that utmost penalty must have inflicted on caroline in moment of natural indignation must have failed in producing such effect a simple command to seek define charge against when angry excitement have so calmed that caroline must have given world if might have not referred to again knew dared not disobey daring have left so powerless that have stood at mother door full ten minute before must command courage sufficient to open enter mr hamilton looked at changed aspect bitter humiliation expressed in feature with such pity that required even more than usual exercise of control to retain grave apparently unmoved tone with said have have long time in to reflect on charge against caroline hope be now sufficiently defined for to understand answer may sit down for seem very capable of standing caroline gladly obeyed by sitting down on low ottoman little distance from mother on whose neck absolutely longed to throw beseech forgiveness mr hamilton tone be not such a to give courage to do so remained silent burying face in hand be waiting pleasure caroline must have thought that have have plenty of time to think during absence of what do accuse oh nothing nothing mamma dear mamma speak to in tone can not bear indeed indeed be miserable enough already condemn to punishment severest can know deserve speak so no caroline be to condemn to punishment must seem more like vengeance for pain have inflicted on by accusation of partiality injustice than from hope of producing good end be no longer child who must be taught line of duty to parent know now a well a can teach if fail must be answerable only to can not help further than by requesting to explain clearly origin of complaint against main ground of offense be believe that since ellen have become inmate of family have treated with more harshness unkindness than ever did before can look back on last eighteen month recall one instance in have be case must have answer caroline may now think explanation be not necessary that meant nothing when spoke will not satisfy when ill temper regains ascendency need not refrain from answering for fear of wounding can scarcely do that more than have done already caroline tried to speak must only sob forth that must not recall one instance in mother have be more displeased with than conduct merited acknowledging almost inarticulately that have sometimes fancied that have remained longer cold with than with ellen after committal of fault that stopped go on caroline must not feel fault such heavy one a ellen be of equal if not greater weight than cousin caroline have be from earliest infancy object of most tender devoted care to father miss harcourt have followed out plan have never be exposed to temptation not even that of casual bad example ellen till became mine encountered neglect harshness must not fail in such character to engender fault have can not compare with for have be situated a be fear must have have still heavier failing must never have told untruth exclaimed caroline with returning temper perhaps not for person be so physically constituted that know what fear be harshness must harden not terrify crush a with such disposition a ellen caroline when temper gain dominion over a have done to day do always think utter nothing truth caroline turned from that penetrating look burst into tear few a word be seemed to flash light into very inmost recess of heart tell that in moment of uncontrolled temper in brooding fancy really did forfeit truth on adherence to so prided that there be excuse for in idea that did not know what said did for why have religion reason be so carefully implanted within to enable to subdue evil temper ere acquired such fearful dominion perhaps have never thought of before caroline resumed mr hamilton tone be not quite so cold think of in future may help to conquer remember word can never be recalled that though may have lost such command over a scarcely to know exact sense of what say yet to whom be addressed who may have only heard must believe so receive perhaps act on false impression after effort will remove now to next charge treat ellen a reasonable being a child if have least foundation for supposition speak without hesitation whence have arisen for one minute caroline hesitated then resolved must atone for fault at least by full confession told wish hope annie information of lady helen promise have imparted pain be to feel that mother thought such child a not to speak to on subject if did think so caroline why did not from first moment annie told of come to tell how very much wished must not indeed have granted wish confidence must have be met with such indulgence a must at least have saved

herself that must listen to percy flowing account of delight with actual cheerfulness be so associated with reproach that must scarcely think of without pain be so convinced of folly in permitting such very little thing so to affect temper a to cause misery have endured that have resolved to punish not only by listening to percy by inquiring detail be girl of really strong mind once convinced of error once released from fell dominion of temper did not care what pain endured what difficulty encountered so that must convince mother how truly regretted tried to atone for past misconduct be very easy a mr hamilton have told to regain lost time in study not quite so easy to check cross word unkind thought to break from black cloud still at time must envelop did not give way constantly

toward convincing be striving in earnest make haste get ready forget poem will send over thing tell lady helen will expect family next monday evening to join edward little farewell party can return with with most delighted alacrity caroline hastened to get ready in hurry forgot poem till re entered school room be still untenanted what will do for writing paper thought desk be put away will detain so long to go up again for key volume be too large to carry oh will tear out blank page from book will not be very elegant can recopy at moorland hastily tore out page from exercise book lay

to dry finding closed on return put away without looking at following day miss harcourt of course requested to see to ellen utter astonishment exercise be not there only faulty blotted theme with sign to explain disappearance now know miss harcourt be rather prejudiced against ellen a have unhappily failed in truth more than once perhaps be not so unjust harsh a poor ellen felt to be refused to believe assurance that have written one have be in school room at time to whom must refer if ellen have never disobeyed deceived of course word must be sufficient a brother cousin must that have failed again in obedience truth ellen can not for moment doubt certainly must be duty to inform aunt directly a know must cause real suffering to be compelled to punish just last week that edward will be with for time will say nothing about to inflict penalty on to attract notice be entirely for sake forbear one so hardened in falsehood a must be so soon to forget kind indulgence after fault only few week ago can deserve nothing harshness contempt will certainly after week warn not to trust too implicitly in artful profession of repentance poor ellen felt too bewildered too miserable even to cry that have written exercise be a positive a have be told to do so if have what have become of harsh a miss harcourt seemed appearance be certainly very much against have not single proof that have obeyed word be nothing even emmeline looked at doubtingly a if must scarcely even pity be very little comfort to think aunt be not to be told own impulse be to go to tell at once how must be believed mr hamilton word if ever discover untruth will compel to adopt still severer measure pain a will be to myself remembrance of have suffered disappointment must be to aunt to think have said read to be forgotten when in reality be constantly thinking of trying to act on checked impulse terrified into silence miss harcourt be not acute physiognomist must only read in ellen face hardihood recklessness rather think mr hamilton must have read something very different be very much engaged with edward if did think ellen looked much more out of spirit attributed to natural feeling at rapid approach of day of separation for brother sake to prove to must enter into joy tried very hard not to evince least symptom of depression never to cry before at least though night told day have gone brought before sort of vague feeling fancy of dread cried to sleep laid awake still more unhappy suspicion attached to seemed to double severity of trial of parting edward be own edward must love with fault even aunt kind dear good aunt must cease to have affection for if so constantly believed guilty of sin so terrible a falsehood seemed to love brother still more than ever day brought hour of parting nearer sometimes a if must not bear pain of not being able to look at bright face listen to glad laugh dear voice for three perhaps six long year aunt gentle kindness seemed to increase unhappiness for though knew be innocent still felt if miss harcourt have told mr hamilton must not be so caressed cared for be receiving that be believed to have forfeited miss harcourt face certainly seemed to ask a distinctly a word how must be so artful so deceitful a to permit aunt to take such notice of so often shrunk away when most longed to sit by listen to edward spirit never sobered except now then when thought of leaving mr hamilton to whom have given same love have lavished on mother perhaps to still greater extent for reverence be largely mingled with mr howard too be whom grieved to leave mr hamilton so trusted in apparently strong affection good disposition a to feel little anxiety merely sorrow that be to lose for profession of danger did not know did mr howard edward that be one who must be guided more by influence of with whom be intimately thrown than by memory of absent judgment of own ellen manner on monday evening annoyed prejudiced miss harcourt still more mr greville mary

to be that have always fancied mr hamilton on contrary saw that in very midst of laugh of speaking niece eye must rest upon edward lip quite quiver smile become for moment so strained that be satisfied ellen cheerfulness proceeded from want of feeling wondered indeed at so much control at early age loved for notwithstanding once only ellen be nearly conquered mary have begged to sing little hindoo air of be particularly fond edward hearing request said eagerly do sing dear ellen be quite a fond of a mary be for seems to make think of india poor mamma will be such long time before

increased difficulty what reason must give mary went asked mr hamilton to accompany ellen did very best voice must tremble just before end of second verse failed entirely still be glad have tried for on mr hamilton saying very kindly in voice that only mary must hear be half afraid must not succeed to night dear ellen be quite right to try mary seemed to understand at once why have be so difficult for to oblige to be quite sorry have pressed so much edward have thanked told must sing in idea very often tried to be merry again must not succeed a before so kept a near aunt a must all remainder of evening a if be only safe there edward too have hard battle with a one by one favorite companion took leave of with hearty shake of hand eager in half choked wish for health prosperity when have gone

not school boy off with will not give time room for one kiss from mamma before go roused tried to laugh in midst of tear gave ellen kiss ran into carriage where be quickly followed by uncle cousin in very few minute oakwood dear happy oakwood a whole heart felt at moment be hidden from sight ellen remained by window looking after carriage long after be impossible to see hear very pale eye very heavy not in tear a aunt went to put arm round began talking to very cheerfully of edward must have to write to about how soon might hear from that ellen must answer a often a fully a liked that must not even ask to see letter to to a might have many little affectionate thing to say to other that might not care about one else seeing must trust ellen seemed a if one pain be soothed if indeed heard often from might bear departure there be still other source of unhappiness recalled time met miss harcourt cold suspicious look have not changed even then still tried to join cousin get work for there be study that morning so little time passed by mr hamilton exertion almost cheerfully then ellen left room to get something wanted in seeking own passed edward room door of stood half open must not resist entering thing spoke of so vividly yet seemed so to tell have gone really gone be quite alone that pain came back again worse than ever laid head on pillow long checked tear flowed with almost passionate violence dear ellen have be looking for where said aunt kind voice full hour afterward emmeline went into room must not find must not imagine what have become of be not wise of to come here

edward ellen love what be then tell replied mr hamilton surprised almost alarmed ellen must not go on much a wished for momentary courage have deserted must only cry more bitterly than before have done thing wrong ellen have forgotten promise inquired aunt after waiting several minute speaking very sorrowfully miss harcourt think have aunt indeed indeed have not have not be so very wicked a to tell falsehood know one can believe must rather must know even if if punish again must try to be more calm dear ellen tell clearly what be causing so much additional suffering for can not quite understand certainly will not punish unless quite convinced have failed in truth again think have tell exactly what be look at while be speaking ellen tried to obey grief have gained ascendency that be very difficult mr hamilton looked very thoughtful when ceased for really be more perplexed than allowed ellen to perceive poor child fancying silence must only mean disbelief condemnation remained quiet trembling by side promised must not doubt ellen will not now though appearance be so strong against said after several minute thought come with to school room show exercise book may find clew to explain mystery ellen thought be quite impossible inexpressibly comforted by aunt trust went with directly ellen have be telling that have be very much displeased with dear lucy mr hamilton said directly entered addressing miss harcourt who be sitting reading with caroline emmeline certainly with great apparent justice be so unhappy about can scarcely believe that have forgotten passed

have candor to tell instead of continuing to receive notice a have done last week ellen have brought book while miss harcourt be speaking mr hamilton attentively examined did not begin one like same day caroline yes mamma remember be obliged to send to harris for a parcel with stationery did not come from exeter a soon a expected noticed how much thinner be though be same sized book did not hear say something about having same number of leaf therefore must have be only quality of paper made difference what memory have mamma answered caroline smiling did not think be taking least notice of do remember saying so now indeed very often wish quality have be same for writing look horrid do happen to remember number of leaf contained if be alike know have same number think be two twenty can tell in moment with usual quickness of movement caroline unlocked desk drew forth book ran over leaf be right two twenty be quite sure have same number perfectly certain mamma then by incomprehensible mean two leaf have disappeared from ellen here be only twenty have ever torn leaf out ellen aunt indeed have not when did miss harcourt tell to write missing exercise last monday week mean yesterday week

ellen unhappiness be in such hurry to copy poem for lady helen tore blank leaf out of open book on table without thinking whose be in haste book fell to ground picked up to write on never noticed if fellow leaf fell out must have done doubt fanny carried away with other torn paper asked if be to destroy be more sorry than can tell ellen pray believe did not do purposely be sure will if be only for comfort of knowing truth said mr hamilton truly relieved not only from explanation perceiving caroline voluntarily offered kiss be willingly heartily returned by ellen be almost first have ever seen exchanged between must believe dear caroline for never say what mean said ellen earnestly do so wish miss harcourt must see exercise must quite believe then must all be more satisfied replied mr hamilton perceiving in moment miss harcourt still doubted ringing bell desired footman to send fanny to do remember taking torn paper from room morning went to tell miss hamilton that mr grahame be waiting asked yes madam be torn up in small piece madam there be one like page out of book made ask miss hamilton if be to be destroyed be such nice clean piece only being written on one side wrapped up lace in mr elli having only hour before scolded for not keeping more carefully bring leaf good girl miss ellen will give still better piece for purpose replied mistress quite unable to suppress smile ellen hastily took out large sheet of writing paper moment fanny returned seemed gone age gave to seized own placed in aunt hand without being able to speak single word think be very theme certainly ellen writing dear lucy can have more doubt now said mr hamilton moment fanny have left room delighted with exchange drawing ellen close to for poor child must really scarcely stand have done injustice ellen beg pardon replied miss harcourt directly mr hamilton must have be better pleased have stopped there must not help adding know must never have doubted if have not so often forfeited truth ellen first impulse have be to go to last word caused to bury face on aunt shoulder really think ellen ought to thank elli for giving scolding a have done such excellent service resumed mr hamilton playfully what fee be going to give for taking upon to prove innocence in open court think so very clever that will tell percy be better lawyer without study than can hope to be with seem very capable of doing thing kissing now so will not be very exacting have cried almost ill so must bear penalty go lie down in dressing room for hour two emmeline go with cousin see what kind affectionate nurse can be till come be never too early to practice complete woman office emmeline quite proud of charge more grieved than very well knew how to express till be quite alone with ellen that too have suspected be cold to last week left room with cousin caroline seemed to hesitate for moment be quite certain by mother face that wished to speak with miss harcourt so without being told took up book went into library now lucy be going to ask personal favor began mr hamilton moment be alone will try not judge ellen so harshly again be instant reply have right to desire dear friend not to ask a favor be too prejudiced too hasty own dear child be so truthful so open that fear have quite spoiled for necessary patience forbearance with others have not quite guessed lucy appearance be so very strongly against poor child be not at astonished must have disbelieved assertion in moment of irritation be not unlikely must have done so favor be going to ask be merely that will try never show that doubt word refer to past failure be quite convinced that untruth be not ellen natural disposition that have be caused by same circumstance have made such painfully timid too humble character if with effort to conquer still find word doubted past brought forward never will be able to succeed examine a strictly carefully a please a be sure will desire if necessary a did to day oblige never doubt if find never do will raise self esteem give still further incentive to adhere a strictly to truth a see believe doe be certain habit of falsehood have often be strengthened by injudicious cruel reference to one two childish failure if be never to be believed what be use of trying to tell truth be very natural question present pain of carefulness being greater than visible amount of evil habit be confirmed will oblige of course will dearest mr hamilton how can talk so have not right to desire what think proper in guidance of child instead of so appealing to a equal be not dear lucy have ever in act word considered otherwise in very intrusting child to care do not prove must think so have lived with year not yet discovered have few notion peculiar perhaps to myself that one among be that can never consider too much be too grateful to invaluable friend who help in training of child have lived long enough with to know that there never be never can be woman like a wife mother mistress friend exclaimed miss harcourt with most unusual fervor did not know own mother dearest lucy a how wish have must not think so firm truthful estimable quality may posse under god blessing owe to a young child before came to year afterward be more like ellen than of own darling perhaps explains secret of love for forbearance with like ellen repeated miss harcourt much surprised forgive indeed can scarcely believe be truth notwithstanding poor father great preference for eleanor when be child very superior beauty quickness threw back into myself be quite certain if have not be for excellent mother who came to live with when be only seven character must have suffered a much from neglect on one side too painful humility on own a ellen have done can understand feeling of loneliness misappreciation shrinking into better even than doe affection kindness ought to have altered character by time hardly eighteen month be not long enough to remove painful impression influence of eleven sorrowful year besides scarcely know influence fear sometimes that have endured more than be aware of so must think charitably of fancy dearest lucy added smiling help to make ellen a much like a woman a believe be to a child to do so try think little very little more kindly hopefully of than do really do wish be not quite so penetrating dearest mr hamilton there be hiding single feeling fancy from answered miss harcourt slightly confused laughing at same time what with memory quick observation determined notice of little thing really be most dangerous person to live with if be not more kind indulgent true than body else must be frightened to come near be glad have saving quality replied mr hamilton laughing also must be rather hard to be isolated because can read other people thought however have entered into compact continued rather more seriously will never show that doubt ellen in difficult matter come at once to miss harcourt willingly assented day passed much more happily than morning must have anticipated emmeline nursing be so affectionate successful that ellen be quite able to join at dinner aunt have selected very interesting story to read aloud in one character be young sailor that hour seemed to fly then have long talk about poor alice seaton brother whether must be possible for mr hamilton to place young seaton in situation that liked better that health be more fitted for ellen said must like to see know alice so much for trial must be such very hard one aunt promised must in midsummer holiday for alice must then come spend week with seemed a if not to be able to wish edward good night kiss brought back of pain again found that thinking about poor alice fancying how miserable must be if loved aunt a dearly a did mr hamilton to be obliged to part from a well a brother live at school made pain seem le absorbing a if to help alice must do more toward curing than thing though of course day for little while seemed to miss edward more more still aunt affection own effort prepared to see uncle cousin return listen to must tell about without increase of pain part iii sin suffering chapter advance retrospect reader must imagine that two year four month have elapsed since last visit to inmate of oakwood be first week in march that edward fortescue only wanting ten day for completion of fourteenth year quitted home be happier than have ever known to enter world a sailor be th of june two year later day on ellen fortescue completes fifteenth year that recommence narrative over interval however much a be anxious to proceed must take brief glance clearly to understand aspect of oakwood home affair from increasing age of younger member have undergone slight change greatest most keenly felt be departure of percy herbert for college october twelvemonth after edward have gone house seemed actually desolate without percy wild joke inexhaustible spirit herbert quiet unobtrusive kindness much a have always be truly appreciated by home circle still scarcely seemed to have be fully felt till young men be gone old house actually seemed enwrapped in silence required very determined effort on part of who remained in least degree to dispel reader who be mother earnest one will easily understand anxious trembling of mr hamilton heart when parted from boy for world for such to spirit fresh boyish unsophisticated a still be oxford must not fail to be for herbert indeed have fear doubt sneer temptation no bad example must affect in whom passing year seemed to increase deepen exalted feeling in earliest childhood have le in of earth than heaven piety be so real faith so fervent affection so concentrated in home in one other individual love pursuit of study so ardent unceasing one aim to become worthy in heart mind to serve god a minister so ever present that be effectually guarded even from world percy have none of feeling to same extent save ardent love for home inmate mother above did indeed give promise that principle so carefully instilled have taken firm root must guide conduct in world mr hamilton be too humble minded too convinced that human effort be imperfect without sustaining vitalizing grace of god to rest in security a many might have done because have so worked so prayed must succeed be hopeful indeed very hopeful how must be otherwise when beheld deep though silent reverence for sacred thing constant increasing respect love for father devoted affection for attachment to herbert seemed so strangely yet so beautifully to combine almost reverence for superior mind holier spirit with caressing protectiveness of older for younger stronger for weaker there be much in to banish anxiety altogether not from such heart a mr hamilton whose very multiplicity of blessing made often tremble led to footstool of god with piety a humble a constant a fervent a many believe be fruit of adversity alone caroline have sufficiently improved a greatly to decrease solicitude on account though there be still want of sufficient humility too great proneness to trust implicitly in own strength inclination to prejudice love of admiration made mr hamilton fear must expose to personal sorrow ere be entirely overcome to produce eternal good might not murmur at temporal suffering fond heart though must anticipate calmly for so shrunk from a touching child that nearer approached period of caroline introduction to gay world more painfully anxious became more gladly must have retained in retirement of oakwood where better higher quality alone have play knew must not be must only trust that anxiety must be proved a groundless with caroline a letter from oxford proved to be with percy endeavor to avert by never wavering in watchful guiding love emmeline at fifteen be just same sportive happy innocent child a have be at twelve feeling be indeed still deeper imagination more vivid religion more fervid to thing be touched with poetry mattered not how dull commonplace might seem to other people mr hamilton judicious care have so taught that truth alone be poetry beauty ideal only lovable when basis be real that be neither romantic visionary keen a sensibility be even over work of fiction prompted deed act of kindness not tear alone for mile round father large domain be known loved so felt a guardian spirit that very sound of step seemed to promise joy actually seemed to live for others making pleasure hers withal so joyous especially in own home at greville manor that even anxiety seemed exorcised when be near before stranger indeed must be a shy a young fawn though even then natural kindliness of heart prompted such kindness of word manner a always to excite wish to see again edward in two year quarter have be away have only once occasioned anxiety two three month after have sailed wrote home in highest term of certain gilbert harding one of senior midshipman of ship from whom have received kindness upon kindness who being six seven year older than jestingly wrote to aunt uncle must certainly be very best friend must have chosen a be much too old to lead into mischief why harding have taken fancy to edward must not tell be so excessively kind so taught duty smoothed difficulty disagreeables owned have at first seemed overwhelming that never must be grateful enough added that though not general favorite with immediate messmate be very highly esteemed by sir edward manly other superior officer that former have much commended for kindness to youngest boy on board edward be be very easy to perceive that young fortescue susceptible affection have be not only attracted already riveted by new friend young party at oakwood rejoiced at mr hamilton must have done so also have not perceived anxious expression on husband face alarmed did not however make remark till have spoken to mr howard then imparted to wife alone not choosing to create suspicion in open heart of child that gilbert harding though very young at time have be one of principal actor in affair have caused mr howard to dismiss pupil a related in former page that very youth for must scarcely have be more than eleven twelve

by immense interest be permitted to enter navy where be said youthful error have be so redeemed courage conduct altogether have so won applause that farther fear be entertained for mr howard alone retained opinion that disposition be naturally bad doubted internal response to seeming outward good be grieved anxious beyond measure when heard that be not only on board same ship a edward already favorite companion most trusted friend anxiety of course extended to mr mr hamilton to degree at first moment must gladly have endeavored to exchange ship must have seemed very strange to sir edward manly who be one of mr hamilton most valued friend have in fact actually delayed edward becoming midshipman till sir edward must take in own ship now to place elsewhere be really impossible after though might be removed from harding influence how must anxious guardian know with whom might be thrown be obliged to content with writing earnestly affectionately to edward painful a be to throw doubt shade over such youthful confidence affection implored not to trust too implicitly in harding that character have not always be free from stain that edward be still so young so susceptible might find that have imbibed principle be tempted to wrong almost unconsciously suffer from effect when too late to escape wrote a affectionately indulgently a must mr howard a well a aunt uncle still felt that certainly did appear cruel to warn young warm heart to break off first friendship have formed especially a beheld that friend approved of by captain looked up to by crew edward reply be somewhat cold though did promise caution assure have not so forgotten influence principle of oakwood a to allow one to lead into error did not surprise never referred to harding again except sometimes casually

accomplished man of world in most painful sense have own companion own haunt scarcely ever visiting home for reason must poor mother have known must have given slight gleam of comfort must not associate either with sister without feeling sort of loathing of longing to be to a percy herbert hamilton be at oakwood not having moral courage sufficient to break from control of father exciting pleasure in control initiated shrunk more more from only spot in better feeling be so awakened within a to give pain to deaden unacknowledged remorse manner be rude unfeeling so that very visit though inexpressibly longed for by mother brought only increase of grief mr greville seemed so inured to suffering that bore up against without visible failing of health struggling against enervating effect

watch have received on birthday if be not enough few trinket have be mother last six month aunt have given into own care ventured casually to inquire if there be opportunity of sending parcel to edward answer be in negative increased difficulty only person dared even to think of so far intrusting with deep distress anxiety for money not cause be widow langford mother of robert young gentleman attendant whom have have occasion more than once to mention former nurse of mr mr hamilton child occupied cottage on outskirt of park be not only favorite with young party ellen included for generally came to nurse in many illness be regarded with greatest confidence affection by mr mr hamilton have endeavored to return unwavering fidelity active service by taking only child robert into family when

manor so that must not be home till quite late in morning ellen though have dressed for going out appeared to have symptom of such violent headache that aunt advised remaining quietly at home assented with eagerness refusing offer of companionship saying if pain went off must quite amuse if continued quietness elli nursing be best thing for give letter before go out ellen be only waiting for to close mine to sir edward why dear have forgotten told must be ready by to day uncle added surprised at exclamation that have not finished must be done sent to t before four to day so do hope head will allow to write for edward will be woefully disappointed if there be not line from especially a from ship cruising about may be several week before can hear again must leave letter with to inclose edward seal up pray see that go in time ellen tried to promise that must tongue actually clove to roof of mouth party dispersing at moment silence be unnoticed mr hamilton gave letter in hour afterward be alone sat for nearly hour in own room with desk before face buried in hand whole frame shaking a with ague must be said at length unlocking drawer took thence small cross one two other trinket put up taking off watch looked at with expression of suffering that seemed a if must not go on carefully folded up with other trinket murmuring if nurse langford will take lend twenty pound till can dispose of may save yet if betray if tell aunt afterward at least only will suffer will not suspect oh to lose to be doubted hated must be at last oh mother mother why may not tell aunt must not disgrace again crouched down cowed by fearful struggle to very earth after few minute passed deliberately putting on bonnet shawl took up trinket set off to widow cottage limb so trembling that knew not how must accomplish even short walk wind be unusually high although day be otherwise lovely be scarcely able to stand against strong breeze especially a breath seemed to increase pain in temple persisted nearest path lay through thick shrubbery almost wood family never used in fact younger member be prohibited from taking secrecy haste be at moment entered ellen mind felt so exhausted by wind blowing branch leaf noisily confusedly around on reaching sort of grassy glade more open than previous path sat down minute on mossy stone wind blew withered stick leaf toward among two three soiled piece of thin paper stained with damp one of raised mechanically started up with wild cry seized others almost unconsciously pressed hand over eye lip moved in utterance of thanksgiving saved edward too guardian angel must have sent if not actually spoken be so distinctly uttered in heart that thought heard retraced step so swiftly so gladly very pain exhaustion be unfelt wrote for hour intently eagerly though wrote knew not never must recall took from secret drawer of desk that secret drawer when percy have so laughingly showed secret of spring telling nobody knew little thought must have occasion so to use bank note of two three five pound making fifteen have so carefully hoarded placed with two have found a did so discovered that two have clung so closely together that sum be five pound more than wanted still a acting under influence of spell carelessly put one aside sealed up packet to edward inclosed in uncle to sir edward manly dispatched full four hour before hour mr hamilton have named be gone sat down to breathe impulse never experienced before urged instead of destroying edward desperate letter a have done similar appeal to retain in blank envelop in same secret drawer a tried to rouse from sort of stupor be strangely creeping over eye caught five pound note have not have occasion to use thought of such overwhelming wretchedness rushed upon a effectually for moment to disperse stupor prostrate in agony of supplication before god what have done if almost maddening thought must have found word such must have be how dared appropriate that money without one question one thought a to whom must belong sent who must have sent great god of mercy oh if thy wrath must fall on guilty one pour on spare spare brother have sinned meant not thought not of knew not what did thou knowest thou alone canst know only thought of moment agony of suffering wrath can be too great for spare how long that withering agony lasted ellen knew not whether tear fell lay scorching eye heart note lay before like hideous specter from vainly tried to turn what must do with take back to spot where others have be blown to tried to rise to do so to own terror found be so powerless that actually must not walk with desperate calmness placed in little secret drawer put up remainder of paper closed locked desk laid down upon bed for must sit up longer elli came to with inquiry after head if must take dinner ellen asked for cup of coffee to be left quite quiet instead a writing have not decreased pain housekeeper accustomed to such casual attack did a be requested came frequently to see in course of afternoon evening still without perceiving thing unusual therefore not tormenting with expression of surprise anxiety thought after thought congregated in poor girl mind a thus lay so fraught with agony that physical suffering be far more than usual be unfelt save in paralyzing effect on limb impulse be to confess exactly what have done to aunt moment must see conjure to sentence to heavy chastisement must deaden present agony be impossible without betraying edward nullifying for relief have sent how must confess sin without full confession of use to money have be applied whose be note be stained with damp a if must have lain among withered leaf time yet have heard inquiry made about a loss of so large sum must surely have demanded only plan must think of a bringing least hope of returning peace be still to beseech mr langford to dispose of watch trinket very first mention heard made of loss to return full sum to real possessor if possible so secretly a for not to be traced to herself thought too that if gave trinket one by one not together to mr langford must be le suspicious perhaps more easily prevail on to grant secrecy assistance if positively refused unless ellen revealed reason of desiring disposal must solemnly promise secrecy must tell so much of intense misery a might perhaps induce to give aid if did not demand reason betrayed must endure doubt serious displeasure course of acting on part must inevitably produce two thing alone stood clear before must replace that money must keep edward secret must have gone very day to mr langford must not move elli at seven prevailed on to undress go to bed not better ellen hoped to day perfect quietness must have removed headache be quite disappointed be mr hamilton affectionate address a softly entered niece room on return of happy party at eleven at night placing lamp so that bed remained in shade must not see expression in ellen face except of

did not mind being alone though unusual almost passionate warmth with returned mr hamilton fond kiss betrayed be indifference to affectionate offer dictated refusal be well mr hamilton though anxious enough to feel inclination to do so did not visit niece again convulsive agony must have witnessed choking sob burst forth few minute after disappeared from ellen sight must have bewildered terrified

walk without much too engrossed with other to be aware that a carried coat be easiest most natural thing possible for smaller content of pocket to fall out if not missed directly from winding rugged wood path not likely to be found again draught of cider hour rest at mr langford cottage sufficiently revived robert to resume coat satisfied that packet of paper be secure a imagined from feel of pocket pocket book also what then be consternation when approached first house at be to leave ten pound of money about twenty mile from oakwood to discover that pocket book be gone that by feel believed to have be old card case that young master percy have laughingly thrown at one day after failing in endeavor to emblazon sticky material have used causing to adhere to whatever touched so preserving in robert pocket when almost other thing have fallen out racked memory in vain a to what must have become of convinced that have not left at oakwood a first sincerely wished that have two

shunned by almost a day merged into week there be trace of note morris elli united in declaring that a stranger passed through part of park if found must have be heard of young man sunk into state of most gloomy despondency longing to tell kind master whole tale yet naturally enough shrinking from dread of suspicion of honesty a more terrible than rest mr hamilton did not suspect so assured of firm belief in truth innocence that be with great difficulty poor robert refrained from throwing at foot to pour forth gratitude be so severely punished from heedlessness that master must not say much about soon after dismissing summoned morris talked with time on subject declaring must a soon suspect own son of dishonesty a boy who have grown up under own eye from infancy son of such mother be very distressing for mr langford certainly old steward allowed looked sad enough be use have tried hard enough to prevent suspicion must come none servant woodman gardener went that path if note have

night might have be thought more flushed than pale passed unnoticed mr hamilton too much annoyed on mr langford account to think at moment of thing how must best set poor mother heart at rest be very evident that though of domestic after master address came up to robert shook hand with begged pardon greater number still sided with morris retained own le favorable opinion must well imagine what mr

illness have confined to room for nearly week when be allowed to take air state of nervous debility to have reduced of course prevented ever being left alone day after mr hamilton appeal to domestic have made desperate attempt by asking permission to be bearer of message from aunt to widow a girl be often allowed encouraged to visit nurse request be granted without surprise though to very last moment feared one of cousin miss harcourt must offer to accompany be however too occupied with for mr hamilton sought cottage there with such very evident mental agony besought mr langford to promise secrecy aid that widow very much against conscience be won over to accede be in most pressing want of money urged dared not appeal to aunt not daring to say whole amount so urgently required at once have only brought with antique gold cross two three smaller ornament have be among mother trinket gold locket percy have given mr langford be painfully startled have idea promise comprised acquiescence assistance in matter so very wrong mysterious a tried argument persuasion to prevail on ellen to confide difficulty to mr hamilton urging that if even have done wrong must only call for temporary displeasure whereas mischief of present proceeding might never come to end must be discovered at last ellen be inexorable though evidently quite a miserable a be firm mr langford have too high idea of solemn nature of pledged word to draw back think of betraying said that of course might be week before must succeed in disposing of a to offer together even at one place must be exposing to most unpleasant suspicion one step be thus gained nearly fortnight have passed heard nothing from widow will never come exclaimed emmeline in mirthful impatience one evening about four day after

persevering practice be only collecting percy herbert favorite song piece playing over instead of new music what if did emmeline why only prof that thought be quite a much occupied by a mine be though have so disagreeably read studied worked just a usual to make one believe thought cared thing about so because caroline can control even joyous anticipation be to be thought void of feeling emmy really can pronounce such judgment so though may have settled to usual pursuit have literally done nothing at to day will not condemn a loving brother le will condemn a idle unsteady hair brained girl replied emmeline kneeling on ottoman at mother foot looking archly fondly in face then do let have fellow sufferer for can not stand condemnation alone ellen do put away that everlasting sketch be idle unsteady too wo do emmy ellen have be so perseveringly industrious since illness must rather condemn for too much application than too great idleness really have be stooping too long warm evening

be quite sure that be completely altered even in manner to mother instead of being so gentle so submissive so quietly happy to deserve smallest sign of approval from mr hamilton now seemed completely to shrink from either in fear that no longer cared to please to obey by imperceptible sure degree painful conviction pressed on mind of whole party even to light hearted unsuspicious emmeline to whom

disappointment be most painful have not gleam of hope to urge on concluding word be that be under evil influence of unconfessed most heinous fault ellen be perfectly convinced what be time will reveal give one month to decide on course of action subdue sullen spirit confess error may have be led into so change conduct a to be again child so loved spite of occasional fault error will pardon be past if at end of month find persisting in same course of rebellion defiance regardless alike of duty to god to will adopt measure to compel submission have hoped to bring up child under own eye by own effort if be not permitted so to do know duty too well to shrink from alternative will no longer remain under care severer guardian more rigid discipline may bring to sense of duty advise to think well on subject ellen know too well think to imagine speak in mere jest have left room a spoke so that if ellen have intended reply there be time for must not have spoken go from oakwood in anger yet be just be better perhaps than lingering torture be then enduring better to hide shame misery among stranger than remain among good happy guilty wretch be sat thought till feeling became utterly

thought robert if justice to mercy to guilty can by extenuating clause unknown to now be united trust will now go obeyed in silence still mr hamilton changed not that outward seeming of rigid calm continued to put paper letter away merely retaining note locked drawer took possession of key then retired to own room where for hour remained alone be not ours to lift vail from brief interval must

window light from fell full on giving figure though be seated naturally enough in one of large maroon velvet oaken chair unusual effect of dignity command impressing terrified beholder with sensation of awe have life depended on must not for one minute have gone forward even when desired to do so by word desired presence ellen because wished to speak to come here without more delay how walked whole length of interminable room stood facing aunt never knew mr hamilton for full minute did not speak fixed that searching look to have once before alluded upon ellen face then said in tone though very low calm expressed a much a earnest look ellen be necessary for to tell why be here necessary to produce proof that word be right that have be influenced by fearful effect of unconfessed most heinous sin little did dream nature for moment ellen stood a turned to stone a white rigid next have sunk down with wild bitter cry at mr hamilton foot buried face in hand be true can be true that offspring of own sister dear to cherished by a own child have be guilty one to appropriate conceal appropriation of money have be source of distress by loss suspicion thence proceeding for last seven week that must listen to uncle word absolving whole household a incapable of deed be actual theft yet by word sign betray remorse guilt must behold innocent suffering fearful misery of suspicion loss of character without power of clearing stand calmly heedlessly by only proving by hardened rebellious temper that be not right within ellen can be true yes be reply with such fearful effort that slight frame shook a with ague thank god that be known dared not bring down punishment on can bear be mere mockery ellen how dare believe even poor evidence of repentance with recollection of past conduct be note found ellen named where be be one smallest ellen answer be scarcely audible used for what there be answer neither then when mr hamilton sternly reiterated question then demanded how long have be in possession five six week reply be so tremulous carried conviction with since robert told story to uncle before before then last answer be falsehood ellen be full seven week since husband addressed household on subject must not have so miscounted time with deed to date by where did find ellen described spot what business have there know that cousin be ever allowed to go way to mr langford cottage more especially alone if wanted to see why did not go usual way when be must remember exact day memory be not in general so treacherous again ellen be silent have forgotten crouched lower at aunt foot answer be audible then answer ellen moment distinctly for what purpose be seeking mr langford cottage by forbidden path when wanted money went to ask to take trinket watch if must be dispose of a have read of others doing a miserable a be wind blew note to very hand used be mad then have be mad since believe must have returned whole amount to robert if must have parted with trinket in time to describe tone of utter despair recklessness a to effect word must produce be impossible word increased mr hamilton bewilderment misery to suppose that ellen did not feel be folly be very depth of wretchedness be crushing to earth answered unanswered question deepened mystery rendered judge task more difficult when be ellen will have more evasion tell exact day asked in vain ellen remained moveless silent a dead after several minute mr hamilton removed hand from face compelling to lift up head gazed searchingly on deathlike countenance for moment in utter silence then said in tone ellen never in life forgot can not imagine ellen that confession will satisfy in smallest degree redeem sin one one only path be open to for that have said left unsaid deepens apparent guilt so blackens conduct can scarcely believe be addressing child so loved must still so love if one real sign be given of remorse penitence one hope of returning truth sign that hope can only be full confession terrible a be guilt of appropriating so large sum granted came by merest chance into hand dark a be additional sin of concealment when innocent person be suffering something still darker more terrible must lie concealed behind must not must not continue thus obdurately silent can believe under heavy pressure of misery strong excitement sum might have be used without thought that fear might have prevented confession of thing so dreadful what be heavy necessity for money strong excitement what fearful mysterious difficulty have be led into to call for tell truth ellen whole truth let have hope of saving misery of publicly declaring guilty one so proving robert innocence tell what difficulty what misery so maddened a to demand disposal of trinket if there be least excuse smallest possibility of obtaining in time forgiveness will grant will not believe so utterly fallen will do can to remove error yet to prevent suffering to win must have full confession question put to must be clearly satisfactorily answered so bring back only comfort to hope to will do ellen oh must be reply in such bitter anguish mr hamilton actually shuddered can not must not dare not aunt emmeline hate condemn to severest sharpest suffering wish for pine for can not loathe more than do speak to in kind tone can not bear be because knew what wretch be have so shunned be not worthy to be with oh sentence at once dare not answer a wish dare not repeated mr hamilton more more bewildered to conceal emotion ellen wild word agonized manner have produced adopting greater sternness dare commit sin from lowest of household must shrink in horror yet tell dare not make only atonement give only proof of real penitence demand be weak wicked subterfuge ellen will not pas with there can be reason for fearful obduracy not even consciousness of greater guilt for promise forgiveness if be possible on sole condition of full confession once more will speak hardihood will be utterly useless for can not hope to conquer if permit to leave with conduct still clothed in impenetrable mystery will compel to adopt measure to subdue that defying spirit will expose to intense suffering must force submission at last can not inflict more than have endured last seven week murmured ellen almost inarticulately have borne that can bear rest then will not answer be resolved not to tell day on found that money use to be applied reason of choosing that forbidden path permitting to believe guilty of heavier sin than may be case in reality listen to ellen be more than time interview must cease will give one chance more be now half past seven took watch from neck laid on table will remain here one half hour longer by time sinful temper may have passed away will consent to give confession demand can not believe so altered in two month a to choose obduracy misery when pardon in time confidence love be offered in stead get up from that crouching posture can be mock humility so only aggravates sin ellen rose slowly painfully seating at table distance from aunt leaned arm upon buried face within never before never after did hour appear so interminable to mr hamilton ellen be well for firmness of former perhaps that must not read heart of young girl even if cause of anguish have be still concealed again again did wild longing turning actually faint sick with agony come over to reveal whole to ask rest mercy for pardon security for edward then clear a held before in letter of fire read word of brother desperate letter particularly breathe to uncle aunt for if know will will never see more mother pallid a death seemed to stand before freezing confession on heart lip looking at threateningly a have so often seen a if very thought be guilt rapidly advancing twilight large lonely room added to fearful illusion if ellen did succeed in praying be with desperate fervor for strength not to betray brother if ever there be martyr spirit be enshrined in young frail form how must mr hamilton imagine how must wildest fancy bring edward brave happy eager edward of whom captain officer crew wrote in such term of praise admiration who have never given cause for anxiety who be so far distant a uniting link to terrible mystery be not more natural that must not enter incongruous painful thought floating through brain save a last resource by influence to obtain truth from ellen more thought more agonizing thought became what must induce determined silence conviction of deeper guilt what must guilt be most terrible suspicion crossed mind have heard though have scarcely believed in of entanglement even where guardianship have be most rigid must one so young seemingly so innocent have fallen into power of desperate character who be working on thus how must be sure intended to take trinket to mr langford choosing that forbidden path be never by chance trodden by family friend constant desire lately not to join in excursion preferring often finding excuse to remain alone came to mr hamilton mind with overpowering sensation of dread misery that worst guilt ellen must have avowed must scarcely have be worse than anticipation pictured yet thought be so vague fancy so undefined there be nothing must grasp at a saving hope in remotest degree excusing cause such obdurate silence in one so young generally so yielding must must conceal nothing still more fearful sin darkness have gathered round save brightening light of harvest moon suddenly awakened to lapse of time moonlight fell full on face of watch be repeater wanted three minute more mr hamilton watched progress of hand with such sickening dread that when reached hour have scarcely strength to strike so give notice for word have none that hour of grace have passed conquered powerlessness soft chime when ellen first came to oakwood have be such constant source of childish wonder delight now rang in ear louder hoarser more fearfully distinct than even of ancient time piece in hall at same moment rang out hour of eight sound ceased with heightened dignity in perfect silence mr hamilton rose passed niece have nearly reached door when paused turned toward ellen a if irresolute ellen eye have watched a in fascination pause endowed with just sufficient power to spring forward fling at aunt foot clasping knee with little remaining strength passionately implore aunt emmeline aunt emmeline speak to one word only one word of kindness before go ask for mercy there can be none for wretch a be will bear without one complaint one murmur may inflict can not be too severe nothing can be such agony a utter loss of affection thought last two month that feared so much that be fear love now now that know sin have come back to make still more wretched before mr hamilton must prevent be in least aware of intention ellen have obtained possession of one of hand be covering with kiss while whole frame shook with convulsed completely tearless sob will confess ellen if stay will give proof that be such agony to lose affection that do love a profess that be only one sin have so changed one word tardy a be will listen if can forgive ellen made answer mr hamilton newly raised hope vanished waited full two three minute then gently disengaged hand dress from ellen still convulsive grasp door closed with sullen seemingly unwilling sound ellen be alone remained in same posture same spot till vague cold terror so took possession of that room seemed filled with ghostly shape article of furniture suddenly transformed to thing of life springing up with wild fleet step of fear paused not till found in own room where flinging on bed buried face on pillow to shut out object oh how longed to shut out thought be such different scene fullness of innocent joy on mr hamilton entered that though thought nerved to control visible emotion contrast almost overpowered knowing too that fatal effect of one person sin must banish that innocent enjoyment must fall on a fearful joy destroying blow room one of least spacious be cheerfully lighted urn hissing upon table at caroline usual be presiding only waiting for mother appearance to satisfy percy who be loudly declaring be famished in two sens for want of mother company of restorative for craving appetite be lounging on sofa playing with emmeline flowing ringlet a sat on low stool by side chatting with in a discursive strain a fancy willed herbert miss harcourt be still in earnest discussion on poem from herbert be occasionally reading aloud such beautiful passage with such richness of intonation variety of expression that caroline even percy emmeline must pause involuntarily to listen at length exclaimed percy springing up a did herbert at same moment to get mother chair place comfortably a usual in midst of really did begin to think intended to punish impatience by not joining at to night did not know be impatient dear boy perhaps might have done so be quiet even smiling reply fear indeed waiting for so long after water excursion must have caused to be impatient in sense what that must be famished assure be loss of society sharpened pang of hunger owe grudge will certainly serve out one day for detaining so long when wanted be not morris that detained answered mr hamilton somewhat hurriedly have done with by six o'clock come tell something about excursion added evidently anxious to elude farther remark perceiving at once miss harcourt herbert looked at very anxiously how did boat go how did caroline voice flute sound on water percy herbert see have found poetry a usual made miss harcourt companion must tell what verse beautiful river recalled afternoon emmy have more sketch to fill up child eagerly entered on day enjoyment herbert conquering anxiety to emulate mother calmness miss harcourt have be too painfully startled by unusual expression of forcibly controlled suffering on friend face to do so with success nearly hour however passed animatedly a usual found so much to tell percy be in such wild spirit that be utterly impossible for there to be thing like pause tea have always be favorite meal at oakwood a bringing family together after various business of day continued to be so have lingered over a usual when caroline suddenly exclaimed what have become of ellen have quite forgotten till moment how neglectful will think do ring bell percy that may send let know if have recollection of meal time really think need not trouble ourselves about be percy half jesting half earnest reply for ellen changed manner to mother have made more angry with for longer time together than have ever be with body especially woman in life stretched out hand however to ring bell mr hamilton stopped need not percy cousin will not wish to join said tone be now so expressive of almost anguish that one of happy party startled looked at with most unfeigned alarm percy thought of jest joyousness checked threw arm round exclaiming mother dearest what have happened that unhappy girl again be sure be why do not cast off from heart at once will bring nothing sorrow for love percy how can be so harsh how unlike exclaimed emmeline indignantly a mr hamilton head for few minute of natural weakness sunk on son encircling arm have given mamma trouble pain enough one time other what must have become of if have cast off have mother too for shame hush answered percy almost sternly for there be time when must quite throw off boy be light common matter to affect mother thus will send for mr howard mother continued fondly in father absence be ablest friend can only feel not counsel there be time when feeling can aid in bringing back control strength when counsel alone must seem so harsh cold can only weep before fond affection of child unusual assumption of protecting manliness in percy so touchingly united with deep respect prevented least intrusive question a to cause of distress till chose to reveal gave power to send back tear have escaped at first so hot fast though still holding hand a if very pressure be support be enabled calmly to relate fatal discovery of evening effect be in truth a if thunderbolt have fallen in midst of execration forcibly checked passionate a nature burst from lip of percy a clamped arm close round mother a thus to protect from misery felt herbert with low cry of pain buried face in hand caroline shocked bewildered first thought for mother must only look at feel for quite forgetting that prejudice against ellen did indeed seem fulfilled emmeline at first looked stunned then sinking down at mr hamilton foot hid face on lap sobbed with such uncontrolled violence that might have seemed a if not ellen be guilty cause of misery miss harcourt like caroline must only think feel for mr hamilton for knew so well hope interest love ellen have excited what must be bitter suffering of fearful disappointment weep thus love mr hamilton said addressing emmeline after nearly quarter of hour have passed various emotion of individual have found vent in word well illustrative of respective character emmeline who continued to sob so painfully that mother successfully forgot own sorrow to comfort ellen be still very young though be giving misery disappointment now may become can wish by by must not give up hope because now care seem so blighted there be fatal mystery attached to conduct for be indeed deceived if be not very wretched there be hope in then why doe not speak rejoined percy impetuously for when found mother resuming control firmness have given vent to indignation by striding hastily up down room what most determined hardihood wickedness can keep silent when promise forgiveness if will speak what mystery can there ought there to be about when have such indulgent friend a to bring trouble to wretched hope be for deserves to be if be only for base ingratitude percy dear percy speak judge so very harshly interposed herbert with deep feeling there doe indeed seem excuse for conduct if ever must find that there be extenuating cause how unhappy will be for having judged still more harshly than deserved be impossible can do muttered percy continuing angry walk nothing guilt can be cause of keeping thing from mother ellen know a know that even error when confessed have always be forgiven sorrow always soothed difficulty removed what can silence spring from then either defying obstinacy blacker sin doe seem like unhappily rejoined caroline very sorrowfully not at all a if triumphed in own previous penetration can not persevere in long dear mamma look so distressed be impossible can resist for length of time have resisted offer of kindness dear child be difficulty a to what course to pursue to compel submission confession so grief perplexes let seek mr howard dearest mother answered herbert be so good so kind even in severest judgment really think ellen will scarcely be able to persevere in mistaken silence if speak to mr hamilton paused for moment in thought believe be right herbert if must have counsel out of own family can not go to kinder wiser more silent friend if fearful shame must inflict on ellen to night of proving robert innocence before whole household by denouncement of guilt have effect in softening will appeal to oh mamma must be can not will not spare implored emmeline clinging to mother in passionate entreaty must kill know must expose to such shame do think be suffering to mother to be called upon to do emmeline that add to by weak interference replied percy sternly before mother must reply shame have shamed enough there want little more to add to be blue eye never moved from mother face miss harcourt longing to spare mr suffering of such proceeding tried to persuade to evade did not succeed one word of confession one evidence that sin originated in momentary temptation that conceals nothing darker one real proof of penitence god know how gladly must have spared a be lucy emmeline make duty harder few a word be tone spoke be enough no more be said mr hamilton tried with very little success to turn child thought to other pleasanter thing time seemed to lag heavily yet when prayer bell sounded fell on heart a fearful knell must have be struck too soon be assembled in library in respective place one herbert waited appearance tell miss fortescue that be only waiting for to commence prayer fanny young lady attendant departed to obey wondering at miss ellen non appearance hearing nothing unusual in mistress voice returned still waited again door unclosed emmeline bent forward in attitude of agony shame unable even to look at cousin whose place be close beside word dreaded came not then herbert at mother sign commenced service proceeded a usual fearful struggle in mr hamilton gentle bosom who might read save pitying god whom so fervently addressed for strength guidance voice of son ceased struggle be over before part for night said when one have arisen be necessary that innocent must be so justified before all that must no longer be injured by suspicion avoidance be nearly two month since master assured of own of perfect conviction that robert langford have told truth that missing note have be unfortunately lost by not appropriated a fear most of have believed be still inclined to do complete failure of search for have induced very uncomfortable feeling among a to person on whom suspicion of finding appropriating might fall none household frequenting that particular path none being able to suppose that storm must have so dispersed a to lose trace of acknowledge be unlikely not so unlikely a robert langford must have failed in honesty that of household must have appropriated concealed mystery be now however at end missing note have be traced found that suspicion discomfort may be removed from among becomes duty to designate individual who have thus transgressed duty to god man not by sin alone by so long permitting innocent to suffer for guilty more especially a individual be one of own family for one moment paused whether to gain strength to give more force to concluding word one must tell ellen fortescue chapter vi sentence execution excitement reigned in servant hall after have withdrawn in most respectful silence from library be extreme robert utterly unable to realize relief in proof of own innocence must only pace hall in agony deploring mad carelessness by exposing to temptation have caused morris elli deepened remorse by perfectly agreeing with before separated old steward called together voice trembling with agitation tear actually running down furrowed cheek told that even a mistress have done duty to utmost ay more than utmost by for must have well nigh broken heart to do solemn duty be demanded from to that if man woman child failed in must know that have feeling honor gratitude in heart deserved must be scouted by that duty be never to let event of night pas lip even to other be enough that mystery suspicion have be taken from that time must clear up remainder never must believe grandchild of mistress father one have so loved cared for must willfully act a appearance seemed to say that be sure one day other must find there be much more to pity than to blame till then if have least spark of generous grateful feeling must forget whole affair only evince sense of mistress conduct by yet greater respect attention to respective duty old man speech be garrulous perhaps often faulty in grammar came from heart so went to heart at once not one held back from pledge of silence demanded there be who imagine that refinement of feeling alone must actuate morris speech warm immediate response be only to be found among educated rich how little who thus suppose understand human heart kindness begets kindness if superior will think of seek happiness temporal eternal of inferior will prove that be considered child of one common father there need equality of rank to create equality of happiness equality of refined because true feeling next morning when mr hamilton have occasion to speak to morris about farm receipt have not be forthcoming preceding day recalled a be departing word have to say seemed unusually difficult for voice audibly faltered face be completely shaded by hand be simply to ask that morris loving reverence have already done when old man in earnest accent of heartfelt respect kindness never can be mistaken related what have passed mistress hastily extended hand to saying in tone never forgot god bless morris ought to have known love for master house must have urged without request from can not thank enough kiss ventured to press upon delicate hand pressed rough palm be not unaccompanied though did force back tear most respectfully yet very earnestly beseech mistress not to take on too much there must be cause mystery one belonging to must so have acted without very fearful temptation very powerful reason must come straight one day future present be only suffering for to obtain full confession from ellen mr hamilton felt so absolutely incumbent on that steadily refused to listen to pity affection must shake firmness opinion advice of mr howard strengthened determination have private interview with ellen be attended with so very little success that left far more bewildered grieved than have sought fully convinced be mere hardihood obstinacy caused incomprehensible most guilty silence not even allowing a mr hamilton have that there be evidence of misery remorse perhaps have be more quiet more resolutely calm if have not be for strong appearance against surely must have seen be strength quiet of despair not defiance believed rebellious spirit must be conquered said on rejoining mr hamilton who with child miss harcourt have most anxiously yet hopefully awaited result of interference must actually be sharing sin if permit to conquer by obduracy self will solitary confinement complete idleness may bring to better temper in fact must be persisted in till full confession be made if fail dear mr hamilton niece must be banished from oakwood must not remain here continual source of anxiety misery to of successful hardihood to herself of there will be time enough to think when have answer from mr hamilton judgment from distance may be wiser than ours on spot irritated a be by such unaccountable obstinacy in one have always thought almost too yielding be incomprehensible change of character in seeming still more perplexed mr hamilton so made believe there must be worse fault dangerous entanglement demanding such resolute pertinacity in concealment closely connected with elli private apartment having inlet outlet save through short passage opening from sitting room be two small not uncomfortable apartment opening one into other looking out on very pretty quite unfrequented part of park have often be used when of elli child grandchild came to see be in consequence almost

have remark made further than can avoid be a kind to a can elli consistent with character a wise watchful guardian god in mercy grant that heart may be so softened that will not fill painful position long now to see percy watchful care have so quietly interposed that mother found in usual sitting room in midst of before must seek ellen when with reproach told that have still most painful duty to accomplish therefore ought not to have prevented answered impetuously mother will not see ellen more alone have made miserable enough already time that see deceitful appearance of remorse suffering

evident daily portion alarmed for effect upon always delicate health a yet however there be outward appearance of failing rather bore up from cessation of nervous dread constant terror have endured before before mr hamilton letter arrived month after fatal discovery elli have drawn own conclusion manner instead of being distant cold have become so excessively kind feeling that poor girl felt heavy change must be impending dared not look to continuance of such comfort mr hamilton never saw niece save when word must pas between must not judge a elli did must only feel a day passed without bringing desired proof of sorrow amendment more more bewildered very wretched though for child sake so conquered feeling a after first week to restore cheerfulness promote various amusement have so enjoyed ellen disappearance have of course to be accounted for to intimate friend with whom so constantly be acknowledgment that have be disappointed in that conduct must not allow social domestic indulgence at least for time satisfied elder member annie for first time discovered that caroline be match in cleverness merely from excessive truth simplicity manoeuvre a might must not discover smallest clew to sudden mystery mary for first time on one subject alone found herbert emmeline impenetrably reserved a soon a mr langford have be informed by son at mistress desire of unanswerable proof of innocence hastened to hall requesting private interview with mr hamilton placed at once in hand trinket watch with have be at different time intrusted related have passed between miss fortescue excessive misery seemed to be enduring confessed that few pound have given a sum obtained by sale of trinket have advanced having resolved that nothing must induce to dispose of that of course be difficulty have in advancing right value have occasioned length of time have elapsed since ellen have first sought must not go far to prove really did wish to return money mr hamilton thought long after widow have left sum have advanced returned with interest be to return fatally appropriated sum because needed more ellen have so positively with such agony asserted first that be scarcely possible to disbelieve what be fearful difficulty pressing demand by one so young for so much money why if be comparatively innocent must not speak more thought more perplexed anxious seemed to become act of endeavoring to dispose of trinket especially have be given received a doubly valuable because have be worn by mother must have be sufficiently faulty to have occasioned natural displeasure compared with other known unknown fault sunk into almost nothing mr hamilton collected together mr langford have returned few remaining in niece drawer carefully put away till circumstance might authorize returning to ellen determined on saying nothing more on subject to ellen own family one thing elli reported to regarding ellen certainly seemed like consciousness of wrong have done robert wish to atone for begged elli so earnestly that might see if be only for five minute that must not resist when came implored so touchingly so pleadingly to forgive long silence entreat mother to do so too assuring that be hope of being able to restore note to without revealing identity have caused silence that be scarcely possible to listen to unmoved be false humility deepest most unfeigned contrition for having be cause of injury ten day after ellen imprisonment letter arrived from sir edward manly mr hamilton have alluded to a necessary to be received before must write to nephew news brought though somewhat alloyed must at time have be received with greatest delight edward be returning in three week month at utmost after receipt of commander letter might be with invalided home for three four month leave there have be rather severe engagement in young fortescue have still more distinguished from headlong courage have be severely not at seriously hurt sir edward intended sending pirate frigate have taken to england a be tight built well looking craft enough wrote if manned with honorable men instead of desperate villians have nominated harding fortescue to accompany second lieutenant a officer name of harding produced disagreeable reminiscence in mr hamilton mind have be so very long since edward have even mentioned that have almost forgotten early fancy for only thought now be thankfulness that gallant nephew have be preserved that be coming home must scarcely be pleasure felt though young party did for there be such excitement in edward courage in having be in two desperate engagement seen so much that with buoyancy happily natural to well disposed youth must only think talk of return forgetting alloy must cloud percy herbert hoped must arrive within three week a then must be with at least week ten day if delayed must very provokingly just arrive a must be returning to college after much painful deliberation mr hamilton determined on making herbert messenger with unexpected tidings to ellen hoping more than expressed that gentle eloquence in bringing before misery to must condemn brother if must persist in silence so compel appeal to must have effect especially a charged to impress upon that even now confession must bring pardon concealment of from edward herbert gladly undertook mission so feelingly so earnestly discharged that poor ellen felt more heart broken than have done yet almost incapable of retaining firmness did for danger to edward seemed more imminent now that be coming home to very vicinity of dreaded uncle than when be at distance must only feel thankful if concealment be indeed so absolutely necessary a have declared to be that mr hamilton be still from home might continue to be so during edward visit be difficult to repress sickening shudder when herbert chanced to mention that harding be brother companion in voyage home difficult not to express more disappointment than occasion warranted that edward have not answered last letter must have received herbert said for sir edward acknowledged father in hers to edward have be inclosed left after very long interview deeply grieved at failure of persuasion remonstrance compelled must not satisfactorily explain why to to family to pity far more than to blame percy declared a did caroline miss harcourt that must be only own too kind gentle disposition never must blame anybody thing mr hamilton be bitterly disappointed mr howard insisted that such obduracy demanded nothing sternest treatment only wished mr hamilton letter must arrive at once saw ellen again twice in five week elapsed between discovery of sin arrival of mr hamilton answer if kindness have so failed be comparatively easy to resist well intentioned in case utterly mistaken sternness be in general so kind even in judgment that mr hamilton thought must have reason to believe ellen so thoroughly hardened from report of be enabled to impart husband sentence with more firmness than have listened to own kind still loving heart be a mr howard have expected ellen be no longer to remain at oakwood to be placed under care of maiden lady living in yorkshire relation of mr hamilton one who have occasionally visited oakwood be therefore well known to mr hamilton to elli too regarded with such dislike by latter a to make actually venture to entreat mistress not to send miss ellen to be sure must break heart now miss seldon be one of worthiest woman ever breathed honest straightforward truth speaking literally to fault a hard a be true whether ever have feeling not mr hamilton with penetration never must discover good did be immense in practical benevolence though quick sympathy kindly word indulgent thought seemed utterly unknown have pity for fault failing always declaring forbearance love be folly if branch be in slightest degree decayed cut off if blight extend to root destroy be fond of saying a for youthful folly error have patience with for never having be rather felt young must not understand age in others elli have not discrimination enough to discern good lay under very disagreeable exterior mr hamilton have suffering a knew residence with must be to ellen if indeed be really character have seemed in childhood though last few month have so contradicted felt husband have decided wisely spite of misery still even very thought of sending orphan niece so completely from be to herself mr hamilton letter read harshly wife knew high almost stern principle have not seen ellen evident anguish must only judge from relation have be sent that told be indeed against of course said if have confessed confession in degree pleaded for wife must use own judgment a to period of banishment must not imagine cause for conduct sufficiently excusing a to demand avoidance of sentence altogether miss seldon last visit to oakwood be sufficiently well remembered by young hamilton though be before cousin have arrived from india for even percy caroline most indignant against ellen to think of father sentence with deepest regret with almost dread for effect on ellen if did know must speak be emmeline exclamation did not feel quite sure that be own happy self time be with atmosphere be frozen twenty degree below zero in room frequented though be otherwise hot summer rejoined percy in yorkshire pray joke dear percy can not bear to think of ellen going away from at much le to such guardian though know be very good answered herbert now good fellow attempt to say word for nancy seldon be only person in world ever heard acknowledge disliked so what must be worthy doubt father must not have trusted ellen to for thing else poor ellen little know to what obstinacy be condemning rejoined caroline wish did then might spare mamma too though fear even confession must not help much now mr hamilton might did think with must not swerve from duty wrote at once to miss seldon not entering into particular merely asking if must consent to take charge of relative whose conduct demanded more rigid watchfulness care entire cessation of indulgence than must be case in family circle at oakwood husband have such perfect confidence in said that if must oblige by undertaking duty knew without assurance on part that must discharge faithfully yearly sum offered be large because wished young relative to have comfort appurtenance of gentlewoman advantage of best education city near resided must afford mr hamilton have doubt of affirmative nature of reply for miss seldon owed recovery of fortune position entirely to exertion of mr hamilton have told once for if must serve oblige in way great small must make far happier than have ever be be likely to be in solitary life letter written dispatched mr hamilton summoned ellen once more to presence scene be again library where have be writing time nearing short twilight of october be three week rather more since sir edward manly letter have be received edward be therefore almost daily expected feeling with unhappy sister looked to return must be vain attempt to define at time intense longing to see again caused wild almost sick feeling of pleasure that might perhaps so soon do so then came have passed pictured anger loathing true have be for have not thought of such deed must must hate spurn too idea of meeting became absolute agony then shuddered in dread must think that must acknowledge be for have thus acted if so have not betrayed instead of saving incident after incident in childhood rose before to give hope that must be silent now a then not betray contending terror united with constant though silent suffering of banishment from loved utter hopelessness a to end of trial have not be without effect on outward frame elli did not see from so constantly watching from ellen never refusing to take exercise desired not making single complaint a to pain be sometimes to walk always to swallow meal a stood opposite to aunt in full light of oriel window approach have be so noiseless mr hamilton who be bending over paper did not see till chanced to look up attenuation of form feature be so very visible that aunt must not prevent from starting painfully word with have intended to address froze on lip be with utmost difficulty refrained from folding to heart trying by mean affection must devise to soothe remove anguish nature far too deep constant for one so very young how dared do when by determined silence ellen so defied authority seemed so resolved that severity kindness own suffering must humble spirit though have even affected frame conquering with powerful effort pleading of affection mr hamilton calmly entered on subject for have summoned reading to greater part of uncle letter hoping that severity must spare pain of additional remark word seemed to burn on ellen brain what have hoped knew not for thought have never hoped at word cause can be excusing enough to justify entire setting aside sentence seemed by agony to tell that thought have entered mind if real cause be by chance discovered must be forgiven in time restored to confidence love now be over even that hope be gone mr hamilton paused for reply observation none came continued impressively can scarcely hope ellen that a even idea of sparing only brother shame misery on return home expecting nothing joy after nearly three year separation exposure to danger have have effect in softening that uncle sentence will once must have believed that only thought of leaving going to care of stranger must have urged to speak directly can believe longer a wish to be with edward at least part of stay with will postpone leaving one month from to day if indeed edward influence be such that for sake will make full confession answer clearly distinctly question put to residence with miss seldon will be limited to three six ten twelve month according to nature of motive of incomprehensible apparently most sinful conduct if leave still obdurate year will in probability pas before can feel sufficiently confident in restored integrity openness of character to permit return to pain be inflicting upon be useless to dwell upon a child of only most dearly loved sister have loved hoped for with little le intensity of affection than have borne toward own for felt with sole exception of brother be only being have on earth united to by tie of blood how conduct repays love care must answer to can only be sensible of bitter disappointment again stopped evidently expecting reply ellen still remained silent short twilight of autumn have set in so suddenly that mr hamilton be not aware niece cheek have become still paler that white lip quivered repeatedly a if several time tried to speak must not after silence of minute said if be determined not to speak ellen may retire have told wished to say except till leave though will still occupy present room be still under elli care be at liberty to employ go about house ground a usual ellen turned to go still in unbroken silence have reached low step dividing upper part from lower part of room whether did not see from other cause room suddenly reeled before fell heavily forward to spring toward raise tenderly bear to nearest couch though so trembled at finding ellen quite insensible a to render task unusually difficult to ring hastily for elli be work of minute be many minute before united effort must bring back consciousness knew must break heart poor lamb be elli exclamation in tone of most unusual excitement thank god thank god master edward coming home that be not to go till doe have so much confidence in influence asked mistress a unable to resist impulse bent down repeatedly kissed cold brow cheek to be so earnestly striving to restore warmth god in mercy grant may be right right dear lady whenever elli be strongly moved always so addressed mistress must stake confidence in be life worth if master edward be not at bottom of that poor child be sacrificing for fancied danger to saw enough of work when be young child have noticed enough since have be under care edward repeated mr hamilton so bewildered a to stop for moment chafing ellen cold hand edward bearing high character doe what can have to do with know lady be sure have young men ay of finest bravest among get into difficulty sometimes touch character a officer see master edward be always so terrified at mere thought of master knowing of fault hush must not let know suspect thing poor lamb will make still more miserable be better now dear miss ellen be not added soothingly a ellen feebly raised hand to forehead then slowly unclosed eye beheld aunt leaning over with same expression of anxious affection illness have so often caused in childhood sense rather memory have not quite returned first word be with faint happy smile be better dear aunt much better dare say will soon be well be only momentary forgetfulness swift a thought came whole of what have so lately passed uncle letter aunt word murmuring in tone how painfully changed forgot forgive buried face in pillow ellen dear ellen why will persist in making so miserable when few word must make happier exclaimed mr hamilton almost imploringly a bent over urge now dear lady be not well enough give till master edward come be sure will not resist answered elli very respectfully though meaningly a look drew mistress attention to shudder convulsed ellen slight frame at mention of brother pained bewildered more than ever mr hamilton after waiting till faintness seemed quite gone thinking that if restraint of presence be removed ellen might be relieved by tear left desiring elli to let know in short time how be moment door closed ellen threw arm round elli neck exclaiming passionately take away take away dear elli can not bear room seems full of misery loved so once will love again when be mile mile away can not see one belonging to oh elli elli knew be too kind be too glad contented to be with be not punishment enough for sin must go away will never never see aunt again know will not oh if might die first be too wicked for that be only good that die almost for first time since sin have be discovered gave way to long violent fit of weeping though terrible while lasted a anguish of young always be greatly relieved enabled after day not to revert in word thought never left till still more fearful anxiety deadened to uncle sentence again mr hamilton sat for very long time alone after have left ellen elli word returned to again again so pertinaciously that must not break from edward cause of must be possible must be that have plunged into difficulty afraid to appeal to uncle have so worked on ellen a not only to make send relief actually so to keep secret a to endure thing rather than betray circumstance after circumstance thought after thought so congregated upon so seemed to burst into being flash light one from other that mind ached beneath pressure ellen unhappiness day last letter have be received sudden illness have taken place before after robert have lost money must not satisfy herself for husband sudden summons to feroe hasty preparation departure have rendered month confused unsatisfactory in recollection so intense be relief of idea mr hamilton feared to encourage lest must prove mere fancy urge softer feeling toward niece than ought to be even supposition made heart yearn toward with such feeling of love almost of veneration for determined self devotion so essentially woman characteristic that resolutely checked ascendency previous fancy that ellen be ordinary child early suffering neglect have while produced childish fault matured deepened capability of endurance control from consciousness rather existence for be not consciousness to child herself of strong feeling returned to a if determined to confirm elli supposition disappearance of allowance assertion that be seeking mr langford cottage by shorter forbidden path to try get to dispose of trinket when wind blew note to hand now seemed connected one with other confirmed must well understand how in moment of almost madness might have be used without thought after effect upon so delicate mind conscience then in contradiction to mere hypothesis raised on nothing firmer than elli supposition came constantly favorable account of edward captain pride confidence in seeming impossibility that must get into such difficulty be name of harding rushed on mind knew not why how made tremble by probable explanation of whole coarse even le refined mind must have appealed at once to ellen a to truth of suspicion thought justified in looking over edward letter to sister a thus to discover truth in mr hamilton pure mind idea never even entered though niece paper letter be in actual possession must only feel to heart core with elli thank god master edward coming home pray earnestly that might be with a hoped anticipated in few very few day chapter vii light glimmer earnest wish prayer of mr hamilton faithful elli be disappointed latter part of month of september have be exceedingly stormy though there be lull from about d to th of october equinoctial gale then set in with utmost fury continuing day after day night after night till ear seemed almost to tire of sound mind anxious for friend at sea despair of cessation during few calm day young party at oakwood have scarcely be absent from window from part of park leading to plymouth road above hour at time percy herbert rode over to plymouth be told frigate must not be in for full week late storm must have detained though be fast sailing craft be great disappointment to for on th of october college term began be compelled to return to oxford cause of mother intense desire for edward return indeed did not know be most impatient to see hoped did not exactly know what with regard to influence with ellen however day of departure came still have not arrived storm have recommenced percy have gone to say good by to elli with whom ellen chanced at moment to be full of spirit joke determinately looked away from cousin took elli hand shook with usual heartiness good by dear elli wonder if will ever feel man when talking to how many trick have played in room be always so good natured even when one of seat cracker set best gown on fire quite spoiled do remember do think be nearly angry then quite enough to make papa made save up money to buy new dress did not play such practical joke in hurry again elli laughed perfectly remembered with hearty good by turned away have forgotten cousin mr percy said disregarding ellen imploring look when remembers duty to mother will remember that be cousin be hasty answer hurried from room a herbert entered good by to elli be quite a warm a percy then turning to ellen put arm round kissed cheek said with impressive earnestness god bless dear ellen hope will be happier when meet again that will not be so long before do a fancy now affected almost to tear at grateful humble look raised to left overcome a much by harshness of generous warm hearted percy whom so dearly loved a by gentle kindness of herbert ellen remained for several minute with arm on table face hid upon thought be quite alone for elli have gone about of business when be startled by percy voice be brute ellen nothing le forgive say good by ca understand at angry a be with pale face haunt like specter so must part friend a looked hastily up kissed warmly twice ran away without word day passed heavily gale seeming to increase in violence causing mr hamilton more terrible anxiety vague dread than allowed to be visible damage among shipping be fearful very supposed vicinity of frigate to channel increased danger paper morning presented long list of ship wrecked fatally dismantled loss of crew part of mail cargo due missing vivid recollection of supposed fate of own brother wretchedness of suspense before fate of vessel be ascertained returned to heighten fear must gain ascendency for nephew for effect of terrible suspense on more especially if indeed have endured week nay month of misery for at first ellen seemed unconscious that there be thing remarkable in delay thought of own departure being uppermost when thought did press upon how came knew not that of given month week be passing edward have not arrived that there must be reason for long delay storm shipwreck death flashed upon at once almost maddened quiet calm of endurance gave way must not sleep at night from tremendous wind not even when elli have bed put up in room remained with night never complained indeed hour after hour must pace room passage leading to elli till compelled to cease from exhaustion must try steadily to employ with difficult study succeed perhaps for hour then remain powerless recommence restless walk mr hamilton made several attempt without apparent interference on part to get to sit occasionally with miss harcourt cousin seemed to shrink from emmeline indeed when once aware of terrible trial be enduring must sit with drawing working a if nothing have occurred to estrange try to cheer by talking on many topic of interest caroline must speak to kindly whenever saw miss harcourt alone retained indignation for suspicion of real cause of silence ever entered mind poor ellen felt that dared not indulge in comfort change in aunt cousin manner produced wanted to wean quite from that pang of separation might be le severe only seemed to succeed in loving more one thought indeed at length took such entire possession of mind a to deaden other be horrible idea that a have sinned to save edward perhaps from merited disgrace must be taken from never breathed haunted night day mr maitland saw continually plainly told mr hamilton while cause of anxiety mental suffering lasted must do good be constant alternation of fearful excitement complete depression exhausting whole system repose kindness ala latter might be given former in present position of affair how must be insured month of grace be waning only two day remained edward have not arrived how must mr hamilton obey husband whose letter reiterated hope that have not be prevailed on to alter sentence if ellen still remained silent send niece from came at length to determination that if week passed still there be tidings not to let fearful self sacrifice if really be such last longer gently cautiously tenderly a must prevail on ellen to confide to promise if edward really have be erring in difficulty must be forgiven for sake even uncle anger averted once determination taken felt better enabled to endure anxiety be injuring almost a much a ellen turned to elli room have lately very often frequented for scarcely felt comfortable when ellen be out of sight though have full confidence in elli care ellen be asleep on sofa looking so wan so haggard so altered from ellen of five short month back that mr hamilton sat down by side pondering whether be doing right to wait even week before must try to bring relief by avowing suspicion must bring relief after be for edward have be allowing affection imagination to mislead soften when sternness might still be needed ellen woke with start a from fearful dream gazed at mr hamilton for full minute a if did not know dear ellen what be have be sleeping uncomfortably surely know thought be at at seldon grange be sure be not dear aunt emmeline do tell be at oakwood know be to go very soon be not there now be put one hand to forehead gazed hurriedly fearfully round while with other held tightly mr hamilton dress there be something alarming in look tone love be with still at oakwood will not go from till have be with edward little time can not think must send away now ellen soothing tone brother name seemed to disperse cloud bursting into tear exclaimed will never come know will never come sin have killed sin ellen what can have to do with edward because word be for be actually on lip be checked in increasing excitement continued nothing nothing indeed with must have if know oh will so grieve perhaps must be better must go before come then then need not know if indeed ever come think quite know what be saying dear ellen uncomfortable dream have unsettled try keep quiet for hour will be better remember suffering a dreadful suspense be brother be still in father gracious keeping that will listen to prayer for safety if be good pleasure still restore to prayer answered ellen fearfully mr howard said there be barrier between while must not confess have refused mercy can confess before god ellen can lay whole heart open before ask in infinite mercy for saviour sake to forgive must did do so answered ellen returning mr hamilton earnestly inquiring look by raising large expressive eye steadily fearlessly to face mr howard told be mockery sin to suppose god must hear forgive while refused to obey by being silent obdurate to that if wished forgiveness must prove by telling whole to whom commandment desired to obey a dared not do have be afraid to pray shudder with laid head again upon pillow betrayed misery of fear be impossible quite impossible that can confide source of grief difficulty to ellen will not do so even if promise forgiveness not merely to to who may have erred answer sweet child silence be fearfully injuring mind body why do fancy dare not tell because because have promised answered ellen in fearful tone of returning excitement sitting upright clasped hand convulsively together while cheek burned with painful brilliancy aunt emmeline oh pray speak to in kind tone be harsh cold again can bear better if did know how heart brain ache how long to tell so rest can not dare not have promised may not tell whom have promised replied mr hamilton former thought rendered apparently null vain by word painfully disappointing answer terrified mamma promised stand by so pale so grieved whenever think of telling answered ellen clinging to mr hamilton looking with strained gaze of terror on vacancy thought must have told when said be to go to go to seldon grange stood by laid hand on head be so cold so heavy remember thing more till found elli leaning over ought not to tell even know ought not for look look aunt emmeline see mamma there quite close to oh tell to forgive will keep promise shuddering convulsively hid face in aunt dress mr hamilton be dreadfully alarmed whatever foundation have doubt that there be that really have to do with edward poor mother mistaken partiality ellen imagination be evidently disordered to attempt obtaining truth while be in fearful state of excitement be a impossible a cruel tried only to soothe to composure speaking of mother a happy in heaven that ellen have thought of so much a be quite natural in sorrow that fancied saw be not reality love if must see speak to be sure must be to tell to confide sorrow to if must make happier oh must be very wicked if made happier ought not even to

sinner repenteth than over ninety nine who have not sinned if father in heaven can so feel so act be creature to do le do think because have given pain trouble disappointment compelled to use such extreme severity cause so much suffering that will be quite impossible for to love again if see do can to win back love ellen made answer alarming excitement have so far subsided a to raise hope that quietness must subdue altogether mr hamilton remained with till seemed quite calm must not have left then have promised caroline to drive with into t afternoon to make purchase emmeline miss harcourt be spending day at greville manor daughter depending on did not like to disappoint difficulty to think of other thing cheerfully converse on comparatively indifferent topic be greater than have ever found that elli surmise be correct have longer smallest doubt ellen be sacrificing not merely for love bore brother from real imaginary promise to poor mother what exact nature be must not indeed satisfy that have something to do with concealing edward fault seemed to flash upon hardly knew how elli word that have seen enough of work when be child returned to various incongruity in ellen character conduct have be unable to reconcile at time seemed connected with to arrive at truth be much more difficult than ever still how must send ellen away yet if still silent must mere surmise satisfy husband there be one hope one ray of light edward own honor if indeed be permitted to return even while driving talking with caroline heart be one fervent prayer that might be fearful struggle of devoted ellen cease aunt gentle unexpected kindness have have beneficial effect on ellen that after early dinner about three o'clock told elli must go in school room try read there for hour knew family be out therefore must be quite undisturbed elli willingly acquiesced rejoicing that must seek change advised a be such mild soft afternoon after late storm to take turn on terrace on glass door

have utterly forgotten desperate word have written have never received intended relief till within week short week of return have be in harding power a ellen devotion have saved nothing what must weigh against maddening conviction that if have one spark of honor remaining must confess that have caused sin instead of saving have betrayed left aunt to seek ellen so evidently disturbed heated interview have be so little satisfactory in softening a have hoped to win to confession at once for have purposely spoken a indulgently of error difficulty a must without betraying strengthened suspicion that if have known how to do so must have forbidden seeing ellen till be more calm unhappily too be that part of day when elli be always most engaged be not even in own room so that there be check on edward violence control have exercised while with aunt increased passion when be removed poured forth bitterest reproach asked how must dare hope relief so obtained must ever have be allowed to reach what have done betrayed for how must be such dishonored coward a to let leave oakwood because must not speak why have not spoken why not betrayed at once not decoyed home to disgrace misery

one spot longing that chance must bring mr howard to that might relieve fearful remorse at once utterly unable to seek of edward disposition like mother be naturally much too good for determined pursuit of evil error have actually be much le grave than from harding artful representation imagined never indulged in passion without being followed by most agonized remorse from having pertinaciously banished religion aunt have so tried to instill be taught by harding to scoff at only safe guide for youth a for age god holy word have nothing whereon to lean either a comfort in remorse hope for amendment strength for self conquest terrible indeed might have be consequence of harding fatal influence if influence of home of love have not be still stronger two hour after have quitted aunt rejoined family tranquil bearing such evident trace of mental struggle at least so mr hamilton fancied for one else noticed that still hoped did not exactly know what for failed in courage to ask issue of interview with ellen contented with desiring emmeline to tell cousin to bring work drawing join be so surprised when emmeline brought back word that ellen have said have much rather not that sought ellen cheek in general so pale be crimson eye in consequence unnaturally brilliant looked altogether so unlike herself that aunt be more anxious than ever did manner when asked why refused to join when edward have so lately returned tend to decrease feeling emmeline did not say desired must have known better than disobey be reply be scarcely disrespectful tone seemed that of spirit crushed goaded to utmost so utterly unable to contend more though nerve be quivering with pain mr hamilton felt bitter pain that ellen at length did indeed shrink from that disregard of entreaty concerning brother appeared so to have wounded that have shaken affection other suffering have have power to move desire ellen though wish replied mildly be of course at liberty to act a please though must have thought most natural that not having be with edward so long must wish to be with a much a possible now be at home will not wish hate spurns a knew must if knew sin to day be to

under circumstance must have expressed desire to leave suppose that must make particularly happy to send away why must not must hate too must not have refused only only favor asked before went answered poor ellen voice have be unnaturally clear be choked for moment with sob resolutely forced back mr hamilton must scarcely bear taking ice cold hand in hers said almost tenderly have reason to condemn a harsh cruel ellen time will perhaps explain motif of conduct a trust pray will solve mystery of yours be not well enough to be left long alone elli be so much engaged to day do wish to be with independent of brother society if so much prefer remaining here will stay with though of course a edward have be away from so long must wish to be with also be almost first time mr hamilton have ever have recourse in management of family to thing be not perfectly straightforward though present motif must have hallowed much deeper stratagem pure mind shrunk from own word wished ellen to be constantly in edward presence that might not be able to evade impulse of feeling honor sight of such suffering thought must call forth must not bear to enforce wish a command when have already be a felt if ellen silence be indeed self devotion not guilt so cruelly so unnecessarily severe ellen made reply resistance taking up work accompanied aunt to usual morning room from many burst of happy laughter joyous tone be echoing caroline emmeline be so full of enjoyment at edward return have so many thing to ask tell be so perfectly unsuspicious a to having concern with sister fault that if did once twice think le lively joyous than when left home attributed simply to not having yet recovered exhausting voyage wound miss harcourt just a unsuspicious secretly accused ellen a cause of occasional abstraction conduct be not likely to pas unfelt by one so upright so honorable if have be harsh with a from ellen fearfully shrinking manner complete silence when be together fancied thought be so deserved that have pity for whatever day passed briskly happily enough in seeming to mr hamilton edward in reality to other member of party one great subject of regret be mr howard absence might be back at rectory that evening emmeline be sure must come to see edward directly a hour waned ellen became sensible of sharp most unusual pain darting through temple gradually extending

fancy thought there be trace of cowardly blow on pale forehead raised black such feeling of agony remorse rushed over that be with difficulty restrained from catching in arm beseeching forgiveness before there be time then proceeded to library step ellen took appeared to bring back fearful pain till a sat down then knelt in place be sensible of nothing else service be over a mr hamilton rose from private prayer with individual concluded devotion nephew stood before white a marble with expression of fixed resolution made heart bound up with hope at very moment turned sick faint with terror

scarcely strength to move address edward must not though felt far more pity toward than anger looked toward ellen who still remained kneeling though elli stood close by evidently trying to rouse with step far more hurried more agitated than child household have ever seen traversed long room stood beside niece ellen said a tried to remove hand clasped burning forehead a if rooted pressure must

be much in sad tale have heard to give hope mr howard longed to impart comfort to mr hamilton felt must not listen while day after day passed poor sufferer for error lay hovering between life death reason so utterly suspended that even when violent agony of first seven day night have subsided into lethargic stupor alternating with such quiet submission gentle word have not be for wandering sense one might have fancied intellect returning still reason be absent though none said aloud fear must gain dominion that health might return not mind first advice have be procured what be distance even

conscious herself that sole feeling toward be pity not anger looking to herself alone a cause of poor child suffering did not think for moment that must imagine never referring to confession originated in displeasure ten twelve day have so passed when one afternoon completely exhausted with two night watchfulness for though nurse langford fanny be in constant attendance on ellen must not rest if heard that harrowing cry for even though presence brought comfort went to lie down for few hour on couch in dressing room caroline have taken book though with not much inclination to read to sit by watch that sleep must not be disturbed how in moment of quiet did long for father feeling intuitively how much heavier be mother trial without loved support have be written to by since edward

must give way be powerless at once husband knew so well that suppression of individual emotion betrayed more forcibly than most earnest word be enduring caroline have kept affectionate vigil nearly two hour when edward voice whispered miss harcourt want dear caroline let take place will be quite a watchful a only let stay here know comfort will be to resist look of pleading wretchedness be impossible left edward drawing low stool to foot of couch a if not daring to occupy cousin seat be close by pillow gazed on mild gentle feature of aunt a in deep repose showed still clearer trace of anxiety sorrow felt more keenly than ever full amount of misery error fatal concealment have created why be thought that man can not bear punishment of fault without causing innocent good to suffer

if such be feeling what be edward mr hamilton former be kneeling on right of bed eye alternately fixed on sister buried in coverlid mr hamilton be on opposite side close to ellen pillow curtain drawn so far back that least change on patient countenance be discernible hour after hour have so passed chime told flight be scarcely heard by anxious watcher be about eight o'clock when slight movement in

vain to say something felt so choked must not ellen held hand looked earnestly searchingly in face a if trying painfully to define vague thought memory seemed connected with with pain must not take distinct form eye wandered from for moment to nurse langford who have come to foot of bed seemed face connected with blank past then fixed again on edward pale face so worked with effort of thought mr hamilton became alarmed saw too that edward be growing paler paler trembled for continuance of control taking ellen hand gently from arranging pillow at same time so a to turn face rather from said playfully have looked at edward long enough ellen to be quite sure be safe at home so now will be jealous if give more of attention neglect must take nourishment try to go to sleep again for must not

hamilton firmly though fondly a hastily signed to edward to leave room most thankfully did never stopping till reached own tried to thank god for great mercy must only sob told not to think because to do so might retard return of strength indeed must try obey know be very peremptory sometimes fond kiss with enforced command seemed to satisfy ellen whose natural submissiveness combined with excessive physical weakness caused to obey at once not attempt to think more took required nourishment with returning appetite soon afterward fell quietly happily to sleep again aunt hand closely clasped in hers from day fear of disordered intellect departed gradually extreme exhaustion gave way before mr maitland judicious treatment strength indeed returned so slowly almost imperceptibly that be necessary to count improvement by week not day when six week after first seizure be thought well enough to be carried to mr hamilton dressing room laid on couch there be source of gratitude rejoicing to mr maitland mr hamilton soon saw with intense anxiety that with physical strength memory thought have fully returned that consequence be depression so deep a effectually to retard perfect recovery seemed to shrink from attention kindness a utterly undeserved even from cousin must look at edward for hour together with expression of suffering that made heart actually ache at time must receive mr hamilton caressing judicious tenderness a if be only comfort at others shrink from a if have right to will never do mr maitland said about ten day after ellen removal into daily quarter

be powerless though quite agreed with how to approach very painful subject required little consideration a be very often case chance doe that on have expended so much thought one afternoon ellen lay so still so pale on couch that mr hamilton bent over to listen if breathed saying a did so almost unconsciously poor ellen when will have comfort of seeing well happy again ellen hastily unclosed eye for be not asleep have be only stupor of painfully engrossing thought rendering insensible to outward thing aunt voice aroused seemed inexpressible relief to feel be quite alone trying to rise clasping hand said in tone of strong excitement oh aunt emmeline how can be happy how can be well when think think that if have not be for sin misery brought on edward might be safe still one need have known error tried to save have only betrayed made wretched suffered be for nothing worse than nothing thank god have spoken dear child felt a if dared not introduce subject now that have think will be able if indeed will listen to patiently ellen to disperse painful mist be still pressing so heavily on poor little heart brain said fondly though seriously a put arm round ellen to support a sat up tell be not natural feeling love be wrong one have sin in consideration of being a be now convinced be wholly involuntary for in fearful state of mind edward desperate letter occasioned must

poisoned happiness forever when recall agony almost madness felt while burdened with consciousness of such act how must have borne if have continued through month perhaps year shudder yet must have be case edward must have persisted in error if sin have be permitted to succeed detection suffering thence springing terrible a have be to poor child have saved will trust only bring securer happiness to saved repeated ellen half starting up scarcely hearing last word saved edward yes dearest by leading to full confession giving not only inexpressible comfort of such proceeding permitting to see great disappointing a error be can be conquered be not of irremediable guilt confirming nature that be taught to suppose for harding own most guilty end so giving hope resolution to amend belief that amendment be impossible entirely frustrates fear for edward own love will give a much pride comfort a have anxiety grief under god mercy will have be cause be hard lesson to learn yet ellen think one day when can look back more calmly on last few month will acknowledge with great a suffering have be be sent in love to to if have saved saved from continuance in error so made happy oh aunt emmeline can think so now will try to bear rest why added growing more excited oh why have be so good so kind why did not continue cold distant must bear better then bear what love what have more to bear tell without reserve why must be cold when deserve love kindness because because be not to go to seldon grange a soon a be strong enough uncle hamilton said there must be excusing cause demanding complete avoidance of sentence thought be pain enough when first told now now time think about seems a if must not bear be not called upon to bear dear child be possible must think for moment must send away from when have borne so much be treated with far too much severity already did not tell that term of banishment depended entirely on motive of silence do think there be excuse in motive ellen mistaken a be be self devotion to be of more account to than seemed to come smile dearest promise in uncle name own will never leave unless be of own free will pleasure few year hence ellen did try to smile be too weak to bear complete removal of double burden without emotion seemed more like pain than joy laid head on aunt shoulder wept without restraint be first tear have shed since illness mr hamilton thanked god for did not attempt to check few word did speak told such affectionate sympathy such perfect comprehension of young heart ellen felt a if mountain of lead be dissolving from now ellen have relieved of painful dread will ease mind of great anxiety inquired mr hamilton nearly hour afterward when ellen seemed so relieved calmed that must talk to without fear look surprised be subject alone can explain till be solved will never feel that happiness be secure what be promise to in illness so constantly referred fear have strengthened in system of self sacrifice for edward sake in addition to love for deep flush rose to ellen transparent cheek brow a answered falteringly ought to tell dear aunt know how often how very often have longed to ask if to keep made do wrong whether ought to break yet seemed so sacred gave poor mamma such comfort when did make love import need not ask for betrayed when knew not what said be confirmed by whole conduct to shield edward from blame punishment by never revealing fault be wrong murmured ellen hiding conscious face wrong in dearest for be too young to know pain evil be likely to bring tell when how be taken think can prove to that poor mother must have recalled have have least idea of solemn hold have taken upon thus encouraged ellen narrated scene have taken place in widow morgan cottage just before mr hamilton arrived mother fear for edward dread of mr hamilton be very evident now more than ever have extended to child said that mr myrvin assurance that mother must see must love in heaven directly following promise have given still more weight solemnity at first thought must be very easy to keep because loved edward so dearly have not be long at oakwood before made very unhappy from constant interference with prevention of obedience duty to aunt that have often caused violent head ache only from vain attempt to satisfy a to ought to do when edward first went to sea seemed so right happy with of course became happier than have ever be before then came difficulty conviction that must save keep secret that reason affection often urged to confide to aunt certain that must not harshly condemn edward must forgive help far more effectually than must dared not for whenever thought thus figure of mother rose before seeming to reproach threaten for exposing child so dearly loved to disgrace ruin be so vivid so constant during last appeal that thought must be going mad that nothing dread of not being firm enough to keep edward secret have withheld from confessing sin at once to aunt especially when uncle have so solemnly denounced a theft that when be discovered seemed actual relief though brought such severe punishment for knew suffering for must be too severe tale a ellen told be brief simple enough that there be merit in system of self devotion never seemed to enter mind for moment to mr hamilton revealed amount of suffering trial such quiet systematic heroic endurance that unconsciously drew that young delicate being closer closer to a if love must protect in future from such trial from what have sprung misery of year at period when life must be so joyous so free that care sorrow flee a purely too briefly happy to approach from few thoughtless word from thoughtless partial mother whose neglect dislike have pronounced that disposition cold unloving inanimate whose nature be so fervid so imaginative that utmost care must have be taken to prevent entrance of single thought feeling too precocious too solemn for year may be urged with truth that to ordinary child promise might have be forgotten heedlessly laid aside without harm accruing from be from not caring to know real character of little being for whose happiness virtue be responsible that whole mischief sprung be neglect of maternal duty against must so earnestly warn who may not have thought about be not enough to educate mind to provide bodily necessary to be indulgent in gift of pleasure amusement heart must be won taught to do so with hope of success character must be transparent a day what difficulty what hinderance can there ought there to be in obtaining important knowledge to mother from whose breast babe

care how easy task to learn opening disposition natural character so a to guide with gentleness love create happiness not for childhood alone though be much for youth maturity thought passed though mr hamilton mind a listened to niece looked at pale sweet face lifted up to hers in earnestness of simple tale a if unconsciously appealing for protection against bewildering contending feeling of own young heart how be effectually to remove impression of year indeed knew not heart seemed to pray for guidance peace might at length be ellen portion even a heard must scarcely have acted otherwise than have always done toward edward dear ellen under influence of promise said extreme youth naturally enough must not permit to distinguish whether be called for by mere impulse of feeling in poor mother really intended tell do think must give comfort happiness if must see emmeline act by percy a have done by edward to see suffer pain sorrow be led into error too sometimes to conceal percy fault prevent removal when by infliction of trifling pain must save exposing to greater seems so different with cousin aunt be such equal can not fancy emmeline in place have always loved alike do not think mother ought to do to dearest how can if be not equally deserving be so different to edward be so handsome good so animated happy be always fretful ill said so often naughty used to fondle poor mamma show love be afraid to do though did love so very much tear started to eye so must not help feeling must be much better than be just a always feel cousin be so be wonder poor mamma loved so much best have ever made difference between edward ellen asked mr hamilton conquering with small effort emotion called forth by ellen simple word oh clung to in almost painful emotion be so good so kind to body must love be kind to a poor papa be because nobody else must dear ellen what can do to remove mistaken impression love father loved because have quality claiming love quite a powerfully a brother must not imagine because may be le personally mentally favored that be inferior to either in sight of heavenly father of friend guardian have given even if such be case be a undeserving a so wrongly imagine duty a of mother must be just same parent doe not love guide child according to individual merit dear ellen according to fountain of love to enable to do duty god have so mercifully placed in heart therefore who have least attraction most fault demand greater cherishing to supply place of one more careful guiding to overcome other do quite understand love ellen earnest face on joy hope seemed struggling with doubt be sufficient answer mother think of solemn responsibility in same light many cause sad recollection reproach for early life separation in coldness from father might have tended to weaken mother consciousness of duty so without fault in ellen have occasioned too great partiality for edward do remember last word ellen did remember acknowledged have so increased affection for mother a to render promise still more sacred to feared so dearest be just contrary effect must have have when called to blessed kissed a fondly a did edward said have done injustice have failed in duty to so grieved for be too late to atone for then must only pray to god to raise up kinder parent have tried to be that for sake a well a own will not acknowledge that if have be spared to love know affection for must no more have borne to see suffer a have done for edward than must emmeline for percy do not think when have learned to feel a do have already begun to do that must have recalled that fatal promise entreated not to act upon have ever done to make to painfully suffer lead often into error confirm by concealment edward fault ellen tear be falling fast freely be hardly tear of pain aunt word seemed to disperse thick mist from brain heart for first time to satisfy that might dismiss painful memory of promise dismiss without blame disobedience to mother mr hamilton have begun conversation in trembling for seemed so difficult to accomplish object without undue condemnation of sister a ellen clasping arm about neck tried to thank again again for taking such heavy load from heart saying that must still help edward just same must try to guard from doing wrong that mother must love still felt have succeeded silently how fervently thanked god will tell one thing aunt emmeline why if promise be mistaken poor mamma must have wished recalled did always seem to see so distinctly fancy so desired to save edward from uncle displeasure because have very strong imagination love increased by dwelling on subject in last trial mind be in such fearful unnatural state of excitement that imagination became actually diseased be not at surprising for much older stronger wiser person must have experienced same under same pressure of grief terror remorse what can do to cure morbid imagination ellen continued playfully sentence a soon a get well to course of mathematics six hour day be afraid poor head will be more stupid at figure than ever replied ellen trying to smile too then suppose must think of something else will follow emmeline example tell thing however foolish unfounded may seem come into little head whether worry plea have nothing will have nothing ever again trust to conceal from dear ellen if will do will give more comfort individually more security for furtherance of happiness a far a love can promote than other plan playfulness have given place to renewed earnestness ellen a if in very thought of such perfect confidence dwelt security peace so long unknown to gave required assurance so eagerly gratefully that mr hamilton be satisfied happy chapter xi loss of siren from day ellen recovery though sad trial of patience to young invalid affectionate nurse be surely progressive without of painful relapse have so tried mr maitland skill before no longer shrunk from society of relation receiving caroline miss harcourt many kind attention with surprise indeed for must not imagine what must so have altered feeling toward with evident gratitude pleasure encourages continuance of kindness emmeline be always kind be indeed happiness to feel might talk with share amusement a in former day instead of thinking ought not to receive aunt affection only thing asked in return be full confidence inexpressible rest to poor ellen conversation gave be not to be described be so blessed so soothing that seemed too unnatural to last secret dread that uncle must not feel toward edward a aunt did be only alloy edward too be cheerful almost happy when with long conversation with mr howard worthy man insisted upon having a soon a be strong enough to remove false impression severity have given never ceased to grieve reproach caused almost daily visit to be anticipated by with a much gladness a have before brought dread now that anxiety for ellen be at end must have take more care of mr hamilton husband last injunction be must never pas week without calling once twice at oakwood to know how be going on what must say to if must see now little thought how strength must be tried good friend so will quite acquit assure that physically be perfectly well worthy doctor shook head most unbelievingly even with one great anxiety calmed there remains week increase be more than double usual time of hearing from husband have never have answer to letter detailing ellen danger edward return answer have be due full month weather have be so unusually tempestuous may have be impossible for siren to ply to fro from feroe to scotland a hamilton wished ship be likely to touch at island in winter really think need not be anxious on score none arthur hamilton head must have contrived hearing a regularly from such outlandish place a have done news be good news depend upon may be anxious on account returning god forbid answered mr hamilton turning very pale better anxiety of not hearing from than thought of being at sea in season oakwood have resumed regular happy aspect though ellen be still up stair morris elli have once more happiness of beloved mistress superintendence proud be a if caroline have be own child to show have done so unostentatiously to save mother trouble when have be too anxious to think of thing ellen mother heart swelled with delicious feeling of gratitude to who if in making so acutely sensible of solemn responsibility have deepened extended anxiety have yet in same measure heightened spiritualized joy fruit be indeed worth nurture though might have be often washed with tear intensely anxious a felt a did also mr howard mr maitland in fact arthur hamilton friend yet tried to sustain spirit of child for young men have evidently grown anxious on subject too be not unlikely that sea round feroe always stormy must prevent ship leaving island young people eagerly grasped idea so painful be to youth to realize cause for anxiety even at time grew unconsciously sad meditating a usually joyous season of christmas new year passed still there be letter ellen edward in secret dreaded arrival of answer to latter confession still affection for mr hamilton be too powerful to permit thought of self interfering with wish that anxiety might be calmed in january weather changed tremendous wind gave place to almost unnatural calm to such excessive mildness closeness of atmosphere that affected health of many who be strong not only made ellen very languid frequently recalled dreadful headache be in illness business called mr howard to dartmouth near end of month prevailed on edward to accompany for whenever sister be more than usually suffering gloom redoubled first few day be so fine that change renovated mr howard declared be sight of old ocean edward did not deny for though be good for permanence of repentance resolution to amend to have influence of home sufficiently long spirit inwardly chafed at detention yearned to be at sea again giving proof of determination to become indeed british sailor third day of visit lull heaviness of air increased so strangely closely for january a to seem almost portentous edward mr howard lingered on beach well practiced eye of former tracing in many little thing unseen to landsman slow sure approach of fearful storm be strange for season there be certainly electricity in air said directing mr howard attention to ridge of white fringed cloud floating under heaven whose murky hue be becoming denser denser ever anon a lashed by a yet silent invisible blast ocean heaved foamed gave sure evidence of approaching fury there will be fear terrible storm to night look at bird several sea gull be skimming along wave almost bathing white plumage in blackened water strange how always herald tempest emmeline must call spirit of blast reveling in destruction foretells be approaching already rejoined mr howard a long hollow blast moaned shivered round followed by roar of mountainous wave bursting on beach god have mercy on exposed to fury gladly turned more inland while edward remained watching progress with almost pleasurable feeling of excitement only wishing must be on sea to enjoy a such storm deserved to be a day drew to close increased a darkness set in fury became appalling blast long loud a reverberation of artillery succeeded one with awful rapidity tearing up huge tree by root tile from roof now then at distant interval blue lightning played through black heaven betraying that thunder have mingled with wind though be impossible to distinguish one sound from other a gust passed onward streak of white spot of strange unnatural blue gleamed through gloom for moment space leaving deeper darkness a disappeared ocean lashed to wildest fury rolled in huge mountain of troubled water throwing up shower of snowy foam contrasting strangely with darkness of earth heaven bursting with sound deadened for time even wild roar of blast to read even to converse in comfortable quarter in hotel overlooked sea became a impossible to mr howard a to edward about eleven o'clock however wind suddenly veered lulled only sending forth now then long sobbing wail a if regretful that work of destruction be even checked sea raged with equal fury presenting spectacle a magnificent a awful giving appearance of calm sharp report sounded suddenly from sea whether be first that others might have be lost in tumult of wind wave who might answer at such rapid interval that danger be evidently imminent edward started to foot again must bear no longer hurriedly exclaiming be signal of distress close at hand something must be done sailor can sit still see sailor perish rushed to beach closely followed by mr howard who be resolved on preventing mad attempt crowd of fisherman townsman have congregated on beach drawn by fearful sound by light from gun seemed scarcely mile distant yet so perilous be present appearance of ocean to go to assistance seemed impossible suddenly however edward voice exclaimed with glad eager tone of perfect confidence can be saved strong boat two willing rower will undertake to reach vessel bring crew safe to shore who among continued turning eagerly to group of hardy fisherman will be assistant in act of common humanity who posse willing heart able hand will lend one who care for life be sullen answer from one of addressed rest stood silent eyeing half disdainfully half admiringly slight figure of young sailor revealed a be in fitful light of many torch scattered by various group along beach be well for boy to talk can not expect old head on young shoulder not boat with consent leaf harbor to night must be willful murder tell will stake life on venture answered edward passion rising high be speaking to sailor can hesitate when hear such sound give boat will go by when need aid may find to give will scarce dare ask if vessel perish before eye lend boat say fitted for such sea lender will be rewarded handsomely if there be such risk ask none to share life be own will peril must have made fine scene for painter young slight form boyish face surrounded by weather beaten men countenance expressing different emotion yet almost unwilling admiration torch glare so lurid on pitchy darkness sheet of foam rising falling like shower of dazzling snow craggy background out at sea unfortunate vessel perfect wreck struggling still with fast rising water mr howard saw with thought of picturesque mind be far otherwise engaged by neptune honor will not go alone have parent sister wife to pipe for if go so life must be of le moment than yours if can so peril why must not exclaimed stalwart young fisherman advancing edward eagerly grasped rough hand conjuring to get boat at once there be not moment to lose example be infectious old man hastily stepped forward declaring youngster have taught duty must do great god what do say exclaimed edward a younger companion hastened down beach to bring boat to leeward of cliff to launch more securely rumor ran through crowd whence arising be impossible to discover siren captain harvey uncle ship must be in must never leave feroe without what foundation be there for rumor let know for god sake none must tell more than that vessel entering harbor just before gale have hailed siren about twenty mile distant seemed laboring heavily in such distressed state that very little must finish not word escaped edward lip grew for moment blanched a marble mr howard to whom rumor have brought most intense agony for not doubt of truth must come to relieve be at side grasping hand murmuring hoarsely edward poor boy must life be periled too be awful let save if perish will be in good cause tell aunt emmeline know will comfort poor ellen that boy have saved from worse misery than death did must to save husband if fail stopped in strong emotion then added give ellen cut off lock of hair with dirk placed watch in mr howard trembling hand now friend god bless reward too threw moment in mr howard arm kissed cheek darting down beach leaped into boat be dancing like nutshell on water be several minute ere must succeed in getting off wave seeming determined to cast back be fairly launched at length then heeded not that one minute rode high on mountain wave seeming a if nothing must save from being dashed in abyss below next be buried in deep valley surrounded by huge wall of water threatening to burst overwhelm for boat to live in such sea at seemed miraculous old collins always declared that unless angel sat at helm with edward human arm must have taken in safety if be angel be pure thought faith winged prayer that might be instrument in eternal hand of turning aside death misery from beloved home in even error have be met with love conquered by forgiveness with effort be such a to bid perspiration stream down face arm of strong men almost exhaust edward for took oar in turn be full hour from leaving shore before reached ship have ceased firing for by light on shore have discovered boat departure watched progress by lantern at head a only can watch who feel one short hour more ship will float no longer collins be spokesman for edward a grappled boat alongside have sunk down for moment powerless by helm roused however effectually by answer siren bound to dartmouth from feroe owner arthur hamilton passenger now on board nine in crew in with then be captain harvey voice will be sworn rumor be only too true ay old collins returned captain thought to perish in sight of own home now mr hamilton not man will stir till be safe companion leaped into boat without reply sinking on one of bench drew cloak closely round face peril be indeed still around compared with even to heaven directed heart terrible struggle of beholding death rising slowly surely round in water filling ship almost within sight sound of home beloved one mere hope of life seemed almost overpowering crew of hapless siren quickly deserted captain harvey be last to descend a did so block of iron loosened from place fell cornerwise struck sharply on edward forehead almost stunning for moment a watched captain descent felt blood slowly trickling down temple cheek be not one to be daunted by pain resumed station at helm in unbroken silence only speaking when direction be absolutely necessary then only in few brief sailor term have scarcely proceeded third of way when water boiled foamed a tossed by strange whirlpool required edward address skill a steersman to prevent frail boat from being drawn into vortex cause be soon displayed heart shuddered for ten minute later help must indeed have be in vain unfortunate vessel have sunk be swallowed up in rushing water suction of so large mass producing for brief interval effect of whirlpool silence of awe of intense thankfulness fell on heart of man more than on who have so far recovered first emotion a to gaze wonderingly admiringly on boyish figure at helm whose voice be utterly unknown whose feature fitful light youth steadfast gaze on rower prevented tracing with certainty crowd have increased on shore watching with intense eagerness return of boat expectation be too deep for sound silence almost portentous reigned huge sea have concealed for several minute mr howard who during two long hour have remained spell bound on beach groaned aloud in agony again be visible driven on with fearful velocity by tide nearer nearer still thought must distinguish figure of friend be sure must hear voice of edward urging commanding directing landing somewhere in contradiction to opinion of others be within dozen yard of shore still not sound of gratulation be heard eye be fixed a in fascination of terror on wave in distance increasing in size fury a rapidly approached neared boat stood impending over frail thing a mighty avalanche of water burst boat be seen no longer wild terrible cry sounded far near along beach chapter xii foreboding whole of day mr hamilton have vainly tried to shake off most unwonted gloom convinced that be greatly physical from unusual oppressiveness of weather relaxing nerve have so many month be overstrained yet thought must cling to mr maitland word that husband might be coming home if account of ellen danger edward confession have recalled ought to have arrived full two three week previous gale swept round awful unnatural darkness remarkable phenomenon at season of lightning long loud thunder clap inland must be fearfully distinguished from gale appalled whole household therefore be not much wonder that vague idea of husband having left feroe exposure to tempest must become in fearful anxiety almost certainty of agony be well perhaps that unselfish nature have object to draw in slight degree out of herself for firmness trust beyond accident of earth seemed about to fail make for time being most wretched a storm closeness increased so did ellen feverish restlessness nerve not yet fully restored felt strung almost to torture with flash clap blast tried to laugh at own folly for though often terrified when little child at storm in india of england have never affected at must not understand why must feel so childishly argument be of little moment in such case mr hamilton satisfying that must no more help present sensation than physical weakness tried to soothe amuse in so doing partially cheered did not leave till past midnight then desiring mr langford to sit up with till be comfortably asleep retired to own bed room never since husband absence have solitude felt so vast so heavily oppressive thought after thought of thronged mind till fairly gave up effort to struggle with will voice ever sound here again heart give support need rose to lip a gazed round her deep stillness gloom only broken by small silver lamp fitful light of fire seemed solemn answer buried face in clasped hand clock struck two before inward conflict permitted once more to lift up heart brow in meek trusting faith to who still watched over beloved one after earnest voiceless prayer drew little table with book of devotion to fire read thoughtfully prayerfully for hour then sought couch must not sleep wind have again arisen fearing to lie awake listen to must only renew unusual agitation rose at four dressed throwing on large shawl softly traversed passage entered niece room finding a fully expected a wakeful restless a herself with addition of intense headache have persuaded nurse langford to go to bed pain have come on since then made more restless feverish than before must not lie in posture to get ease till at last about six o'clock completely exhausted fell asleep sitting almost upright in aunt arm head leaning against a stood by bedside fearing to disturb mr hamilton must not move desiring morning prayer to be said without miss harcourt daughter not to wait breakfast a must have with ellen when awoke that be stiff exhausted with three hour standing in one position did not heed perhaps scarcely felt for woman loveliest attribute that of tender utterly unselfish nurse be hers to perfection did not refuse cup of chocolate caroline brought herself with affectionate earnestness entreated to take footnote storm a occurring in devonshire in january february be creation of imagination author have heard more than one officer in preventive service have mentioned a occurring during night watch of awful violence look so fatigued so pale dearest mother wish must let take place must be so quiet so gentle ellen must not even know change of nurse doubt care love fear least movement will disturb poor child have have such restless night want to sleep a long a can thoughtful care have so refreshed that feel quite strong again so go finish breakfast in comfort dearest caroline very unwillingly obeyed about quarter of hour afterward mr hamilton be startled by sound of carriage advancing with unusual velocity to house stopped at main entrance have scarcely time to wonder who must be such very early visitor when loud scream in voice of emmeline rung in ear whether of joy grief must not distinguish be voice of child already tortured nerve of wife mother must not bear without sensation of terror amounting to absolute agony laid ellen head tenderly on pillow watched over though limb so trembled must scarcely support saw with intense relief that movement have not disturbed quiet sleep calling mr langford from adjoining room hastily descended stair though how did so entered breakfast room always said never knew many eager glad voice be speaking at once very servant thronged hall threshold of room made way for arthur husband did find voice to exclaim object figure reeled before fainted in arm be time before recovered for mind frame have be too long overtasked mr hamilton a clasped in arm beseeching only to speak to gazed on deathlike countenance felt in moment great a anxiety have be for have not imagined one half have endured voice kiss seemed to rouse scattered sens even more effectually than miss harcourt anxiously proffered remedy must not speak only looked up in face a if to be quite quite sure have indeed returned that vague fancy of danger even if have foundation have merged in most blissful reality that be no longer alone leaning head on bosom be only conscious of thankfulness too deep for word repose since departure have not known for single day husband must believe that be only six month since have be separated seemed to mr hamilton especially a if must have lived through year in time have be so fraught with sorrow not one word own dearest only pallid cheek heavy eye to greet must reproach directly come home for a usual not thinking enough of forgetting how precious be that self to so many husband above nay papa will not scold mamma said emmeline eagerly a mother tried to smile speak in answer ought to scold for not sending one line to prepare for unexpected presence frightening by coming so suddenly upon making mamma faint a never saw do before indeed like mother darling continued affectionate girl kneeling down by mother clinging to adding in suppressed terrified voice be so like death mr hamilton read in moment that emmeline playfulness be only assumed to hide strong emotion that be trying very hard for complete control so trembling that knelt down literally because must not stand be such proof of endeavor to profit by mother gentle lesson even at moment not only gave sweetest gratification helped to rouse indeed think be perfectly right emmy said quite in usual voice a pressed child moment to kissed cheek be almost a pale a own will not submit to scolding when papa be answerable for unusual weakness a wanted so very much why will be lenient with only keep prisoner with for time to come get breakfast quickly caroline love early visitor must want when did arrive dearest arthur added looking earnestly in face half wondering at expression upon seemed to speak so many thing surely not morning be not at sea in yesterday awful storm be indeed emmeline can bear to hear have be agitated enough already have be in danger great danger father infinite mercy have preserved to making instrument of preservation so young lad slight frame know not how sufficiently to bless god to thank preserver mr hamilton hand closed convulsively on husband eye riveted on countenance a if must grasp whole meaning at once little did guess whole did not come alone added striving for composure even playfulness though seems be such important personage a to be only one seen thought about by by did see fancied saw edward rejoined caroline who at news of father having be in danger have left breakfast table unable to keep away from even that short distance of others connecting cousin with mr hamilton word not quite understanding why must have so interrupted most interesting subject have gone to see ellen suppose so have missed be companion papa how where did meet let answer for replied mr hamilton still determinately hiding feeling under tone manner of jest leaving wife side for moment drew edward from recess of window where time have be standing quite unobserved led forward good heaven edward what have be about exclaimed miss harcourt exclamation be echoed by caroline emmeline while mr hamilton gazed at in bewildered alarm be deadly pale with appearance of exhaustion most disfiguring patch on left brow have tried in vain to hide with hair have be fighting only with element miss harcourt have rather tired be will be well in day two look so terrified dear aunt answered with same attempt at jest a uncle throwing lightly on ottoman by mr hamilton laid head very quietly on lap fighting with element arthur dearest arthur for pity sake tell whole truth at once can not be why must not beloved there be attempt at jest now to whom care have preserved sister whom indulgent love have given courage to resolve that error will be conquered will become can wish whom took to heart home when motherless god have mercifully made instrument of saving husband from watery grave giving back father to child to be associated in heart with other thought than of ingratitude cruelty sin oh aunt emmeline can not thank god enough for permitting great mercy be only word poor edward must speak when first intensity of aunt emotion be in degree conquered must look in young face though eye be almost blinded with tear putting back bright hair rain spray have so uncurled a to lay heavy damp upon pale forehead imprinted long silent kiss upon looking alternately at husband seemed powerless to realize other thought mr hamilton briefly most eloquently narrated event of previous night dwelling only sufficiently on imminent peril to evince real importance of edward extraordinary exertion not to harrow feeling of listener more than need be that young officer determined opposition to almost angrily expressed opinion of captain harvey old collins a to better landing place have saved from effect of huge wave have burst like water spout minute after have leaped in safety on shore almost overwhelming projecting sand to collins have wished to direct boat so proving at once edward far superior nautical knowledge for have steered there frail bark must inevitably have be upset crew washed by receding torrent back to sea harvey collins acknowledged error at once looked eagerly for edward to say so to have vanished moment have achieved safe landing to mr hamilton annoyance for have not least suspicion who be only longed to express if must not otherwise evince gratitude collins grey refusing smallest credit declaring that if have not be for young stranger officer of whom knew nothing not even name not man must have stirred that for fisherman mere ordinary sailor to have guided boat to from sinking vessel in such sea be so impossible that one must have attempted old collins ending with superstition of class by declaration that disappearance convinced already more than suspicion that be good angel in boy likeness for arthur hamilton must never have be permitted so to perish explanation mr hamilton added laughingly that might suit emmy be rather too fanciful for however young preserver be nowhere to be found to extreme astonishment little relief for now that be so near home anxiety to hear of especially ellen whom scarcely dared hope to find alive became insupportable mr howard suddenly stood before grasping hand without power for minute two to speak mr hamilton overwhelmed with question scarcely giving time to answer one before asked have nearly reached hotel when captain harvey bluff voice be heard exclaiming here be mr hamilton be too exhausted to escape thanks blessing now what must youngster have tried to hide for before mr hamilton must make rejoinder save to grasp young man hand strongly in own mr howard said eagerly oblige captain harvey take boy into hotel be only just round corner make take off dripping jacket give of sailor stuff be not quite strong enough for exertion to night must rest at once captain harvey bore off almost carrying for exertion variety of emotion have rendered faint powerless do know howard who what be mr howard did not perhaps must not reply hurried friend on to hotel entered room where having called for light ingredient of grog punch vowed boy must have instead of brandy water have called for found edward trying to laugh protesting against coddling be perfectly well must not go to bed must not imagine what right captain harvey have to be sailor if thought so much of storm blow wetting must if be sailor rigged what business have with overgrown mast of figure face pale delicate a woman so like dying mother be that mr hamilton stood for moment on threshold completely stupefied leave reader to imagine rest how captain harvey carried seemingly marvelous news that brave young officer be mr hamilton own nephew over town in fisherman hut in miraculously short space of time may a well state here at once to save farther retrospection that mr hamilton by active admirable assistance of morton have after three month residence at feroe perceived that might return to england much sooner than have at first anticipated still did not like to mention even probability of such thing to family till perfectly certain morton never ceased persuading to name period for return knowing comfort must be to home mr hamilton must not bear idea of leaving friend in voluntary banishment so many month sooner than have reckoned on when however letter came from oakwood

table because at present be only subject under consideration really can not see thing very poetical in not even in lina archly replied emmeline bending down so that face must come before sister instead of copy be very pretty small marble figure now if be not most determined piece of prose in world must find poetry even in face for lo artist more gazed on feature still cold stood bewilder 'd amazed a living charm unfold a if touch 'd by yon orient ray stone to life have warm 'd for round lip such bright smile play a never sculptor form 'd there caroline be what ought to have felt if can make poetry on own face poetry on why emmeline thought be repeating verse of old poet with be unacquainted really beg pardon did not know favorite muse have dubbed follower a well a worshiper did till moment feared for reputation near love of prose a be so touched with inspiration be exceedingly obliged to even if failed to make poetical caroline might have emulated cowper instead of singing beofa sung 'table indeed think very pretty poem might be made of look at variety of tasteful useful thing laid on table there stand in midst of immovable cold insensible just like one on whom heap favor upon favor who remains so wrapped in self a to be utterly indifferent to now caroline put into rhyme blank verse if prefer be new idea at least so new replied sister laughing that think will send to

thought acquirement think now perhaps habituated a be to employment that be impossible be just of age to demand very strict watchfulness over to prevent now that be emerging from routine of childhood lesson too old to be compelled to do be right rendering task of control more difficult more susceptible to poetry what term inspiration than ever must try infuse little of caroline steady matter of fact into poetry instead of almost despising a so cold disagreeable now look so very sad so very serious love jump at conclusion that be displeased because speak seriously love joyousness far too dearly to check wish to do so especially in own family just a have learned necessity of evinced so well so feelingly control in emotion of sorrow emmeline so be quite sure will trust experience practice control even in pleasant inspiration of poetry joy emmeline sat very quiet for several minute be just in mood of extreme hilarity render control excessively difficult cause least check upon to be felt a harsh unkind almost to bring tear be not too perfect to escape from feeling even though person who have caused be mother so dearly loved did not give way to few minute hard struggle momentary temper be so conquered that with even more than usually warm kiss promised to think quite seriously on mother said effort far more difficult be just a joyous a before have made so many mistake in drawing mamma really think can go on with to day do let help will take such pain with work will be almost a neat a yours then though finger be employed at least may go on talking mr hamilton assented telling might talk a much a pleased with one of peculiar smile of approval ever made emmeline heart throb for always told that thought feeling secret struggle with temper imagined must be known only to herself mother by mysterious power have discovered rewarded edward what be so deep in 'fragments of voyage travel ' thought be something much deeper than by deep attention be giving must dip in ocean not in fragment of water ned did not feel inclined for exertion replied smiling do know continued when first read that book did merely because have lurking sort of affection for handsome cousin of mine who be sailor be so charmed with trick played in cockpit be seized with violent desire to don middy dress come after must have made pretty story too did not think mamma papa must quite approve of so desisted must not make very handsome boy edward so handsome replied again smiling that fear must not have preserved incognita hour especially with flowing curl dear emmeline do tell have made in mood asked ellen last week be so sad last three day have be wild enough to frighten ellen ah if did know reason have better satisfy curiosity emmy said mr hamilton so meaningly that emmeline ready mind instantly understood tell did occur in awful storm three day ago a poetically lengthily a like one will interrupt if will only be very careful not to exaggerate alarm edward gave up seat to cousin emmeline launched at once into most animated description of storm shipwreck rescue cleverly contriving so to hide name a to elude least suspicion of preserved preserver having thing to do with ellen becoming so exceedingly interested a to lose sight of question at first have struck what must have to do with emmeline wild spirit mean to say be own father saved said a cousin paused minute to take breath tale be becoming so like romance emmy hardly know how to believe assure be quite true only imagine what young hero feeling must have be of family to whom gave back husband father must think so intense so sacred a to be hardly joy at first scarcely possible to be imagined even by vivid fancy emmy know ellen think can imagine may shake head look wise will prove can by by what do think of hero must like to know admire quite a much a can desire who told one of principal actor in scene what have penchant for thing out of common way reached dartmouth old collins brought tale replied emmeline laughing guess again william grey one of rescued crew who may know aunt wrong again ellen then can not guess emmeline so pray tell be very silly ellen be not mr howard edward at dartmouth at time why did not guess not that have from edward repeated ellen did know thing about more than one else dearest answered mr hamilton cautiously fondly put emmeline strange tale together connect with happiness other morning think own heart will explain rest more especially with speaking witness continued emmeline playfully putting back edward hair that ellen might see scar understood in moment clasping arm round brother neck a knelt by tried hard to prevent emotion must not burst into tear tear little ellen said must only be greeted with smile exclaimed rich deep voice close beside before have time to fear presence felt clasped with father fondness in uncle arm head resting on shoulder warm kiss on cheek edward be only word must speak fear for dear ellen true repentance firm resolution to amend be ask if future conduct really prove error of youth will be forgotten a if have never be know must say dear child did think there must be excuse palliation for sin even if still wish temptation have be resisted have indeed suffered for more than harshest judgment must desire let be forgotten a entirely a fully a be forgiven in very few minute ellen composure be so fully restored heavy dread so subsided that relief seemed to almost dream must be possible that be relative have pictured a so harsh stern pitiless to youthful error who have drawn chair close by sofa caressingly holding hand in looking so kindly so earnestly in altered face be trying to amuse by telling so many entertaining thing about feroe mr morton voyage home alluding to brother courage prudence skill in such term a almost brought tear again mr hamilton be inexpressibly shocked at change mental bodily suffering have wrought in niece there be always something peculiarly touching appealing to best emotion in youthful sorrow suffering of kind trial have be such aggravated one combining such agonized remorse for act harshest judgment knowing point of case must scarcely pronounce a other than involuntary with most heroic perfectly unconscious self sacrifice not only terror for brother fate almost crushing sense of misery for fault that pallid face frame so delicately fragile have still deeper claim for sympathy cherishing than even when caused by ordinary illness loss of unusually luxuriant hair except soft band shaded face visible under pretty little lace cap made look much younger than really be so delicately transparent have become complexion that blue vein be clearly traceable on forehead throat hand dark soft lash seemed longer than before a swept pale cheek brow more penciled eye whether in imagination from friend knowing have endured in reality be so expressive of such deep quiet feeling that whole countenance be so altered so improved that seemed a if heavy sallow child be rapidly changing into one of sweet lovable heart attracting girl who without actual beauty can never be passed unnoticed at ellen request mr hamilton have a soon a be strong enough read with morning evening devotional exercise be read below to assembled family mr hamilton soon perceived with little pain that ellen shrunk from idea of being well enough to rejoin in actual suffering here again be effect of same vivid imagination of whose existence until late event in one so quiet seemingly so cold mr hamilton have not least idea of ellen have be so long accustomed to be silent a to feeling in fact carefully to conceal that much a might wish intend to be unreserved aunt feared must cause difficulty to be so must not hope to succeed in controlling imagination unless be that night however ellen unreserved confidence gave hope when devotional exercise in have joined with even more than usual earnestness fervor be concluded said with almost emmeline confidence a laid hand on aunt be so very very happy to night dear aunt be afraid think enough of what be past did so dread uncle return so tremble at what sentence must be on edward that even kindness must not remove weight now have found so groundless be so kind so indulgent be so relieved that fear must have thought more of anger than anger of god sin remains same in sight though uncle hamilton have so fully forgiven think ought to feel so happy indeed dear ellen think may heavenly father be still more merciful than man a mr howard so clearly proved to in long conversation have with know by holy word that asks be sincere repentance for sin firm conviction that in only be made sufficiently righteous for penitence to be accepted believe ellen that forgiveness be yours long before must give mine for must read heart saw reason of silence remorse suffering from appearance against might not even guess that in compassionating love pity permitted increased trial ordaining even failure of relief to edward to convince that not even in such fearful case a yours might error however involuntary prosper can trace loving providence even in fact of finding one more note than wanted discovery might thence come without seeming chance be humanly speaking impossible have shown compassion love for edward in very suffering ordained so check returning happiness fearing must be unacceptable to try to trace thing of joy sorrow to associate with thought believe own ellen very happiness will both draw nearer to be acceptable offering in sight ellen listened eagerly gratefully felt a if with word mr hamilton said film of doubt vague fancy be dissolving from mind after short pause said then think aunt emmeline inability to pray for so long time be proof that god have utterly forsaken made still more wretched for thought be sure sign be so irredeemably wicked have left to device of own heart must never love have mercy on again even after have quite forgiven proved to promise be mistaken one not binding still felt difficulty to pray be so painful such inability be very often so entirely physical dear ellen that must not think too much about simple duty be to persevere however little satisfactory devotion put firm trust in heavenly father that will heal permit countenance so to shine upon again a to derive comfort from prayer inability before illness be natural consequence of mr howard severe representation have since assured never must have used if must have have least idea of cause of silence poor child be suffering too much from complete chaos of conflicting feeling duty to be able to realize be not at astonished that when most yearned for comfort of prayer trust thought that by silence be failing in duty to so disobeying god must utterly have prevented since severe illness inability have be entirely physical a strength peace return will regain power realize comfort try under feeling trust in love god be too much elated when can think seriously pray joyfully too desponding when fail in present state physical cause alone so often occasion difference of feeling in hour of devotion that if thought too much about must constantly think wrong be very miserable try prove desire to love serve god in daily conduct secret thought ellen will be able to judge of spiritual improvement by action feeling far more truly justly than by mood in pray earnestness of truth feeling be always so impressed on mr hamilton manner whenever addressed youthful charge that simplest word have weight happy indeed be when youth that season of bewildering doubt question vivid often mistaken fancy too impetuous feeling have rich blessing of such affectionate counsel such friend why will not woman rise superior to petty employment feeling too often alone
