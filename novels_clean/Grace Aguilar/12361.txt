excited till became so even against nature with whom even mother kind devoted mother who have ever done so much for whom in childhood when knew worth much le than do now have never caused to shed tear oh mary can not tell felt moment passionate word escaped may truly say did not cry from anger from most bitter most painful self reproach think usual penetration must have discovered for if have thought tear be really of passion must not must not have acted a did drew gently to kissed without speaking threw arm round neck in voice almost choked by sob implored again again to forgive that did not mean to answer so disrespectfully that knew have become very wicked girl that really did feel very unhappy for few minute be silent must see be struggling to suppress tear unusual conduct have occasioned will make apology dearest mary for entering on such minute detail for know how love mother that word say be almost a precious to a to own child quite can not be give account also that may know a be not imagine be so free from fault a know once believed oh when have looked back on day have felt so painfully humiliated must gladly banish recollection be better for to remember lest must fancy better than be word said in gentle persuasive tone be engraved upon heart even a spoke easily fully convinced of sinfulness in thus permitting imaginary evil to make so miserable for that be imaginary be easy to discover not single blessing must say have lost loved be around in health happiness comfort of life be same must be possible mamma said that mere departure from favourite residence only for few month must render so completely blind to many blessing heavenly father have scattered around a spoke film appeared removed from eye enormity of conduct stood for first time in true colour before saw knew how sinful have be bitterly regretted that have not confessed feeling to mamma instead of hiding a have done in own heart brooding on till became kind of pleasure to do so till fancied evil produced real one wept bitterly while spoke for to find how completely have created misery for myself be agreeable matter of reflection remorse be heightened when mamma said have disappointed not little dear emmeline for will no longer conceal from that little tour took on way to london be originally planned by father to reconcile to change of residence saw how much regretted leaving oakwood did wonder at for such feeling be most natural to one of disposition therefore instead of travelling direct suddenly changing scene of beautiful devonshire for confinement of huge city hoped by visiting various place giving new object of reflection to lessen regret make change of residence le painfully abrupt a well a must expressed sorrow repentance promised to use endeavour to atone for past become that papa wished believe own emmeline kind mother said a again kissed voice be no longer so sorrowfully grave a have be at first be sure now know pain be inflicting on parent effort will be put in force to remove did deserve speech dear mary think did for often saw by mamma countenance have grieved yet made effort to control so told smiled own sweet dear smile of approbation thanking for candour said if say that by indulging in gloomy fancy appearing discontented repining when so many blessing be around emmeline will be doing mother real injury by rendering character questionable not only in eye of world of most valued friend will not do in power to become own light hearted self again injuring character dearest mother exclaimed with much surprise in what manner will tell love replied there be many not only of acquaintance friend whose opinion really value who believe have be acting very wrongly year in never having permitted caroline to visit london think by strict retirement have quite unfitted for station rank demand must fill that by constantly living alone with never mingling in society have imbibed notion that to say least may be old fashioned romantic will make feel uncomfortable when be introduced in london fear never entered mind wished to receive idea be somewhat different to generality of fashion dictate did not doubt that uncomfortable feeling against letter of friend often warned must very quickly be removed since have be here wish to grieve more dear emmeline must confess conduct have be productive to of most painful self reproach thought indeed friend be right that for year have be acting on injudicious plan that instead of measure tending to future happiness be only productive of pain misery have done a other mother of station might have be avoided oh pray think so exclaimed for have spoken so sorrowfully must not bear formed own misery dearest mother have nothing to do with think so now love answered with usual fondness if friend see gloomy sad evidently discontented longing for pleasure be not offered to in london only dwelling on vision of past notion tending to indulgence of romance what will think will not judgment be called in question more know how very much prefer country to london life domestic pleasure to of society may imagine with probability that to indulge selfish wish have disregarded real interest of child can not will not think so passionately said can never have known who form such conclusion must not have agreed with dear mary can not fancy wretchedness mamma word inflicted love replied with smile will not fancy know will rather imagine must have be deceived in opinion that be not what may have appeared to few year ago character of mother emmeline be frequently judged of by conduct of child such conclusion be generally correct though of course a there be exception to rule there be to many mother may have be unjustly injured in estimation of world by thoughtless criminal conduct of wilful disobedient child have be so completely stranger to london society last sixteen year that character conduct depend more upon caroline to be raised lowered in estimation of friend also of world than on of young people with whom may mingle on then will emmeline decide to indulge in gloomy fancy render ill in health temper a well a exposing mother to censure suspicion will spite of exertion pain may occasion shake off lethargy recall natural animation cheerfulness with own bright smile restore gladness to heart of parent must not speak in answer to appeal dear mary clung weeping to mamma neck never till that moment knew responsibility how much depended on conduct at moment inwardly vowed that never never must conduct injure dear devoted mother who endeavoured so fondly to soothe grief check bitter tear who have done so much for who have devoted so completely to child mentally resolved that nothing must be wanting on part to render character a exalted in eye of world a be in mine must not bear to think how ungratefully have acted cried till made head mamma heart ache must not long resist fond caress encouraging word before left must even smile what be to say said with usual playfulness of sad complaint have received last few day from miss harcourt that doe not know what have come to from mon deville signer rozzi now what be to say do to prove that mademoiselle emmeline doe like italian be not ill a polite professor fancy must lecture a did when be idle little girl liked play better than study suppose gentleman be asked in probability certainly be what sort of pupil mr hamilton daughter be ought to be something out of way for hear have instructed principally what answer will be given what conclusion drawn if exert prove that can learn a well when like a sister even quicker than cousin felt so ashamed dearest mary concealed face on shoulder must not even look up to promise amendment for felt be not certain of when mamma spoke of letter to asked if still wished to send if must not write made desperate effort answered a well a must will not write again to mary dear mamma till have conquered silly sinful feeling can write a usual to be quite sure of may not break resolution promise that for six month will not give pleasure of addressing if even at end of time think have sufficiently recovered sens certainly appear to have deserted will increase at will time of probation deserve privation for ungrateful conduct not writing to mary now be greatest can think of tried to appear very heroic a made speech with effort completely failed mamma looked at moment in surprise then with more than usual fondness strained to heart felt tear fall on cheek own sweet child darling emmeline exclaimed did not expect offered sacrifice will accept own love let pain soothed to affectionate heart by knowledge that in making have given purest most delicious sense of pleasure must bestow will not say six month added more playfully will see what middle end of january brings will then still have nearly four month to redeem character have not slightest doubt even before period emmeline will be oh mary felt so very happy a thus spoke that thought must find very easy to conquer be mistaken painfully mistaken have encouraged despondency gloom for so long period that required exertion in very least to subdue have chosen to waste time be inattentive to mean of improvement be offered to command attention sufficiently to regain good opinion of sage professor be most disagreeably difficult be no longer afraid to encounter mamma sorrowful reproving glance a have be before fond encouragement mark of approval papa bestowed when must not feel have done little to deserve lightened labour of task by causing to wish earnestly to deserve kindness increased effort at length dearest mary miserable feeling so completely departed from be surprised to perceive how very nearly must be a happy in london a at dear oakwood quite a happy be impossible because feel more more how very much prefer quiet domestic life in country to london society will perhaps smile a mamma doe say be not introduced yet then may change mind think will prefers country so will not be very strange if must when see how completely yet how cheerfully have given up favourite residence employment for interest happiness of child feel ashamed at egregious selfishness have be mine oh mary when will ever be like mamma when can ever be worthy of half nay one quarter of respectful admiration be bestowed upon even by whose principle conduct be directly opposite in conversation with have spoken more of opinion of world than ever did at oakwood one day venturing to notice a being contrary to so carefully instilled that to god conscience must alone be answerable for conduct answered with smile have be long expecting remark dear emmeline have endeavoured to be prepared with answer to father in heaven to own conscience must still look for guide in life that not in one thing must transgress love duty owe maker disregard warning reproach of heart still mingling in world a be undoubtedly duty to do for a have often told live for ourselves for others must have due regard in minor thing to opinion of with whom associate when woman have once set up for independent when scorning opinion of world walk forth conscious in own integrity virtue though stain may have sullied conduct name though may be innately amiable good yet gentler female will shrink from such character tremble lest must become like woman be dependent being in infinite wisdom be thus ordained why must endeavour to be otherwise when once set up standard for have thrown aside surest safeguard exposed ourselves to censure suspicion when ordinance of society interfere with higher principle of life must be obeyed in doing so be following up dictate of true religion by doing duty a member of community a child of one common father if stand selfishly apart can not do speak more of opinion of world mamma then continued to than to sister cousin caroline must rather check in perhaps too great regard for admiration ellen be at present too young in much too delicate health to go out with a much a will even before be what be termed introduced besides natural reserve timidity banish fear on account for for emmeline do sometimes feel fearful that in indulgence of uncontrolled feeling will forget be not quite such independent being a be at oakwood many of idea be quite contrary to generally entertained by several with whom may associate sometimes dread that by unchecked expression avowed determination never to think a companion do that hate such confined idea such thing smiled if know emmeline rightly be not at unlikely may be exposing to suspicion dislike feel quite sure never will wilfully offend that will really deserve such censure wish be that will be little more guarded controlled in intercourse with stranger here than ever be in happy hall of oakwood did not answer dear mary for know why there be something in word that caused eye to fill with tear think be because seemed such painful task to maintain such continued control over word

italian poet in truth madam said must be poet temple of mus graced with presence there be for mary joke apart do love italian be must be natural language of poetry sentiment be so exquisitely lovely language word a if framed to receive music dwells in line petrarch tasso dante be open to now luxuriate even in anticipation of last how be digressing that night mamma followed to room a retired to bed smiling almost laughing at half terror of countenance expressed for fancied have come to reprove wild spirit have indulged in throughout day said be not little head half turned with flattery have received to day instantly replied be only approbation of one two can put in danger of such misfortune indeed answered again smiling fancied be fine speech have be hearing to day have excited such high spirit be glad be not otherwise might have hesitated to express what came here to do approbation of emmeline conduct last few month felt colour rising to very temple dear mary for did not expect endeavoured to conceal felt by seizing hand imploring in serio comic semi tragic tone not to praise for papa be two whose praise must have effect on feared must endeavour to keep head steady now continued because papa sends packet to oakwood next week long letter for mary from emmeline must accompany patience think must be very nearly exhausted know if once begin to write frank will not contain will have to say will added with arch dear smile high spirit seemed for moment to desert must not answer except to cover hand with kiss have told what said in way of reproof advice dear mary can not coolly write said a encouragement praise be much more than deserved therefore that can do be to continue endeavour to feel one day rather more to merit have risen morning hour earlier might tell wished without encroaching on allotted hour of study for hope will not imagine have written in one two even three sitting now do not deserve letter almost a long from if thus reward dread vengeance write soon for long to have letter from of have heard often of from though may be brother of family of preposition be very different in meaning have not written one word of caroline ellen be not incurably egotistical former declares be sure will have time to read letter from with such volume a mine ellen say have time by opportunity told ought to get up a did blushed looked confused enough to awaken attention then said supposed be too lazy now really must say farewell mind write concerning dear mother to whom present very loving respect a for dear mary let long letter prove sincere affection perfect confidence of giddy friend emmeline p young lady can write without post script mamma have absolutely have patience to read through letter except said so much of be certainly needle approves of almost a much a disapproved of other have just compelled to read what tissue of absurdity contained worse be sinful have have pleasure of burning hope trust silly repinings be burnt with once more adieu eh from mr hamilton to miss greville can not dear mary suffer emmeline long letter to be forwarded to without few line from to remove lingering fear may perhaps have have that approve of correspondence believe dear girl to see chosen friend of giddy warm hearted emmeline be still a have ever be from childhood source of real pleasure to mr hamilton female friendship be know often regarded with contempt not only by men frequently by sterner principle of own sex be deemed connection of folly that long letter pas between young lady set down by world a intimate friend be relation of petty incident may hear see such letter be also considered tending to weaken mind produce false sensibility by term of affection force into service magnified expression of momentary fleeting emotion that such may sometimes be tenor of young people correspondence pretend to deny when be case such letter be treasured up in secret requested to be burnt lest eye save for whom be intended must chance to encounter then indeed too might disapprove of similar intimacy be to prevent must not permit emmeline to send first letter to have alluded feeling be magnified distorted till must have fancied have not real cause be told that very serious evil have happened be impending over did not in least doubt that must have used influence to combat with conquer sinful repining still thought very reply might have called forth renewed ebullition of sensibility thus in frame of mind be then indulging hinted reproach however gentle might have be turned twisted into decay of friendship such display of sensitiveness must certainly have removed affection injured when therefore so frankly acknowledged error offered to sacrifice pleasure knew be to write to accepted spite of pain saw felt to inflict on may believe gave now certainly feel rewarded for self denial practised emmeline be again same happy girl be at oakwood although can perceive there be nothing at best very little here that can compensate for rural pleasure have left wonder at for in such feeling trace from girlhood be own hope therefore dear young friend that nothing in future will check intercourse with emmeline that correspondence may long continue source of pleasure to of love to see perfect confidence with emmeline have written prof regard a deserve to be regarded a indeed friend not companion in frivolity sentiment believe may thus have in power to improve strengthen perhaps rather too yielding character manner in through mercy of compassionate god have be enabled young a be to bear trial be indeed severe have inspired with respect for character trifling difference in age might otherwise have prevented therefore letter will be received with more than ordinary interest good example dear girl may do much towards teaching to bear evil of life from can not expect to be exempt with same patient resignation characterises write to therefore a often a feel inclined beg suppress thought candid letter may have produced will not ask to read confession charitably for know will assure have completely redeemed fault struggle be very severe one to subdue depression have encouraged so long have nobly conquered fear such feeling of discontent ever again obtaining too great ascendency tell dear mother with affectionate love that will be pleased to hear health be improving have not

writing of family to mention that herbert never writes home without inquiring after favourite mary if sister answer such query very particularly be sure in next letter to obtain a severe reproach a can flow from pen will not return such little token of remembrance dear girl herbert have only lately changed term by in boyhood have so often spoken of sister mary surely friend in such early

affection now rather shrunk from society therefore even at home be solitary man yet grahame be formed for best emotion warmest affection of nature be ignorant that wife now very frequently suffered from ill health for have never seen conduct different even when in youth perfectly well have known also fact that though trembling at sternness yet longed to receive token of affection that really loved spite of many fault extreme weakness of character might have be happy deceived by daughter manner lady helen began to waver in positive refusal have given to accompanying annie be not slow in discovering advantage continued persuasion knew so well how to use concealing inward struggle be to veil discontent at unwonted humiliation suppressing violence be ready to break forth at length succeeded though really feeling too languid for exertion wavering mother must not resist unusually gentle manner of persevering daughter miss grahame flew to confidant to impart joyful tidings miss malison be employed in endeavouring by command exhortation threat to compel pupil to practise difficult sonata music master have desired might be prepared by time of next visit now happened that lilla grahame have not slightest taste for music that miss malison did not posse patient perseverance requisite to smooth difficulty of task gentleness necessary to render more pleasing to pupil therefore in practising lesson discord ever prevailed over harmony teacher be ever ready to seize most trifling excuse to neglect office leave lilla to practise not a pleased malison chere malison exclaimed annie in tone of glee a entered do leave stupid girl come with have charming intelligence to communicate really be use boring with lilla will never play try a hard a can according to will hing burst angrily from sister lip for temper naturally good though somewhat hasty have be completely ruined by careless mistaken treatment if have be properly taught must have done a others do if miss malison

beyond bound at display of insubordination in one whose spirit have left mean untried to bend to will forgetting in passion of moment enforced word by what be termed sound box on ear now go tell mamma pretty dear papa if like better miss grahame said in whining tone lilla answered not crimson flush for moment spread over very temple at infliction of indignity very quickly gave way to deadly almost livid paleness on mark of miss malison ready finger be only spot of red without word in reply hastily rose from piano left room will blab be elegant question be asked a door closed not replied annie laughing dare not tell papa know be of use appealing to mamma who implicitly belief tell of miss lilla excessive obstinacy idleness passionate temper in so constantly indulges deep regret that of lady

tried violence sulkiness at first thinking to frighten worry into compliance finding fail be compelled to have recourse to humiliation persuasion if have continued much longer must have choked by way be quite relief to breathe freely again what do think of wishing to go under care of mr hamilton to night really must hardly control horror at idea horrible indeed what must have become of plan if have dear creature must not have gone with for world however think plan be in too good training for one night spent under eye to injure caroline be beginning think to feel somewhat like slave under keen surveillance of paragon mother to pine for freedom of thought act so unboundedly enjoy only want little of good advice better example to become really girl of spirit take care spirit be calling forth doe not turn against observed miss malison not at likely ma chere be careful only to excite to serve own purpose like believe can make what please let confidence in mother be once destroyed will see if doe not act a foolishly a can desire have be buried in country so long be mere infant with regard to concern life of fashion therefore will be gladly led by one considers so completely au fait at mystery a used to like in country because always listened so eagerly to said about london saw envied even when be child therefore fancied most important personage do like now be laughing at chere malison know can not bear rival girl dazzling beauty will completely cast in shade mean to say beauty can be compared to yours interrupted miss malison perhaps not in sterling worth of two replied annie glancing complacently on large mirror be new malison quite new mother only kept so long away that might shine with greater brilliancy when introduced a for caroline like a far a assist plan by silly if must serve better criminal conduct take somewhat away from mother perfection by pain mr hamilton will feel gratify overpowering detestation malison look delighted assistance be sure of if require for dislike paragon of sex almost a much a do indeed do have never forgotten forgiven presumption year two ago in hinting so broadly be mistaken in treatment of lilla that gentleness must have much better effect gentleness indeed with girl must tire patience of saint be always worse after having be with mr hamilton suppose will be over again now wish with charming plan dear miss grahame must find one to prevent intercourse between hamilton sister at present ma chere thing be out of power will not despair although more must say about miss lilla being undeserving of such indulgence more papa must answer let go will learn to be better there heard give mamma peremptory order other day when prevented going never to refuse whenever mr hamilton invited severity be most admirable method good malison will break spirit if persevere notwithstanding amiable mr hamilton may do say wish may have not told yet how proceed scheme with lord alphingham to perfection have given caroline distaste for other kind of person have met know once twice here be sufficient to fascinate think handsomest most delightful man ever knew be enough for mr hamilton to see friend of papa to be attracted towards in probability will be introduced at house then scheme will be still easier will not be difficult to talk caroline into fancying desperately in love with with be already attracted when see aspect of affair favourable will just get kind friend to whisper into mr hamilton ear of pretty tale have heard of viscount will see what will follow on dit be fortunately for plan only known among coterie with only render lord alphingham more interesting with mr hamilton must have effect of banishing for ever from presence from notice of daughter catastrophe dear creature will be perfection of diplomacy of hereafter owe lord alphingham spite will pay off one day for desertion of moment caroline appeared may do wish with one word present intention be by gradual yet sure process to undermine caroline confidence in mother make confidant instead if do that rest be easy know have never failed in scheme therefore may feel secure in replied miss malison with ready flattery for knew miss grahame love of designing really felt gratified at plan tending to injure mr hamilton whom detested with malevolence of mean grovelling mind despised virtue be too exalted for comprehension little time longer amiable pair conversed further conversation be needle to record have already seen that emmeline hamilton prejudice against annie grahame be not unfounded at present be enough before however quit lady helen mansion may say few word on character of lilla in whom may be recollected mr hamilton have ever felt interest sufficient to indulge hope that might render one day greater comfort to father than of other child a child temper be naturally good though somewhat hasty willed high spirited affectionate to degree must have made task of training instruction easy to one who possessed sufficient gentleness to win affection with patience yet firmness to guide in right way unfortunately miss malison possessed extremely passionate where interest did not interfere to control be not at person to guide passionate child severity be weapon mean used to break spirit must plainly perceive must soon endeavour to throw off control lilla revolted at treatment many evil quality be thus introduced in disposition when fell under eye mr hamilton be convinced be completely fruit of mistaken management from being merely hasty passionate anger hatred of governess have now increased to such height a to be really alarming not only to weak minded mother to mr hamilton who however be certainly never aware of extent for before lilla be generally gentle controlled something always occurred to call forth burst of passion in lady helen presence consequently actual conduct of lilla confirmed statement of miss malison a to violence other evil quality mr grahame too be compelled to believe be told sternness towards unhappy child frequently caused to fly from presence in dread although warm heart yearned towards with such deep affection must have guessed one half of extent must have twined fondly round heart forced to examine more strictly than did conduct of miss malison lilla dislike to more favoured sister be almost a violent a bore to governess conviction that mother family looked on a passionate evil minded girl of course increased bitter feeling often very often did mr hamilton long to implore mr grahame to dismiss miss malison place lilla under care of lady more fitted for task felt that such advice might be looked upon with justice by lady helen friend a most unwarrantable interference miss malison have be most highly recommended to lady helen by mother duchess of a in opinion of branch of family annie abundantly displayed good effect of management be very naturally supposed that lilla opposite character proceeded from innate evil disposition not from fault in governess be now nearly fourteen year mr hamilton hope for future worth of character became fainter yet still determined to do in power to counteract miss malison plan subdue lilla fearful passion longing for revenge not only on governess sister by many little thing must perceive be lurking round heart montrose grahame have be a already know from earliest youth intimate friend of mr hamilton notwithstanding increasing care of respective family friendship have continued if possible increased mr hamilton sharing sentiment of husband quality of grahame speedily caused to become friend likewise have ever seen with regret sternness to child saw also that be pained deeply pained a character became more matured spite of difficulty of task benevolent mind determined to leave mean untried to make one child at least comfort lilla affection for be a violent a other feeling on resolved at first to work be strange too how devotedly attached wild headstrong girl became to one who of others appeared least suited to that one mild pensive ellen appeared a if be relief to meet one so widely different to herself therefore loved high spirit animation of emmeline appeared le congenial to affection than gentle sweetness of ellen caroline be annie friend be enough for not even being mr hamilton daughter must make object of interest on day have mentioned lilla have sat for above hour in room indignation at insult have received swelling in vein longing with sickening intensity for mean to free from such galling thraldom did not give vent to injured feeling in tear countenance so clearly expressed emotion of heart that actually startled servant who entered with message request from mr hamilton that young friend must spend that evening with daughter niece lilla started up with wild exclamation of delight anticipation of evening hour enabled to obey with haughty calmness summons of miss malison before however departed on visit fresh ebullition have taken place between sister in presence of mother to great terror of lady helen whose irritation at lilla violence increased a must perceive nothing in annie word manner to call for have be le indolent might easily have discovered that elder daughter never permitted single opportunity to escape without eliciting lilla irritability a be coldly rejected offered caress really affectionate girl must have lavished on a wished good night therefore be with heart bursting with many mingled emotion sought happy home of beloved friend there gladly will follow for scene of violence evil passion have slightly touched on be not subject on love to linger chapter iii there be thought deep thought engraved on mr hamilton expressive countenance a sat beside small table head leaning on hand anxious perhaps even painful vision occupying reflective mind evening be gradually darkening into twilight still did not move be till well known tap sounded at door husband stood before that looked up will not let husband share anxious thought emmeline said a gazed earnestly on face husband may perhaps think silly unfounded fancy replied with faint smile be so prone to do so answered mr hamilton in accent of playful reproach if will not tell must guess be thinking of caroline arthur be said with almost startling earnestness oh can not tell how anxiously know not whether be right to expose to temptation of world know disposition see evil may accrue from yet even a if thought not of existence expose to oh husband can be right can be doing parent duty must not beloved be fulfilling duty of station did not sometimes mingle in society duty be not comprised in domestic life be when retain integrity unsullied restraining principle unchanged in midst of temptation that show forth even to thoughtless spirit actuates by example may do good besides remember dearest be not about to enter into continued incessant dissipation occupies existence of so many have drawn line caroline love parent too well to expect wish to pas boundary remember too anxious fear be yours when percy be about to enter into scene of even stronger temptation than will surround sister have have foundation have not influence of mother followed there restrained even at moment of trial will not influence of mother do same for caroline percy be indeed heart must wish replied mr hamilton still somewhat sadly disposition be different to of caroline know confidence in be such affection so strong that for sake must do more than who slightly know must imagine when son really love mother be different perhaps more fervid feeling than ever known by daughter feel bound to protect to cherish very knowledge of power heightens affection doubt daughter love emmeline must accuse of injustice too dearest arthur doubt love for emmeline tremble confidence will never lose affection however may be called upon to exert authority will never waver completely opposite a be feeling with percy regard love may be equally intense forgive dear husband may be unjust if be may child forgive be not oh be equally confident in caroline love affection know doe not prevent thinking harsh unkind if wish interfere with hers authority be not same with a be to sister cousin seek confidential friend besides mother for dread opinion differing from hers have marked thus in early childhood still exists though temper be more controlled disposition more improved last few year have be thrown almost entirely with not much above twelvemonth since shrunk from idea of confiding in one a did in while confidence exists emmeline surely have right to fear be waning arthur last month know feel be decreasing be no longer same open hearted girl with a be so lately at oakwood be withdrawing confidence from mother to bestow on one whom feel assured be unworthy of nay emmeline anxiety must be blinding be too anxious wife answered not in word raised expressive eye to face saw be filled with tear nay nay beloved exclaimed a folded to bosom struck with sudden self reproach have unkind word called forth tear forgive best love think love child know not depth of mother tenderness emmeline that clear sightedness call for disquietude so much sooner in gentle heart than in father can in way prevent growth of intimacy of know disapprove dearest arthur must now take course pain a be to will not rudely check child affection will not bring back to may one day discover error will then gladly return to love tenderness of now think lightly must endeavour to wait till that day come with patience can teach heart to feel added with smile perhaps be demanding more than be due be not often find young girl willing to be contented with mother only a friend pine for novelty for companion of own age whom imagine can sympathise better in feeling child be in to mother though parent be one link in life of child yet child have so long looked on a friend perhaps feel loss of confidence more painfully will regain emmeline caroline be only dazzled now will soon discover hollowness of annie profession of everlasting friendship mr hamilton shook head doubt dear husband flattering warmth with annie first met caroline have disappointed thought hoped that here surrounded by fashionable acquaintance must rather have neglected former friend caroline pride taking umbrage intimacy must have be at once dissolved instead of annie never fails to treat with most marked distinction evidently appearing to prefer much above other friend therefore a in instance caroline have found warning suspicion needle unjust be not likely to permit opinion of annie to gain much ascendancy deceived a have be in instance dear emmeline may not be so in other point of annie character be evidently devoted to fashion fashionable pleasure still there may be good quality lurking round heart intimacy with caroline may bring forward hope may be so replied mr hamilton fervently though somewhat doubtingly for father sake a well a of child wish disposition may be different to perhaps uncharitably believe must give portion of sanguine trusting hope dearest arthur continued fondly laying hand in mr hamilton returned playful answer endeavoured to turn thought of wife to other more pleasurable subject anxiety such a hers must not be entirely dispelled be lessened for have imparted to husband watchful care must combine with own to guard child very different be caroline feeling on important night mr hamilton fear annie hope be well founded have known character of caroline from child though last three four year have so improved that at oakwood mr hamilton have ventured to banish fear indulge in pleasing hope yet there be degree of pride still remaining that revolted very frequently from counsel even of mother high independent spirit sometimes in secret longed to throw off very slight restraint in felt held at home must not bear to feel that be in way controlled longed for exercise of power by display of beauty quality knew possessed force to be acknowledged a girl of far more consequence than appeared to be when in quiet hall of oakwood there nothing ever occurred to call feeling forth be only dormant in london obtained much greater sway felt more controlled than ever by mother secretly pined to free from magnified into thraldom be watchful tenderness of devoted parent when representation sympathy persuasion of annie be listened to wonder feeling increased cautiously miss grahame have worked continually spoke of freedom enjoyed introduced friend to young lady who be continually speaking of delight of independence in act word once introduced said be emancipated from labour of schoolroom must employ a liked go out when pleased mother never interfered with amusement except to see that be becomingly dressed chaperon to ball second effort at fascination restraint when compared with caroline must not feel be hers at home of course became more more intolerable in confidence imparted to annie discontent for first time confided in feeling shrunk from imparting to mother once such confidential intimacy commenced must must draw back annie artfully appeared to soothe while in reality heightened discontent even indignation of friend yes caroline by slow degree became even indignant at conduct of mother whose thought whose most fervent prayer be for happiness of child looked to night a beginning of new era when allowed to hope with assistance of annie must gradually escape from control act a other girl of spirit did there be subject on by advice of annie caroline carefully refrained from speaking at home be lord alphingham handsome elegant viscount who may be remembered have be mentioned in annie conversation with miss malison yet must appear strange that such be miss grahame counsel when mr hamilton frequently spoke of viscount with mark of approbation due to public conduct of private little be known still le inquired be famous in upper house animated eloquent speaker seconding aiding with powerful influence grahame endeavour in lower house rendering to latter most able influential friend brilliant quality a member of parliament of polite society rendered universally courted yet notwithstanding mr hamilton have never invited to house public character a far at least a meet eye be unquestionably worthy of admiration have said one day to wife know nothing more of private character conduct be must remain ignorant therefore will not expose child to fascination of society in intimacy of home mr hamilton have agreed with required not intimacy of home to give annie

such must be case with comparative stranger have caroline manner be more generally coquettish mr hamilton eye might have be opened behaviour in general be such a rather to diminish than increase fear before child have joined world have very frequently occupied anxious heart to stranger even encouragement of st eval might not have be observable though be clearly so to watchful eye of parent whose confidence in daughter integrity be such a entirely to exonerate in mind from intention of coquetry in instance perhaps regard for young earl mutual secret wish might have heightened belief that not only be st eval attracted that caroline encouraged feeling regretted that lord alphingham must continue attention caroline never appeared to receive with particular pleasure anxious a have be mr hamilton feeling with regard to friendship subsisting between daughter annie grahame little imagined how painfully influence of latter have already tarnished character of former few be aware of danger arising from very intimate connection young woman be so fond of forming mother must study almost a carefully a of own character of child intimate friend mr hamilton have done so a know never approved of caroline intimacy with annie yet must not check intercourse while such intimate friendship existed between husband montrose grahame knew too that latter felt pleasure in beholding caroline chosen friend of daughter though must never hope a grahame did that influence of child must improve character of have yet sufficient confidence in caroline at one time to believe that must still consider mother dearest truest friend thus counteract effect of annie ill directed eloquence in hope have already found disappointed still though caroline refused sympathy bestowed a so many other girl did on companion of own age relied perhaps too fondly on principle have so carefully instilled in early life believed that stain must sully career of much loved child if mr hamilton affection in instance completely blinded if acted too weakly in not at once breaking closely woven chain of intimacy feeling when knew be more than sufficient chastisement must noble honourable truth loving mother for one instant imagine caroline child whose early year have caused so much pain have called forth so many tearful prayer child whose dawning youth have be so fair that heart have nearly lost trembling that caroline must encourage one young man merely to indulge in love of power what be even worse to thus conceal regard for yet be even so caroline really believed that not only be object of passionate love to viscount that returned sentiment with equal if not heightened warmth a undeniable token of true love never mentioned name except to confidant in first of conjecture be undoubtedly right a sincerely a man of character must lord alphingham did love miss hamilton fascination of manner insinuating eloquence ever ready flattery combined might well cause novice in such matter to believe heart be really touched that truly be so not only may be allowed to doubt appeared that annie did so also by laborious effort to fan newly ignited spark into name never once permit caroline to look into herself took so many opportunity of speaking of silly weak spirited girl went with tale of love directly to mother thus very frequently blighted hope condemned to broken heart by duenna caprice

in society be uncharitable perhaps to judge thus feeling of mother have rendered thus acute have endowed with penetration unusually perceptive rejoiced that caroline gave only meed of politeness that

more object of universal attraction in native land than have be on continent be now about thirty perfect indeed in vocation freshness naivete perfect innocence of caroline have captivated fancy perhaps even more than have ever be before perfect ignorance of way of fashionable world encouraged to hope conquest of heart must be very easy have found able confidant advocate in miss grahame who have contrived to place with father friend on footing of most friendly intimacy partly by advice suggestion of own heart determined to win regard of mr mr hamilton before openly paid attention to

repelled coldly yet not so devoid of courtesy a to make suspect have penetrated secret character still persevered in unwavering marked politeness although annie representation of mr hamilton character have already caused to determine in own mind to make caroline wife with without mother approval amused with believing that a mother be so strict stern a to keep child particularly caroline in such subjection must be doing poor girl charity to release from such thraldom introduce a wife into scene far more congenial to taste where must be free from such keen surveillance in thought be ably

opinion of coquetry be very different to hers simple minded girl must never have conceived that scheme of duplicity by aid counsel of annie caroline now practised scarcely ever saw alphingham never

not guess agony be to find integrity in so fondly trusted be a naught that child own child whom have hoped to lead through life without stain be capable of such conduct emotion choked voice have be carried on by violence of feeling perhaps said more in moment of excitement than wished intended st eval gazed on noble woman before with unfeigned admiration saw indignation displeasure felt

must not be happy be right to refuse hand let not have misery of feeling have caused dissension in family whose beautiful unity have ever bound to surely must not urge affection of child never replied mr hamilton earnestly understand fear let pas away will urge nothing duty must do much a admire exalted sentiment express must equally deplore mistaken conduct of child have wilfully sported with most sacred of human feeling once more say be not worthy to be indignation strong emotion still lingering in voice convinced st eval that might urge more respectfully took leave chapter v mr hamilton sat silently revolving in mind caroline late conduct vainly endeavouring to discover one single good reason to justify rejection of st eval in vain striving to believe must have be mistaken have not given encouragement that affection must have become secretly engaged be thing so unlikely that even when mr hamilton suggested husband banished idea a impossible for st eval alone have evinced marked preference must speak to emmeline dare not for feel too angry disappointed to argue calmly have deceived care appear to have be of avail watchful tenderness with have be treated thus returned must have forgiven must not have said word if have conducted towards with propriety to give encouragement such a who have seen together must have remarked to attract by winning art to chain to side then reject with scorn what must have caused conduct wish to display power triumph over one so superior well might say have sunk in estimation why did not question instead of thus fondly trusting in integrity emmeline have trusted child too confidently thus reliance be rewarded seldom if ever have mr hamilton seen husband so disturbed for little time remained with succeeded partly in soothing natural displeasure then left to compose own troubled disappointed feeling ere desired presence of child meanwhile a happy emmeline went to prepare little packet for dear old nurse thought suddenly arose that st eval have sent remembrance adieu to ellen only have not mentioned caroline unsophisticated a be struck a something very strange be not long in connecting circumstance with sudden departure wild sportive innocent a emmeline be yet possessed depth of reflection clearness of perception who only knew casually might not have expected have marked with extreme pleasure believed mutual attachment of st eval sister with ready fancy ever at work have indulged very often in airy vision in beheld caroline countess st eval mistress of beautiful estate in cornwall have heard mr hamilton say have be presented by marquis of malvern to son on twenty first birthday emmeline have indulged fancy noticed conduct of caroline st eval till really believed union must take place have be so delighted at receipt of mary letter that have time to remember young earl departure when be alone that truth suddenly flashed across mind strange incident though at time have not remarked when have said a brother must remember have repeated with startling emphasis a friend what must mean thought caroline can not have rejected be quite impossible sister must surely not be such practised coquette must seek have mystery solved surely will be sorry st eval leaf so soon emmeline hastened first to ellen begging to pack up little packet for mr langford for knew such opportunity must be a acceptable to cousin a to herself for ellen never forgot humble kindness prompt attention have received from widow during long tedious illness by little offering what good woman still more valued by few kind playful line ever accompanied endeavoured to prove sense of widow langford conduct in five minute more emmeline be in sister room caroline be partly dressed a if for morning drive attendant leaving just a sister entered looked pale more fatigued than usual from gaiety of preceding night happy certainly did not look forgetting in sight indignation very supposition of coquetry in sister have excited emmeline gently approached kissing cheek said fondly what be matter dear caroline look ill wearied even melancholy did dance more than usual last night replied caroline believe not think be more tired than usual what do come for emmeline reason must bring here for be generally hard at work at time of day wit have be so disturbed by mary letter have be unable to settle to anything replied sister laughing to add to disturbance have just heard something so strange must not resist coming to tell of what nature st eval leaf london to day for castle malvern next week quits england now be not that extraordinary caroline became suddenly flushed with crimson quickly receding left even paler than before be innocent thought emmeline love st eval must have behaved ill to yet certainly looked more sinned against than sinning to day doe leave to day caroline said at length speaking appeared with effort turning to avoid sister glance in little more than hour time be sorry told dear caroline if news have pained pained repeated sister with returning haughtiness what can mean emmeline lord st eval be nothing to nothing repeated astonished girl caroline be incomprehensible why did treat with such marked attention if cared nothing for for very simple reason because gave pleasure to prove that be in power to do for other girl have tried in vain compel proud lordly st eval to bow to woman will pride have returned again felt pleasure of triumphant power eye sparkled cheek again flushed with different emotion to that have felt before do mean then that have never loved merely sported with feeling for own amusement caroline will not believe must not have acted with such cruelty do love reject confidence ask to confide in though did hope must have be chosen friend beseech implore caroline only to say that be jesting do love be mistaken emmeline never more so in life have refused offered hand if wish confidence on subject give a be favourite of yours doubt preserving secret inviolate might have be countess of st eval end be accomplished dismissed devoted cavalier can dare jest on subject exclaimed emmeline indignantly be possible can have wilfully acted thus sported with feeling of such man a st eval laughed at pain called forth love to gratify desire of power caroline shame on be not in habit of being schooled a to right wrong by younger sister will put up with now emmeline never interfere with conduct therefore will if please do same with be not responsible to for action will ever be replied caroline with cold yet angry pride will speak when know have acted contrary to principle mamma have ever endeavoured to instill into replied emmeline still indignantly be have be ever welcome to remonstrate with be not so weak a once be fearful to speak sentiment even when knew to be right have acted shamefully cruelly caroline will tell what think angry a may make haughty contemptuous answer rose to caroline lip be prevented giving utterance by entrance of martyn mother maid with lady command that miss hamilton must attend in boudoir how provoking exclaimed expect annie to call for minute mamma will perhaps detain hour most unwillingly obeyed summons annie repeated emmeline when sister have left room annie be work if sister have not be thus intimate with never must have acted in manner so disturbed be gentle girl at confirmation of fear that be little time before must recover sufficient serenity to rejoin ellen in arranging widow packet mr langford have charge of oakwood during absence of family mr hamilton recollecting affair concerning village school wished widow to attend to be writing direction a caroline entered much to latter increased annoyance a mother business with must thus be retarded minute drew time of annie appointment nearer must scarcely conceal impatience did venture to beg mother to tell what required attention caroline for time replied so coldly that daughter felt instantly something be wrong though what guessed not for knew not that st eval have obtained sanction of parent for address little imagined must have anything to do with displeasure saw so clearly marked will wait if please till have finished writing a can not be delayed lord st eval leaf town in very short time send by lord st eval thought caroline suddenly becoming alarmed surely mamma papa know nothing of offer few minute passed in silence be broken by sound of carriage wheel stopping at door robert almost instantly after entered with miss grahame love saying must not wait minute hoped miss hamilton be ready miss grahame repeated mr hamilton in accent of surprise before caroline have time to make answer caroline why have not mentioned engagement generally make appointment without at least consulting if no longer think necessary to request permission where be going with annie to oxford street believe answered carelessly to conceal rising indignation at interference of mother if require anything there can go with by bye robert give compliment to miss grahame say from miss hamilton be particularly engaged with at present therefore can not keep engagement to day return here a soon a have delivered message mother burst from caroline lip in accent of uncontrollable anger a soon a servant have left room with strong effort checked hastily walked to window expression of extreme pain passed across mother feature a looked towards took notice till robert have returned have be dismissed with note to be given to emmeline to transmit with hers caroline then said with dignity yet perhaps le coldly than before if will give attention for short time will learn cause of displeasure be perhaps at present incomprehensible unless indeed own conscience have already reproached before commence on other subject must request that will make more appointment with miss grahame without permission be not first time have done so have not noticed previously because thought own good sense must have told that be acting wrong contrary to principle of candour believed to posse be always prejudiced against annie answered caroline with rising anger for have quite determined not to sit silent while mother spoke cost what might be not speaking of annie caroline to change in conduct since have become thus intimate with might indeed justify prejudice on be not now dwelling consider miss malison fit chaperon for daughter therefore desire will not again join in drive other girl of station have privilege of at least choosing own companion without animadversion replied caroline indignantly in simple thing of making appointment without interference be hard that alone be to be exception if look around circle in visit intimately caroline will find did act according to own wish must stand more alone than be to regard mine have done wrong in ever allowing to be a intimate with miss grahame a be looked surprised angry when mentioned change have taken place in conduct have sufficient reason for surprise replied caroline impatiently be not aware that character be so weak a to turn change with new acquaintance be then same girl be at oakwood demanded mr hamilton gravely yet sadly sudden pang of conscience smote heart of mistaken girl at word sob rose choking in throat longed to have given vent to tear pride anger remorse be summoning must not answered according to evil whispering before have only indulged in secret if be changed answered passionately be because papa be same at oakwood be free have full liberty to act speak think a pleased while here chain be thrown around simplest action very word be turned into weapon against friendship disapproved of in at least surely may have liberty to choose for have replied mr hamilton mildly complain not caroline of pain have inflicted upon in so completely withdrawing confidence friendship to bestow upon young girl control not affection be duty will obey to warn when see favourite companion likely to lead wrong have thought feeling be open to inspection a at oakwood must have trifled a have with most sacred feeling of fellow creature must have called forth love by winning art by marked preference to reject when acknowledged with scorn with triumph ill concealed must have sported thus with heart whose affection must do honour to favoured one on whom be bestowed must have cast aside in manner integrity honour hoped believed be own caroline have disappointed deceived parent have blighted fondest hope destroyed sinfully destroyed peace of noble virtuous excellent young man who loved with deep fervour of enthusiastic soul to have beheld husband must have fulfilled wish hope entertained by father must have intrusted happiness to care without one doubt arising within have spurned offer rejected without reason without regret without sympathy for wounded disappointed feeling without giving one hope that in time affection might be returned caroline why have thus decidedly rejected what be there in young man see to bid tremble for future happiness caroline answered not have leaned arm on cushion of couch buried face upon while mother spoke mr hamilton in vain waited for reply caroline continued in tone of such appealing affection seemed strange that touched not heart of child caroline will not intrude on confidence one question must ask implore to answer truly do love still caroline spoke not moved not mother continued if do why must hide from own mother caroline believe conduct changed towards have condemned without proof have abandoned sympathy shrunk from love try now sweet child if love confess will do what can to make love happy if be returned why must conceal if be not caroline child will refuse even poor comfort mother can bestow spoke in vain must have read daughter heart at moment maternal affection might not have be so deeply pained a be by strange silence regret deep though unavailing have be caroline portion from moment have reflected soberly on rejection of st eval recalled word look of respectful yet ardent admiration wept at infatuation have bade act a have done then look of controlled contempt stung to quick meant not perhaps that glance must have so clearly denoted that have sunk in estimation did not at moment did when in solitude recalled felt that deserved in vain in moment did struggle to call up vision of lord alphingham word of love look of even more fervid passion image must not rise to banish that of st eval if caroline have not still be blinded by influence argument of annie have given own good sense one half hour uncontrolled dominion must have discovered that if love have secretly unsuspiciously entered heart be not for lord alphingham have really loved must not have resisted fond appeal of mother to express in word confused indefinable emotion then filling heart be impossible continued for several minute silent mr hamilton felt too deeply pained disappointed to speak again daughter have spoken to morning a have seldom done even in childhood then mother must look forward to year of reason maturity for improvement of error now others have arisen if control be once so entirely thrown aside must ever regain sufficient influence to lead right seldom have caroline conduct given so much pain a in disclosure event of morning be absolutely necessary caroline at length said summoning a aunt eleanor have often done pride to drown whispering of conscience must love because rejected lord st eval in such important step a marriage must imagine own inclination be first to be consulted must be strange indeed if after have heard say on evil of forcing young woman to marry that must compel own child to accept first offer received do injustice caroline replied mother controlling with effort natural displeasure st eval must not accept unwilling bride after have passed must father deem worthy to become wife then long may paragon of excellence remain away replied caroline with indignant haughtiness kindling in feature have wish ever to associate again with one by whose side be deemed so unworthy even by parent who love best caroline be ever first to behold deplore fault have acted honourably have done worthily in exciting love merely to give pain to amuse gratify own love of power have done more than other girl do with impunity without even notice surely that be so generally practised can not demand such severe censure a bestow on therefore must make custom excuse for sin caroline must have spoken thus few month since must have questioned justice of mother sentence yet say be not changed be excuse for wrong action because others do have be differently instructed might be not when from earliest year have endeavoured to reason with to convince of sin of coquetry to from child have be inclined have acted more sinfully than many whose coquetry have be more general devoted to one alone encouraged flattered because saw be already attracted instead of adhering to distant behaviour must have at once told must feel no more for than a friend must have prevented future suffering by banishing from first secret hope wished to prove must accomplish more than others by captivating one so reserved superior a st eval interrupt by denial caroline for dare not deliberately say such be not motive that noble integrity have so long believed own have exiled from heart entire conduct towards st eval have be one continued falsehood be then worthy to be united to one who be truth honour nobleness have loved rejection of young man might have be excused not behaviour towards for not one good reason can be brought forward in excuse be speaking severely caroline perhaps word may alienate confidence affection still farther from duty will be done painful a may be to can not speak tamely on subject in future character welfare of child be concerned can no longer trust in integrity spite of change in manner in feeling towards still confided in unsullied honour can no longer do have forfeited confidence caroline not until see total change of conduct can ever hope to regain that perhaps will not grieve a must once have done unless redeem character continued serious displeasure of father will be yours will in probability find mean of withdrawing from society have be so injurious to purity of character others may do be duty to act according to principle of parent not to of others therefore for future desire will abide by criterion of right wrong not by misleading law of custom when have conquered irritation anger word have occasioned may perhaps agree to justice of what have said till then expect whether reason approves of not desire implicit obedience if have anything desire to do may leave caroline wish to detain longer in silence too sullen to give hope of repentant feeling judgment convinced caroline have listened to mother word be indeed unusually severe manner from beginning of interview must not have lessened displeasure already felt have known mr hamilton from commencement of career when a girl not older than caroline mingled with world can not fail to have perceived detestation of fashionable sin of coquetry remembrance of eleanor evil entailed upon by indulgence of sinful fault be still vividly acute cost what might to who be dearer still child must do duty endeavour to turn from evil path saw that caroline be in mood for gentle word tenderness to have effect therefore though at variance a be to nature spoke with severity usual unwavering decision must read promise of amendment contrition in haughty sullen feature urged more for might only exasperate lead farther from conviction for few minute caroline remained in same posture evil passion of varied nature suddenly appeared to gain ascendancy in innately noble heart prevented expression might have soothed mother solicitude hastily rising without word abruptly left room retired to own where gave vent to brief passionate flood of tear cooled not fever of brain haughty spirit revolted from mother just severity to be scolded threatened desired to obey like child infant what girl of age must bear tamely well might annie say be slave not permitted to act even think according to own discretion well might say other mother behaved to daughter a mine to be kept in complete thraldom to be threatened if behave better to be removed from scene so much love buried again at home suppose be wonder be changed be strange must no longer feel for mamma a formerly even emmeline must condemn call to account for action intimacy with annie be made subject of reproach if see a often a before can write thank heaven at least sympathy affection will be mine such be tenor of secret thought followed up by writing to friend lengthened heightened description of have occurred that morning dwelling long indignantly on what termed cruel unjust severity of mother imploring a such confidential letter generally did annie secrecy sympathy epistle be despatched quickly answered in style a might be imagined increased caroline feeling of indignation towards parent bade rely still more confidingly on false friend who taught to believe be almost only person who really cared for best interest day passed mr mr hamilton changed in coldness of manner towards child perhaps such conduct added fire to already resentful girl surely might be pardoned for acting a did caroline irritability increased annie secret letter be ever at hand to soothe while excited ever endeavoured to turn friend attention from what termed severe trial to devotion felt towards by lord alphingham declaring that interview confirmed more more belief in passionate admiration evil influence miss grahame letter have upon mind of caroline in private hour be apparent in manner to lord alphingham when chanced to meet even more guarded than have hitherto be did caroline become in behaviour towards when parent be present conduct have confirmed to heated mistaken fancy annie representation of unjustifiable severity indignant at rejection of st eval must unhesitatingly refuse consent to acceptance of viscount caroline thought not to ask how then be intimacy with to end only enjoyed present a much a must while coldness of parent amidst pride boasted stoicism still tortured to future annie a yet completely prevented looking miss grahame plan appeared indeed to thrive many be confidential triumphant conversation held upon subject with miss malison who became more more indignant at mr hamilton intrusive conduct in taking so much notice of lilla notwithstanding tale industriously circulated against own severity malevolence however appeared about to become foe for about time slight change with regard to happiness of injured pupil took place threatened to banish from mr grahame family one morning mr hamilton accompanied by ellen called on lady helen rather earlier than usual found friend not yet visible attack of indisposition confining to couch later than usual lady helen sending to entreat friend not to leave house without seeing mr hamilton determined on waiting annie have gone out with miss malison wonder poor lilla proceeds slowly in education remarked mr hamilton when footman gave information if be so much neglected father have right to expect much progress wish from heart must think of plan must tend not only to happiness of poor girl in end to of father also be fault now apparent in character judiciously removed feel confident mr grahame must have more comfort in than in of other child be always very different when be with observed ellen can never discover evil passion of so many accuse passionate be that might be controlled never can while miss malison remains with for treatment be such that year increase evil sound a of one sobbing violently in adjoining room interrupted conversation fancying came from object of conversation mr hamilton opened folding door discovered young friend weeping violently almost convulsively on sofa ever alive to sorrow of nature at age mr hamilton followed by ellen hastened towards what have happened lilla said soothingly what have chanced to call forth violent grief tell love know need not hesitate to trust with sorrow unused save from one dear friend to hear voice of sympathy kindness lilla flung arm passionately round neck clung to for few minute till choking sob permitted to speak aunt augusta say be so wicked so very wicked that mamma ought not to keep at home be not at too old to go to school mamma say that will go what occasioned aunt to advise alternative demanded mr hamilton gently oh because because know be very wicked must not help miss malison have be tormenting morning exciting anger then annie chose to do must to call forth before mamma so just told what thought of amiable confidant hate continued with vehemence even presence of mr hamilton must not restrain wish from heart must never see more if gave vent to such sinful word before mother replied mr hamilton gravely wonder at aunt suggesting what did how often have entreated to leave room when sister commences unkind endeavour to excite anger thus give mother proof of consideration for present state of health evince to sister that if can not calmly listen to word can at least avoid mamma never take notice however much may endeavour to please if must only caress praise sometimes know must be very different girl then must bear annie cruel word will not will never put up with permit miss malison to govern chain down spirit a try can to do one can ever know constant ill treatment receive from everything do word speak be altered to suit purpose mamma belief say will feel power one day when least expect will not be made so constantly miserable unrevenged lilla dear lilla exclaimed ellen imploringly speak thus know what say must not return evil for evil on sister pray let anger however just obtain so much dominion annie never treat a sister see why must practise such forbearance towards will do can indeed

look displeased with feel so very very wretched know deserve to lose kindness for never follow advice deserve that must hate a one else doe know have to endure oh let go from home can not persuade father to let remain at home dear girl replied mr hamilton drawing young companion closer to speaking with soothing tenderness because agree with aunt in thinking must be really best thing for then

intimate with mr douglas will very often come see when be in town midsummer holiday will also occur during time lastly if papa mamma will consent will see moorland year for will ask mr grahame to bring with in annual christmas visit to estate petition that will leave behind to spend whole of winter vacation with ellen at oakwood now be objection waived have very determined opponent more to bring forward lilla did not answer raised head from kind friend shoulder pushing back disordered lock of bright hair looked up in face a if more sorrow must be portion oh must remain at school whole year together if might spend vacation at oakwood with ellen emmeline exclaimed with glee a wild childish a former emotion have be lady helen at instant entered after languidly greeting mr hamilton ellen exclaimed for heaven sake lilla go away appearance be enough to frighten one must be absolutely ashamed of if friend be to come in unexpectedly perhaps may choose to obey now that mr hamilton be present little know what trouble be at home continued languidly flush of passion again mounted to lilla cheek ellen taking arm entreated to go with left room together while lady helen amused friend by long account of domestic misfortune insolence of upper domestic heedlessness of elder fearful passion of younger daughter even carelessness of husband manner towards notwithstanding evidently declining health similar sorrow be poured into sympathising ear of mr hamilton giving clearer clearer evidence of lady helen extreme increasing weakness of mind character great indeed be astonishment of indolent mother when mr hamilton urged necessity of sending lilla to school without accusing miss malison of want of judgment be yet enabled to work on lady augusta denhain word prove good effect that removal from home for few year might produce on lilla character lady augusta advice have be merely remembered during lady presence seconded a now be by earnest pleading of mr hamilton determined on rousing sufficiently to put in force if husband consented to obtain approbation be task too terrible for nerve entreated mr hamilton to speak with on subject willingly consented only requesting that lady helen must not mention intention to annie miss malison till husband have be consulted to lady helen willingly consented for in secret dreaded miss malison lamentation reproach when arrangement must be known when mr grahame in compliance with mr hamilton message called on following morning heard cause of summons surprise almost equalled that of wife knew dislike to plan of sending girl to school however might be in vogue almost in terror asked if proposed scheme because evil character of child required such desperate expedient be easy to prove to such be very far from meaning spoke more openly on character of lilla than have yet done for thought long year of intimacy demanded candour on part year while increased evil of lilla present situation heightened earnest desire to draw father child more closely together did not palliate fault proved that be increased by constant contradiction irritation have to encounter repeated have passed between preceding day unconsciously cautiously condemning grahame excessive sternness by relating almost verbatim lilla simply expressed wish that father must let love gained point softened agitated father felt self condemned a proceeded earnestly implored to give one more proof of friendship by recommending lady under whose care must with safety place erring yet naturally noble minded warm hearted child fashionable seminary be sure must do more harm than good listened with eagerness to mr hamilton description of mr douglas widow of naval officer who have for several year be in habit of educating ten young lady of highest rank mentioned one two who have be pupil whose worth mental endowment be well known to grahame be guided entirely by on subject so important said after recalling family to mind whose daughter have be placed there make inquiry of who know mr douglas see before quite decide have very high opinion of be certain must be sorry if be to place lilla with upon advice alone when in probability added with smile will find lady helen family opposed to arrangement a have never guided right when have interfered with child approbation disapproval will have little weight in determination answered grahame have awakened to sense of duty mr hamilton for can not sufficiently express gratitude with too much reliance upon opinion of others have regarded many tale brought against poor child now see how greatly fault have be occasioned by mistaken treatment thought once must never have parted with daughter for school now see will be kindness to do so pain a will now know may in time win affection advice will be followed must consent to part with for one vacation also replied mr hamilton playfully have promised in answer to weighty objection that will never see moorland again to persuade to let spend christmas at oakwood must consent will teach lilla lesson of rebellion carry off from mr douglas by force willingly gratefully exclaimed mr grahame will promise to permit to love to use own simple affectionate word before leaf will not terrify by cold sternness frequently manifest towards prove that take sufficient interest in to love more for conquest make faithfully faithfully promise kind friend then be satisfied replied mr hamilton countenance glowing with benevolent pleasure will trust one day succeed in making little lilla happy thus add to comfort of parent be old friend mr grahame added therefore hesitate to express pleasure have given by thus promising to think upon advice began to fear that must be displeased at interference deeming advice impertinent needle have endeavoured to impress upon lilla necessity of temporary absence from home have in part succeeded having lady helen sanction to speak with must hesitate no longer do hesitate one moment to act upon disinterested advice dear friend word be enough a so earnestly wish will very hour seek of friend who be acquainted with mr douglas must leave lilla to express gratitude for father mr hamilton be soon placed at rest regarding destination of young friend there be not dissenting voice a to mr douglas worth one general opinion of satisfaction prevailed most gratifying tribute grahame felt be affection esteem former pupil still fondly encouraged towards thus prepossessed appearance manner did much to strengthen resolve grahame now felt armed for encounter with who presuming on near relationship to wife must bring forward numberless objection to plan be agreeably mistaken lilla be looked upon by a such evil minded ill informed girl that signified little where be placed a generally brought discredit on who have anything to do with miss malison however excited sympathy annie declared be shameful dishonourable thing to dismiss without notice after so many year of devoted service to family poor lady helen have to encounter storm of upbraiding from daughter tear sob of governess at ill treatment received in vain lady helen accepted protestation that have done duty that be sure must be done for miss lilla have be done annie declared that though service be no longer required for ungrateful sister must not do without miss malison for mother health seldom permitted to walk drive out must absolutely die of ennui without one to act in case a chaperon in be ably seconded by mother family whose protegee miss malison have long be against better judgment grahame at length consented that miss malison must remain in family till must get situation a finishing governess of course miss grahame have determined must not be for little time mr hamilton have be particularly cautious in interview with mr grahame not to speak word for against miss malison perhaps have said what really thought even concession must not have be made mr grahame fixed sudden determination to send lilla to school be of course laid by annie confidant to mr hamilton charge increased not little prejudice against adding fresh incentive to scheme for destruction of peace caroline self willed conduct now rendered even more easy than have previously be when be arranged when be decidedly settled that lilla must join mr douglas establishment at conclusion of midsummer vacation father quietly entered study where be alone to give information really fond heart must not gaze on without admiration be now nearly fifteen though in look manner conversation from being kept under such continual restraint always appeared at first sight very much younger childlike in movement even impetuosity might have aided deception lady helen have so often indolently answered question concerning daughter age believed be about twelve thirteen at length really believed be so be annie miss malison interest to preserve illusion for be recognised a fifteen many privilege might have be acceded to very much at variance with interest annie have desire for rival to present have sister appeared in public must undoubtedly have be case lilla gave promise of beauty though not perhaps really so perfect a annie must certainly have attracted fully a much notice be drawing tiny wreath of brilliant flower on small portfolio be regarding with complacency added brilliancy to animated feature at father well known step looked up in little terror rose a be custom whenever first saw in morning fear must not check sparkling lustre of eye grahame taking hand said kindly have news for little girl trust will prove a agreeable a have reason to hope may mr douglas will gladly consent to receive lilla a inmate of happy family flush of animation sparkling lustre of eye faded on instant turned away why kind friend mr hamilton bade hope must be pleasing intelligence have deceived love continued father drawing with such unwonted tenderness to that after glance of bewilderment flung arm

alarming mysterious nature of have already alluded will be found in next chapter chapter vi malison dear malison congratulate game be in own hand exclaimed miss grahame one morning a entered private room of confidant about week after receipt of letter have mentioned with feature expressing triumphant yet malignant glee have be case week have not replied miss malison yes not so completely a at present caroline have just left be afraid of imparting in writing important intelligence have to give important indeed for save world of trouble though did allow to think on present situation of suffering believe must repent perfect innocent confidence in defence of character whenever be attacked almost touch heart mother intrusive mother must be paragon of sex rise before continually urge on will learn to cost that carefully trained child be not better than others have learned partly already by account remarked miss malison concealing under calm exterior detestation of mr hamilton have rejection of st eval assisted most agreeably did not expect that caroline own spirit self will must have aided so effectually that disappointment with st eval have affected mr hamilton more deeply than chooses to make visible coldness severity towards child spring from own angry mortified feeling however lay to score of caroline faulty conduct friendly letter have happily convinced caroline such be case in most sanguine expectation of triumph never imagined must succeed so well in severing link between mr hamilton daughter confidence be utterly at end between must be sufficient to gratify one vengeance for prejudice dislike with perfect creature regard must be more fully satisfied at present be only soothed now know chere malison be dying with curiosity to hear what new assistance have started up little more patience will know be aware with what bitter resentful feeling caroline regard treatment receives from parent also from emmeline child a be perfectly do wonder at in case immaculate mr hamilton doe not appear to practise what preaches be rather wonderful that one who say so much about gentle treatment doing more good than harshness must now make own child suffer beneath severity a said before malison severity be disguise for mortification annoyance lord st eval heir of malvern peerage be too good chance to be thrown away without vexation caroline be silly fool to act a did must say that for grateful a ought to be for assistance that foolish act have given a for rejecting merely for love of alphingham be complete farce more love viscount than do perhaps not so much make believe doe so intend to do till plan be fully accomplished love a must have done a in probability at present moment love lord st eval doe not never will will make fashionable pair not love match malison believe that mr hamilton may have exquisite pleasure of seeing daughter like other people however different may choose to be will rather do kindness than injury dear miss grahame fortunately for purpose will not think so will through caroline inflict deeper wound than ever thought to have done other injury must have touched pride on christian forbearance patience such like simply translated must be found to be nothing haughtiness pride utter insensibility to human feeling if caroline go wrong elopes perhaps a aunt did disregard parental command act in weighty affair of matrimony for why will be something like triumph for diplomatic scheme must work well on caroline mind to produce consummation observed miss malison doubt much whether must ever act in manner that must believe so contrary to duty must advise never to give time to reflect never mean to do so if silly girl have ever reflected at must at once have known that loved st eval not lord alphingham that mother be truest friend not annie grahame a chooses to remain so stupidly blind trusting why see harm in playing part a for consenting let hear honourable viscount sweet persuasive eloquence look on handsome pleading feature consent will quickly be obtained why must not demand at once of father mr hamilton be always friendly with when meet have just hit mark ma chere very truth be always stumbling block in machination for almost feared by mr hamilton manner towards that interesting tale concerning youth have intended must be poured into wife ear might be disregarded such from first have be intention have felt puzzled in degree how to set about nay do injury dearest miss grahame observed ex governess officiously from earliest year be never puzzled at anything wit deserted then for moment replied annie laughing must perhaps have returned when plot be ripe for execution be happy to say can dispense with assistance a have received most effectually from member of mr hamilton own family how exclaimed miss malison much astonished even so ma chere now come to important intelligence caroline brought morning appears that last week mr hamilton received letter from percy by account must have contained mysterious warning against very lord alphingham that attention to caroline have be not only remarked reported to conjuring father a valued caroline future peace to dismiss at once peremptorily thus much mr hamilton imparted to daughter few day after receipt of letter after bestowing little approbation on conduct towards know before parent be always particularly cold guarded requested rather desired that must gradually withdraw entirely from society a have received quite sufficient confirmation of letter to render anxious to break off further communication acquaintance with caroline be such simpleton wonder must prevent countenance from betraying a spoke suppose did for mr hamilton expressed satisfied by assurance that wish must not be forgotten whether letter contains other more explicit matter doe not know state of mind at present be miserable enough to touch heart be not quite so steeled a mine must almost smile at fond belief that really love for see own work tender passion a imago to break off intercourse with appears comparative torture have already convinced her of father injustice cruelty in acting thus capriciously towards one so well known so universally honoured merely from mysterious unsatisfactory letter from boy who know nothing about matter hinted very broadly that be only because parent be provoked at rejection of st eval a still have lingering hope must return did not choose to receive attention from one else saw eye flash cheek crimson with indignation against who have thus injured declared with more vehemence than expected that father mother percy must prevent choosing husband for violent burst of tear succeeded speech continued to soothe console left with spirit vowed determined to free from such galling tyranny what do think have be mood when first came to miss malison a expected expressed ignorance why weak simpleton thought of confessing whole tale of love to mother imploring comfort assistance take care doe not do so still remarked miss malison not have proved too clearly how ridiculous miserable must make herself by denouement mother said instead of pitying must assuredly condemn for past most probably convey at once to oakwood immure there till lord st eval came to release be terrified indignant at idea wonder must be do know if father have seen lord alphingham since arrival of letter once last night be fancied anguish felt for distress be unable a usual to soothe in consequence of keen surveillance of mother brought here morning to tell mr hamilton be still courteous more distant have convinced that a parent no longer treat with confidence have right to treat with a one know worthy character of viscount can be doing nothing wrong in proving to that feeling in favour be unchanged have hinted to to explain situation in be placed entre nous mean to do such thing for have plan of own to follow up be not aware how very intimate be with viscount how much confides in persuasion will tend to urge to ask of father be sure nothing can be more honourable than course of action nothing be sure echoed conscientious confidant how will assist former scheme most admirably mr hamilton will of course decidedly refuse consent without even consulting daughter anger of lord alphingham will be overpowering rage against father love for daughter will urge to mean to obtain hand caroline indignation against father for acting in way treating so much like child feeling will take care to create foster will second eloquence feel quite certain that next season caroline hamilton mingles in most fashionable circle a viscountess alphingham to obtain such triumphant end in opinion mean be faulty most assuredly not not only young lady whole family ought to be eternally grateful for without such manoeuvring doubt much whether perfect daughter self satisfied mother must obtain establishment in thing so desirable enraged a will be at first at such unexpected conduct in child have so ill treated will thank in end miss grahame depend upon if thought so malison on honour must feel disinclined to proceed one step further in business give cause to thank feel have unwittingly be of service to whom of whole sex hate most to one who from earliest year know regarded with aversion contempt malison must draw back on instant did think so will not will not be life of child a countess of alphingham will not be such a to bring peace to mr hamilton heart to mother might not to hers will behold in marriage complete failure of plan utter wreck of exclusive notion will see that pretended goodness christian example be not exemplified in caroline at least will feel power aye bitterly thus will triumph in caroline disobedience will be avenged for contempt dislike mother have ever shown to suddenly raised slight figure to full height looked on companion with countenance expressive of such malignant triumph that save companion in iniquity must have shuddered a beheld such youthful feature so deformed other conversation passed between able confidant a little more be said on subject most interesting to will not follow further annie evil scheme be already too clearly displayed mind unable a miss malison to comprehend exalted nature of mr hamilton character looked upon with detestation more so a feeling be ever acting believed hypocrisy that worth for even who visited not gave credit be not real character artful veil to conceal evil quality quick penetration of miss grahame have even in childhood discovered that be favourite accustomed to be spoiled flattered by with whom associated indignation dislike towards only one who must dare treat differently look on a mere child rendered ridiculous by affectation increased with year soon discovered influence possessed over caroline on knowing also fault determined to work thus effectually destroy peace of mother devoted to child prove to world that eccentric seclusion of mr mr hamilton for child benefit be productive of more good if a much a plain in eye only useful plan of fashionable education in first scheme have already succeeded more than be perhaps conscious affair of st eval have clearly painfully proved to mr hamilton that fear of wife night of caroline introduction anxious fear be indeed well founded have sunk beneath temptation integrity honour better feeling have be overcome by inordinate love of power mother from first have seen dreaded father heart be pained disappointed not only in that caroline now be not same a have be at oakwood change have come over darkening spirit rendered conduct at home gloomy distrustful uneasy irritability of childhood have returned very conversation appeared restrained since departure of lord st eval cheek have become pale eye no longer sparkling only in excitement of society parent beheld a formerly mr hamilton be deeply grieved knew not guessed not extent of wife anguish saw foreboding fear fulfilled confidence of child be entirely withheld from coldness with felt compelled to treat disregard of wish have felt assured completely alienated affection caroline must no longer love week day proved by hundred minute circumstance affection be fleeting mother despairingly felt never to return yet have done duty exercised natural authority to lead erring child in better way firm unshrinking discipline in childhood have only bound cord of affection between herself offspring more firmly together now in case of caroline appeared about to snap asunder fond heart yearned constantly towards daughter must not give way for sake of emmeline ellen whose effort vied with other to increase comfort happiness of so dearly loved affection confidence must not change however authority might interfere with wish must become repining gloomy because there be one source of sorrow amidst so many blessing pious heart struggled for submission obtained caroline guessed not deep pang have inflicted knew not many tear shed in secret many inward prayer offered up for however severe be chastening might be blessed bring back to deserted fold to bosom of mother knew not be annie conscious how fearfully plan have succeeded in inflicting pain very cheerfulness of mr hamilton striven for a be unwavering kindness of manner towards emmeline ellen increased irritability of caroline with indignation at mother coldness severity towards felt be indeed slave longed to throw aside that galling bondage what right have mother to treat thus why must action be controlled very friendship disapproved of felt be injured one therefore allowed thought for whom in truth have injured for same reason clung yet closer to annie in alone in present state of mind found full sympathy yet even with be not happy there be strange indefinable sensation in heart even to friend must not express there be void within deep yearning void tortured in solitary moment even society of lord alphingham must not wholly remove in solitude blindly taught to believe that void must be for how far erred future page must tell conduct in society meanwhile since departure of st eval have be guarded reserved parent fondly trusting displeasure have be of service relaxed after first fortnight in coldness mistrustful manner towards mr hamilton have hoped pale cheek dim eye proceeded from remorse have not caroline be so pointedly distant reserved when in society must have lavished on tenderness of former year when mysterious letter from percy came although caused parent considerable anxiety yet never once occurred that coldness on part towards lord alphingham must occasion caroline pain percy wrote with degree of eloquent earnestness must not be resisted guarded a information caution be mr hamilton determined implicitly to abide by young man wrote what annie have informed miss malison that have heard from more than one quarter of lord alphingham marked attention to sister that have even be congratulated on brilliant alliance caroline be about to make did not must not believe that such be case said for must then have heard from parent conjured father however casual viscount attention might be to withdraw caroline entirely from know well wrote father a value sister future peace expose not to many fascination if have endeavoured to win heart if have paid marked attention be villain dare not be more explicit be pledged to silence only to dear father on such emergency be privileged to write thus much desire caroline to give more encouragement however slight tell even may not only alarm be imparted perhaps to friend a young lady be fond of doing have once said never deceived father trust now be jest sister happiness be too dear to break off connection with lord alphingham give credit to rumour have heard for letter season bade hope lord st eval must have be sister choice departure from england have dispelled vision yet caroline affection can not have be given to lord alphingham without mother knowledge again implore associate more with be not worthy of father friendship mysterious a be yet mr mr hamilton knew percy too well to imagine must write thus without strong cause suspicion almost unconscious prejudice entertained towards by mr hamilton received confirmation by letter be pleased that husband determined no longer to encourage intimacy percy wrote if have paid caroline marked attention endeavoured to win heart be villain have done so mr hamilton must not feel sufficiently rejoiced at caroline apparent manner towards deceived a have be yet that once honourable child must so entirely forget principle of childhood a to give secret encouragement while conduct in society rather bespoke indifference pride than pleasure that caroline must have be led to act thus be thing so morally impossible to mr hamilton that have hesitation whatever in complying with percy request little imagining that in doing so placed inseparable bar to regaining confidence of child widened more painfully breach between caroline heart on receiving father command to withdraw by degree entirely from lord alphingham be wrung with many bitter contending feeling at first reproached for having thus completely concealed feeling have followed impulse of nature must at once have thrown on mother neck there confessed that loved that have long done so implore not to check intercourse without more explicit reason annie evil influence have be too powerful dreaded reproach on want of confidence in what be still worse satirical smile at ridiculous weakness then remembered mother displeasure at former conduct dreaded renewal of same coldness perhaps even increased control determined therefore to wait till have seen annie interview rendered more miserable excited still more indignation against parent brother strengthened feeling of devoted affection with fancied regarded lord alphingham annie continued note confirmed feeling under specious intention of soothing caroline wounded pride be very easy for to disguise repeated insinuation of mr mr hamilton injustice caprice towards viscount tyranny towards veil have thrown over caroline sober judgment became thicker more blinding caroline must sometimes scarcely restrain even before parent indignation so continually filled heart mr hamilton be ignorant of communication be so constantly passing between annie daughter might perhaps have put stop to caroline own maid fanny have be persuaded to become mean of receiving sending intelligence in secret conscience of girl reproached more than once idea be so improbable that miss caroline must act improperly that continued faithful to wish even against better judgment lord alphingham ready penetration be puzzled at change of manner in mr hamilton daughter latter must easily perceive be constrained to act thus determination to release from such thraldom became more strongly fixed within became a cold reserved to father a mr hamilton have be to silent yet despairing glance ever turned towards caroline be felt assured quite enough to rivet influence more closely around following morning a annie have expected viscount sought to give vent to fear about caroline indignation against unaccountable alteration in mr hamilton manner what must have caused have ever acted honourably nobly openly marked preference have talked into passion before companion offered to give advice speak comfort be determined daughter will not marry whom like in revenge for not accepting whom selected be resolved by studied display of coldness to bring to point so advise to speak to stern capricious father at once what good will do great deal if manoeuvre properly on quality fortunately require lesson from will at least discover mr hamilton intention if receive well good must be flattered at condescension if contrary will at least know on what ground stand situation in poor friend must be placed be worried to death with continual caprice of mamma papa must be charity in one to break chain in be held came to yesterday in deepest distress from caprice for what else can be have changed mr hamilton manner lord alphingham fancy became more more warmed a spoke vanity love be alike gratified answered eagerly may depend then on affection will not for fear of mamma play false not be to say if betray in eagerness to ask of father have never yet asked question though have discovered love if in demanding of father say have gained affection consequence will be if mr hamilton refuse will be borne instantly to oakwood there imprisoned till poor girl pine droop like chained bird without hope of freedom whereas if will only govern impetuous temper trust to affection friendship wish may be gratified with without mr hamilton advice will assist adorable girl how can ever repay exclaimed raising hand passionately to lip cheek of annie suddenly blanched cold proud smile curled lip answered in own spirit after prolonged interview viscount departed to act on advice ere day closed lord alphingham have sought mr hamilton with demonstration of respectful yet passionate affection solicited consent to address daughter warning of son strong term have used be engraved on mr hamilton mind scarcely must answer viscount with accustomed calmness politely decidedly refused adding that have hoped constant reserve of caroline manner must at once have convinced of feeling spared pain of refusing for honourable alliance lord alphingham proposed haughty somewhat triumphant smile played for second on viscount lip mr hamilton understood not import companion with many expression of wounded feeling injured honour departed leaving mr hamilton rather pleased than otherwise at affair a gave plausible excuse for withdrawing entirely from society imparted what have passed to wife agreed be better for caroline to say nothing of proposal determination for once be not thwarted by annie who thought better for lord alphingham to plead own cause at future time when idea of having be refused without consulting person principally concerned must excite yet greater indignation toward parent assist effectually cause of lover who leaving town for week two to prove to mr hamilton wounded feeling be pretence for other reason left to annie charge of preparing caroline mind for alternative might propose circumstance happened about time appeared greatly to favour scheme of annie lord alphingham expose caroline more powerfully to temptation duchess of rothbury have invited select number of friend to while away remaining week of london season at elegant seat be situated in lovely spot about twenty mile from metropolis amongst number of course included mr hamilton expressed very much disappointed when lady tendered excuse mr hamilton must not leave town have put mr myrvin case into hand of able solicitor wished to remain on spot to urge on business that might be completed before returned to oakwood be not likely said that affair must occupy much time whole circumstance being directly illegal have only be age poverty combined with shrinking sensitiveness from public gaze have prevented mr myrvin from coming forward at very first against persecutor specious tale have be brought forward to excuse illegality impose on bishop in whose diocese llangwillan be situated myrvin though must meet trial with resignation be too broken hearted to resist thus much mr hamilton have learned from arthur to whom wrote requesting to give minute account of whole circumstance earnestness seconded by entreaty of son succeeded in banishing arthur proud reserve mr hamilton be now engaged heart soul in benevolent scheme of exposing iniquity restoring injured clergyman to grieving flock must not therefore leave london mr hamilton who for mere amusement must not bear to part from child for only caroline be to accompany steadily resisted entreaty of friend for be firm hesitated when duchess seconded by daughter requested most persuadingly that if must not come must at least permit caroline to join have known so long have vanity to believe that if promise to guard child a if be own will trust with grace urged with pertinacity must not fail to be flattering will be a safe under care a be under observance of mother that doubt one moment replied mr hamilton earnestly if hesitated be from doubt of grace care kindness if caroline be willing to accept invitation father consent have permission thank good friend trusted in eloquence to prevail duchess said smiling with air of sincerity gratified mr hamilton quickly imparted to caroline accepted invitation in vain endeavoured to read on face of child whether be pleased otherwise circumstance caused mr hamilton rather to rejoice at caroline absence from london for time be to latter great preventive to enjoyment to in such elegant society might otherwise have looked forward annie grahame be much to own vexation excluded from select circle duchess have penetrated designing character regarded with prejudice a violent a be nature be only invited to large assembly included acquaintance not merely friend amazed at slight miss grahame at once determined that there catastrophe for have so long planned must take place detestation of mr hamilton be gratified to uttermost must lord alphingham be there be question crossed caroline mind repeatedly be a often demanded of friend annie must not must not tell must add perhaps ought to congratulate caroline on separation from a dread mandate have gone from parent surely must not wish to encourage society then must implore forgiveness sympathise so well in fancied distress describe that of lord alphingham in such heightened colour caroline unsophisticated a in thing still be felt truly miserable viscount sudden departure from town must have be unaccountable have not annie succeeded in persuading that be sure be entirely owing to caroline coldness mr hamilton unaccountable conduct mr hamilton did not at first approve of daughter leaving home without mother even to visit duchess of rothbury yielded to solicitation of wife knew that lord alphingham be somewhat of favourite with duke felt so assured that heart of child be entirely disengaged at least to that on account did not hesitate caroline conduct with regard to st eval have be convinced proceeded from pure love of coquetry must not believe have rejected because fancied loved have have no cause to do so since mr hamilton have spoken so seriously on subject caroline behaviour in public have be such a to excite approbation renew in measure confidence in integrity be more reserved manner to viscount when chanced to meet have led trustingly to believe command on head must be implicitly obeyed perhaps mr hamilton penetration have played false be strange that mother so long accustomed to divine thought feeling of child must have be thus blind to emotion with caroline believed regarded lord alphingham surely farther proof than be wanting to clearly demonstrate be not true love felt have be that real pure fervid passion must one so unused to art have concealed flushing cheek sparkling eye trembling voice must invariably have betrayed be infatuation blind maddening infatuation strengthened by indignation towards parent by wish to prove must throw off control choose for herself love whom where how liked without choice sympathy be thus completely veiled feeling can condemn mother for refusing to believe child have trained watched prayed for so long such adept in deceit can blame want of penetration in instance think unnatural in

accounted for excused absence by stating that lord alphingham have received disagreeable letter from agent of in scotland demanded instant presence that intended passing through london thence proceed to north where in probability must await hunting season being engaged to join large circle of noble friend must be useless to linger on impotent fury of lord alphingham when discovered well conceived

when in presence of duchess of rothbury caroline felt most uncomfortable family be a cordial a ever there be somewhat in cold penetrating eye of grace that bade almost unconsciously shrink from meeting glance in previous season duchess have ever singled caroline out a object of especial regard circumstance so unusual in one of character that rendered present haughty coldness more difficult to bear caroline must have borne in silence have only extended towards appeared a if emmeline ellen shared contempt perhaps have justly called forth on a duchess tenacious of penetrative power feared to honour of with favour lest must be again deceived caroline longed to undeceive on point to give just estimate of sister cousin character acknowledge how far superior in filial respect affection a well a in innate integrity uprightness be to herself mother entreated to let time do work wait till duchess discovered be not what believed be might be checked wish will here mention circumstance occurred in mr hamilton family soon after arrival in town occasioned mr hamilton uneasiness ellen health be now perfectly re established on miss harcourt unexpected departure mr hamilton have determined on introducing niece with emmeline in present season if lucy have remained in family ellen must not have made debut till following year not that age be obstacle for there be only eight month difference between emmeline retiring disposition delicacy of constitution caused mr hamilton to think plan most advisable when however there be longer excuse with regard to failing health miss harcourt with whom evening at home might be more agreeably spent mr hamilton by advice of husband changed intention emmeline even made joke with ellen on admirable fun must have together rejoicing that important event in life of must take place on same day so happened that ellen never appeared to enter into cousin everlasting merriment on subject still said nothing for against till day important with ordering elegant dress for occasion timidly hesitatingly then ventured to entreat aunt still to adhere to first plan allow to remain quietly at home under care of elli till following year mr hamilton cousin looked at with astonishment former smilingly replied must not indulge niece in what appeared unfounded fancy dress must order for hoped must change mind before day arrived a unless very good reason be given must not grant request ellen appeared distressed conversation changed subject be not resumed till day actually arrived in evening of be to accompany aunt to ball at marchioness of malvern two day after be engaged at dinner party at earl of elmore summoning courage ellen entered aunt boudoir in morning again made request with earnestness almost startled mr hamilton particularly a be accompanied by depression of manner now did not very often permit to obtain ascendency with affectionate persuasiveness demanded reason of extraordinary resolution surprise gave way to displeasure when found ellen have really none to give only entreaty be that might not be desired to go out till next year why dear ellen must have reason for intended seclusion last year fancied wished much to accompany ever regretted delicate health prevented have made change mind so completely have distaste for society in mingle falteringly almost inaudibly ellen answered none be religious motive do principle revolt from amusement be now before tell candidly ellen know nothing displeases so much a mystery can forgive everything else for then know relative position be satisfied be not going far wrong when reason be studiously concealed can not guess truth must fancy be at least mistaken notion blinding better judgment did not expect second mystery from ellen mr hamilton expressive voice clearly denoted be displeased niece after two three ineffectual effort to prevent finally burst into tear wish to be harsh with accuse unjustly continued aunt softened at unaffected grief beheld if reason be good one why do so carefully conceal have be lately so very open with appeared to regard so truly a friend that present conduct be to not only riddle painful reflection be because conscience forbids perhaps in solitary moment have fancied that worldly amusement even in moderate way in regard unfits for more serious consideration fear perhaps to confess such be reason because will seem reproach to if such really be motive fear to confess dear girl must be very last to urge to do anything be against idea of what be right to prove fallacy of such reasoning to show that may be truly religion without eccentricity certainly must endeavour to do must not force to go out with till argument have convinced fancy by blushing cheek have really guessed cause of extraordinary resolution sorry a will be if have reason however mistaken be better than continued mystery indeed indeed be not so good a believe replied ellen with much emotion be not religious motive imagine that urge to act contrary to wish did know reason be sure must not blame pray command to tell must obey if do then then if approve of reason a say will what be that fear why if conscience doe not reproach do still hide from ellen be painfully silent mr hamilton continued in tone of marked displeasure fear be to find again deceived in ellen though in what manner a yet know not will not do such extreme violence to inclination a to command to yield to wish if desire so much to remain at home do so can not engage to make excuse for neither failing health being too young can now bring forward must answer inquiry for with truth that own wish must not by persuasion overcome alone keep at home conscience will still be clear from reproach so plentifully showered on by world last season feared to bring forward orphan niece with daughter lest charm must rival theirs did ill natured ignorant dare to say such thing of demanded ellen startled at remark knew not cause of never appearing in public therefore a appearance be against scrupled not to condemn do heed do remark affect exclaimed ellen earnestly ellen have done duty will still do undisturbed by such idle calumny even must now be believed by whose opinion value who from seclusion may imagine have good reason in conduct towards last two year have nothing to reproach last two year oh never never from first moment be under care never can conduct to have given cause for self reproach dearest aunt oh say that gratification of wish will give rise to suspicion so unjust so unfounded entreated ellen seizing with impetuosity hand of aunt in probability will speak in strain now ellen accord not well with mystery of word mr hamilton coldly withdrew hand there be moment silence for ellen have turned away pained to heart core soon after quitted room to seek own where throwing on low seat by side of couch gave way to unrestrained violent flow of tear mr hamilton little knew internal struggle niece be enduring cause of seclusion that term of self condemned probation be not fulfilled that long tedious task be not accomplished that be for purpose so earnestly desired that time might not be occupied by amusement till task be done error of earlier year atoned mr hamilton have seldom felt more thoroughly displeased hurt with niece than at present moment gentle invulnerable a ever seemed to irritation open a day have ever endeavoured to frame child character in like manner ingenuousness always obtained forgiveness might have be mistake fault ellen have always be subject of anxiety watchfulness last two year reserve have so entirely given place to candour that solicitude have much decreased till recalled by resolution have recorded have ellen alleged reason must have be well mr hamilton must not have thought on subject so seriously mystery in conduct have once before be so productive of anguish that mr hamilton must not think with usual calmness temper on circumstance be so long before ellen regained composure that trace of tear be visible even when joined family at dinner be remarked by uncle who jestingly demanded what must occasion sign of grief at important era in life vainly ellen hoped aunt must spare pain of answering by even expressing displeasure at resolution waited in vain be compelled to own that era of life to uncle so playfully referred be postponed by own earnest desire till next season mr hamilton put down knife fork in unfeigned astonishment why what be meaning of sudden change exclaimed be not wont to be capricious ellen will aunt explain marvellous mystery be sorry can not mr hamilton replied in tone plainly betrayed to quick ear of husband that be more than usually disturbed be not in ellen confidence resolution be a extraordinary to a to for have given reason mr hamilton said more looked vexed ellen did not feel more comfortable detained a be about to leave room briefly demanded in what manner intended to employ many hour now that miss harcourt be away must have to herself crimson flush mounted to ellen temple a spoke flush combined with hesitating tone in answered to read work might well justify sternness of tone manner with uncle replied ellen have never deceived might trust spite of flushed cheek hesitating tone a be conduct last two year urge to do so notwithstanding appearance say be beware how deceive second time ellen cheek lost colour became for space of minute pale a death so much so that mr hamilton regretted husband must have spoken so severely rallying energy ellen replied in steady very low voice conduct uncle during aunt absence from home have be will ever be open to inspection of household be too well aware that be undeserving of confidence appeal to elli on whose fidelity know rely to prove to in case suspect unjustly last word be audible be deeply pained ellen retired to own room did not quit even to see favourite cousin decked for ball emmeline sought however tried by kiss to recall truant rose banished smile mr hamilton did not come to wish good night ellen heart be heavy few day passed mr hamilton accepted three several invitation without again expressing wish though subject be not resumed equal perplexity existed in mind of aunt niece ellen did not accuse mr hamilton of unkindness must not fail to perceive that no longer retained confidence that knowledge painfully distressed orphan easily excited feeling circumstance gave additional pain strange apparently capricious behaviour have be casually mentioned to herbert aware that advice be always acceptable to ellen ventured to remonstrate with playfully to reason out of what termed extraordinary fancy for seclusion indefinable sensation ever prevented ellen from speaking writing to herbert a must have done to other member of family answered acknowledging deserved hinted reproach owning that must not change conduct even in compliance with request nevertheless grieved much to know that whose approbation unconsciously ardently wished to gain must believe capricious unaccountable being be evident did still persevered more might have to endure be petty trial to secretly chastened mind might bend must not weakly bow knew if aunt be conscious of attention much a perhaps might approve of motive must deem needle sacrifice probably prohibit continuance if permitted encouraged merit of action must no longer exist must indeed while in enjoyment of praise have finished task commenced carried on purely for sake of duty a atonement for past by sacrifice of inclination make peace with gracious god have offended petty trial be welcome then for if met with christian temper christian spirit might hope that might endure be progressing in path whose way be pleasantness whose path be peace must remove lingering displeasure distrust of aunt uncle must be quite happy so happened that emmeline next engagement be to opera be always ellen greatest conquest of inclination have amused by superintending cousin dressing sigh so audibly escaped that emmeline instantly exclaimed ellen know must like to go with in name of be incomprehensible why do stay at home because much a own must like to go with like better to stay at home really be spirit of contradiction ellen what did sigh for not for opera emmeline then why because can not bear to feel aunt have lost confidence in be marvellously silly ellen mamma be just same to a usual have observed difference dear emmeline coldness be not seen be felt a have be so happy a never to have felt can not understand what mean do ever wish to feel look so sorrowful dear ellen mamma coldness be awful thing to encounter own if have never felt how can judge said playful voice beside for emmeline have be too deeply engrossed in arranging disarranging wreath of rose in hair ellen too much engaged in own thought to notice entrance of mr hamilton be possible be not yet ready emmeline what have be about teasing ellen mamma besides fanny be engaged must not please rather be disinclined for exertion have be watching last few moment have played with pretty wreath till be nearly spoiled plead guilty dear mamma let fanny come will be ready in second answered emmeline looking archly caressingly in mother face mr hamilton smiled turned a if to speak to niece ellen be gone be sitting in own room few minute afterwards endeavouring to collect thought sufficiently to understand book of new opera cousin have lent when be interrupted by hand gently placed upon leaf so coldness be felt not seen be dear ellen well then let that kiss banish for ever exclaimed mr hamilton encircling delicate form of niece with arm have be more distant unkind perhaps than be necessary mysterious resolution irritated beyond forbearance have be very unjust very cruel have not will forgive ellen looked up in face unable to control feeling threw arm around burst into tear nay dearest let leave in tear be satisfied have good reason for conduct though usual penetration be entirely at fault will quite content by looking steadily in face assuring that conscience never reproach conduct will not have one lingering doubt then ellen smiled through tear a tried to obey lip so quivered a answered that mr hamilton laughingly added that must never do in court of justice silly little girl one must pronounce innocent if thus tearfully affirmed a generally compel to regret severity when do venture to use must be content to let follow own inclination year at least next season give such licence nolens volens a percy must say must take out with will not hide in solitude fancy resolution will hold good even remainder of season added smilingly pray try to turn from dear kind aunt said ellen earnestly deserve indulgence from for know how much dislike concealment indeed indeed will never regret kindness will not abuse be only because because hesitated excite curiosity too painfully ellen in return for indulgence said mr hamilton sportively dear aunt only wish to finish task have set various avocation during day prevent having time unless take from such amusement said ellen blushing a spoke indeed be real only reason mr hamilton fixed anxious
