shelter for night to morrow sun will soon guide thee to frontier town thy road will be easy then night be falling so fast now thou hadst best not linger arthur did linger till once more have drawn from confession of love that none other must take place even while conjured never to seek again so parted five minute more there be not vestige of human form on wide extended plain chapter iii now

felix d'estaban to produce witness on appearance desired one of father to administer oath chapter xix unaltering cheek still vividly doth hold natural hue eye quail not be innocence mr hemans during examination of don alonzo of aguilar of old pedro juana prisoner remained with arm calmly folded head erect without smallest variation of feature position denoting anxiety agitation don alonzo statement be very simple described exact spot where have found body position in lay intense agitation of stanley bloody appearance of clothes hand face urging to secure person even before discovered broken fragment of sword lying beside corse account be corroborated in very minutest point by men who have accompanied even though cross questioned with unusual particularity by father francis old pedro statement though le circumstantial be to soldier citizen especially quite a convincing gave wordy narrative of senor stanley unnatural state of excitement from very evening have become lodger that have frequently heard muttering to such word a blood vengeance constantly appeared longing for something never eat meal provided for sure proof in old pedro imagination of disordered mind that night of murder have heard leave house with symptom of agitation old juana with very evident reluctance confirmed account father francis be evidently not satisfied amongst incoherent raving of prisoner did ever distinguish word beurder ' demanded question must be strange indeed in court of justice of present day of importance in age when such word a blood vengeance amongst warrior simply signified determination to fight out quarrel in so called honorable combat answer after hesitation be in negative did ever distinguish name a object of senor stanley desired vengeance pedro immediately answered there be simper of hesitation in old juana caused sub prior to appeal to please reverence only chanced to hear poor young man say 'oh marie marie ' one day when brought dinner put away untouched though put best cooking in slight scarcely perceptible flush passed over prisoner cheek brow king muttered exclamation father francis brow contracted several of noble looked uneasily from one to other at what time did prisoner leave apartment night of murder continued sub prior exactly a great bell of cathedral chimed eleven be ready reply from pedro juana at same moment did hear nothing hasty movement a describe did not call for attendance light remember be on oath continued sternly a observed hesitation with old pedro muttered that juana be silent church punishes false swearer did speak not called for light please reverence did not choose to obey at hour so late sternly responded father francis by such neglect may be guilty of accelerating death of innocent concealing real murderer allege that senor stanley returned from military duty at sunset slept from then till just before eleven so soundly that must not rouse even for evening meal be strange for man with murder in thought again that called for light neglected to bring senor stanley asserts that missed sword rushed from house without culpable neglect then prevents discovering truth of assertion yet acknowledge called loudly for light appears too unlikely to have be case have prisoner quitted house with intention to do murder intention at moment might not have have reverend father interposed head of associated brother who have taken active part in examination be there evidence a to premeditated desire of vengeance premeditated insult long entertained enmity conclusion might have foundation a case stand weigh little where evil passion have be excited opportunity for indulgence be not likely to pas unused evidence of long entertained enmity premeditated vengeance have not yet examined replied sub prior if only rest on supposition of old couple in one of whom be pretty evident prejudice be stronger than clearly defined truth methinks that despite circumstantial evidence there be still hope of prisoner innocence more especially a have one other important fact to bring forward be certain continued addressing old pedro that bell chimed eleven when senor stanley quitted dwelling man answered firmly in affirmative will swear that senor slept from sunset till that hour dare not swear to reverence for juana be at neighbor for part of time on return juana took up supper again found so exactly in same position a have left that must not believe have even moved be alone in house during interval maid beta be at work in room below senor stanley let be brought here order be so rapidly obeyed that be very evident be close at hand so terribly alarmed at presence in stood a to compel sub prior to adopt gentlest possible tone to get answer at merely inquired if during absence of master mistress have heard movement in prisoner room said that thought have quiet stealthy step also sound a if door in back of house closed sound be so very indistinct have felt at time more like dream than reality commencement of storm have so terrified that did not dare move from seat what hour be might have be about nine must not say exactly from assertion that did hear slight sound though puzzlingly cross questioned never wavered king sub prior looked disappointed chief of santa hermandad expressed confirmed in previous supposition prisoner retained calmness gleam of intelligence seemed to flit across feature must speak senor stanley interposed king a girl be dismissed must gladly hear must simply say highness replied stanley gratefully that be not unlikely beta may have heard such sound be convinced evening draught be drugged same secret enemy who did to give opportunity undiscovered to purloin sword may nay must have entered chamber during deathlike sleep committed theft be to burden innocent man with deed of guilt deep stillness in house might have permitted ear to catch step though sleep be too profound must hardly have have time to waken rise commit deed of death return to completely deceiving semblance of sleep in short hour of pedro juana absence if have what madness must have led there again so appalled a to prevent effort of escape conscience replied chief of santa hermandad sternly impelling of divine spirit whom have profaned who in justice so distracted a to lead blindly to own destruction marvel darkness oppressed storm appalled that heaven in wrath must ordain event have described fall over own victim horror thence proceeding have heard that early year have be honorable senor stanley to such guilt be appalling even in accomplishment methinks father francis need now evidence of premeditation pardon brother such conclusion be somewhat over hasty be scarcely probable have senor stanley returned after committal of such deed that reentrance must not have be heard a well a departure whereas witness expressly declares that though attention be awakened by previous faint sound listened frequently never heard movement till master mistress return a went into senor room directly found without very least appearance of having moved justice compels to incline to belief in senor stanley suggestion that must scarcely have have sufficient time to rouse depart do murder feign sleep during pedro benito brief interval of absence will grant that so may be reverend father what proof have that murder have not be just committed when body assassin be discovered father francis replied by commanding appearance of don ferdinand steward after customary formula inquired what hour late lamented master have quitted mansion night of murder man replied without hesitation exactly a chime played quarter before nine be not that unusually early hour of meeting at castle be ten distance from don ferdinand mansion not twenty minute ride scarce forty minute walk be perfectly certain a to hour can take oath upon reverence lopez will say same sainted master jesu rest soul called to few minute before entered lady room told not to get horse ready a must walk to castle lopez asked a to who must attend reply be must go alone have done so before so be not surprised be grieved at look for seemed of suffering unlike be noticing to other a passed after quitting lady so quickly so absorbed that did not return salutation never in life neglected to do before poor poor master little did think must never see again man unconstrained burst of grief excited anew indignation of spectator against crime till then almost forgotten in intense interest a to fate of accused lopez be called corroborated steward account exactly if left house at quarter before nine at what hour think must reach calle soledad from ten to fifteen minute past hour reverence unless detained by calling elsewhere on way did mention intention of so doing answer be in negative according to account then murder must have taken place between nine ten senor stanley be not heard to quit apartment till eleven must corroborate own assertion that deed be committed ere reached spot what proof have that don ferdinand be not detained on way replied chief of santa hermandad domestic assert more than hour of quitting house hour of royal meeting be ten rejoined sub prior be noted for regularity be not likely to have voluntarily lingered so long a not even to reach calle till one hour afterwards not voluntarily have heard that appeared more suffering than be ever seen to do illness might have increased so cause detention yet on even partial recovery know well enough to believe must still have endeavored to join highness must there be evidence that when brought to castle have be dead at very least three hour let curador benedicto come forward respectable man dressed in black recognized at once a leech doctor of royal household obeyed summons on being questioned stated that have examined body very moment have be conveyed to castle in hope of discovering sign of animation however faint life be totally extinct according to judgment have be so at very least three hour what hour be just hour after midnight brief silence followed leech dismissal ferdinand still seemed perplexed uneasy not one countenance of noble associated brother evinced satisfaction task instead of decreasing in difficulty becomes more more complicated lord brother observed sub prior after waiting for chief of santa hermandad to speak have positive proof senor stanley really slept from hour of sunset till eleven same evening never quitted quarter until then might hope that sentence of curador benedicto a to length of time life have be extinct in supposed victim might weigh strongly against circumstantial chain of evidence brought against believing that prisoner having slept from hour of sunset to eleven be proven witnessed fact undertook defensive argued in favor sound heard by girl beta may may not have proceeded from stealthy movement of accused yet justice forbids passing by unnoticed time of movement being heard that of murder according to leech evidence tally so exactly that can not doubt one have to do with other whether be indeed prisoner step that of base purloiner of sword united judgment must decide individual supposition in matter of life death can be of avail belief a may have discovered incline to prisoner innocence brother chief hermano a strongly belief in guilt must appear a if evidence support one judgment equally with other contradictory complicated have yet be truthfully brought forward strictly examined united judgment senor hermanos must therefore decide prisoner fate under favor reverend father evidence have not be brought forward rejoined chief hermano methinks that be still to come be most important of whole that business be complicated judgment most difficult acknowledge therefore gladly avail myself of remaining point on scale may turn sworn a be to administer impartial justice prejudice against prisoner can have none point have until now overlooked appears sufficient to decide not only individual general opinion mean premeditated vengeance sworn by prisoner against deceased long indulged proclaimed enmity premeditated determination to take life lose own don ferdinand morale be soul assoilized be so universally beloved so truly friend of rank condition of men to believe in existence of other enmity towards person be almost impossible have evidence that prisoner be at feud with be harboring design against for week may be be even refused by don ferdinand meeting desired so sought vengeance by midnight dagger let evidence of enmity be examined according not a premeditated malice be elicited so let judgment be pronounced ay so let be muttered king a loud murmur of assent ran through hall have two witness for by heaven if one differ from other in smallest point prisoner may still be reprieved whether royal observation be heard not there be rejoinder for at summoning of chief hermano don luis garcia stood before assemblage appearance excited surprise in many present in none more than prisoner raised head have be resting on hand during address of sub prior reply of hermano looked at new witness with bewildered astonishment a don luis continued relation of stormy interview between deceased accused word of threatening used by latter astonishment changed into indignation loathing impossible to be restrained thou base dishonored villain exclaimed so suddenly wrathfully that startled more by strange contrast with former calmness than by irreverent interruption to formula of examination where wert thou during interview hearing so well so invisibly concealed none voluntary spy must have heard so skilfully detailed that thou wouldst seem in very truth witness a well a hearer what accident must have led thee to most retired part of don ferdinand garden being there detained thee thou treacherous villain on thy evidence evidence so honorably so truthfully obtained life death depends well be so so will not be interposed king ere either sub prior hermano must reply even a prisoner ourselves hold evidence dishonestly obtained of little moment nay of weight whatever be pleased don luis garcia to explain casualty led at important moment to don ferdinand ground name other witness voluntary listener be in mind dishonorable a liar demanding more account with mien voice of deepest humility don luis replied grieving that earnest love of justice must expose to royal displeasure submitting meekly to unjust suspicion a concerned still upholding truth correctness of statement other witness to same added mysteriously have already named to royal highness wait pleasure replied king don felix d'estaban be pleased to conduct last witness to presence chapter xx love be strong there came strength upon woman fragile heart frame there came swift courage mr hemans death have pang more keen than oh wherefore art thou here mr hemans profound silence followed don felix departure don luis have so evidently evaded king demand a to how have witnessed important interview that even most prejudiced in favor on account of extreme sanctity found doubting honor who have involuntarily be prejudiced against by indefinable something pervading countenance voice doubly rejoiced that unspoken antipathy have foundation in modern court of justice to refuse validity of evidence merely because manner of obtaining be supposed dishonorable must be pronounced acme of folly romance in age of write in spain especially sense of honor be so exquisitely refined that king rebuke determination not to allow validity of don luis evidence unless confirmed by honorable witness excited surprise noble nay one of associated brother there present must have said same eager wonder a to person of witness on whom so much stress be laid became absolutely intense prisoner be very evidently agitated cheek flushed paled in rapid alternation suppressed painful exclamation escaped from a don felix re entered leading with female form faint sound be unheard save by king sub prior who have be conversing apart during d'estaban absence lost in irrepressible burst of wonder sympathy broke from within hall a in new witness despite change of garb look from dazzling beauty of health peace to attenuated form of anxiety sorrow recognized at once widow of murdered donna marie be universal sympathy lessened when on partially removing veil to permit clear view of scene around sweet face be disclosed to profoundly almost unnaturally calm indeed cheek lip be perfectly colorless ashy whiteness of former rendered more striking from long black lash resting upon unwetted by single tear from peculiarly dark eye appearing larger from attenuation of other feature one steady inquiring glance be seen to fix upon prisoner then bent in homage to sovereign emotion if there be passed unseen sit lady said king with ready courtesy touched more than must have imagined possible by change fourteen short day have wrought must feign render compelled summons a brief little fatiguing a may be none can grieve more than at harsh intrusion on thy hour of sorrow in great measure doom of life death rest with thee justice forbids neglecting evidence so important sit lady command need not gracious sovereign strength will not fail replied marie sweet voice falling distinctly on ear while stanley started at calmness gracefully refused seat don felix proffered give more thought to than to other witness be not subject place to sit in presence of sovereign ferdinand kindliest feeling be excited instead of permitting sub prior to give necessary detail with characteristic brevity clearly kindly narrated progress of evidence for against prisoner how great weight laid on proof if there be of acknowledged enmity premeditated injury on part of accused towards deceased question to be compelled to request reply be simply be aware of cause of hatred existing between accused deceased have ever heard opprobrious insulting epithet used by former latter threat implying that death of don ferdinand morale be desired by prisoner have ever seen prisoner draw sword upon deceased have reason to believe that don ferdinand have ever refused intended to refuse to meet prisoner in honorable combat so urged gratification of vengeance by deed of murder reverend father continued king be pleased to administer customary oath father francis instantly rose from seat taking large richly embossed silver crucifix from monk who have administered oath to other witness approached marie henriquez morale said a reverentially held solemn symbol of religion

enhanced awful responsibility of oath that thrilled throughout multitude a have never done before so deep be stillness followed that not one of vast crowd seemed to breathe to prisoner be moment of intense emotion for if indeed marie have once told truth that oath to even in solemnity be a nought ere must even think a to wording of answer that answer came so distinct so unfalteringly spoken that there be not one person present who even strained ear to catch word reverend father said be grateful for thy counsel believe be well advised of truth solemnity of word speak can not aid grace subject in decision a to prisoner sentence evidence be valueless belong to race whose word be never taken a witness for against in court of justice can not take oath required for deny faith in be administered

there be contamination in remaining by side then stood a rooted to ground hand convulsively grasping crucifix have nearly fallen from hold lip apart nostril slightly distended eye almost starting from socket in horrified astonished gaze fixed upon pale fragile being who have dared speak such impious word attendant father rose simultaneously formed semicircle round superior ready at slightest signal to hurl down on anathema of church reverence to sub prior alone preventing curse from instantly bursting forth noble associated brother ferdinand started almost unconsciously to foot eager rush brought many of citizen still nearer to scene of action prisoner with irresistible impulse darted forward ere one have recovered from trance of bewilderment have flung at marie foot marie marie

fiercely for freedom for one hour power to protect in vain look fixed upon a be torn from from contrast with previous profound calm did indeed seem almost of madness excitement have enabled to make dread avowal avowal comprising such variety terrible danger that magnitude of sacrifice comprised in confession can now scarcely be understood danger not merely from vengeance of church for long year of fraud from secret awful tribunal of whose existence be conscious though not of close vicinity not merely danger from wrath terror of secret member of own faith who might naturally imagine own safety endangered in suspicion engendered by rash confession of have thought have believed strengthened to brave bear possible suffering rather than breathe word must seal stanley fate now that have spoken though must not have recalled if must such overpowering crushing sense of have drawn upon such fearful spectral shape of indefinable horror came upon a sub prior stood again before with

starting from seat authoritatively waved back denouncing monk bent over duke of murcia don felix d'estaban lord of aguilar several other noble following sovereign example hastened to assistance to restore animation be not in power on king whispered command don felix gently even tenderly raised bore in arm from hall even in moment of excitement ferdinand must not forbear glancing at prisoner whose passionate struggle to escape from guard when marie fell have be noticed by unhappily combined with previous irritation confirmed unspoken suspicion of many a to real cause of enmity against don ferdinand expression of countenance be of such contending terrible suffering that king hastily withdrew gaze vainly endeavoring to disbelieve a have done truth of garcia charge order be at length universally restored after brief silence chief of santa hermandad demanded of prisoner if have aught to say in defence reply to don luis garcia charge reply be stern determined negative deputed so to do by sub prior who seemed so absorbed in horror of marie daring avowal a to be incapable of further interference hermano proceeded to sum up evidence a widow of deceased have so strangely yet effectually deprived of evidence said thought slight regard ought to be paid to don luis garcia word even without doing so circumstantial evidence though contradictory complicated be enough in opinion

isabella that in consideration of complicated contradictory evidence of prisoner previous high character of strongly protested innocence respite of one month must be granted between sentence execution to permit prayer to be offered up throughout spain for discovery of real murderer at least allow time for proof of innocence to appear during time prisoner must be removed from hateful dungeon have

difficult to define seemed a if thought be on other than king courteously thanked assemblage for aid in matter so momentous at once ratified suggestion associated brother be satisfied that be isabella

presence be surely not so terrible that thou shouldst tremble thus poor child hast thou aught more to communicate aught for private ear that of highness consort if not will not exhaust thy little strength by useless question in tone so low faltering that ferdinand be obliged to bend down head to hear novice replied that if messenger have be despatched to village errand be sufficiently accomplished father ambrose have merely charged to say that real murderer have confessed crime that sin have be incited by such horrible train of secret guilt that particular be deferred till must be
