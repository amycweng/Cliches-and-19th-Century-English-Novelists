delicate task of surveying ground confident that attack on barbacan must demand whole strength attention of besieged thus effectually cover movement plan succeeded fearful shout seconded by tremendous discharge of huge stone of rattled against massive wall in vain others flying across moat crushing of men on inner wall be first terrific sound unexpectedly greeted aroused attention of scotch armor of foe flashing through mist furious charge of knight up to very gate of barbacan seemingly in sterner more compact array than of late have be wont immense body followed appearing in dim light more numerous than reality struck momentary chill on scottish garrison unwonted emotion be speedily dissipated by instant unhesitating sally of sir christopher seaton brave companion impetuosity of charge suddenness of appearance despite great disparity of number caused english moment to bear back kept in full play until nigel men at arm rushing over lowered drawbridge joined in strife brief very brief interval of fighting convinced scottish leader that master spirit now headed foe that be struggling at infinitely greater odds than before unity of purpose greater sagacity military skill be now at work against scarce knew wherefore for recognized same war cry same banner there be same gallant show of knight for in desperate melee be scarcely possible to distinguish noble form of lancaster from

besieged from barbacan have gallantly successfully driven foe that trifling success be so counterbalanced by serious loss of life amid garrison included that nigel sir christopher felt next attack must deliver into hand of besieger loss of men be in reality scarcely third of number have fallen among english yet to that loss be of infinitely more consequence than to foe bitter painful emotion filled noble spirit of nigel a gazed on diminished number of men met ill suppressed groan lamentation of who have at first alarm of english sought shelter protection in castle ill suppressed entreaty that must struggle no longer against such odds grated harshly ominously on ear sternly turned from to men at arm in steadfast bravery joyous acclamation found degree of hope yet ere day closed besieged felt too truly dream of triumph of final success little short of miracle must realize fancy that new mightier spirit of generalship be at work within english camp be confirmed two distinct

causeway so a to admit of easy access to outer wall progress have made in work first day while attention of scotch have be confined to attack on barbacan be sufficient evidence of intent with bitter sorrow sir nigel brother in law felt that only mean of efficient defence lay in resigning long contested barbacan to besieger important point certainly be still to retain wall overlooking more silent effort of english must be left comparatively unguarded might obtain almost uninterrupted scarce contested passage within wall while whole strength attention of besieged be employed a have already be

often cut off many of men stationed within barbacan drawbridge be precarious ground of many midnight strife till daring gallantry of nigel bruce became theme of tongue gallantry equalled only by consummate skill displayed in retreating within entrenchment frequently without loss of single man a killed wounded often must sir christopher seaton whose wound still bound most unwilling prisoner to

caused be excitement change from dull routine of siege consequently welcomed with joy many indeed believing sir nigel have requested truce for purpose sir christopher too though pale gaunt compelled to use support of cane in walking be observed to look upon youthful charge with former hilarity of mien chastened by kindly tenderness seemed indeed that of father whom personated lady seaton have donned richer garb than be wont stood encouragingly beside bride about twenty men at arm armor weapon hastily burnished that unseemly soil must mar peaceful nature of ceremony by recalling thought of war be ranged on side church be lighted dimly in nave aisle softly somewhat with holy radiance where youthful couple knelt from large waxen taper burning in silver stand upon altar abbot of scone be at post attended by domestic chaplain of kildrummie there be strange mixture of admiration anxiety on old man face agnes saw not saw nothing save at whose side knelt nigel even in agitation of mind in

be passing within court see that men at arm be at post in consequence of truce for conclusion of still wanted little time there be fewer men on wall than usual commander having desired to take advantage of brief cessation of hostility seek refreshment rest trumpet be to sound at hour of ten hour before truce concluded to summon again to post men most acute in penetration most firm steady in purpose nigel selected a sentry along wall post of being one of round tower have mentioned remaining space be consequently clear night have already fallen anxiously observing movement on wall endeavoring to discover whether various little group of men woman in ballium meant thing more than usual sir nigel did not notice various pile stack of straw wood be raised against wall in many part where shadow lay darkest also against other granary be contained in low wooden building projecting from wall friend even men at arm noticed if did imagined in darkness to be stone other weight generally collected there used to supply engine on wail with exception of sentry men employed by nigel garrison have assembled in hall of keep for evening meal recollection of whose frugality

of sage poet with glorious achievement of most perfect knight that have bound alike to heart however varied disposition however opposite taste there be not one from holy abbot of scone to lowest

most awful though perchance most fascinating eye can behold fearful shout cry rush of many foot mingled with now easily distinguished roar of devouring element burst confusedly on ear minute sufficed to fling open door of church for knight men at arm to rush forth in one indiscriminate mass sir christopher must have followed utterly regardless of inability have not wife clung to imploringly

done greater more irreparable mischief than combustible up up seeming to very heaven lurid flame ascended blazing roaring lighting whole scene a with glare of day fantastic wreath of red fire danced in air against pitchy blackness of heaven rising falling in such graceful yet terrible shape that very eye felt riveted in admiration while heart quailed with horror backwards forward gleamed form of men in dusky glare oath cry clang of sword shriek of woman terrified by destruction have not little assisted to ignite sudden rush of horse bursting from stable flying here there scared by unusual sight horrid sound hissing stream of water thrown from huge bucket on flame seemed to excite to greater fury instead of lessening devouring way crackling of straw wood a of roar of hundred furnace be varied sound sight burst upon eye ear of nigel a richly attired a be drawn sword in hand fair hair thrown back from uncovered brow head stood in very centre of scene one glance sufficed to perceive that rage of men at arm be turned on treacherous countryman that work of war raged even then sword of scotsman be raised against other even woman fell in fierce slaughter for demon of revenge be at work sought blood in vain holy abbot heedless that one sudden gust flowing garment must inevitably catch fire uplifted crosier called on to forbear in vain officer rushed amidst infuriated men bidding

sought spot where confusion horror waxed thickest dermid will care for agnes guard will not think of mad woman word yet even a rushed onwards giving direction command lending aid to effort made for extinguishing fire prayer for wife be uttered in heart fire continued rapid progress buttress after buttress tower after tower caught on wall causing conflagration to continue even when by most strenuous effort have be partially extinguished amongst dwelling of court wind blowing from north fortunately preserved keep inner wall even church uninjured save that scorched blackened side of latter gave evidence of close vicinity of flame how narrowly have escaped with saddened heart noble defender of scotland last remaining bulwark beheld impregnable scene of such dauntless valor such unconquered struggle against whole force of mighty foe have be of avail that wall crumbling into dust ash in very sight opening broad passage to english foe yet still there be evidence that to yield be preferable than to die still though well nigh exhausted with herculean effort to quench flame there be cessation no pause although very height of wall prevented success for have not facility afforded by engine of present day sir nigel knight nay venerable abbot seconded effort of men seemed a if little more must add to horror of scene yet shout of granary granary merciful heaven be

arming speaking at same time in tone so utterly unconcerned that ere task be finished coolness have extended unto have allowed few of english to make unmolested way own men be drawn up in close line against inner wall so deep in shadow that be at first unobserved by english must perceive by still clear light of flame troop after troop of besieger be marching forward in direction of causeway river

contemptuously to earth flag of england floated in place many dying eye unclosed by sudden sound looked on emblem of defeat moved not in life again others sprung up to foot with wild shriek of defiance fell back powerless in death sir christopher seaton whose exhausted frame must barely sustain weight of armor have be taken in first charge fighting bravely falling from exhaustion to earth where be nigel hemmed in on side yet seemingly unwounded unconquered still face indeed be deadly pale there be moment when stroke flagged a from utter failing of strength if on observing foe pressed closer strength appeared to return still still struggled on sought for death felt that dared destiny death shunned strove with destiny in vain not thus might fall young generous gifted on foot armor hacked stained with blood not yet have word yield be shouted in ear back back leave glorious prize shouted lancaster spurring on charger through crowd leaping from instant neared spot where nigel

unclasped helmet threw from brow stood in attitude of defence one moment sir nigel paused closing foe have fallen from at word of leader hesitated one brief instant a to whether indeed must struggle more deliver up sword to generous earl when shout of triumph from topmost turret proclaiming raising of banner fell upon ear nerved to onset noble generous exclaimed a sword crossed might choose fate must fall by thy knightly sword a stupefied with wonder at skill extraordinary velocity power of combatant men at arm stood round without making one movement to leave spot fearful indeed be that deadly strife equal seemed in stature in use of weapon in mystery of sword eye ached with rapid flashing of blade ear tired of sharp unwavering clash still quailed not moved not from spot where combat have commenced how long fearful struggle must have continued who must finally be victor be undecided still when suddenly wild mocking laugh of madness sounded in very ear of nigel voice shouted aloud fight on bonny lord see see how care for winsome bride maniac form of jean roy rushed by through thickest rank of men swift swift a lightning track veil of silver tissue floated from shoulder seemed to be bearing something in arm what rapidity of way precluded discovery fierce soldier shrunk away from a if appalled by gaunt spectral look too much scared by sudden appearance to attempt detaining eye of nigel involuntarily turned from foe to follow recognized veil fancy did rest saw near part of wall be tottering beneath engine of english there be wild shriek in other tone than hers wall fell burying maniac in ruin mist came over sens of young knight strength suddenly fled arm stepped back a to recover slipped fell violence of fall dashing sword many yard in air yield true prisoner rescue rescue said in tone so startling in agony that rudest heart beside shrunk within appalled for minute lancaster checked word upon lip nay nay yield not in such tone gallant foe said with eager courtesy with own hand aiding to rise must be majesty of england must deem debased did hold such gallantry in durance of truth thou hast robbed of conquest fair sir for be skill of mine brought thee to ground may thank that shrieking mad woman perchance for preservation of laurel give thanks for courtesy lord replied sir nigel striving to recover pray pardon if beseech let that falling mass be cleared at once note if unhappy woman breathes methought added in stronger agitation carried something in arm did answered many voice child girl who be struggling though head be muffled up a if to prevent sound see to bring news of what find said lancaster hastily for same ghastly expression passed over countenance of prisoner a have startled at first thou art not well good lord continued kindly nay be well lord will go with replied young knight slowly a if collecting strength ere must speak be wearied with turmoil of last twelve hour fighting against fire sword at once must fain see noble hereford with permission rest brief while lancaster made further comment two knight who few minute before have be engaged in deadly strife now made way together through heap of dying dead through many group of rude soldiery who scowled on nigel with friendly eye for only recognized a destroyer of hundred of countryman not chivalric champion who have won enthusiastic admiration of leader soon found in castle hall in presence of earl of hereford who be surrounded by noblest officer sir christopher lady seaton few other scottish prisoner most of whom be badly wounded advanced to meet sir nigel courteously though gravely grief said to receive a prisoner knight of such high renown such chivalric bearing a sir nigel bruce must have kept rare quality for sovereign to whom be naturally due who must have known how to have appreciated honor rather than shed such lustre on so weak cause doe lordship regard freedom of oppressed country so weak cause replied nigel hot blood mounting to cheek rising in defence of rightful king in lieu of slavishly adhering to one who though so powerful good men aye even good englishman must look on in claim to scotland a ambitious usurper lord lord spirit of hereford spoke not in word forgive for have much for to proffer thanks unto noble hereford much that knightly soul scorned treachery gave fair field durance be melancholy prospect yet must be must not nobler captor must forfeit esteem in hold gallant sir replied earl therefore do pray command service in aught can pleasure interfere not with duty to sovereign will be proud to give speak pray nay can ask naught earl of hereford hath not granted of said sir nigel must beseech to extend protection to female of unhappy castle to part not sister from lord for a see wound weakness call for woman care to grant leech aid to who need if there be unhappy men of faithful troop remaining must beseech show mercy unto let go free can work further ill to edward can fight more for scotland for lieth chained have head therefore mean of resistance beseech give freedom unshackled by condition will be will be replied hereford hastily evidently moved for young sir can do naught for thee nothing answered young man calmly need little more on earth for youth birth what pleaseth thee to term gallantry will save from sweeping axe of edward must beseech thee to let death atone for redeem noble friend ask not for know in thou hast power yet though ask nothing now added after brief pause in lower voice a to be heard only by hereford ere march to england may have boon to crave protection liberty for beloved one whose fate a yet know not spoke almost inarticulately for again seemed horrid word maniac laugh of jean roy resounded in ear there be that in look manner of english earl inviting confidence moment tortured young man longed to pour into ear to conjure to find agnes give to arm next refrained for word ask not how will contrive to abide by thee undiscovered by foe suddenly flashed on memory with conviction that if be indeed still in life acknowledged wife hereford must feel compelled to keep under restraint a did lady seaton wife of other noble scotsman lip trembled fortunately for preservation of composure hereford attention be called from by eager entrance of several other officer who crowded round alike in congratulation waiting command perceiving be agitated earl turned from with courteous bow eagerly seized that moment to spring to side of sister to whisper impatient inquiry agnes where be agnes to feel heart moment throb high then sink again by reply that have not seen since have placed in arm of seer that in fearful confusion followed have looked for in vain examined accustomed haunt discovered trace of save silver tissue veil there be however hope in jean roy misled by glittering article seeing perchance in hand of might have be deceived in prey nay welcomed uncertainty of suspense there be something so fearful so horrible in idea that own faithful agnes be among blackened mangled body lancaster informed have be discovered beneath ruin something so sickening so revolting must not take advantage of earl offer to examine though lancaster added must not be of much use for challenged dearest friend to recognize must not believe such be fate dermid have not be seen since fatal conclusion of marriage knew fidelity interest in agnes must not must not believe maniac have decoyed from care where be where in moment must have conveyed what must be final fate how must rejoin be question ever thronging on heart brain struggling with doubt with horrible suspicion still clinging to shriek have sounded a ruin fell darker more forebodingly oppressive grew conflicting thought a day after day passed still came not be there tidings of seer very brief interval sufficed for english earl to conclude arrangement at kildrummie prepare to march southward berwick being frontier town to scottish prisoner be usually conveyed loss have be greater than at other similar siege more than third of large army have fallen several others be wounded not much above third remained who be fitted to continue in arm be fearful proof of desperate valor of besieged earl felt must so exasperate sovereign against scottish commander a to remove slightest hope of mercy ruin be with labor cleared away remains of outer wall levelled with earth except tower communicating with drawbridge barbacan must be easily repaired inner wall hereford likewise commanded to be restored keep turned into hospital for wounded leaving with sufficient garrison to defend castle in case of renewed incursion of scottish patriot case in present state of country not very probable true to promise men at arm who survived whose wound permitted removal hereford set at liberty not above ten in number dispirited heart broken felt indeed there be need to impose condition on of traitor who remained endeavored by cringing humility to gain favor of english finding shunned despised for commonest english soldier be of nature too noble to bear with aught of treachery dispersed over country finding little in miserable condition to impart enjoyment to life have enacted so base part to preserve may be well to state ere entirely leave subject that execution of evan roy exciting evil passion in already rebellious heart have determined to conspire for signal revenge raving of jean roy desperate counsel of mother in law urging to catastrophe have related murder of nigel have be first planned dismissed a likely to be discovered thwarted bring vengeance on own head instead of before execution of comrade head of conspiracy have only be desirous of shunning horror of prolonged siege afterwards revenge became stronger than mere personal safety therefore be refused to take advantage of safe conduct demanded by nigel granted a have said scottish prisoner be removed from castle few hour after capitulation placed in honorable restraint in separate pavilion lancaster whose romantic admiration for antagonist have not be in least diminished by sir nigel bearing in captivity lofty tone of young knight society conversation frequently courted absolutely made shrink from heading force be to conduct prisoner to england for well knew very quality calling forth spark of chivalry in own bosom must be only so many incitement to edward for instant execution therefore demanded that superintending work of garrison keeping strict watch upon movement of adjoining country must devolve on hereford a older wiser must conduct prisoner to border report event of siege to sovereign colleague acceded eighth day from triumph of besieger be fixed on to commence march be on evening of seventh day that earl of hereford then engaged in earnest council with lancaster on

house of bruce whether man woman child noble serf belonging to have be somewhat soothed by ignominious execution of nigel have felt almost a much amused a angered at earl tale enjoyed idea of man whom in inmost heart most thoroughly despised having be so completely outwitted for time so foiled feud between comyn bruce be nothing to except where forwarded own interest have incited buchan to inquire about daughter simply because occupation must remove that earl out of way for short time perhaps if rumor of engagement with one of brother of bruce be true set engine at work to discover place of

by extending protection to wife be not traitor bold presuming traitor deserving chastisement of such bearding thus in very palace wrathfully exclaimed edward know ye not be liable to charge of treason aye treason fear ye to brave thus liege be traitor amenable to such charge calmly answered gloucester far far more truly faithfully devotedly grace subject than many of who have shrunk from act a in so doing be likely to incur royal displeasure acknowledge with deep regret sorrow take shame thus on knee to beseech highness indulgence for fault if deem worthy of chastisement be ready to submit to denying however graver charge than of failing in proper deference to grace other charge by st edward be not that enough answered king in mollified tone thou minion thou whom deemed very paragon of

shunning society of who must call forth candid acknowledgment of having deserved displeasure submission to will however so soothed self love fondness for absolute power that permitted to have vent with little restraint agnes might have be wife of traitor be out of edward way daughter of traitress be equally powerless linked with treason too much crashed by own misery to be sensible of aught
